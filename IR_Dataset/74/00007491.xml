'''Cola''' is a sweetened, [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]] flavored with [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], [[citrus]] [[essential oil|oils]] and other flavorings. Most contain [[caffeine]], which was originally sourced from the [[kola nut]], leading to the drink's name, though other sources are now also used. Cola became popular worldwide after [[pharmacist]] [[John Pemberton]] invented [[Coca-Cola]] in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://happydazeblog.com/2017/05/01/may-8-1886-soda-pop-invented/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327172406/http://happydazeblog.com/2017/05/01/may-8-1886-soda-pop-invented/ |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cocaine.org/cocawine.htm |title=Coca Wine |publisher=Cocaine.org |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the [[coca wine]] of [[pharmacist]] [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]], created in 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;cocaine&quot; /&gt;

Most modern colas contain [[caramel color]], and are sweetened with [[sugar]] and/or [[high-fructose corn syrup]]. They now come in numerous different [[brand]]s. Among them, the most popular are [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]]. These two companies have been competing since the 1890s, but their [[Cola wars|rivalry has intensified since the 1980s]].

==Flavorings==
The primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are [[citrus]] [[essential oil|oils]] (from [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], and [[lemon]] [[Peel (fruit)|peels]]), [[cinnamon]], [[vanilla]], and an [[acid]]ic flavorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DeNeefe, Janet |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/13/the-exotic-romance-tamarind.html |title=The Exotic Romance of Tamarind |work=The Jakarta Post |date=March 13, 2008 |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sparror.cubecinema.com/cube/cola/chemistry/cola2.htm |title=Cola 2 |publisher=Sparror.cubecinema.com |date= |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like [[nutmeg]] or [[coriander]], but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain citrus, vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by [[phosphoric acid]], sometimes accompanied by [[citric acid|citric]] or other isolated acids. [[Coca-Cola formula|Coca-Cola's recipe]] is maintained as a corporate [[trade secret]].

A variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized [[Maize|corn]]. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=M. Ataman Aksoy |editor2=John C. Beghin |title=Global Agricultural Trade and Developing Countries |year=2005 |publisher=World Bank Publications |isbn=0-8213-5863-4 |page=329 |chapter=Sugar Policies: An Opportunity for Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[stevia]] or an [[artificial sweetener]] may be used; &quot;sugar-free&quot; or &quot;diet&quot; colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.

==Clear cola==
[[File:Crystal Pepsi 20oz.jpg|thumb|upright|Crystal Pepsi, 20 oz. bottle, as seen in the US in 2016]]
In the 1940s, Coca-Cola produced [[White Coke]] at the request of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Georgy Zhukov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ozy.com/flashback/coke-made-especially-for-a-communist/41336|title=Coke made especially for a communist|last=Braswell|first=Sean|website=Ozy|publication-date=April 23, 2015|access-date=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clear colas were again produced during the [[Clear Craze]] of the early 1990s. Brands included [[Crystal Pepsi]], [[Tab Clear]], and [[7 Up Ice Cola]].  Crystal Pepsi has been repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s.

In Denmark, a popular clear cola was made by the [[Cooperative]] [[Coop amba|FDB]] in 1976. It was especially known for being the &quot;Hippie Cola&quot; because of the focus of the harmful effects the color additive could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands. It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the Environmental-Organisation NOAH, an independent Danish division of [[Friends of the Earth]]. This was followed up with a variety of sodas without artificial coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.samvirke.dk/node/287945|title=Samvirke - Rød sodavand - uden farve!|first=|last=Samvirke|website=classic.samvirke.dk|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today many organic colas are available in Denmark, but, for nostalgic reasons, clear cola has still maintained its popularity to a certain degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bt.dk/danmark/husker-du-kult-colaen-vender-endelig-tilbage|title=Husker du? Kult-colaen vender endelig tilbage|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Coca-Cola introduced [[Coca-Cola Clear]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2018/06/12/Coca-Cola-Clear-launches-in-Japan|title=Coca-Cola Clear launches in Japan|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/a21094272/clear-coke/|title=Coca-Cola Pulls a Pepsi and Launches Clear Coke|date=June 6, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
{{details|Criticism of Coca-Cola#Health effects}}
A 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The [[phosphoric acid]] used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tina M. Saldana |author2=Olga Basso |author3=Rebecca Darden |author4=Dale P. Sandler |title=Carbonated beverages and chronic kidney disease |year=2007 |journal=[[Epidemiology (journal)|Epidemiology]] |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=501–6 |doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e3180646338 |pmid=17525693 |pmc=3433753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies indicate &quot;soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in [the] American diet&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/05/050527111920.htm |title=Preliminary Data Suggest That Soda And Sweet Drinks Are The Main Source Of Calories In American Diet |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=May 27, 2005 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so most nutritionists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[vitamin C]], [[riboflavin]], and [[vitamin A]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, Michael F. (2005). &quot;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/liquid_candy_final_w_new_supplement.pdf Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health]&quot;, pp. 5–6. [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]]. Retrieved October 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The drink has also aroused criticism for its use of [[caffeine]], which can cause [[physical dependence]] ([[caffeine addiction]]).&lt;ref&gt;Center for Science in the Public Interest (1997). &quot;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/caffeine.htm Label Caffeine Content of Foods, Scientists Tell FDA].&quot; Retrieved June 10, 2005. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724114650/http://www.cspinet.org/new/caffeine.htm |date=July 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake and [[osteoporosis]] in older women (but not men).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tucker KL, Morita K, Qiao N, Hannan MT, Cupples LA, Kiel DP | title=Colas, but not other carbonated beverages, are associated with low bone mineral density in older women: The Framingham Osteoporosis Study| journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition| volume=84| pages=936–942| issue = 4| date = October 1, 2006| pmid = 17023723 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/84.4.936}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was thought to be due to the presence of [[phosphoric acid]], and the risk for women was found to be greater for sugared and caffeinated colas than diet and decaffeinated variants, with a higher intake of cola correlating with lower bone density.

Many soft drinks are sweetened mostly or entirely with [[high-fructose corn syrup]], rather than [[sugar]]. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of [[corn syrup]] because it may aggravate [[obesity]] and [[type-2 diabetes]] more than cane sugar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=51623-single-food-ingredient &quot;Single food ingredient the cause of obesity ? New study has industry up in arms&quot;]. (April 26, 2004). ''FoodNavigator.com''. Retrieved February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
