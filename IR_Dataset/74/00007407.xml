In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a '''county town''' is the most important town in a [[county]]. It is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within a county and the place where the county's members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] are elected. Following the establishment of the English [[County council#United Kingdom|county council]]s in 1889, the headquarters of the new councils were usually located in the county town of each county. However, the concept of a county town pre-dates the establishment of these councils. 

The concept of a county town is ill-defined and unofficial. Some counties have their administrative bodies located elsewhere. For example, [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] is the county town of [[Lancashire]], but the county council is located in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]. Some county towns are no longer situated within the administrative county because of changes in the county's boundaries. For example, [[Nottingham]] is administered by a [[Unitary authority#United Kingdom|unitary authority]] separate from the rest of [[Nottinghamshire]].

== UK county towns post 19th-century reforms==
With the creation of elected [[county council]]s in 1889 the location of administrative headquarters in some cases moved away from the traditional county town. Furthermore, in 1965 and 1974 there were major boundary changes in [[England and Wales]] and [[administrative county|administrative counties]] were replaced with new [[metropolitan county|metropolitan]] and [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]].  The boundaries underwent further alterations between 1995 and 1998 to create [[Unitary Authority|unitary authorities]] and some of the ancient counties and county towns were restored.  (Note: not all headquarters are or were called County Halls or Shire Halls e.g.: Cumbria County Council's HQ up until 2016 was called ''The Courts'' and have since moved to Cumbria House.) Before 1974 many of the county halls were located in towns and cities that had the status of a [[county borough]] i.e.: a borough outside of the county council's jurisdiction.
