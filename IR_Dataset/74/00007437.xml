[[File:Pinocchio.jpg|thumb|Pinocchio, by [[Enrico Mazzanti]] (1852–1910), the first illustrator (1883) of ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'']]
'''Carlo Lorenzini''' (24 November 1826 – 26 October 1890), better known by the [[pen name]] '''Carlo Collodi''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkarlo kolˈlɔːdi}}), was an [[Italians|Italian]] author, humorist,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|last=Marrone|first=Gaetana|last2=Puppa|first2=Paolo|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781579583903|location=New York|pages=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-Collodi|title=C. Collodi &amp;#124; Italian author|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely known for his [[fairy tale novel]] ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.

==Early life==
Collodi was born in Florence on 24 November 1826. His mother Angiolina Orzali was a seamstress from the town of [[Collodi (Italy)|Collodi]] from which he took the pen name and his father, Domenico Lorenzini was a cook and both worked for the Marquis Ginori Lisci.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Collodi was the eldest in the family&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Multi-Grade Readers Theatre: Stories about Short Story and Book Authors|last=Barchers|first=Suzanne|last2=Pfeffinger|first2=Charla|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=9781598848014|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he had 10 siblings but seven died at a young age. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Collodi where his mother was born. He lived there with his grandmother. After attending primary school, he was sent to study at a seminary called Colle Val d'Elsa.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; An account explained that Ginori offered financial aid but the boy found that he did not want to be a priest so he continued his education at the College of the Scolopi Fathers in Florence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales, Children, and the Culture Industry|last=Zipes|first=Jack|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0415918502|location=New York|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he started working at the bookstore Libreria Piatti, where he assisted Giuseppe Aiazzi, a prominent Italian manuscript specialist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
During the [[Italian unification|Italian Wars of Independence]] in 1848 and 1860 Collodi served as a volunteer with the Tuscan army. His active interest in political matters may be seen in his earliest literary works as well as in the founding of the satirical newspaper ''Il Lampione'' in 1853. This newspaper was censored by order of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1854 he published his second newspaper, ''Lo scaramuccia'' (&quot;The Controversy&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;JZ&quot;&gt;Jack Zines. «Introduction». In: Carlo Collordi. ''Pinnochio''. Penguin Books 2002. {{ISBN|0-14-243706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenzini's first publications were in his periodicals. A debut came in 1856 with the play ''Gli amici di casa'' and parodic guidebook ''Un romanzo in vapore'', both in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinocchio.it/?idcnt=885&amp;lang=en Carlo Collodi: other works]; pinocchio.it&lt;/ref&gt; By 1860, he published his first notable work called ''Il signor Alberi ha ragione!'' (Mr. Alberi Is Right!), which outlined his political and cultural vision of Italy. This is the text where Lorenzini started using the Collodi pseudonym, which was taken from his mother's hometown.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Collodi had also begun intense activity on other political newspapers such as ''Il Fanfulla''; at the same time he was employed by the Censorship Commission for the Theatre. During this period he composed various satirical sketches and stories (sometimes simply by collating earlier articles), including ''[[Macchiette]]'' (1880), ''[[Occhi e nasi]]'' (1881), ''[[Storie allegre]]'' (1887).&lt;ref name=&quot;MarronePuppa2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gaetana Marrone |author2=Paolo Puppa |title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA485 |date=26 December 2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-45530-9 |pages=485–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collodi became disenchanted with Italian politics afterward so he turned to children's literature and his first works involved translating French fairy tales into Italian.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; In 1875, for instance, he completed ''Racconti delle fate'', a translation of French fairy tales by [[Charles Perrault]]. In 1876 Lorenzini wrote ''[[Giannettino]]'' (inspired by [[Alessandro Luigi Parravicini]]'s ''Giannetto''), the ''[[Minuzzolo]]'', and ''Il viaggio per l'Italia di Giannettino'', a pedagogic series which explored the unification of Italy through the ironic thoughts and actions of the character [[Giannettino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MarronePuppa2006&quot; /&gt;

Lorenzini became fascinated by the idea of using an amiable, rascally character as a means of expressing his own convictions through [[allegory]]. In 1880 he began writing ''Storia di un burattino'' (''Story of a [[Marionette]]''), also called ''Le avventure di [[Pinocchio]]'', which was published weekly in ''[[Il Giornale per i Bambini]]'', the first Italian newspaper for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarronePuppa2006&quot; /&gt; Pinocchio was adapted into [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|a 1940 film by Disney]] that is considered to be one of Disney's greatest films ever made. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Disney Book: Pinocchio|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|editor-last=Maltin|editor-first=Leonard|location=New York|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=1|title=AFI: 10 Top 10|website=www.afi.com|access-date=2019-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1940/02/08/archives/the-screen-in-review-pinocchio-walt-disneys-longawaited-successor.html|title=THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; 'Pinocchio,' Walt Disney's Long-Awaited Successor to 'Snow White,' Has Its Premiere at the Center Theatre--Other New Films|last=Nugent|first=Frank S.|date=1940-02-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-02-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collodi died suddenly in Florence on 26 October 1890 and lies buried in Cimitero Monumentale Delle Porte Sante, Firenze, Toscana, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Proietti, 'LORENZINI, Carlo', in ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'', Volume 66 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The National Carlo Collodi Foundation was established to promote education and the works of Carlo Lorenzini, and the Park of Pinocchio attracts many visitors each year.
