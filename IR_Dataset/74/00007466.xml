== Uses ==

=== Medicine ===
Coal tar is used in medicated [[shampoo]], [[Wrights Coal Tar Soap|soap]] and [[ointment]]. It demonstrates [[antifungal]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antipruritic|anti-itch]], and [[antiparasitic]] properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mai2011&quot; /&gt; It may be applied topically as a treatment for [[dandruff]] and [[psoriasis]], and to kill and repel [[head lice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2008&quot;/&gt; It may be used in combination with [[ultraviolet light therapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2008&quot; /&gt; 

[[Pine tar]] has historically also been used for this purpose. Though it is frequently cited online as having been banned as a medical product by the FDA due to a &quot;lack of evidence having been submitted for proof of effectiveness&quot;, pine tar is included in the Code of Federal Regulations, subchapter D: Drugs for Human Use, as an OTC treatment for &quot;Dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2008-title21-vol5/xml/CFR-2008-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.xml|title=Title 21&amp;nbsp;– Food and Drugs.

Coal tar may be used in two forms: crude coal tar ({{lang-la|pix carbonis}}) or a coal tar solution ({{lang-la|liquor picis carbonis, LPC}}) also known as liquor carbonis detergens (LCD).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mai2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharmacyaus&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical pharmacy : a practical approach - Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia|last1=Hughes|first1=Jeff|last2=Donnelly|first2=Richard|last3=James-Chatgilaou|first3=Greta|date=2001|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Australia|isbn=9780732980290|location=South Yarra|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paghdal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Paghdal KV|author2=Schwartz RA|date={{date| 31 jan 2009}}|title=Topical tar: back to the future|journal=J Am Acad Dermatol|volume=61|issue=2|pages=294–302|doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.11.024|pmid=19185953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named brands include Denorex, Balnetar, Psoriasin, Tegrin, T/Gel, and Neutar. When used in the extemporaneous preparation of topical medications, it is supplied in the form of coal tar topical solution [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]], which consists of a [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|20% w/v]] solution of coal tar in [[ethanol|alcohol]], with an additional 5% w/v of [[polysorbate 80]]&amp;nbsp;USP; this must then be diluted in an ointment base such as [[petrolatum]].

=== Construction ===
{{Main|Sealcoat}}

Coal tar was a component of the first sealed roads. In its original development by [[Edgar Purnell Hooley]], [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] was tar covered with granite chips. Later the filler used was industrial [[slag]]. Today, petroleum derived binders and sealers are more commonly used. These sealers are used to extend the life and reduce maintenance cost associated with [[asphalt]] pavements, primarily in asphalt road paving, car parks and walkways.

Coal tar is incorporated into some parking-lot [[sealcoat]] products used to protect the structural integrity of the underlying pavement.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs20113010&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author1 = Mahler BJ| author2 = Van Metre PC| url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/| title = Coal-Tar-Based Pavement Sealcoat, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Environmental Health| publisher = U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet| date = {{date| 2 feb 2011}}| accessdate = {{date| 8 mar 2013}}| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130328042236/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/| archivedate = 2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealcoat products that are coal-tar based typically contain 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;fs20113010&quot;/&gt; Research&lt;ref name=lakes&gt;{{cite journal| title = Contribution of PAHs from coal-tar pavement sealcoat and other sources to 40 U.S. lakes| author1 = Van Metre PC| author2 = Mahler BJ| journal = U.S. Geological Survey| date = {{date| 15 dec 2010}}| pmid = 21112613| doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.08.014| volume=409| issue=2| pages=334–44| bibcode=2010ScTEn.409..334V}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows it is used in [[United States]] states from [[Alaska]] to [[Florida]], but several areas have banned its use in sealcoat products,

=== Industry ===
Being flammable, coal tar is sometimes used for heating or to fire [[boilers]]. Like most heavy oils, it must be heated before it will flow easily.

A large part of the binder used in the [[graphite]] industry for making &quot;green blocks&quot; is coke oven volatiles (COV), a considerable portion of which is coal tar. During the baking process of the green blocks as a part of commercial graphite production, most of the coal tar binders are vaporised and are generally burned in an incinerator to prevent release into the atmosphere, as COV and coal tar can be injurious to health.

Coal tar is also used to manufacture paints, synthetic dyes (notably [[tartrazine]]/Yellow #5), and photographic materials.

In the [[coal gas]] era, there were many companies in Britain whose business was to [[distill]] coal tar to separate the higher-value fractions, such as [[naphtha]], [[creosote]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]. A great many industrial chemicals were first isolated from coal tar during this time. These companies included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Smith |url=http://www.igg.org.uk/gansg/12-linind/tardis.htm |title=GANSG&amp;nbsp;– Coal Tar Distillers |publisher=Igg.org.uk |accessdate={{date|8 mar 2013}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619153801/http://www.igg.org.uk/gansg/12-linind/tardis.htm |archivedate=2013-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Side effects of coal tar products include skin irritation, sun sensitivity, [[allergic reactions]], and skin discoloration.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2008&quot; /&gt; It is unclear if use during [[pregnancy]] is safe for the baby and use during [[breastfeeding]] is not typically recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/breastfeeding/coal-tar.html|title=Coal Tar use while Breastfeeding {{!}} Drugs.com|website=www.drugs.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118034352/https://www.drugs.com/breastfeeding/coal-tar.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[National Psoriasis Foundation]], coal tar is a valuable, safe and inexpensive treatment option for millions of people with [[psoriasis]] and other scalp or skin conditions.&lt;ref name=coalcal&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.psoriasis.org/news/stories/2001/20011202_coalcala.php| title = The battle to save coal tar in California| date = {{date|December 3, 2001}}| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021029132630/http://www.psoriasis.org/coaltar.advocacy.htm| archivedate = 2002-10-29| accessdate = {{date|8 mar 2013}}| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[FDA]], coal tar concentrations between 0.5% and 5% are considered safe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=358&amp;showfr=1&amp;subpartnode=21:5.0.1.1.30.8| title = Drug Products for the Control of Dandruff, Seborrheic Dermatitis, and Psoriasis| author = FDA| date = {{date|April 1, 2015}}| accessdate = {{date|February 26, 2016}}| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150918184253/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=358&amp;showFR=1&amp;subpartNode=21%3A5.0.1.1.30.8| archivedate = September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effective for psoriasis.

=== Cancer ===
Evidence is inconclusive whether the coal tar in the concentrations seen in non-prescription treatments causes cancer, because there is insufficient data to make a judgment.&lt;ref name=Ro2010&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roelofzen|first=Judith H.

Coal tar was one of the first chemical substances proven to cause cancer from occupational exposure, during research in 1775 on the cause of [[chimney sweeps' carcinoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Modern studies have shown that working with coal tar pitch, such as during the paving of roads or when working on roofs, increases the risk of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/mono100F-17.pdf|title=Coal-tar pitch|website=IARC|publisher=IARC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521101818/http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/mono100F-17.pdf|archivedate=21 May 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=10 June 2017|quote=it was concluded that there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of occupational exposures during paving and roofing with coal tar pitch. ...

Coal tar contains many [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]], and it is believed that their metabolites bind to DNA, damaging it.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Long-term skin exposure to these compounds can produce &quot;[[tar warts]]&quot;, which can progress to [[squamous cell carcinoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; 

The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] lists coal tars as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1]] [[carcinogen]]s, meaning they directly cause cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|title=IARC Monographs- Classifications|website=monographs.iarc.fr|access-date=2017-06-10|quote=CAS No.: 8007-45-2, Agent: Coal tars (see Coal-tar distillation), Volume: 35, Sup 7, Year: 1987, Agent: Coal-tar distillation, Group: 1, Volume: 92, 100F, Year: 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610015529/http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/latest_classif.php|archivedate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/suppl7/Suppl7-58.pdf|title=IARC MONOGRAPHS SUPPLEMENT 7|publisher=IARC|pages=175|chapter=COAL-TARS (Group I)|quote=Evidence for carcinogenicity to humans (sufficient)|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315151519/http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/suppl7/Suppl7-58.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the state of [[California]] list coal tars as known human carcinogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/profiles/coaltars.pdf|title=Report on Carcinogens, Fourteenth Edition: Coal Tars and Coal-Tar Pitches|website=National Toxicology Program, Department of Health and Human Services|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-10|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201002821/https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/profiles/coaltars.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to public health concerns regarding the carcinogenicity of PAHs some municipalities, such as the city of Milwaukee, have banned the use of common coal tar-based road and driveway sealants citing concerns of elevated PAH content in groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Quirmbach |first1=Chuck |title=Milwaukee Common Council Bans Coal Tar Sealants |url=https://www.wiscontext.org/milwaukee-common-council-bans-coal-tar-sealants |publisher=Wisconsin Public Radio |date=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact mechanism of action is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mai2011&quot; /&gt; Coal tar is a complex mixture of [[phenols]], [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), and [[heterocyclic compound]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2002&quot; /&gt;

It is a [[keratolytic]] agent, which reduces the growth rate of skin cells and softens the skin's [[keratin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2918e/26.2.html#Jh2918e.26.2|title=WHO Model Prescribing Information: Drugs Used in Skin Diseases: Keratoplastic and keratolytic agents: Coal tar|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2017-06-10|quote=keratolytic agent that inhibits excessive proliferation of epidermal cells by reducing DNA synthesis and mitotic activity to normal levels|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420161122/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2918e/26.2.html#Jh2918e.26.2|archivedate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

== Composition ==
Coal tar is produced through thermal destruction ([[pyrolysis]]) of [[coal]]. Its composition varies with the process and type of coal used &amp;ndash; [[lignite]], [[bituminous coal|bituminous]] or [[anthracite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Toxicology (Third Edition)|last=Roberts|first=L.|date=2014|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123864550|editor-last=Wexler|editor-first=Philip|location=Oxford|pages=993–995|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-386454-3.00012-9|quote=composition of coal tar will be influenced by the process used for pyrolytic distillation as well as by the original composition of the coal ...

==Derivatives==
Various [[phenols|phenolic]] coal tar derivatives have [[analgesic]] (pain-killer) properties. These included [[acetanilide]], [[phenacetin]], and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen).&lt;ref name=&quot;para&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dronsfield |first=Alan |date=1 July 2005 |title=Pain relief: from coal tar to paracetamol |url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/pain-relief-from-coal-tar-to-paracetamol/2020140.article |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=102–105 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013607/https://eic.rsc.org/feature/pain-relief-from-coal-tar-to-paracetamol/2020140.article |archive-date=13 October 2017 |access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracetamol is the only coal-tar derived analgesic still in use today, but industrial [[phenol]] is now usually synthesized from crude oil rather than coal tar.

==Society and culture==
Coal tar is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO21st&quot;/&gt; Coal tar is generally available as a [[generic medication]] and [[over the counter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ric2015&quot; /&gt; In the United Kingdom 125 ml of 5% shampoo costs the [[NHS]] about [[Pound sterling|£]]1.89.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF69&quot;/&gt; In the United States a month of treatment costs less than {{US$|25}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ric2015&quot; /&gt;

=== Regulation ===
Exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles can occur in the workplace by breathing, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]]) to 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[benzene]]-soluble fraction over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[cyclohexane]]-extractable fraction over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 80&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, coal tar pitch volatiles are [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC&amp;nbsp;– NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards&amp;nbsp;– Coal tar pitch volatiles|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0145.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208120356/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0145.html|archivedate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as a medication in the United States, coal tar preparations are considered [[over-the-counter drug]] pharmaceuticals and are subject to regulation by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).
