'''Chelsea Football Club''' are an English professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Fulham]], [[London]]. Founded in 1905, they compete in the [[Premier League]], the top division of [[Football in England|English football]]. Chelsea are among [[List of football clubs in England by competitive honours won|England's most successful clubs]]; they have been league champions six times and won over thirty competitive honours, including six European trophies. Their home ground is [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;capacity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/about-chelsea-football-club/general-club-info.html |title=General Club Information |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chelsea won their first major honour, the [[List of English football champions|League Championship]], in [[1954–55 Chelsea F.C. season|1955]]. They won the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in 1970 and their first European honour, the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], in 1971. After a period of decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup competitions. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history: they won five of their six league titles and the [[UEFA Champions League]] during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/about-chelsea/history/trophy-cabinet |title=Trophy Cabinet |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=23 May 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea are one of [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|five clubs]] to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, and the only London club to have won the Champions League.

In 1904, [[Gus Mears]] acquired the [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea|Chelsea]] was chosen for the new club; names like ''Kensington FC'', ''Stamford Bridge FC'' and ''London FC'' were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),&lt;ref name=&quot;teamhistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/the-club/club-history/1900.html|title=The Birth of a Club|publisher=Chelsea FC|date=30 September 2004|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on [[Fulham Road]], and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.

Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the [[1915 FA Cup Final]], where they lost to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1800262 |title=Team History – 1905–29 |website=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |accessdate=23 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718071312/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/TeamHistory/0%2C%2C10268~1800262%2C00.html |archivedate=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players&lt;ref name=&quot;glanville&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=10 January 2004 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article992039.ece |title=Little sign of change for Chelsea and their impossible dreams |work=The Times |location=UK|accessdate=15 March 2009 |first=Brian |last=Glanville |author-link=Brian Glanville}} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted large crowds; they had the highest average attendances in English football in ten separate seasons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; including [[1907-08 in English football|1907–08]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1908.htm|title=Historical attendances|publisher=European Football Statistics|accessdate=2011-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004050048/http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1908.htm|archive-date=2011-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1909–10 in English football|1909–10]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1910.htm|title=Historical attendances|publisher=European Football Statistics|accessdate=2011-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004050234/http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1910.htm|archive-date=2011-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1911-12 in English football|1911–12]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1912.htm|title=Historical attendances|publisher=European Football Statistics|accessdate=2011-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004050355/http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1912.htm|archive-date=2011-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1912–13 in English football|1912–13]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1913.htm|title=Historical attendances|publisher=European Football Statistics|accessdate=2011-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004050458/http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1913.htm|archive-date=2011-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1913–14 in English football|1913–14]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1914.htm|title=Historical attendances|publisher=European Football Statistics|accessdate=2011-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004050508/http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1914.htm|archive-date=2011-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1919–20 in English football|1919–20]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1920.htm|title=Historical attendances|publisher=European Football Statistics|accessdate=2011-08-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818182655/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/england/aveeng1920.htm|archive-date=2012-08-18|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and England centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's [[Chelsea pensioner]] crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success – the League championship – in [[1954–55 Chelsea F.C. season|1954–55]]. The following season saw UEFA create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]], but after objections from [[The Football League]] and the [[The Football Association|FA]], Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 April 2005 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/europe/article2327902.ece |title=The great Chelsea surrender |work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 December 2006 |first=Brian |last=Glanville |author-link=Brian Glanville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach [[Tommy Docherty]].

[[File:ChelseaFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart showing the progress of Chelsea's league finishes from 1906 to the present]]

Docherty built a new team around the group of talented young players emerging from the club's youth set-up and Chelsea challenged for honours throughout the 1960s, enduring several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and League Cup going into the final stages of the 1964–65 season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography – The Definitive Story of the First 100 Years|publisher=Headline Book Publishing Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7553-1466-9 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up. Under Docherty's successor, [[Dave Sexton]], Chelsea won the [[1970 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 1970]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] 2–1 in a final replay. The following year, Chelsea took their first European honour, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] triumph, with another replayed win, this time over [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in Athens.

The late 1970s through to the '80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=84–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious [[hooliganism|hooligan]] element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=143–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by [[Ken Bates]] for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, but in 1983 manager [[John Neal (footballer, born 1932)|John Neal]] put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division with two top-six finishes, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.

[[File:Chelsea UCL Winners 2012.jpg|thumb|250px|Chelsea players celebrate their first [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League title]] against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] (2012).]]

After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the [[1994 FA Cup Final]]. The appointment of [[Ruud Gullit]] as player-manager in 1996 began an upturn in the team's fortunes. He added several top international players to the side and led the club to their first major honour since 1971, the [[1997 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]]. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], whose reign saw Chelsea win the [[1998 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], the [[1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and the [[1998 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup in 1998]], and the [[2000 FA Cup Final|FA Cup in 2000]]. They also mounted a strong title challenge in 1998–99, finishing four points behind champions Manchester United, and made their first appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. Vialli was sacked in favour of [[Claudio Ranieri]], who guided Chelsea to the [[2002 FA Cup Final]] and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.

[[File:Stamford Bridge - West Stand.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], West Stand]]
Chelsea have only had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 and for the first 28 years of its existence, it was used almost exclusively by the [[London Athletic Club]] as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother [[Joseph Mears|Joseph]], who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5&amp;nbsp;acre (51,000&amp;nbsp;m²) site.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt; Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who had also designed [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], [[Craven Cottage]] and [[Hampden Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.

Starting with an open bowl-like design and one grandstand with seating, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000, making it the second biggest stadium in England after [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt; The early 1930s saw the construction of a terrace on the southern part of the ground with a roof that covered around one fifth of the stand. As the roof resembled that of a corrugated iron shed, the stand eventually became known as the &quot;Shed End&quot;, although it is unknown who first coined this name. Starting in the 1960s, it became known as the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, another small seated stand was added, the North Stand, which remained until its demolition in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt;

In the early 1970s, the club's owners announced a modernisation of Stamford Bridge with plans for a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt; Work began in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and ultimately only the East Stand was completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the [[Fee simple|freehold]] being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt; The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001. The East Stand was retained from the 1970s development. In 1996, the north stand was renamed the [[Matthew Harding]] stand, after the club director and benefactor who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When Stamford Bridge was redeveloped in the [[Ken Bates|Bates]] era many additional features were added to the complex including two [[Millennium &amp; Copthorne Hotels|Millennium &amp; Copthorne]] hotels, apartments, bars, restaurants, the Chelsea Megastore, and an interactive visitor attraction called Chelsea World of Sport. The intention was that these facilities would provide extra revenue to support the football side of the business, but they were less successful than hoped and before the Abramovich takeover in 2003 the debt taken on to finance them was a major burden on the club. Soon after the takeover a decision was taken to drop the &quot;Chelsea Village&quot; brand and refocus on Chelsea as a football club. However, the stadium is sometimes still referred to as part of ''&quot;Chelsea Village&quot;'' or ''&quot;The Village&quot;''.

The Stamford Bridge [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], the [[Association football pitch|pitch]], the turnstiles and Chelsea's [[naming rights]] are now owned by [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, they may have to change their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |pages=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crest===
[[File:Chelsea Crest 1953.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Chelsea's crest from 1953–1986; the present day crest was modelled on this one.]]
Chelsea have had four main [[crest (sports)|crests]], which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a [[Chelsea pensioner]], the army veterans who reside at the nearby [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]]. This contributed to the club's original &quot;pensioner&quot; nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When [[Ted Drake]] became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Glanvill |first=Rick |year=2006 |title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a [[crosier|staff]]. It was based on elements in the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/lcc.html#chelsea%20bc
|title=Chelsea Metropolitan Borough Council

It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt; This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s.

In 1986, with [[Ken Bates]] now owner of the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and because the old rampant lion badge could not be trademarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season and marked a return to the older design, used from 1953 to 1986, featuring a blue heraldic lion holding a staff. For the centenary season this was accompanied by the words '100 YEARS' and 'CENTENARY 2005–2006' on the top and bottom of the crest respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;new crest&quot;/&gt;

Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler [[eton blue]], which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, [[Earl Cadogan]], and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Chelsea's away colours are usually all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club have had a number of black or dark blue away kits which alternate every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;change kits&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Roman Abramovich 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Chelsea owner [[Roman Abramovich]]]]
Chelsea Football Club were founded by [[Gus Mears]] in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when [[Ken Bates]] bought the club from Mears' great-nephew [[Brian Mears]] for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]] stock exchange in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Football Clubs on the UK Stock Markets |url=http://www.footballeconomy.com/stats/stats_turnover_09.htm |publisher=Football Economy |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman [[Matthew Harding]] became a director and loaned the club £26&amp;nbsp;million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The battle of Stamford Bridge |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-battle-of-stamford-bridge-1581435.html |work=The Independent|date=11 November 1995 |accessdate=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003, [[Roman Abramovich]] purchased just over 50% of Chelsea Village plc's share capital, including Bates' 29.5% stake, for £30&amp;nbsp;million and over the following weeks bought out most of the remaining 12,000 shareholders at 35 pence per share, completing a £140&amp;nbsp;million takeover. Other shareholders at the time of the takeover included the [[Matthew Harding]] estate (21%), [[BSkyB]] (9.9%) and various anonymous offshore trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bates sells off Chelsea to a Russian billionaire |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2406994/Bates-sells-off-Chelsea-to-a-Russian-billionaire.html |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 February 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the 90% share threshold, Abramovich took the club back into private hands, delisting it from the AIM on 22 August 2003.

At the time of the Abramovich takeover, the club also had debts of around £100&amp;nbsp;million, which included a ten-year £75 million [[Eurobond (external bond)|Eurobond]] taken out in 1997 by the Bates regime to buy the freehold of Stamford Bridge and finance the redevelopment of the stadium.

== Controversy ==

=== Sexual abuse ===
{{Main|United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal}}

In August 2019, Chelsea's board apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; after a report found that during the 1970s the club's chief scout, [[United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal|Eddie Heath]], groomed and abused young boys aged between 10 and 17. The report, which was led by Charles Geekie QC, concluded that Heath was a &quot;prolific and manipulative sexual abuser&quot; and had been able to operate &quot;unchallenged&quot;. The report was also heavily critical of the club's former assistant manager [[Dario Gradi]], who was accused of failing to tell more senior club staff about an allegation regarding the sexual conduct of Heath which had been brought to him by the father of a young player.

In light of the report, Chelsea announced that it was committed to assessing compensation claims for victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49251891|title=Chelsea apology over ex-chief scout Eddie Heath's 'unchallenged' sex abuse|date=2019-08-06|access-date=2019-08-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial abuse ===
In May 2018, the club appointed [[Barnardo's]] to oversee an independent investigation into the allegations of racism. The complaints were initially brought by three former youth-team footballers who claimed that Gwyn Williams and Graham Rix subjected young black players to explicit racial abuse, during their time at the club in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/09/chelsea-barnardos-investigate-racism-claims-gwyn-williams-graham-rix|title=Chelsea bring in Barnardo's to investigate claims of racism by coaches|last=Taylor|first=Daniel|date=2018-05-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2019, Barnardo's published the findings of its review. The report concluded that &quot;black players were subjected to a daily tirade of racial abuse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Following the publication of the report, the club issued a statement in which it acknowledged that &quot;Barnardo's found that there is overwhelming information indicating that a member of staff at the club during the 1980s and 1990s subjected young players to bullying and racially abuse behaviour&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/06/dario-gradi-accused-failing-prevent-abuse-former-chelsea-coach/|title=Dario Gradi accused of failing to prevent abuse by former Chelsea coach and serial sexual offender Eddie Heath|last=Wilson|first=Jeremy|date=2019-08-06|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2019-08-06|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
