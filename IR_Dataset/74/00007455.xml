'''Chaparral''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ʃ|æ|p|ə|ˈ|r|æ|l}}) is a [[shrubland]] or [[heath]]land [[plant community]] found primarily in the US state of [[California]] and in the northern portion of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], [[Mexico]]. It is shaped by a [[Mediterranean climate]] (mild, wet winters and hot dry summers) and wildfire, featuring summer-drought-tolerant plants with hard [[sclerophyllous]] evergreen leaves, as contrasted with the associated soft-leaved, [[drought-deciduous]], [[scrubland|scrub]] community of [[coastal sage scrub]], found below the chaparral [[biome]].  Chaparral covers 5% of the state of California and associated Mediterranean shrubland an additional 3.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calacademy.org/educators/lesson-plans/discovering-rainforest-locations|title=Discovering Rainforest Locations|last=|first=|date=|website=California Academy of Sciences|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word {{lang|es|chaparro}}, for [[Quercus section Cerris|evergreen oak]] [[shrubland]].

==Introduction==
In its natural state, chaparral is characterized by infrequent fires, with intervals ranging between 30-50+ years. The fires are high intensity and stand-replacing. Recent human activity has increased fire frequency. The shoots of the Chaparral plants do not have thick bark, therefore, they are not very resistant; however, the vegetative recovery is resilient (with long fire-free periods) because its regeneration is rapid from dormant seed banks and root-crowns.

There are two kinds of Chaparral plant species:

* Sprouters (obligate): these plants have dormant meristems on buried lignotubers. They have storage and intact roots which help them respond quickly.
* Seeders (facultative and obligate): these plants have long-lived seeds in the seed bank or aerially. The germination of these seeds is induced by fire.

Because sprouters can respond with more rapid growth than seeders, they tend to dominate the early years after a fire. If fires become frequent (&lt;10 years), seeders cannot reach reproductive size before the next fire. System shifts to sprouter-dominance. If fire become even more frequent (&lt; 5 years), sprouters exhaust their below- ground reserves and there will be a conversion to a non-chaparral (grassland) biome.

Mature chaparral (stands that have survived for greater intervals between fires) is characterized by nearly impenetrable, dense thickets (except the more open chaparral of the desert).  These plants are highly flammable during the late summer and autumn months when conditions are characteristically hot and dry.  They grow as woody shrubs with thick, leathery, and often small leaves, contain green leaves all year (are evergreen), and are typically drought resistant (with some exceptions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venturas|first=Martin D.|last2=MacKinnon|first2=Evan D.|last3=Dario|first3=Hannah L.|last4=Jacobsen|first4=Anna L.|last5=Pratt|first5=R. Brandon|last6=Davis|first6=Stephen D.|date=2016-07-08|title=Chaparral Shrub Hydraulic Traits, Size, and Life History Types Relate to Species Mortality during California's Historic Drought of 2014|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=7|pages=e0159145|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0159145|pmid=27391489|pmc=4938587|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;). After the first rains following a fire, the landscape is dominated by small flowering herbaceous plants, known as fire followers, which die back with the summer dry period.

Similar plant communities are found in the four other Mediterranean climate regions around the world, including the [[Mediterranean Basin]] (where it is known as [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]), central [[Chile]] (where it is called [[Chilean Matorral|matorral]]), the [[South Africa]]n Cape Region (known there as [[fynbos]]), and in [[Western Australia|Western]] and [[Southern Australia]] (as [[kwongan]]).  According to the California Academy of Sciences, Mediterranean shrubland contains more than 20 percent of the world's plant diversity.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  The word ''chaparral'' is a [[loanword|loan word]] from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|chaparro}}, meaning both &quot;small&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot; evergreen oak (typically [[holm oak]] and [[kermes oak]] species), which itself comes from a [[Basque language|Basque]] word, {{lang|eu|txapar}}, that has the same meaning.

[[Conservation International]] and other conservation organizations consider chaparral to be a [[biodiversity hotspot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/california_floristic/Pages/default.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714080728/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/california_floristic/Pages/default.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-07-14 |title=The Biodiversity Hotspots_Conservation International }}&lt;/ref&gt; – a [[biological community]] with a large number of different species – that is under threat by human activity.

===California cismontane and transmontane chaparral subdivisions===
Another [[phytogeography]] system uses two California chaparral and woodlands subdivisions: the cismontane chaparral and the transmontane (desert) chaparral.

====California cismontane chaparral====
'''''Cismontane chaparral''''' (&quot;this side of the mountain&quot;) refers to the [[California chaparral and woodlands|chaparral ecosystem]] in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]] in California, growing on the western (and coastal) sides of large mountain range systems, such as the western slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] foothills, western slopes of the [[Peninsular Ranges]] and [[California Coast Ranges]], and south-southwest slopes of the [[Transverse Ranges]] in the Central Coast and Southern California regions.

=====Cismontane chaparral plant species=====

=====Cismontane chaparral bird species=====
{{For|more bird species|:Category: Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands}}
The complex ecology of chaparral habitats supports a very large number of animal species. The following is a short list of birds which are an integral part of the cismontane chaparral ecosystems.

:Species essential to the health of the ecosystem include:
* California thrasher (''[[Toxostoma redivivum]]'')
* California towhee (''[[Pipilo crissalis]]'')
* Spotted towhee (''[[Pipilo maculatus]]'')
* Western scrub jay (''[[Aphelocoma californica]]'')

:Very common inhabitant species include:
* Anna's hummingbird (''[[Calypte anna]]'')
* Bushtit (''[[Psaltriparus minimus]]'')
* Costa's hummingbird (''[[Calypte costae]]'')
* Greater roadrunner (''[[Geococcyx californianus]]'')
* Wrentit (''[[Chamaea fasciata]]'')

====California transmontane (desert) chaparral====
'''Transmontane chaparral''' or '''desert chaparral''' —''transmontane'' (&quot;the other side of the mountain&quot;) ''chaparral''—refers to the [[desert]] shrubland [[habitat]] and chaparral [[plant community]] growing in the [[rainshadow]] of these ranges. Transmontane chaparral features xeric desert climate, not [[Mediterranean climate]] habitats, and is also referred to as desert chaparral.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;A Natural History of California, [[Allan A. Schoenerr]], Figure 8.9 – 8.10, Table 8.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;co.san-diego.ca.us&quot;&gt;County of San Diego Department of Planning and Land Use Multiple Species Conservation Program, {{cite web|url=http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/dplu/mscp/docs/Biodiversity/handoutvegcomm14.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106032023/http://www.co.san-diego.ca.us/dplu/mscp/docs/Biodiversity/handoutvegcomm14.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Desert chaparral is a regional [[ecosystem]] subset of the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]], with some plant species from the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].  Unlike cismontane chaparral, which forms dense, impenetrable stands of plants, desert chaparral is open, with only about 50 percent of the ground covered.&lt;ref name=NHC/&gt;  Individual shrubs can reach up to {{convert|10|ft|m}} in height.

[[File:Inspiration Point Laguna Mountains.JPG|thumb|View from the [[Laguna Mountains]], chaparral in the foreground]]
Transmontane chaparral or desert chaparral is found on the eastern slopes of major [[mountain range]] systems on the western sides of the [[deserts of California]]. The mountain systems include the southeastern [[Transverse Ranges]] (the [[San Bernardino Mountains|San Bernardino]] and [[San Gabriel Mountains]]) in the [[Mojave Desert]] north and northeast of the [[Los Angeles basin]] and Inland Empire; and the northern [[Peninsular Ranges]] (San Jacinto, [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa]], and [[Laguna Mountains]]), which separate the [[Colorado Desert]] (western [[Sonoran Desert]]) from lower coastal [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=NHC&gt;''A Natural History of California'', Allan A. Schoenherr, pp.8–9, 357, 327, {{ISBN|978-0-520-06922-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is distinguished from the cismontane chaparral found on the coastal side of the mountains, which experiences higher winter rainfall. Naturally, desert chaparral experiences less winter rainfall than cismontane chaparral. Plants in this community are characterized by small, hard ([[sclerophyllic]]) evergreen (non-[[deciduous]]) leaves. Desert chaparral grows above California's desert cactus scrub plant community and below the [[pinyon-juniper woodland]]. It is further distinguished from the deciduous sub-alpine scrub above the pinyon-juniper woodlands on the same side of the Peninsular ranges.

=====Transmontane chaparral distribution=====
Transmontane (desert) chaparral typically grows on the lower ({{convert|3500|–|4500|ft|m}} elevation) northern slopes of the southern Transverse Ranges (running east to west in [[San Bernardino County|San Bernardino]] and [[Los Angeles County|Los Angeles]] counties) and on the lower ({{convert|2500|–|3500|ft|m}}) eastern slopes of the Peninsular Ranges (running south to north from lower [[Baja California]] to Riverside and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] counties and the Transverse Ranges).&lt;ref&gt;''A Natural History of California'', Allan A. Schoenherr, pp.327, Figure 8.9, {{ISBN|978-0-520-06922-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be found in higher-elevation [[sky island]]s in the interior of the deserts, such as in the upper [[New York Mountains]] within the [[Mojave National Preserve]] in the Mojave Desert.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The California transmontane (desert) chaparral is found in the rain shadow deserts of the following:
* [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] creating the [[Great Basin Desert]] and northern Mojave Desert
* [[Transverse ranges]] creating the western through eastern [[Mojave Desert]]
* [[Peninsular ranges]] creating the [[Colorado Desert]] and [[Yuha Desert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;co.san-diego.ca.us&quot;/&gt;

==Wildfires==
{{more citations needed section|date=December 2013}}
Chaparral is a coastal biome with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The Chaparral area receives about {{convert|38|–|100|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year. This makes the chaparral most vulnerable to fire in the late summer and fall.

The chaparral ecosystem as a whole is adapted to be able to recover from infrequent wildfires (fires occurring a minimum of 15 years apart); indeed, chaparral regions are known culturally and historically for their impressive fires. (This does create a conflict with human development adjacent to and expanding into chaparral systems.) Additionally, Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fire, native peoples, and the natural landscape|date=2002|publisher=Island Press|others=Vale, Thomas R., 1943-|isbn=9781559638890|location=Washington, DC|oclc=614708491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a major fire, typical chaparral plant communities are dominated by [[manzanita]], chamise (also called greasewood; ''[[Adenostoma fasciculatum]]'') and ''[[Ceanothus]]'' species, [[toyon]] (which can sometimes be interspersed with [[California scrub oak|scrub oak]]s), and other drought-resistant shrubs with hard ([[sclerophyllous]]) leaves; these plants resprout (see [[resprouter]]) from underground [[burl]]s after a fire.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The shoots of these plants are, however, not resistant to chaparral crown-fire regimes as the bark is simply not thick enough. Plants that are long-lived in the seed bank or serotenous with induced germination after fire include chamise'', Ceanothus,'' and fiddleneck''.'' Some chaparral plant communities may grow so dense and tall that it becomes difficult for large animals and humans to penetrate, but may be teeming with smaller fauna in the understory. Many chaparral plant species require some fire cue (heat, smoke, or charred wood, and chemical changes in the soil following fires) for germination. Others, such as annual and herbaceous species like ''[[Phacelia]]'' require fires to allow sunlight to reach them, and are known as [[fire follower]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thanos|first=C. A.|last2=Rundel|first2=P. W.|date=1995|title=Fire-Followers in Chaparral: Nitrogenous Compounds Trigger Seed Germination|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=83|issue=2|pages=207–216|doi=10.2307/2261559|jstor=2261559}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time shortly after a fire, chaparral communities may contain soft-leaved herbaceuous annual plants that dominate the community for the first few years – until the burl resprouts and seedlings of chaparral perennials create an overstory, blocking the sunlight from other plants in the community. When the overstory regrows, seeds of annuals and smaller plants may lie dormant until the next fire creates the conditions required for germination. Mid-sized plants such as ''Ceonothus'' fix nitrogen, while others cannot, which, together with the need for exposure to the sun, creates a symbiotic relationship of the entire community with infrequent fires.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Because of the hot, dry conditions that exist in the California summer and fall, chaparral is one of the most fire-prone plant communities in North America. Some fires are caused by lightning, but these are usually during periods of high humidity and low winds and are easily controlled. Nearly all of the very large wildfires are caused by human activity during periods of very hot, dry easterly [[Santa Ana winds]]. These man-made fires are commonly caused by power line failures, vehicle fires and collisions, sparks from machinery, arson, or campfires. In natural Chaparral communities without human interference, the fires are ignition-prone as there are plenty of ground fuels and the temperatures are fire-permitting during the dry season.

Though adapted to infrequent fires, chaparral plant communities can be exterminated by frequent fires. A moderate frequency of fire (less than ten years) will result in the loss of seeder plants such as [[wikipedia:Manzanita|''Manzanita'' spp.]] This moderate frequency disallows seeder plants to reach their reproductive size before the next fire and the community shifts to a sprouter-dominance. High frequency fires (less than five years) can cause the additional loss of sprouters by exhausting their reserves below-ground. Today, frequent accidental ignitions can convert chaparral from a native shrubland to non-native annual grassland and drastically reduce species diversity, especially under drought brought about by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syphard|first=Alexandra D.|last2=Radeloff|first2=Volker C.|last3=Keeley|first3=Jon E.|last4=Hawbaker|first4=Todd J.|last5=Clayton|first5=Murray K.|last6=Stewart|first6=Susan I.|last7=Hammer|first7=Roger B.|date=2007-07-01|title=Human Influence on California Fire Regimes|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1388–1402|doi=10.1890/06-1128.1|pmid=17708216|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=R.

===Wildfire debate===
There are two assumptions relating to California chaparral fire regimes that appear to have caused considerable debate, and sometimes confusion and controversy, within the fields of wildfire ecology and land management.

When intervals between fires drop below 10 to 15 years, many chaparral species are eliminated and the system is typically replaced by non-native, invasive, weedy grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keeley|first=Jon E.|date=1995|jstor=41425064|journal=Madroño|volume=42|issue=2|pages=175–179|title=Future of California Floristics and Systematics: Wildfire Threats to the California Flora}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haidinger|first=Tori L.|last2=Keeley|first2=Jon E.|date=1993|title=Role of high fire frequency in destruction of mixed chaparral|url=http://www.californiachaparral.org/images/Haidinger_Role_of_High_fire_frequency.pdf|journal=Madroño|volume=40|pages=141–147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zedler|first=P.H.|year=1995|editor-last=Keeley|editor-first=J.E.|editor2-last=Scott|editor2-first=T|title=Fire frequency in southern California shrublands: biological effects and management options|url=|journal=Brushfires in California Wildlands: Ecology and Resource Management|volume=|pages=101–112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that older chaparral is responsible for causing large fires was originally proposed in the 1980s by comparing wildfires in [[Baja California]] and southern California .{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It was suggested that fire suppression activities in southern California allowed more fuel to accumulate, which in turn led to larger fires {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} (in Baja, fires often burn without active suppression efforts {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}). This is similar to the argument that fire suppression in western United States has allowed [[ponderosa pine]] forests to become &quot;overstocked&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In the past, surface fires burned through these forests at intervals of anywhere between 4 and 36 years, clearing out the understory and creating a more ecologically balanced system. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} However, chaparral has a crown-fire regime, meaning that fires consume the entire system whenever they burn, with a historical frequency of 30 to 50 years. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In one study, a detailed analysis of historical fire data concluded that fire suppression activities have been ineffective at excluding fire from southern California chaparral, unlike in ponderosa pine forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley 255–265&quot;/&gt; In addition, the number of fires is increasing in step with population growth. Chaparral stand age does not have a significant correlation to its tendency to burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moritz|first=Max A.|last2=Keeley|first2=Jon E.|last3=Johnson|first3=Edward A.|last4=Schaffner|first4=Andrew A.|date=2004-03-01|title=Testing a basic assumption of shrubland fire management: how important is fuel age?|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=67–72|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0067:tabaos]2.0.co;2|issn=1540-9309|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f272d6d3aec1d947b8159d2ba9fe3f9626b03bb3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low humidity, low fuel moisture, and high winds appear to be the primary factors in determining when and where a chaparral fire occurs and how large it becomes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Fires can be beneficial to plant communities by clearing away canopies of litter, inducing serotenous germination, and sanitizing the soils from pathogens.
