'''RDX''' is an [[organic compound]] with the formula (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NNCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a white solid without smell or taste, widely used as an [[explosive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Simon Quellen|title=Boom!: The Chemistry and History of Explosives|date=July 1, 2017|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1613738054|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, it is classified as a [[nitramide]], chemically similar to [[HMX]]. A more energetic explosive than [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], it was used widely in [[World War II]] and remains common in military applications.

It is often used in mixtures with other explosives and [[plasticizer]]s or [[phlegmatized|phlegmatizers]] (desensitizers); it is the explosive agent in [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] plastic explosive. RDX is stable in storage and is considered one of the most energetic and [[brisance|brisant]] of the military [[high explosive]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Army TM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Department of the Army Technical Manual TM 9-1300-214: Military Explosives|publisher=Headquarters, Department of the Army (United States) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ODYYAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Military%20explosives&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with a [[relative effectiveness factor]] of 1.60.

==Name==
RDX is also known, but less commonly, as cyclonite, hexogen (particularly in Russian, French, German and German-influenced languages), T4, and, chemically, as cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine.&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt; In the 1930s, the [[Royal Arsenal]], Woolwich, started investigating cyclonite to use against German [[U-boat]]s that were being built with thicker hulls. The goal was to develop an explosive more energetic than TNT. For security reasons, Britain termed cyclonite as &quot;Research Department Explosive&quot; (R.D.X.).&lt;ref name=&quot;MM-18&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''RDX'' appeared in the United States in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Baxter III|1968|pp=27, 42, 255–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public reference in the United Kingdom to the name ''RDX'', or ''R.D.X.'', to use the official title, appeared in 1948; its authors were the managing chemist, [[ROF Bridgwater]], the chemical research and development department, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich]], and the director of [[Royal Ordnance Factories]], Explosives; again, it was referred to as simply RDX.&lt;ref name= sfb/&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Bombing_up_106_Squadron_Lancaster_WWII_IWM_CH_12541.jpg|thumb|right|Armourers prepare to load 1,000-lb MC bombs into the bomb-bay of an [[Avro Lancaster]] B Mark III of No. 106 Squadron [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] at [[RAF Metheringham]] before a major night raid on [[Frankfurt]]. The stencilled lettering around the circumference of each bomb reads &quot;RDX/TNT&quot;.]]
RDX was widely used during [[World War II]], often in explosive mixtures with [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] such as [[Torpex]], [[Composition B]], Cyclotols, and H6. RDX was used in one of the first [[plastic explosive]]s. The [[bouncing bomb]] depth charges used in the &quot;[[Operation Chastise|Dambusters Raid]]&quot; each contained {{convert|6,600|lb}} of Torpex;&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, John (2002) ''The Dambusters Raid''. London: Cassell Military Paperbacks. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] and [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]] bombs designed by Wallis also used Torpex.  

RDX is believed to have been used in many bomb plots, including [[terrorist]] plots.

RDX is the base for a number of common military explosives:

==Synthesis==
RDX is classified by chemists as a [[hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine]] derivative. It is obtained by treating [[hexamine]] with  [[white fuming nitric acid]].

This [[nitrolysis]] reaction also produces [[methylene dinitrate]] (not to be confused with [[dinitromethane]]), [[ammonium nitrate]], and water as byproducts. The overall reaction is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Luo |first1=K.-M. |last2=Lin |first2=S.-H. |last3=Chang |first3=J.-G. |last4=Huang |first4=T.-H. |title=Evaluations of kinetic parameters and critical runaway conditions in the reaction system of hexamine-nitric acid to produce RDX in a non-isothermal batch reactor |journal=Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=119–127 |year=2002 |doi=10.1016/S0950-4230(01)00027-4 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
RDX was used by both sides in [[World War II]]. The U.S. produced about 15,000 long tons per month during WWII and Germany about 7,000 long tons per month.&lt;ref name=Urbanski-78&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDX had the major advantages of possessing greater explosive force than [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]], used in World War I, and requiring no additional raw materials for its manufacture.&lt;ref name=Urbanski-78/&gt;

===Germany===
RDX was reported in 1898 by Georg Friedrich Henning, who obtained a [[Germany|German]] [[patent]] (patent No. 104280) for its manufacture by [[nitrolysis]] of hexamine ([[hexamethylenetetramine]]) with concentrated nitric acid.&lt;ref name=urbanski&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=77–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henning/&gt; In this patent, the medical properties of RDX were mentioned; however, three further German patents obtained by Henning in 1916 proposed its use in [[smokeless propellant]]s.&lt;ref name=urbanski/&gt; The German military started investigating its use in 1920, referring to it as hexogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gartz&quot;/&gt; Research and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|p=125}} credits &quot;G. C. V. Herz&quot; for the patent, but the patentee is Edmund von Herz.&lt;/ref&gt; described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, obtained a British patent in 1921 &lt;ref name=Herz-British/&gt; and a [[United States]] patent in 1922.&lt;ref name=Herz-US/&gt; Both patent claims were initiated in Austria; and described the manufacture of RDX by nitrating [[hexamethylenetetramine]].&lt;ref name=Herz-British/&gt;&lt;ref name=Herz-US/&gt; The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by nitration, its use with or without other explosives, its use as a bursting charge and as an initiator.&lt;ref name=Herz-British/&gt; The U.S. patent claim was for the use of a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing RDX.&lt;ref name=Herz-US/&gt; In the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gartz&quot;/&gt;

During World War II, Germany used the code names W Salt, SH Salt, K-method, the E-method, and the KA-method. These names represented the identities of the developers of the various chemical routes to RDX. The W-method was developed by Wolfram in 1934 and gave RDX the code name &quot;W-Salz&quot;. It used [[sulfamic acid]], formaldehyde, and nitric acid.&lt;ref name=urbanski-W&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=107–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; SH-Salz (SH salt) was from Schnurr, who developed a batch-process in 1937–38 based on nitrolysis of hexamine.&lt;ref name=urbanski-SH&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The K-method, from Knöffler, involved addition of [[ammonium nitrate]] to the hexamine/nitric acid process.&lt;ref name=urbanski-K&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The E-method, developed by Ebele, proved to be identical to the Ross and Schiessler process described below.&lt;ref name=urbanski-E&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KA-method, also developed by Knöffler, turned out to be identical to the Bachmann process described below.&lt;ref name=urbanski-KA&gt;{{Harvtxt|Urbański|1967|pp=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive shells fired by the [[MK 108 cannon]] and the warhead of the [[R4M rocket]], both used in [[Luftwaffe]] fighter aircraft as offensive armament, both used hexogen as their explosive base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMY9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17|title=World War 2 In Review No. 23: Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|last=Press|first=Merriam|publisher=Lulu Press|year=2017|isbn=9781387322572|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), RDX was manufactured from 1933 by the research department in a pilot plant at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]], [[London]], a larger pilot plant being built at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|RGPF Waltham Abbey]] just outside London in 1939.&lt;ref name=cocroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Akhavan/&gt; In 1939 a twin-unit industrial-scale plant was designed to be installed at a new {{convert|700|acre|ha|adj=on}} site, [[ROF Bridgwater]], away from [[London]] and production of RDX started at Bridgwater on one unit in August 1941.&lt;ref name=cocroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=hornby/&gt; The ROF Bridgwater plant brought in ammonia and methanol as raw materials: the methanol was converted to formaldehyde and some of the ammonia converted to nitric acid, which was concentrated for RDX production.&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; The rest of the ammonia was reacted with formaldehyde to produce hexamine. The hexamine plant was supplied by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]]. It incorporated some features based on data obtained from the United States (U.S.).&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; RDX was produced by continually adding hexamine and concentrated nitric acid to a cooled mixture of hexamine and nitric acid in the nitrator.&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; The RDX was purified and processed for its intended use; recovery and reuse of some methanol and nitric acid also was carried out.&lt;ref name=sfb/&gt; The hexamine-nitration and RDX purification plants were duplicated (i.e. twin-unit) to provide some insurance against loss of production due to fire, explosion, or air attack.&lt;ref name=cocroft/&gt;

The United Kingdom and [[British Empire]] were fighting without allies against [[Nazi Germany]] until the middle of 1941 and had to be [[self-sufficient]]. At that time (1941), the UK had the capacity to produce {{convert|70|LT|tonne}} &lt;!-- {{convert|71000|kg|lb}} --&gt;(160,000&amp;nbsp;lb) of RDX per week; both [[Canada]], an allied country and self-governing dominion within the British Empire, and the U.S. were looked upon to supply ammunition and explosives, including RDX.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=253–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942 the [[Royal Air Force]]'s annual requirement was forecast to be {{convert|52000|LT|tonne}} of RDX, much of which came from North America (Canada and the U.S.).&lt;ref name=hornby/&gt;

===Canada===
A different method of production to the Woolwich process was found and used in Canada, possibly at the [[McGill University]] department of chemistry. This was based on reacting paraformaldehyde and ammonium nitrate in [[acetic anhydride]].&lt;ref name=Gilman/&gt; A UK patent application was made by Robert Walter Schiessler (Pennsylvania State University) and James Hamilton Ross (McGill, Canada) in May 1942; the UK patent was issued in December 1947.&lt;ref name=Schiessler/&gt; Gilman states that the same method of production had been independently discovered by Ebele in Germany prior to Schiessler and Ross, but that this was not known by the Allies.&lt;ref name=urbanski/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilman/&gt; Urbański provides details of five methods of production, and he refers to this method as the (German) E-method.&lt;ref name=urbanski-E/&gt;

===UK, U.S., and Canadian production and development===
At the beginning of the 1940s, the major U.S. explosive manufacturers, [[duPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company]] and [[Hercules Inc.|Hercules]], had several decades of experience of manufacturing [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) and had no wish to experiment with new explosives. U.S. Army Ordnance held the same viewpoint and wanted to continue using TNT.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-254&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=253–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; RDX had been tested by [[Picatinny Arsenal]] in 1929, and it was regarded as too expensive and too sensitive.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The Navy proposed to continue using [[ammonium picrate]].&lt;ref name=baxter-253-254/&gt; In contrast, the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC), who had visited The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, thought new explosives were necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;baxter-253-254&quot;/&gt; [[James B. Conant]], chairman of Division B, wished to involve academic research into this area. Conant therefore set up an experimental explosives research laboratory at the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]], [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]], using [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD) funding.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt;

====Woolwich method====
In 1941, the UK's [[Tizard Mission]] visited the U.S. Army and Navy departments and part of the information handed over included details of the &quot;Woolwich&quot; method of manufacture of RDX and its stabilisation by mixing it with [[beeswax]].&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The UK was asking that the U.S. and Canada, combined, supply {{convert|220|ST|tonne}} &lt;!-- {{convert|200000|kg|lb}} --&gt; (440,000&amp;nbsp;lb) of RDX per day.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; A decision was taken by [[William H. P. Blandy]], chief of the [[Bureau of Ordnance]], to adopt RDX for use in mines and [[torpedo]]es.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; Given the immediate need for RDX, the U.S. Army Ordnance, at Blandy's request, built a plant that copied the equipment and process used at Woolwich. The result was the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordnance Works]] run by E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, this works had the largest nitric acid plant in the world.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The Woolwich process was expensive: it needed {{convert|11|lb}} of [[nitric acid#Grades|strong nitric acid]] for every pound of RDX.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM-13&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=13}} These pages need to be checked. Page 13 may actually be page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1941, the NDRC was researching new processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MM-13&quot;/&gt; The Woolwich or direct nitration process has at least two serious disadvantages: (1) it used large amounts of nitric acid and (2) at least one-half of the formaldehyde is lost. One mole of hexamethylenetetramine could produce at most one mole of RDX.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Elderfield|1960|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three laboratories with no previous explosive experience were instructed to develop better production methods for RDX; they were based at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Michigan University|Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania State University|Pennsylvania State]] universities.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These were not the only laboratories to work on RDX, Gilman's 1953 account of the Ross–Schiessler method was based on unpublished work from laboratories at the Universities of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Cornell, Harvard, Vanderbilt, McGill (Canada), Bristol (UK), Sheffield (UK), Pennsylvania State College, and the UK's research department.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Emmanuel Bachmann]], from Michigan, successfully developed the &quot;combination process&quot; by combining the Canadian process with direct nitration.&lt;ref name=urbanski-KA/&gt;&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; The combination process required large quantities of acetic anhydride instead of nitric acid in the old British &quot;Woolwich process&quot;. Ideally, the combination process could produce two moles of RDX from each mole of hexamethylenetetramine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elder-6&quot;/&gt;

The vast production of RDX could not continue to rely on the use of natural beeswax to desensitize the RDX. A substitute stabilizer based on petroleum was developed at the Bruceton Explosives Research Laboratory.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt;

====Bachmann process====
The NDRC instructed three companies to develop pilot plants. They were the Western Cartridge Company, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, and [[Eastman Chemical Company|Tennessee Eastman Company]], part of Eastman Kodak.&lt;ref name=baxter-253-259/&gt; At the Eastman Chemical Company (TEC), a leading manufacturer of acetic anhydride, [[Werner Emmanuel Bachmann]] developed a continuous-flow process for RDX. RDX was crucial to the war effort and the current batch-production process was too slow. In February 1942, TEC began producing small amounts of RDX at its Wexler Bend pilot plant, which led to the U.S. government authorizing TEC to design and build [[Holston Ordnance Works]] (H.O.W.) in June 1942. By April 1943, RDX was being manufactured there.&lt;ref name=Bachmann-Sheehan/&gt; At the end of 1944, the Holston plant and the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordnance Works]], which used the Woolwich process, were producing {{convert|25000|ST|tonne}} (50 million pounds) of [[Composition B]] per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|MacDonald and Mack Partnership|1984|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Bachmann process for RDX was found to be richer in [[HMX]] than the United Kingdom's RDX.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}} This later led to a RDX plant using the Bachmann process being set up at ROF Bridgwater in 1955 to produce both RDX and HMX.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}

===Military compositions===
The United Kingdom's intention in World War II was to use &quot;desensitised&quot; RDX. In the original Woolwich process, RDX was [[phlegmatized]] with beeswax, but later [[paraffin wax]] was used, based on the work carried out at Bruceton. In the event the UK was unable to obtain sufficient RDX to meet its needs, some of the shortfall was met by substituting [[amatol]], a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT.&lt;ref name=hornby/&gt;

[[Karl Dönitz]] was reputed to have claimed that &quot;an aircraft can no more kill a U-boat than a crow can kill a [[Mole (animal)|mole]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Baxter-42&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, by May 1942 [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bombers]] began to deploy [[depth charge]]s containing [[Torpex]], a mixture of RDX, TNT, and aluminium, which had up to 50 percent more destructive power than TNT-filled depth charges.&lt;ref name=Baxter-42/&gt; Considerable quantities of the RDX–TNT mixture were produced at the Holston Ordnance Works, with [[Tennessee Eastman]] developing an automated mixing and cooling process based around the use of stainless steel [[conveyor belt]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;baxter-257&amp;259&quot;&gt;{{Harvtxt|Baxter III|1968|pp=257 &amp; 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===
A [[Semtex]] bomb was used in the [[Pan Am Flight 103]] (known also as the Lockerbie) bombing in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolz|first1=F.

[[Ahmed Ressam]], the [[al-Qaeda]] [[2000 millennium attack plots|Millennium Bomber]], used a small quantity of RDX as one of the components in the bomb that he prepared to detonate in [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on [[New Year's Eve]] 1999-2000; the bomb could have produced a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating [[car bomb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;febninth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/US_v_Ressam_9thcircuitappeals0210.pdf|title=U.S. v.

In July 2012, the Kenyan government arrested two Iranian nationals and charged them with illegal possession of {{Convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=off}} of RDX. According to the [[Kenyan Police]], the Iranians planned to use the RDX for &quot;attacks on Israeli, US, UK and Saudi Arabian targets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ap-exclusive-iranian-agents-in-kenya-planned-attacks-on-israel-us-uk-saudi-arabian-targets/2012/07/02/gJQAgSuWIW_story.html |title=Iranian agents in Kenya planned attacks on Israel, US, UK, Saudi Arabian targets |newspaper=Washington Post |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RDX was used in the [[assassination of Rafic Hariri|assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri]] on February 14, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/the-hezbollah-connection.html |title=The Hezbollah Connection |author=Ronen Bergman |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 10, 2015 |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

250 kg High-grade RDX was used by [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]] in [[2019 Pulwama attack]]. The attack resulted in the death of 44 [[Central Reserve Police Force]] (CRPF) personnel and the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2019 Pulwama attack: RDX used|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/80-kg-high-grade-rdx-used-by-jaish-terrorist-in-pulwama-attack/articleshow/68016262 |accessdate=Feb 15, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Economic Times]] |date=Feb 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stability==
RDX has a high nitrogen content and a high O:C ratio, both of which indicate its explosive potential for formation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

RDX undergoes a deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in confinement and certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=D. |last2=Bernecker |first2=R. |year=1977 |title=DDT Behavior of Waxed Mixtures of RDX, HMX, and Tetryl |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a047968.pdf |journal=Naval Surface Weapons Center |volume= |pages= |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Explosive velocity|velocity of detonation]] of RDX at a density of 1.76 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is 8750&amp;nbsp;m/s.

It starts to decompose at approximately 170&amp;nbsp;°C and melts at 204&amp;nbsp;°C. At [[room temperature]], it is very stable. It burns rather than explodes. It detonates only with a [[detonator]], being unaffected even by [[small arms]] fire. This property makes it a useful military explosive. It is less sensitive than pentaerythritol tetranitrate ([[PETN]]). Under normal conditions, RDX has a [[Figure of Insensitivity]] of exactly 80 (RDX defines the reference point).{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}

RDX [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimates]] in [[vacuum]], which restricts or prevents its use in some applications.

RDX, when exploded in air, has about 1.5 times the explosive energy of TNT per unit weight and about 2.0 times per unit volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Elderfield|1960|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baxter-257&amp;259&quot; /&gt;

RDX is insoluble in water, with solubility 0.05975 [[Gram per litre|g/L]] at temperature of 25°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://chemistry-chemists.com/chemister/Spravochniki/handbook-of-aqueous-solubility-data-2010.pdf|title=Handbook of aqueous solubility data|last1=Yalkowsky|first1=S.

==Toxicity==
The substance's toxicity has been studied for many years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ncea/iris/pdfs/Litsearch_RDX.pdf Annotated Reference Outline for the Toxicological Review of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)]. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (November 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; RDX has caused convulsions (seizures) in military field personnel ingesting it, and in [[munition]] workers inhaling its dust during manufacture.  At least one fatality was attributed to RDX toxicity in a European munitions manufacturing plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider1977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0041-008X(77)90144-2 |pmid=854927 |title=Toxicology of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine: Distribution and metabolism in the rat and the miniature swine |journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=531–41 |date=March 1977 |last1=Schneider |first1=N.

During the [[Vietnam War]], at least 40 American soldiers were hospitalized with [[C-4_(explosive)|composition C-4]] (which is 91% RDX) intoxication from December 1968 to December 1969. C-4 was frequently used by soldiers as a fuel to heat food, and the food was generally mixed by the same knife that was used to cut C-4 into small pieces prior to burning. Soldiers were exposed to C-4 either due to inhaling the fumes, or due to ingestion, made possible by many small particles adhering to the knife having been deposited into the cooked food. The symptom complex involved nausea, vomiting, generalized seizures, and prolonged [[postictal state|postictal confusion]] and amnesia; which indicated [[toxic encephalopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ketel|first1=W.

Oral toxicity of RDX depends on its physical form; in rats, the LD50 was found to be 100 mg/kg for finely powdered RDX, and 300 mg/kg for coarse, granular RDX.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider1977&quot; /&gt; A case has been reported of a human child hospitalized in [[status epilepticus]] following the ingestion of 84.82 mg/kg dose of RDX (or 1.23 g for the patient's body weight of 14.5 kg) in the &quot;plastic explosive&quot; form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woody|first1=R.C.|last2=Kearns|first2=G.L.|last3=Brewster|first3=M.A.|last4=Turley|first4=C.P.|last5=Sharp|first5=G.B.|last6=Lake|first6=R.S.|title=The Neurotoxicity of Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) in a Child: A Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation|journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology|date=1986|volume=24|issue=4|pages=305–319|doi=10.3109/15563658608992595}}&lt;/ref&gt;
