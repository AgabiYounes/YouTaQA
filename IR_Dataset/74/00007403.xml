[[File:Chemotaxis1.jpg|thumb|Capillary tube assay for chemotaxis. Motile prokaryotes sense chemicals in their environment and change their motility accordingly. Absent chemicals, movement is completely random. When an attractant or repellent is present, runs become longer and tumbles become less frequent. The result is net movement towards or away from the chemical (i.e., up or down the chemical gradient). The net movement can be seen in the beaker, where the bacteria accumulate around the origin of the attractant, and away from the origin of the repellent.]]
'''Chemotaxis''' (from ''[[chemical substance|chemo-]]'' + ''[[taxis]]'') is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chemotaxis|volume=6|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somatic cell]]s, [[bacteria]], and other [[single-cell organism|single-cell]] or [[multicellular]] organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment. This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g., [[glucose]]) by swimming toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from [[poison]]s (e.g., [[phenol]]). In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g., movement of [[sperm]] towards the egg during [[fertilization]]) and subsequent phases of development (e.g., migration of [[neuron]]s or [[lymphocyte]]s) as well as in normal function and health (e.g., migration of [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] during injury or infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Oliveira S, Rosowski EE, Huttenlocher A | title = Neutrophil migration in infection and wound repair: going forward in reverse | journal = Nature Reviews.

''Positive'' chemotaxis occurs if the movement is toward a higher concentration of the chemical in question; ''negative'' chemotaxis if the movement is in the opposite direction. Chemically prompted [[kinesis (biology)|kinesis]] (randomly directed or nondirectional) can be called [[chemokinesis]].

== History of chemotaxis research ==

Although migration of cells was detected from the early days of the development of microscopy by [[Leeuwenhoek]], a Caltech lecture regarding chemotaxis propounds that 'erudite description of chemotaxis was only first made by [[Theodor Wilhelm Engelmann|T. W. Engelmann]] (1881) and [[Wilhelm Pfeffer|W. F. Pfeffer]] (1884) in bacteria, and [[Herbert Spencer Jennings|H. S. Jennings]] (1906) in [[ciliate]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Chemotaxis Lecture. Uploaded in 2007. available at: http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/aph161/2007/lectures/ChemotaxisLecture.pdf (Last inspected: 15/04/17)&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Prize laureate [[Élie Metchnikoff|I. Metchnikoff]] also contributed to the study of the field during 1882 to 1886, with investigations of the process as an initial step of [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Élie Metchnikoff&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of chemotaxis in biology and clinical pathology was widely accepted in the 1930s, and the most fundamental definitions underlying the phenomenon were drafted by this time.{{By whom|date=April 2017}} The most important aspects in quality control of [[chemotaxis assay]]s were described by [[Henry Harris (scientist)|H. Harris]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Keller-Segel Models for Chemotaxis. 2012. available at: http://www.isn.ucsd.edu/courses/Beng221/problems/2012/BENG221_Project%20-%20Roberts%20Chung%20Yu%20Li.pdf (Last inspected by April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the revolution of modern cell biology and biochemistry provided a series of novel techniques that became available to investigate the migratory responder cells and subcellular fractions responsible for chemotactic activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4873021&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snyderman R, Gewurz H, Mergenhagen SE | title = Interactions of the complement system with endotoxic lipopolysaccharide.

[[File:ChtxCCW CW (Fixed).png|right|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Correlation of swimming behaviour and flagellar rotation&lt;/div&gt;]]
Some [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', have several [[flagellum|flagella]] per cell (4–10 typically). These can rotate in two ways:
# Counter-clockwise rotation aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in a straight line; and
# Clockwise rotation breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan J, Fahrner KA, Turner L, Berg HC | title = Asymmetry in the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the bacterial flagellar motor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 29 | pages = 12846–9 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20615986 | pmc = 2919929 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1007333107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712846Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The directions of rotation are given for an observer outside the cell looking down the flagella toward the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.physik.uni-muenchen.de/lehre/vorlesungen/wise_16_17/Biophysics_of_Systems/013_BakterChemotaxis_DB_WS16.pdf|title=Bacterial Chemotaxis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior ===
The overall movement of a bacterium is the result of alternating tumble and swim phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berg HC, Brown DA | title = Chemotaxis in Escherichia coli analysed by Three-dimensional Tracking | journal = Nature | volume = 239 | issue = 5374 | pages = 500–504 | date = October 1972 | doi = 10.1038/239500a0 | pmid = 4563019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the trajectory of a bacterium swimming in a uniform environment will form a [[random walk]] with relatively straight swims interrupted by random tumbles that reorient the bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sourjik V, Wingreen NS | title = Responding to chemical gradients: bacterial chemotaxis | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 262–268 | date = April 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2011.11.008 | pmid = 22169400 | pmc = 3320702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' are unable to choose the direction in which they swim, and are unable to swim in a straight line for more than a few seconds due to rotational [[diffusion]]; in other words, bacteria &quot;forget&quot; the direction in which they are going. By repeatedly evaluating their course, and adjusting if they are moving in the wrong direction, bacteria can direct their random walk motion toward favorable locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Howard C. |title=Random walks in biology|year=1993|pages=83–94|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-00064-0|edition=Expanded, rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the presence of a chemical [[gradient]] bacteria will chemotax, or direct their overall motion based on the gradient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} If the bacterium senses that it is moving in the correct direction (toward attractant/away from repellent), it will keep swimming in a straight line for a longer time before tumbling; however, if it is moving in the wrong direction, it will tumble sooner and try a new direction at random.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In other words, bacteria like ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' use temporal sensing to decide whether their situation is improving or not, and in this way, find the location with the highest concentration of attractant (usually the source) quite well.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Even under very high concentrations, it can still distinguish very small differences in concentration, and fleeing from a repellent works with the same efficiency.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

This biased random walk is a result of simply choosing between two methods of random movement; namely tumbling and straight swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macnab RM, Koshland DE | title = The gradient-sensing mechanism in bacterial chemotaxis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 69 | issue = 9 | pages = 2509–12 | date = September 1972 | pmid = 4560688 | pmc = 426976 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.9.2509 | bibcode = 1972PNAS...69.2509M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The helical nature of the individual flagellar filament is critical for this movement to occur. The protein structure that makes up the flagellar filament, [[flagellin]], is conserved among all flagellated bacteria.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Vertebrates seem to have taken advantage of this fact by possessing an immune receptor ([[Toll-like receptor|TLR5]]) designed to recognize this conserved protein.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

As in many instances in biology, there are bacteria that do not follow this rule. Many bacteria, such as ''Vibrio'', are monoflagellated and have a single flagellum at one pole of the cell. Their method of chemotaxis is different. Others possess a single flagellum that is kept inside the cell wall. These bacteria move by spinning the whole cell, which is shaped like a corkscrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard C. |last=Berg | name-list-format = vanc | title=''E. coli'' in motion | year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-387-00888-2 |publisher=Springer | location=New York, NY }}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

===Signal transduction===
[[Image:ChtxAspRec.png|right|350 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Domain structure of chemotaxis receptor for Asp&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemical gradients are sensed through multiple [[transmembrane receptor]]s, called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), which vary in the molecules that they detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wadhams|first1=George H. |last2=Armitage|first2=Judith P.|date=December 2004 |title=Making sense of it all: bacterial chemotaxis |journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=1024–1037 |doi=10.1038/nrm1524 |pmid=15573139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of MCP receptors are known to be encoded across the bacterial kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Galperin |first1=Michael |date=June 2005 |title=A census of membrane-bound and intracellular signal transduction proteins in bacteria: Bacterial IQ, extroverts and introverts |journal=BMC Microbiology |volume=5 |pages=35 |doi=10.1186/1471-2180-5-35 |pmid=15955239 |pmc=1183210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors may bind attractants or repellents directly or indirectly through interaction with proteins of [[periplasmatic space]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The signals from these receptors are transmitted across the [[plasma membrane]] into the [[cytosol]], where ''[[Che proteins]]'' are activated.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Che proteins alter the tumbling frequency, and alter the receptors.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Flagellum regulation====
The proteins CheW and CheA bind to the receptor. The absence of receptor activation results in [[phosphorylation|autophosphorylation]] in the histidine kinase, CheA, at a single highly conserved histidine residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4lv7cBYVug|title=Chemotaxis|last=ToxCafe|date=2 June 2011|access-date=March 23, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} CheA, in turn, transfers phosphoryl groups to conserved aspartate residues in the response regulators CheB and CheY; CheA is a histidine kinase and it does not actively transfer the phosphoryl group, rather, the response regulator [[Protein-glutamate methylesterase|CheB]] takes the phosphoryl group from CheA.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This mechanism of signal transduction is called a [[two-component regulatory system|two-component system]], and it is a common form of signal transduction in bacteria.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} CheY induces tumbling by interacting with the flagellar switch protein FliM, inducing a change from counter-clockwise to clockwise rotation of the flagellum. Change in the rotation state of a single flagellum can disrupt the entire flagella bundle and cause a tumble.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Receptor regulation====
[[Image:Chtxbactsign1.png|right|450 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Signalling pathways of E.coli&lt;/div&gt;]]
CheB, when activated by CheA, acts as a [[demethylase|methylesterase]], removing methyl groups from [[glutamate]] residues on the [[cytosol]]ic side of the receptor; it works antagonistically with CheR, a methyl[[transferase]], which adds methyl residues to the same glutamate residues.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; If the level of an attractant remains high, the level of phosphorylation of CheA (and, therefore, CheY and CheB) will remain low, the cell will swim smoothly, and the level of methylation of the MCPs will increase (because CheB-P is not present to demethylate).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadhams|first=George H.|last2=Armitage|first2=Judith P.|date=December 2004|title=Making sense of it all: bacterial chemotaxis|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=5|issue=12|pages=1024–1037|doi=10.1038/nrm1524|pmid=15573139|issn=1471-0080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCPs no longer respond to the attractant when they are fully methylated; therefore, even though the level of attractant might remain high, the level of CheA-P (and CheB-P) increases and the cell begins to tumble.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt; The MCPs can be demethylated by CheB-P, and, when this happens, the receptors can once again respond to attractants.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The situation is the opposite with regard to repellents: fully methylated MCPs respond best to repellents, while least-methylated MCPs respond worst to repellents.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This regulation allows the bacterium to 'remember' chemical concentrations from the recent past, a few seconds, and compare them to those it is currently experiencing, thus 'know' whether it is traveling up or down a gradient.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Although the methylation system accounts for the wide range of sensitivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mello BA, Tu Y | title = Effects of adaptation in maintaining high sensitivity over a wide range of backgrounds for Escherichia coli chemotaxis | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 92 | issue = 7 | pages = 2329–37 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17208965 | pmc = 1864821 | doi = 10.1529/biophysj.106.097808 | bibcode = 2007BpJ....92.2329M }}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} that bacteria have to chemical gradients, other mechanisms are involved in increasing the absolute value of the sensitivity on a given background.

== Chemoattractants and chemorepellents ==
Chemoattractants and chemorepellents are [[inorganic]] or [[Organic compound|organic]] substances possessing chemotaxis-inducer effect in motile cells. These chemotactic [[ligand]]s create chemical concentration gradients that organisms, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, move toward or away from, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Xu | first = Feifei | last2 = Bierman | first2 = Robert | last3 = Healy | first3 = Frank | last4 = Nguyen | first4 = Hoa | name-list-format = vanc |title=A multi-scale model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis from intracellular signaling pathway to motility and nutrient uptake in nutrient gradient and isotropic fluid environments|doi = 10.1016/j.camwa.2015.12.019 |journal=Computers &amp; Mathematics with Applications|volume=71| issue = 11 |pages=2466–2478 | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chtx-AttrRep-en.png|right|250x250px|float]]
Effects of chemoattractants are elicited via chemoreceptors such as [[methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein]]s (MCP).&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szurmant H, Ordal GW | title = Diversity in chemotaxis mechanisms among the bacteria and archaea | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 301–19 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15187186 | pmc = 419924 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.2.301-319.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MCPs in E.coli include Tar, Tsr, Trg and Tap.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto K, Macnab RM, Imae Y | title = Repellent response functions of the Trg and Tap chemoreceptors of Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 172 | issue = 1 | pages = 383–8 | date = January 1990 | pmid = 2403544 | pmc = 208443 | doi = 10.1128/jb.172.1.383-388.1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemoattracttants to Trg include [[ribose]] and [[galactose]] with [[phenol]] as a chemorepellent. Tap and Tsr recognize [[dipeptide]]s and [[serine]] as chemoattractants, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;

Chemoattractants or chemorepellents bind MCPs at its extracellular domain; an intracellular signaling domain relays the changes in concentration of these chemotactic ligands to downstream proteins like that of CheA which then relays this signal to flagellar motors via phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P).&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot; /&gt; CheY-P can then control flagellar rotation influencing the direction of cell motility.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;

For ''E.coli'', ''[[S. meliloti]]'', and ''[[R. spheroids]],'' the binding of chemoattractants to MCPs inhibit CheA and therefore CheY-P activity, resulting in smooth runs, but for ''[[Bacillus subtilis|B. substilis]]'', CheA activity increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt; Methylation events in ''E.coli'' cause MCPs to have lower affinity to chemoattractants which causes increased activity of CheA and CheY-P resulting in tumbles.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot; /&gt; In this way cells are able to adapt to the immediate chemoattractant concentration and detect further changes to modulate cell motility.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty&quot;/&gt;

Chemoattractants in eukaryotes are well characterized for immune cells. [[Formyl]] [[peptide]]s, such as [[N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine|fMLF]], attract [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] such as [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s, causing movement toward infection sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiffmann&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffmann E, Corcoran BA, Wahl SM | title = N-formylmethionyl peptides as chemoattractants for leucocytes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 72 | issue = 3 | pages = 1059–62 | date = March 1975 | pmid = 1093163 | pmc = 432465 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.72.3.1059 | bibcode = 1975PNAS...72.1059S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-acylated methioninyl peptides do not act as chemoattractants to neutrophils and macrophages.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiffmann&quot; /&gt; Leukocytes also move toward chemoattractants C5a, a [[Complement system|complement]] component, and [[pathogen]]-specific ligands on bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;shiffmann&quot; /&gt;

Mechanisms concerning chemorepellents are less known than chemoattractants. Although chemorepellents work to confer an avoidance response in organisms, [[Tetrahymena|''Tetrahymena thermophila'']]  adapt to a chemorepellent, [[Netrin-1 peptide]], within 10 minutes of exposure; however, exposure to chemorepellents such as [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], [[PACAP-38]], and [[nociceptin]] show no such adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuruvilla H, Schmidt B, Song S, Bhajjan M, Merical M, Alley C, Griffin C, Yoder D, Hein J, Kohl D, Puffenberger C, Petroff D, Newcomer E, Good K, Heston G, Hurtubise A | title = Netrin-1 Peptide Is a Chemorepellent in Tetrahymena thermophila | journal = International Journal of Peptides | volume = 2016 | pages = 7142868 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27123011 | pmc = 4830718 | doi = 10.1155/2016/7142868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GTP and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] are chemorepellents in micro-molar concentrations to both ''Tetrahymena'' and ''[[Paramecium]]''.

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotes and have receptors embedded uniformly throughout the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine2013&quot; /&gt; Eukaryotic chemotaxis involves detecting a concentration gradient spatially by comparing the asymmetric activation of these receptors at the different ends of the cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine2013&quot; /&gt; Activation of these receptors results in migration towards chemoattractants, or away from chemorepellants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine2013&quot; /&gt;

Levels of receptors, intracellular signalling pathways and the effector mechanisms all represent diverse, eukaryotic-type components.

===Motility===
Unlike motility in bacterial chemotaxis, the mechanism by which eukaryotic cells physically move is unclear. There appear to be mechanisms by which an external chemotactic gradient is sensed and turned into an intracellular [[PIP3]] gradient, which results in a gradient and the activation of a signaling pathway, culminating in the [[polymerisation]] of [[actin]] filaments. The growing distal end of actin filaments develops connections with the internal surface of the plasma membrane via different sets of peptides and results in the formation of anterior[[pseudopods]] and posterior [[Uropod (immunology)|uropods]].
[[Cilium|Cilia]] of eukaryotic cells can also produce chemotaxis; in this case, it is mainly a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent induction of the [[microtubule|microtubular]] system of the [[basal body]] and the beat of the 9&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 microtubules within cilia. The orchestrated beating of hundreds of cilia is synchronized by a submembranous system built between basal bodies.
The details of the signaling pathways are still not totally clear.

====Chemotaxis-related migratory responses====
[[Image:Chtxphenomen1.png|right|400 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;Chemotaxis related migratory responses&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemotaxis refers to the directional migration of cells in response to chemical gradients; several variations of chemical-induced migration exist as listed below. 
* ''[[Chemokinesis]]'' refers to an increase in cellular motility in response to chemicals in the surrounding environment. Unlike chemotaxis, the migration stimulated by chemokinesis lacks directionality, and instead increases environmental scanning behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker EL | title = Stimulated neutrophil locomotion: chemokinesis and chemotaxis | journal = Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | volume = 101 | issue = 10 | pages = 509–13 | date = October 1977 | pmid = 199132 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In ''[[haptotaxis]]'' the [[gradient]] of the chemoattractant is expressed or bound on a surface, in contrast to the classical model of chemotaxis, in which the gradient develops in a soluble fluid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6030602&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter SB | title = Haptotaxis and the mechanism of cell motility | journal = Nature | volume = 213 | issue = 5073 | pages = 256–60 | date = January 1967 | pmid = 6030602 | doi = 10.1038/213256a0 | bibcode = 1967Natur.213..256C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common biologically active haptotactic surface is the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM); the presence of bound [[ligands]] is responsible for induction of transendothelial migration and [[angiogenesis]].
* ''[[Necrotaxis]]'' embodies a special type of chemotaxis when the chemoattractant molecules are released from [[necrosis|necrotic]] or [[apoptosis|apoptotic]] cells. Depending on the chemical character of released substances, necrotaxis can accumulate or repel cells, which underlines the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon.

===Receptors===
In general, eukaryotic cells sense the presence of chemotactic stimuli through the use of 7-transmembrane (or serpentine) heterotrimeric [[G protein|G-protein]]-coupled receptors, a class representing a significant portion of the [[genome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim JY, Haastert PV, Devreotes PN | title = Social senses: G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways in Dictyostelium discoideum | journal = Chemistry &amp; Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 239–43 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8807851 | doi = 10.1016/s1074-5521(96)90103-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of this gene superfamily are used in eyesight (rhodopsins) as well as in olfaction (smelling).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montell C | title = Visual transduction in Drosophila | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | pages = 231–68 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10611962 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.15.1.231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Antunes G, Simoes de Souza FM | title = Olfactory receptor signaling | journal = Methods in Cell Biology | volume = 132 | pages = 127–45 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26928542 | doi = 10.1016/bs.mcb.2015.11.003  | isbn = 9780128035955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main classes of chemotaxis receptors are triggered by:

However, induction of a wide set of membrane receptors (e.g., [[cyclic nucleotide]]s, [[amino acids]], [[insulin]], vasoactive peptides) also elicit migration of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Haastert PJ, De Wit RJ, Konijn TM | title = Antagonists of chemoattractants reveal separate receptors for cAMP, folic acid and pterin in Dictyostelium | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 140 | issue = 2 | pages = 453–6 | date = August 1982 | pmid = 7117406 | doi = 10.1016/0014-4827(82)90139-2 | url = https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/14539904/1982ExpCellResvHaastert.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of molecules capable of eliciting chemotactic responses is relatively high, and we can distinguish primary and secondary chemotactic molecules.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The main groups of the primary ligands are as follows:
* ''Formyl peptides'' are di-, tri-, tetrapeptides of bacterial origin, formylated on the N-terminus of the peptide.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zigmond SH | title = Ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to orient in gradients of chemotactic factors | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 75 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 606–16 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 264125 | pmc = 2109936 | access-date =  | doi = 10.1083/jcb.75.2.606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are released from bacteria in vivo or after decomposition of the cell[ a typical member of this group is the N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (abbreviated fMLF or fMLP).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Bacterial fMLF is a key component of inflammation has characteristic chemoattractant effects in neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The chemotactic factor ligands and receptors related to formyl peptides are summarized in the related article, [[Formyl peptide receptors]].

* ''[[Chemokines]]'' belong to a special class of [[cytokines]]; not only do their groups (C, CC, CXC, CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C chemokines) represent structurally related molecules with a special arrangement of disulfide bridges but also their target cell specificity is diverse.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} CC chemokines act on monocytes (e.g., [[RANTES]]), and CXC chemokines are neutrophil granulocyte-specific (e.g., [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Investigations of the three-dimensional structures of chemokines provided evidence that a characteristic composition of beta-sheets and an alpha helix provides expression of sequences required for interaction with the chemokine receptors.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Formation of dimers and their increased biological activity was demonstrated by crystallography of several chemokines, e.g. IL-8.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
*Metabolites of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s
** ''[[Leukotrienes]]'' are [[eicosanoid]] lipid mediators made by the metabolism of [[arachidonic acid]] by [[ALOX5]] (also termed 5-lipoxygenase). Their most prominent member with chemotactic factor activity is [[leukotriene B4]], which elicits adhesion, chemotaxis, and aggregation of leukocytes. The chemoattractant action of LTB4 is induced via either of two [[G protein–coupled receptor]]s, [[BLT]]1 and [[BLT2]], which are highly expressed in cells involved in [[inflammation]] and [[allergy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25449650&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell WS, Rokach J | title = Biosynthesis, biological effects, and receptors of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and oxoeicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs) derived from arachidonic acid | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 340–55 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25449650 | pmc = 5710736 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chemotactic range fitting ====
[[Image:chtxCRF2.png|right|250 px|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;border:none&quot;&gt;[[Chemotactic range fitting]]&lt;/div&gt;]]
Chemotactic responses elicited by the ligand-receptor interactions are, in general, distinguished upon the optimal effective concentration(s) of the ligand. Nevertheless, correlation of the amplitude elicited and ratio of the responder cells compared to the total number are also characteristic features of the chemotactic signaling. Investigations of ligand families (e.g., amino acids or oligo peptides) proved that there is a fitting of ranges (amplitudes; number of responder cells) and chemotactic activities: Chemoattractant moiety is accompanied by wide ranges, whereas chemorepellent character by narrow ranges.

==Clinical significance==
A changed migratory potential of cells has relatively high importance in the development of several clinical symptoms and syndromes.
Altered chemotactic activity of extracellular (e.g., [[Escherichia coli]]) or intracellular (e.g., [[Listeria monocytogenes]]) pathogens itself represents a significant clinical target. Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.
Apart from infections, there are some other diseases wherein impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.

==Mathematical models==
Several mathematical models of chemotaxis were developed depending on the type of
* migration (e.g., basic differences of bacterial swimming, movement of unicellular eukaryotes with [[cilia]]/[[flagellum]] and [[ameboid|amoeboid]] migration)
* physico-chemical characteristics of the chemicals (e.g., [[diffusion]]) working as ligands
* biological characteristics of the ligands (attractant, neutral, and repellent molecules)
* assay systems applied to evaluate chemotaxis (see incubation times, development, and stability of concentration gradients)
* other environmental effects possessing direct or indirect influence on the migration (lighting, temperature, magnetic fields, etc.)

Although interactions of the factors listed above make the behavior of the solutions of mathematical models of chemotaxis rather complex, it is possible to describe the basic phenomenon of chemotaxis-driven motion in a straightforward way.
Indeed, let us denote with &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the spatially non-uniform concentration of the chemo-attractant and with &lt;math&gt;\nabla \varphi&lt;/math&gt; its gradient. Then the chemotactic cellular flow (also called current) &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; that is generated by the chemotaxis is linked to the above gradient by the law: &lt;math&gt; J = \chi C \nabla\varphi &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is the spatial density of the cells and &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is the so-called ’Chemotactic coefficient’. However, note that in many cases &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; is not constant: It is, instead, a decreasing function of the concentration of the chemo-attractant &lt;math&gt; \varphi &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \chi(\varphi) &lt;/math&gt;.

[[Spatial ecology]] of soil microorganisms is a function of their chemotactic sensitivities towards substrate and fellow organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gharasoo2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.11.019|title=How the chemotactic characteristics of bacteria can determine their population patterns|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=69 |pages=346–358 |year=2014 |last1=Gharasoo |first1=Mehdi |last2=Centler |first2=Florian|last3=Fetzer|first3=Ingo|last4=Thullner|first4=Martin | name-list-format = vanc }}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} The chemotactic behavior of the bacteria was proven to lead to non-trivial population patterns even in the absence of environmental heterogeneities. The presence of structural pore scale heterogeneities has an extra impact on the emerging bacterial patterns.

==Measurement of chemotaxis==
{{main|Chemotaxis assay}}
A wide range of techniques is available to evaluate chemotactic activity of cells or the chemoattractant and chemorepellent character of ligands.
The basic requirements of the measurement are as follows:
* concentration gradients can develop relatively quickly and persist for a long time in the system
* chemotactic and chemokinetic activities are distinguished
* migration of cells is free toward and away on the axis of the concentration gradient
* detected responses are the results of active migration of cells

Despite the fact that an ideal [[chemotaxis assay]] is still not available, there are several protocols and pieces of equipment that offer good correspondence with the conditions described above. The most commonly used are summarised in the table below:

==Artificial chemotactic systems==
''Chemical robots'' that use artificial chemotaxis to navigate autonomously have been designed. Applications include targeted delivery of drugs in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lagzi|first=István|title=Chemical Robotics—Chemotactic Drug Carriers|journal=Central European Journal of Medicine|year=2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=377–382|doi=10.2478/s11536-012-0130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, enzyme molecules have also shown positive chemotactic behavior in the gradient of their substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sengupta S, Dey KK, Muddana HS, Tabouillot T, Ibele ME, Butler PJ, Sen A | title = Enzyme molecules as nanomotors | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 135 | issue = 4 | pages = 1406–14 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23308365 | doi = 10.1021/ja3091615 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermodynamically-favorable binding of enzymes to their specific substrates is recognized as the origin of enzymatic chemotaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohajerani |first1=F |last2=Zhao |first2=X |last3=Somasundar |first3=A |last4=Velegol |first4=D |last5=Sen |first5=A |title=A Theory of Enzyme Chemotaxis: From Experiments to Modeling |journal=Biochemistry |date=2018 |volume=57 |issue=43 |pages=6256–6263 |doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00801 |pmid=30251529 |arxiv=1809.02530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, enzymes in cascades have also shown substrate-driven chemotactic aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao X, Palacci H, Yadav V, Spiering MM, Gilson MK, Butler PJ, Hess H, Benkovic SJ, Sen A | title = Substrate-driven chemotactic assembly in an enzyme cascade | journal = Nature Chemistry | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–317 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29461522 | doi = 10.1038/nchem.2905 | bibcode = 2018NatCh..10..311Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from active enzymes, non-reacting molecules also show chemotactic behavior. This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guha R, Mohajerani F, Collins M, Ghosh S, Sen A, Velegol D | title = Chemotaxis of Molecular Dyes in Polymer Gradients in Solution | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 139 | issue = 44 | pages = 15588–15591 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29064685 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.7b08783 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
