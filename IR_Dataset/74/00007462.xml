==Career==

===Television===
Anderson was involved in the fledgling [[alternative comedy]] scene in the early 1980s and was the first act to come on stage at [[The Comedy Store, London|The Comedy Store]] when it opened in 1979.&lt;ref name=Radio2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/comedy/cliveanderson.shtml#biog |title=Clive Anderson's Chat Room |accessdate=29 July 2007 |publisher=BBC Radio 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his name as host of the improvised television comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', which ran for 10 series.&lt;ref name=TVbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uktv.co.uk/g2/item/aid/528014 |title=UKTV G2 Stars: Profile: Clive Anderson |accessdate=29 July 2007 |publisher=UKTV Interactive Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson hosted his own chat-show, ''Clive Anderson Talks Back'', on [[Channel 4]], which ran for 10 series. Anderson moved to the BBC in 1996.  The show's name was changed to ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' and it was aired on [[BBC One|BBC1]]. In one incident in 1997, Anderson interviewed the [[Bee Gees]], and throughout the interview he repeatedly joked about their songs from the ''Saturday Night Fever'' era, also referring to their original intended name as 'Les Tosseurs' but his comment, 'you'll always be tossers to me' ultimately prompted the band to walk out of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/36957253/five-stars-that-walked-out-of-their-interviews-and-never-came-back|title=Five stars that walked out of their interviews and never came back - BBC Newsbeat|date=2016-02-08|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson once had a glass of water poured over his head by a perturbed [[Richard Branson]], to which Anderson remarked &quot;I'm used to that; I've flown [[Virgin Atlantic|Virgin]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dave.uktv.co.uk/have-i-got-news-for-you/article/clive-anderson-profile/|title=Clive Anderson Profile {{!}} Have I Got News for You {{!}} Dave Channel|website=dave.uktv.co.uk|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said to [[Jeffrey Archer]], &quot;There's no beginning to your talents.&quot; Archer retorted that &quot;The old jokes are always the best,&quot; for Anderson to reply &quot;Yes, I've read your books.&quot; The last series of ''Clive Anderson All Talk'' aired in 2001.

When asked by Morgan, &quot;What do you know about editing newspapers?&quot;, he swiftly replied, &quot;About as much as you do.&quot;

In 2005 he presented the short-lived quiz ''[[Back in the Day (game show)|Back in the Day]]'' for [[Channel 4]].
