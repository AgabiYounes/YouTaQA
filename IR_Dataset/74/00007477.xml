'''Cuitláhuac''' ({{IPA-es|kwiˈtɬawak|-|Cuitlahuac1.ogg}}, {{audio|Kuitlawatsin.ogg|modern Nahuatl pronunciation}}) (c. 1476 &amp;ndash; 1520)&lt;ref&gt;For year of birth, see entry for [http://sites.estvideo.net/malinal/1.hist/CU.html#CUITLAHUAC &quot;CUITLAHUAC&quot;], ''Dictionnaire de la langue nahuatl classique'' (Wimmer 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  or '''Cuitláhuac''' (in Spanish orthography; {{lang-nah|Cuitlāhuac}},&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-nah|kʷiˈt͡ɬaːwak}}, honorific form: '''Cuitlahuatzin''') was the 10th ''[[tlatoani]]'' (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlan]] for 80 days during the year [[Aztec calendar|Two Flint]] (1520).&lt;ref name=&quot;cha&quot;&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 56–57, 164–165, 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with leading the [[Mexica]] resistance to the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|Spanish invasion]], following the death of his kinsman [[Moctezuma II]].

==Biography==
Cuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler [[Axayacatl]] and a younger brother of [[Moctezuma II]], the late ruler of [[Tenochtitlan]], who died during the Spanish occupation of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother's father, also called [[Cuitlahuatzin I|Cuitlahuac]], had been ruler of [[Iztapalapa]],&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially.&lt;ref&gt;Chimalpahin (1997): pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuitláhuac was an experienced warrior and an adviser to Moctezuma, warning him not to allow the Spaniards to enter Tenochtitlan. [[Hernán Cortés]] imprisoned both Moctezuma and Cuitláhuac. Following the massacre of Aztec elites when Cortés was away from Tenochtitlan, the [[Mexica]] besieged the Spanish and their indigenous allies. Cuitláhuac was released on the pretense to reopen the market to get food to the invaders. Moctezuma was killed under disputed circumstances, and Cuitláhuac was elected ''tlatoani'' following the flight of the Spaniards and their allies from Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520.  Some sources claim he was serving in that role even before Moctezuma's death.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, Louise. &quot;Cuitlahuac&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'' vol. 2, pp. 339-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuitláhuac was ritually married to Moctezuma's eldest daughter, a ten- or eleven-year-old girl, who later was called [[Isabel Moctezuma]].&lt;ref&gt;Chipman, Donald E. (2005). Moctezuma's Children: Aztec Royalty Under Spanish Rule, 1520–1700. Austin: University of Texas Press, pp. 40-41 {{ISBN|0-292-70628-6}}. {{OCLC|5713428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuauhtláhuac.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Cuitláhuac]]
Cuitláhuac ruled just 80 days, perhaps dying from [[smallpox]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cha&quot;/&gt; that had been introduced to the [[New World]] by the [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]]. The early sources do not explicitly say from what he succumbed.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhart, &quot;Cuitlahuac&quot;, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Cuitláhuac's death, [[Cuauhtémoc]] was made the next ''tlatoani''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cha&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
The modern [[municipio (Mexico)|Mexican municipality]] of [[Cuitláhuac, Veracruz]] and the [[Mexico City Metro]] station [[Metro Cuitláhuac]] are named in honor of Cuitláhuac. The [[asteroid]] 2275 Cuitláhuac is also named after this ruler.

There is an Avenue in Mexico City Called Cuitláhuac (Eje 3 Norte) that runs from Avenue Insurgentes to Avenue Mexico-Tacuba and that is part of an inner ring; also many streets in other towns and villages in Mexico are so called.
