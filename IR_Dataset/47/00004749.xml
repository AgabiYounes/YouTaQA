'''Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack''' is a reusable [[putty]]-like [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]] produced by [[Bostik]], commonly used to attach lightweight objects (such as posters or sheets of paper) to walls, doors or other dry surfaces. Traditionally blue, it is also available in other colours. Generic versions of the product are also available from other manufacturers. The spelling now used is without a hyphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bostik.co.uk/diy/product/bostik/Blu-Tack/89|title=Bostik Blu Tack - A re-usable adhesive|last=http://www.ikodesign.co.uk|website=www.bostik.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711102935/http://www.bostik.co.uk/diy/product/bostik/Blu-Tack/89#|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition  is described as a synthetic rubber compound without hazardous properties under normal conditions.  It can be swallowed without harm&lt;ref name=&quot;Bostik FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blutack.com/faq.htm|title=Welcome to Blu Tack.com - FAQ |accessdate=October 14, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418062649/http://www.blutack.com/faq.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is noncarcinogenic.  It is non-soluble and is denser than water.  The material is not flammable, but emits [[carbon dioxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]] when exposed to fire or high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostik.co.uk/sds/download_sds/BOSTIKBLUTACK-English/04413135.pdf|accessdate=2014-12-02|title=Safety Data Sheet Bostik Blu Tack|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509082722/http://www.bostik.co.uk/sds/download_sds/BOSTIKBLUTACK-English/04413135.pdf#|archive-date=2015-05-09|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Bostik was manufacturing around 100 tonnes of Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack weekly at its [[Leicester]] factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward213&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Adventures in Stationery]] |last=Ward |first=James |publisher=Profile Books |year=2015 |isbn=978 1 84668 616 0 |edition=paperback |publication-place=London |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack was originally developed in 1969 as an accidental by-product of an attempt to develop a new sealant using chalk powder, rubber and oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward213-4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Adventures in Stationery]] |last=Ward |first=James |publisher=Profile Books |year=2015 |isbn=978 1 84668 616 0 |edition=paperback |publication-place=London |pages=213–214}} (Statements on the internet suggesting that Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack was invented by somebody called ‘Alan Holloway’ all appear to derive from an unsourced 2007 edit to this page, since removed).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the inventor is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward213-4&quot;/&gt; Originally Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack was white, but consumer research showed fears that children may mistake it for chewing gum, and a blue colouring was added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward213&quot;/&gt;

In the United Kingdom in March 2008, 20,000 numbered packs of pink Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack were made available, to help raise money for Breast Cancer Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/36960/Blu-Tack-goes-pink-for-charity |title=Daily Express &amp;#124; UK News :: Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack goes pink for charity |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 10 pence from each pack going to the charity. The formulation was slightly altered to retain complete consistency with its blue counterpart. Since then, many coloured variations have been made, including red and white, yellow and a green [[Halloween]] pack.

Similar products of various colours are made by many manufacturers, including [[Faber-Castell]]'s &quot;Tack-it&quot;, [[Henkel]]'s &quot;Fun-Tak&quot;, [[UHU]]'s &quot;Poster Putty&quot; and &quot;Sticky Tack&quot;,&quot;Gummy Sticker&quot; [[Pritt]]'s &quot;Sticky Stuff&quot;, [[Bostik]]'s &quot;[[Prestik]]&quot; and [[Elmer's Products, Inc.|Elmer's]] &quot;Poster Tack&quot;. Plasti-Tak by Brooks Manufacturing Company appears to pre-date Blu Tack, with a copyright registration in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trademark.trademarkia.com/plastitak-72198931.html|title=PLASTI-TAK Trademark of BROOKS MANUFACTURING COMPANY Serial Number: 72198931 :: Trademarkia Trademarks|website=trademark.trademarkia.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the product are also sold under the generic names &quot;adhesive putty&quot; and &quot;mounting putty&quot;. The [[generic trademark]] or common name for mounting putty varies by region. It is known as &quot;Patafix&quot; in France, Italy, and Portugal, ''{{lang|is|Kennaratyggjó}}'' (&quot;teacher's chewing gum&quot;) in Iceland, ''{{lang|sv|Häftmassa}}'' (&quot;attachment paste&quot;) or ''{{lang|sv|kludd}}'' in Sweden, and ''{{lang|af|wondergom}}'' in South Africa (an [[Afrikaans]] word, literally translated as &quot;wonder glue&quot;).

== Other uses ==

Like all poster putties, Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack provides an alternative to the artist's traditional [[kneaded eraser]], having a superior grip and plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sibleyfineart.com/tutorial--erasing-pencil-blu-tack.htm|title=ERASING PENCIL with BLU-TACK wall putty at MIKE SIBLEY FINE ART|website=sibleyfineart.com|access-date=2019-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack can be finely shaped and worked into even very small areas. Like kneaded erasers, it can be stretched and kneaded to freshen its working surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BluTack Website |title=How to use Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack |accessdate=2015-02-23 |url=http://www.blutack.com/how-to-use.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215001242/http://www.blutack.com/how-to-use.html |archivedate=2015-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scale model hobbyists use Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack as a masking medium for painting camouflage schemes, as it can be easily molded to any shape and will not react with or lift the underlying paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britmodeller.com/forums/index.php?/topic/61996-how-do-you-do-the-cammo-technique-with-blu-tac/|title=How do you do the cammo technique with Blu-tac?|work=Britmodeller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack is also used for sculpture. In 2007 artist Elizabeth Thompson created a {{convert|200|kg|abbr=on}} sculpture of a house spider using Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack over a wire frame. It took around 4000 packs and was exhibited at [[London Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tulpastudios Elizabeth Thompson+ Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/elizabeth_thompson/2574564991/ |title=Elizabeth Thompson Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack spider &amp;#124; Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists have created works from the material including stop-motion animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=JessKattDesign, conceptart.org |title=My stop motion animations – Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack Dog |url=http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?266320-My-stop-motion-animations-Blu-tack-Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack can be used as a [[Damping (music)|damping agent]] for sound and vibration applications, due to its low amplitude response properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereophile.com/content/sound-surprise-loudspeakerstand-interface|title=The Sound of Surprise (the loudspeaker/stand interface)|work=Stereophile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small amount of Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack can be placed on the head of a screw to hold it onto a screwdriver.&lt;ref name=&quot;BluTack Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=BluTack Website |title=How to use Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack |accessdate=2016-03-03 |url=http://www.blutack.com/how-to-use.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215001242/http://www.blutack.com/how-to-use.html |archivedate=2015-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack can also be used to clean in-ear headphones by gently pressing putty into mesh of headphones.&lt;ref name=&quot;BluTack Website&quot;/&gt;

Blu&amp;nbsp;Tack can be regarded as a comfortable alternative to over-the-counter ear plugs for the attenuation of everyday sound.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-laryngology-and-otology/article/div-classtitleis-blu-tack-as-effective-at-attenuating-sound-as-over-the-counter-ear-plugsdiv/A91A18CF7AF8900B66C1B2799D82C4AD#&lt;/ref&gt;
