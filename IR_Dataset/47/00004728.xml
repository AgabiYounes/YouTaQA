'''''Batman Returns''''' is a 1992 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Denise Di Novi]] and Burton, based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. The sequel to the 1989 film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', it is the second installment of [[Warner Bros.]] [[Batman (1989 film series)|initial ''Batman'' film series]], and stars [[Michael Keaton]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside [[Danny DeVito]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Michael Gough]], [[Pat Hingle]], and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. In ''Batman Returns'', Batman must prevent the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] from killing all of [[Gotham City]]'s firstborn sons, while dealing with [[Catwoman (Batman Returns)|Catwoman]], who seeks vengeance against Max Shreck, a corrupt tycoon who seeks to bring Gotham City under his control.
 
Burton originally did not want to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with [[Sam Hamm]] which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]. [[Wesley Strick]] was later chosen to do an uncredited rewrite shortly before filming. This included normalizing dialogue, fleshing out the Penguin's motivations and master plan and removing scenes due to budget concerns. Strick continued working as the on-set writer through filming. [[Annette Bening]] was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer.

''Batman Returns'' was released on June 19, 1992. It grossed $266.8 million worldwide on a budget of $80 million and received positive reviews. Critics praised its action sequences, performances, [[Danny Elfman]]'s score, effects, and villains, although its dark tone was criticized. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. A sequel, ''[[Batman Forever]]'', was released in 1995, with [[Val Kilmer]] replacing Keaton as Batman.

== Plot ==
In the prologue, Gotham City socialites Tucker and Esther Cobblepot give birth to a deformed baby boy, Oswald. Disgusted by his appearance and wild demeanor, they confine the baby to a cage and ultimately throw him into the sewer, where he is discovered by a family of penguins underneath the abandoned zoo.

Thirty-three years later, millionaire and philanthropist Max Shreck proposes to build a power plant to supply Gotham with energy, though he is opposed by the mayor. During Shreck's speech, Gotham comes under attack by a disgraced former circus troupe, the Red Triangle Gang. Though Batman intervenes and manages to fight the criminals off, Shreck is abducted and taken to the sewer, where he meets the gang's secret leader, Oswald himself, now going by the name &quot;Penguin&quot;. Oswald blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corporate crimes into helping him return to the surface, and he accepts. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, discovers that the power plant is actually meant to drain Gotham of its energy, which will bring the city under Shreck's control. Shreck pushes her out of a window to silence her, but she survives the fall and vows revenge, taking up the mantle of Catwoman.

Oswald makes his presence known by rescuing the mayor's baby from a staged kidnapping attempt, and requests to be allowed into the Hall of Records to find his parents. Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, voices his suspicions about Oswald's true motives, and investigates his background and connection to the Red Triangle Gang, discovering that the troupe had been shut down years ago due to children going missing during their performances and the disappearance of one specific member before interrogation, who Bruce suspects to be Oswald. During a meeting with Shreck to voice his own opposition to the power plant, Bruce meets Selina and the two become attracted to one another. In order to remove his enemies, Shreck pushes for Oswald to run for mayor and discredit the current mayor by having the Red Triangle Gang wreak havoc on the city. Batman intervenes and meets Catwoman as she attempts to sabotage one of Shreck's businesses; she escapes, but is injured and swears revenge on Batman by allying with Oswald, who also plans to kill Batman as part of his own schemes.

As Bruce and Selina begin a romantic relationship, Oswald abducts Gotham's Ice Princess and kills her, framing Batman for the act, as well as causing the Batmobile to rampage throughout Gotham before Batman narrowly manages to regain control and escape the authorities. When Catwoman rejects his advances, Oswald breaks off their partnership and attempts to kill her, but she survives after falling into a greenhouse. During the chase, Batman records Oswald's disparaging remarks about the people of Gotham and later plays them during his next speech, destroying his image and forcing him to return to the sewer, where he renounces his humanity and reveals his plan to abduct and kill all of Gotham's firstborn sons as revenge for what his parents did to him. At a charity ball hosted by Shreck, Bruce and Selina meet and discover each other's secret identities. The Penguin appears and reveals his plan, intending to take Shreck's son Chip with him, but Shreck gives himself up in his son's stead.

Batman foils the kidnappings and heads for the Penguin's lair. The Penguin attempts to have his army of penguins bomb the city and kill everyone in Gotham, though Batman and his butler, Alfred, jam the signal and order the penguins to return to the sewer. Batman arrives and confronts the Penguin. In the ensuing fight, the Penguin falls through a window into the sewer's toxic water. Shreck escapes but is confronted by Catwoman, who intends to kill him. Batman pleads for Selina to stop, unmasking himself in the process. Shreck draws a gun and shoots Bruce, and then shoots Selina multiple times, but she survives and electrocutes herself and Shreck with a stun gun, causing a massive explosion. Bruce, who was wearing body armor, finds Shreck's remains but Selina is nowhere to be found. The Penguin emerges from the water and tries to shoot Bruce from behind, but eventually dies from his injuries and from the toxic sewage, before his penguin family lays his body to rest in the water. In the aftermath, as Alfred drives him home, Bruce sees Selina's silhouette in an alley but only finds her cat as a farewell gift, who he decides to take home with him. The Bat-Signal appears in the sky as Catwoman, who survived, watches.

==Cast==
{{redirect-distinguish|Max Shreck|Max Schreck}}
* [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:                                          The protector of [[Gotham City]] and the Caped Crusader. Bruce struggles with his dual identity as a crime fighter, becoming romantically involved with Selina Kyle, alias Catwoman. Keaton earned $11 million for reprising his role as the Caped Crusader as director [[Tim Burton]] thought that Keaton deserved it. ''Batman Returns'' was Keaton's final film as [[Batman]], as he was subsequently replaced by [[Val Kilmer]] and [[George Clooney]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'', respectively.
* [[Danny DeVito]] as [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin]]:                                    A psychopathic, deformed man born as Oswald Cobblepot who was abandoned by his parents when he was a baby. Raised by penguins of an abandoned zoo, he returns for revenge thirty-three years later as leader of the Red Triangle Circus Gang after being cheated by businessman Max Shreck. DeVito was suggested for the role by his friend [[Jack Nicholson]] after the financial success of [[Batman (1989 film)|the first film]], in which Nicholson played [[Joker (character)|the Joker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2019-11-13|title=Six Things You Didn’t Know About Jack Nicholson|url=https://www.amc.com/talk/2013/05/jack-nicholson-trivia-fun-facts|website=AMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DeVito, &quot;It was four-and-a-half hours of makeup and getting into the costume.

* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Catwoman (Batman Returns)|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:                                       A normal woman who becomes a criminal after being almost killed by her boss Max Shreck, who later decides to try everything to kill her. She is held as a [[femme fatale]] in most of the film. According to Pfeiffer, she felt devastated after [[Annette Bening]] was cast as Catwoman. However, Bening became pregnant, allowing Pfeiffer to get the role. Pfeiffer's $3 million salary was $2 million more than was offered to Bening. To prepare for the role, Pfeiffer attended [[kickboxing]] classes and practised handling a [[whip]] (during which she accidentally cut her teacher's chin).&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodreporter.com&quot; /&gt; [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Meryl Streep]] (who was considered &quot;too old&quot; by Burton),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notstarring.com/actors/streep-meryl|title=Meryl Streep - Trivia|website=www.notstarring.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brooke Shields]] (whom Burton considered &quot;not bankable&quot;), [[Demi Moore]], [[Nicole Kidman]] (who ended up playing Dr. Chase Meridian in ''[[Batman Forever]]''), [[Jodie Foster]], [[Geena Davis]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Lena Olin]], singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Cher]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Jennifer Beals]] were also considered for the role, but they lost out to Pfeiffer.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajiba.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajiba.com/seriously_random_lists/batman-returns-is-25-and-other-yummy-mindhole-blowers.php|title='Batman Returns' Is 25 and Other Yummy Mindhole Blowers|date=March 21, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christopher Walken]] as Max Shreck: A wealthy businessman and industrialist known as &quot;The Santa Claus of Gotham&quot;. He is obsessed with building a power chemical plant in Gotham City, but when both Bruce Wayne and the Mayor of Gotham City deny his idea, he decides to help [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot]] to become the new mayor of Gotham City for his plans. Apart from being the father of Chip Shreck and presumably killing his wife to gain her money, Shreck is also the former employer of Selina Kyle, who wants to kill him following his attempt to kill her.

* [[Michael Gough]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]]: The Wayne family's butler and [[Batman]]'s accomplice, who has helped and raised him since his parents' death. Along with [[Pat Hingle]], Gough was one of the few actors who appeared in all four films of the initial ''Batman'' film series.
* [[Pat Hingle]] as [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner James Gordon]]:                       Commissioner of the Police Department of [[Gotham City]]. Along with [[Michael Gough]], Hingle was one of the few actors who appeared in all four films of the initial ''Batman'' film series.
* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as The Mayor:    The unnamed mayor of [[Gotham City]]. He does not like Max Shreck's idea to build a nuclear power plant in [[Gotham City]]. His son is later kidnapped by the Red Triangle Circus Gang, only to be &quot;saved&quot; by [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]].
* [[Vincent Schiavelli]] as The Organ Grinder:                                            A member of the Red Triangle Circus Gang and [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]]'s right-hand man. He carries an [[organ grinder]] as his main weapon. He survives all three attacks on [[Gotham City]], but is captured and presumably interrogated by [[Batman]] during the Penguin's final attempt to take over Gotham City. Schiavelli had previously co-starred with DeVito in several episodes of the sitcom ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''.
* [[Andrew Bryniarski]] as Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Shreck:                                          Son of Max Shreck and his late wife. Apart from being the heir of Max's business, he is brave enough to do everything he can to defend his father, such as ordering him to flee as he helps other [[Gotham City]] residents to restrain members of the Red Triangle Circus Gang.
* [[Cristi Conaway]] as The Ice Princess: A Christmas-themed beauty queen and model of Gotham City.
* [[Rick Zumwalt]] as The Tattooed Strongman:                                       A member of the Red Triangle Circus Gang. He survives the first attack on [[Gotham City]], but is killed during the second attack by one of his bombs when Batman throws him into a hole before the explosion.

He and his wife abandoned their son by throwing him into Gotham City's park river after realizing that he could be a danger to society after he killed their cat. [[Burgess Meredith]], the actor who played [[Penguin (character)|the Penguin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s ''Batman'' TV series]], was originally asked to play Tucker, but he declined due to his health problems which culminated with his death in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;pajiba.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/remembering-actor-burgess-meredith-passed-19-years-article-1.2784635|title=Remembering actor Burgess Meredith, who passed away 19 years ago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reubens would later reprise his role as the [[Oswald Cobblepot (Gotham)|Penguin]]'s father in the 2016 second season of the television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', though named Elijah Van Dahl and set in a different continuity.
* [[Diane Salinger]] as The Penguin's Mother (Esther Cobblepot):           The mother of Oswald Cobblepot and wife of Tucker Cobblepot.

===Development===
After the success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] was hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at [[Pinewood Studios]]. They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. [[Tim Burton]] originally did not want to direct another film in the franchise. &quot;I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting&quot;, he said in 1989. &quot;Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jones (November 1989). &quot;Batman in Production&quot;, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', pp. 75—88. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton decided to direct ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Meanwhile, [[Sam Hamm]] from the previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script, while [[Bob Kane]] was brought back as a creative consultant.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[Denise Di Novi]], [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Dark Side of the Knight'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Finger]], co-creator of Batman, the Penguin, and Catwoman, was uncredited at the time of the films release and his name was not added to any Batman related media until 2016.&lt;ref name=Fingercredit&gt;{{cite web|title= DC Will Finally Credit Bill Finger As Co-Creator Of Batman |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dc-will-finally-credit-bill-finger-as-co-creator-of-bat-1731947676|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm's script had the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] and [[Catwoman]] going after hidden treasure.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

Burton was impressed with [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]' work on ''[[Heathers]]''; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. Warner Bros. then granted Burton a large amount of creative control. [[Denise Di Novi]] and Burton became the film's producers. The first film's producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] became executive producers, joining [[Benjamin Melniker]] and [[Michael E. Uslan]]. Dissatisfied with the Hamm script, Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;&lt;ref name=beetle&gt;Judy Sloane (August 1995). &quot;Daniel Waters on Writing&quot;, ''Film Review'', pp. 67—69. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt; Waters &quot;came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor's office by the Penguin&quot;, Waters reported. &quot;I wanted to show that the true villains of our world don't necessarily wear costumes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; The subplot of the Penguin running for Mayor came from [[Batman (TV series)|the 1960s TV series]] episodes &quot;Hizzoner the Penguin&quot; and &quot;Dizzoner the Penguin&quot;.&lt;ref name=Mad&gt;Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). &quot;Three Go Mad in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 39—46. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Waters wrote a total of five drafts.&lt;ref name=forever&gt;{{cite book | first= Ken| last= Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | pages =117–122 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Batman on Burton's Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the characterization of Catwoman, Waters explained &quot;Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, &quot;Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; In early scripts Max Shreck was the &quot;golden boy&quot; of the Cobblepot family, whereas The Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother.&lt;ref name=villain&gt;[[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], [[Alex Ross]], ''Batman Returns: Villains'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Max Shreck was also a reference to actor [[Max Schreck]], known for his role as [[Count Orlok]] in ''[[Nosferatu]]''.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;

===Pre-production===
Burton hired [[Wesley Strick]] to do an uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, &quot;When I was hired to write ''Batman Returns'' (''Batman II'' at the time), the big problem of the script was the Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'.&quot;&lt;ref name=stick&gt;{{cite book | first=David| last=Hughes | title =Comic Book Movies | publisher =[[Virgin Books]] | year =2003 | pages =33–46 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6| chapter = Batman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. presented Strick with warming, or freezing [[Gotham City]], a plot point they would later use in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''. Strick gained inspiration from a [[Moses]] parallel that had the Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby.&lt;ref name=stick/&gt; [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin &quot;the most worthless character in the world, especially with [Batman as] the loner of loners&quot;. Robin started out as a juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic.&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; Waters explained, &quot;He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the [[Batmobile]], which I notice they used in the [[Batman Forever|third film]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; [[Marlon Wayans]] was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Nathan| last = Rabin | url = https://www.avclub.com/article/marlon-wayans-13500 | title = Wayans world | work = [[The A.V.

===Filming===
[[File:Batman Returns set.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gotham City]] Square set built inside Studio 16 on Warner Bros. Studios.]]
In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest [[sound stage]]s (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at [[Universal Studios]]) were being prepared for the filming of ''Batman Returns''.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Filming started in June 1991.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on [[Rockefeller Center]]. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by [[Gotham City]] sets.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

[[Animal rights]] groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs. Richard Hill, the [[curator]] of the penguins, explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable.&lt;ref name=Ow/&gt; &quot;On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees&quot;, recalls Hill. &quot;In Hollywood, they were given a refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks.

Warner Bros. devoted a large amount of secrecy for ''Batman Returns''. The [[art department]] was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's [[Working title#Title ruse|fake working title]] ''Dictel'' to go anywhere near the sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Steve| last = Daly | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310819,00.html | title = Sets Appeal: Designing ''Batman Returns'' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Costner]] was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a [[private investigator]] to track down the accomplice.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; $65 million was spent during the production of ''Batman Returns'', while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; The final shot of Catwoman looking at the [[Bat-Signal]] was completed during [[post-production]] and was not part of the [[shooting script]]. After ''Batman Returns'' was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a [[body double]] was chosen.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

===Design and effects===
[[Bo Welch]], Burton's collaborator on ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', replaced [[Anton Furst]] as [[production designer]], since Furst was unable to return for the sequel due to contractual obligations with [[Columbia Pictures]] (as he was working on what would be his final credited work prior to his suicide, ''[[Awakenings]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/when-hell-burst-through-the-pavement-and-grew-anton-furst-conjured-up-batmans-gotham-city-in-england-he-was-a-creator-of-dreams-but-in-hollywood-his-dreams-ended-simon-garfield-reports-1531040.html|title=When hell burst through the pavement and grew: Anton Furst conjured up Batman's Gotham City.

The [[Batsuit]] was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', and the logo was changed to better reflect how it looked in the comics. The new bat-suit also had a zipper for urination and the upper body build did not look like a muscular physique. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it easy for him to get into character. [[J. P.

===Music===
{{main|Batman Returns (soundtrack)}}

[[Danny Elfman]] had great enthusiasm for returning because &quot;I didn't have to prove myself from the first film.

It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average film score.&quot;&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the &quot;scraping&quot; on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, the relationship between the two strained, which — along with further &quot;creative differences&quot; on ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''&lt;ref name=Danny&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp.137-144&lt;/ref&gt; — led Burton to use [[Howard Shore]] to score his next film ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

===Critical response===
Though criticized by some for being too dark and violent, ''Batman Returns'' received mostly positive reviews. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6.73/10. The site's critical consensus reads, &quot;Director Tim Burton's dark, brooding atmosphere, Michael Keaton's work as the tormented hero, and the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin, and Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken make the sequel better than the first.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_returns/ | title = Batman Returns | website = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;CinemaScore&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought that &quot;Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits, all of them rendered with the mixture of horror, sympathy and playfulness that has become this director's hallmark.&quot; She described Michael Keaton as showing &quot;appropriate earnestness&quot;, [[Danny DeVito]] as &quot;conveying verve&quot;, Christopher Walken as &quot;wonderfully debonair&quot;, Michelle Pfeiffer as &quot;captivating... fierce, seductive&quot;, Bo Welch's production design as &quot;dazzling&quot;, Stefan Czapsky's cinematography as &quot;crisp&quot;, and [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]'s screenplay as &quot;sharp.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 | title = Movie Review—Batman Returns |work=The New York Times | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =November 17, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120219175204/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 |archivedate=February 19, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: &quot;Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams.&quot; He praised the performances: &quot;Pfeiffer gives this feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit; she's a classic dazzler... Michael Keaton's manic-depressive hero remains a remarkably rich creation. And Danny DeVito's mutant Penguin—a balloon-bellied ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' with a kingdom of sewer freaks—is as hilariously warped as [[Jack Nicholson]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and even quicker with the quips.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns | title = Batman Returns | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | author = [[Peter Travers]] | date = February 7, 2001 | accessdate =August 14, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104160020/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns |archivedate = November 4, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desson Thomson|Desson Howe]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: &quot;Director Burton not only re-creates his one-of-a-kind atmosphere, he one-ups it, even two-ups it. He's best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds in which his characters reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Phantom of the Opera]]''-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owner's inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a ''Batman'' movie. But ''Returns'' comes closer than ever to [[Bob Kane]]'s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.&quot; He described Walken as &quot;engaging&quot;, DeVito as &quot;exquisite&quot; and Pfeiffer as &quot;deliciously purry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/batmanreturnspg13howe_a07fbb.htm | title = Batman Returns |work=The Washington Post | first = Desson| last = Howe | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that &quot;the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but the result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses.&quot; He praised the contributions of [[Stan Winston]], [[Danny Elfman]], Bo Welch and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that &quot;the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains&quot;, calling DeVito &quot;fascinating&quot; and Pfeiffer &quot;very tasty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901465.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title = Batman Returns |work = Variety | first = Todd| last = McCarthy | date = June 15, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008033852/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901465.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0|archivedate=October 8, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two stars out of four, writing: &quot;I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a ''Batman'' story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and [[film noir]] don't go together; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes.&quot; He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that &quot;the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny.

Batman comic book writer/artist [[Matt Wagner]] was quoted as saying: &quot;I hated how ''Batman Returns'' made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing.

Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by ''Batman Returns'': Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|title=Video Review: Batman Returns|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312091,00.html|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 23, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unproduced spin-off==
{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=&quot;After the traumas of ''Batman Returns'' she has amnesia, and she doesn't really remember why she has all these bullet holes in her body, so she goes to relax in Oasisburg. What [[Gotham City]] is to [[New York City|New York]], Oasisburg is to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]-[[Los Angeles]]-[[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]]. [It's a] resort area in the middle of the desert. It's run by superheroes, and the movie has great fun at making fun at the whole male superhero mythos. Then they end up being not very good at all deep down, and she's got to go back to that whole Catwoman thing.&quot;|source=—Daniel Waters on his script for ''Catwoman''&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt;}}

''Batman Returns'' would be the last film in the Warner Bros. [[Batman (1989 film series)|''Batman'' film series]] that featured Burton and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor. With ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Warner Bros. decided to go in a &quot;lighter&quot; direction to be more [[mainstream]] in the process of a [[family film]]. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Joel Schumacher]], ''The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight: Reinventing a Hero'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; With Warner Bros. moving on development for ''Batman Forever'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] was announced. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in ''Forever'' because of her own spin-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR107881 | title = Dish | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-06-17 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] also returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR109036 | title = Another life at WB for ''Catwoman'' and Burton? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-07-22 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct ''Catwoman'' or an adaptation of &quot;[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR117395 | title = Seagal on the pulpit may be too much for WB | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-01-13 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his ''Catwoman'' script to Warner Bros., the same day ''Batman Forever'' was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, &quot;Turning it in the day ''Batman Forever'' opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. ''Catwoman'' is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Tim Egan | title = Michelle Pfeiffer, Sensuous to Sensible | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]] for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by [[Ashley Judd]]. The film ended up becoming the critically panned ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004), starring [[Halle Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117796285 | title = WB: Judd purr-fect as ''Cat'' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2001-04-02 | accessdate = 2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/ | title = Catwoman | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
