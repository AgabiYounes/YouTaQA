'''Bayonne''' ({{IPA-fr|bajɔn}}; [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]]: ''Baiona'' {{IPA-oc|baˈjunɔ|}}; {{lang-eu|Baiona}} {{IPA-eu|baiona|}}; {{lang-es|Bayona}}) is a city and [[Communes of France|commune]] and one of the two [[Subprefectures in France|sub-prefectures]] of the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]], in the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region of southwestern France.&lt;ref name=Lion/&gt; It is located at the confluence of the [[Nive]] and [[Adour]] rivers in the northern part of the [[cultural region]] of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], as well as the southern part of [[Gascony]] where the Aquitaine basin joins the beginning of the [[Pre-Pyrenees]].

Together with nearby [[Anglet]], [[Biarritz]], [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]], and several smaller communes, Bayonne forms an urban area with 288,359 inhabitants at the 2012 census,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=TER&amp;millesime=2012&amp;typgeo=AU2010&amp;search=036 INSEE Results of Census 2012] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45,855 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper.&lt;ref name=INSEE&gt;[http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/dossier_complet.asp?codgeo=COM-64102 INSEE Complete Dossier – Bayonne 64102] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site on the left bank of the Nive and the Adour was probably occupied before [[ancient times]] as a fortified enclosure was attested in the 1st century at the time when the [[Tarbelli]] occupied the territory. Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman [[Castra|castrum]], a stronghold in [[Novempopulania]] at the end of the 4th century before the city was populated by the [[Vascones]].

In 1023 Bayonne was the capital of [[Labourd]] and, in the 12th century, extended to and beyond the Nive. At that time the first bridge was built over the Adour. The city came under the domination of the English in 1152 through the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]: it became militarily and, above all, commercially important thanks to maritime trade. It was separated from the Viscount of Labourd in 1177 by [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion Heart]]. In 1451 the city was taken by the Crown of France after the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The loss of trade with the English and the silting up of the river as well as the movement of the city towards the north weakened it. The district of Saint-Esprit developed anyway thanks to the arrival of a Jewish population fleeing the [[Spain|Spanish]] expulsions dictated by the [[Alhambra Decree]]. From this community Bayonne gained its reputation for chocolate. The course of the Adour was changed in 1578 under the direction of [[Louis de Foix]] and the river returned to its former mouth, returning business lost to Bayonne for over a hundred years. In the 17th century the city was fortified by [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]]. In 1814 Bayonne and its surroundings were the scene of fighting between the Napoleonic troops and the Spanish-Anglo-Portuguese coalition led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]: the city then underwent its final [[Battle of Bayonne|siege]].

In 1951 the Lacq gas field was discovered whose extracted [[sulphur]] and associated oil are shipped from the port of Bayonne. During the second half of the 20th century many housing estates were built forming new districts on the periphery and the city was extended to form a conurbation with [[Anglet]] and [[Biarritz]]: this agglomeration became the heart of a vast Basque-Landes urban area.

Bayonne was, in 2014, a commune with over 45,000 inhabitants, the heart of the urban area of Bayonne and of the ''Agglomeration Côte Basque-Adour'' which includes [[Anglet]] and [[Biarritz]]. It is an important part of the Basque ''Bayonne-San Sebastián Eurocity'' and it plays the role of economic capital of the Adour basin. Modern industry—metallurgy and chemicals—are established to take advantage of procurement opportunities and sea shipments through the harbour. Business services today represent the largest source of employment. Bayonne is also a cultural capital, a city with strong Basque and Gascon influences and a rich historical past. Its heritage lies in its architecture, the diversity of collections in museums, its gastronomic specialties, and traditional events such as the famous [[Fêtes de Bayonne]].

The inhabitants of the commune are known as ''Bayonnais'' or ''Bayonnaises''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.habitants.fr/pyrenees-atlantiques-64 Inhabitants of Pyrénées-Atlantiques] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Bayonne is located in the south-west of France on the western border between [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and [[Gascony]]. It developed at the confluence of the [[Adour]] and tributary on the left bank, the [[Nive]], 6&amp;nbsp;km from the Atlantic coast. The commune was part of the Basque province of [[Labourd]].

===Geology and relief===
Bayonne occupies a territory characterized by a flat relief to the west and to the north towards the [[Landes forest]], tending to slightly raise towards the south and east. The city has developed at the confluence of the Adour and Nive {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the ocean. The meeting point of the two rivers coincides with a narrowing of the Adour valley. Above this the alluvial plain extends for nearly {{convert|30|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} towards both [[Tercis-les-Bains]] and [[Peyrehorade]], and is characterized by swampy meadows called ''barthes'' which are influenced by floods and high tides.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;In [[Gascony]] and in Basque country alluvial floodplains along a river are called ''barthe'' (from the [[gascon language|gascon]] ''barta'')&lt;/ref&gt; Downstream from this point the river has shaped a large bed in the sand dunes creating a significant bottleneck at the confluence.

The occupation of the hill that dominates this narrowing of the valley developed through a gradual spread across the lowlands by building embankments and the [[aggradation]] from flood soil.&lt;ref group=PH name=p4&gt;p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nive has played a leading role in the development of the Bayonne river system in recent geological time by the formation of alluvial terraces that form the sub-soil of Bayonne beneath the surface accumulations of silt and aeolian sands.&lt;ref group=PH name=p3&gt;p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The drainage network of the western [[Pre-Pyrenees]] evolved mostly from the [[Quaternary]] from south-east to northwest oriented east-west. The Adour was then captured by the gaves and this system, together with the Nive, led to the emergence of a new alignment of the lower Adour and the Adour-Nive confluence. This capture has been dated to the early Quaternary (80,000 years ago).&lt;ref group=PH name=p3/&gt;

Before this capture the Nive had deposited pebbles from the [[Mindel glaciation]] of medium to large sizes that slowed erosion of the hills causing the bottleneck at Bayonne. After the deposit of the lowest alluvial terrace ({{convert|10|to(-)|15|m|ft|abbr=off}} high at Grand Bayonne), the course of the Adour became fixed in its lower reaches.&lt;ref group=PH name=p3/&gt;

Subsequent to these deposits there was a rise in sea level in the [[Holocene]] period (from 15,000 to 5000 years ago) which explains the invasion of the lower valleys with fine sand, peat, and mud with a thickness of more than {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=off}} below the current bed of the Adour and the Nive in Bayonne. These same deposits are spread across the barthes.&lt;ref group=PH name=p4/&gt;

In the late Quaternary the topographic physiognomy we know today was formed—i.e. a set of hills overlooking a swampy lowland. The promontory of [[Bassussarry]]–Marracq ultimately extended to the labourdin foothills, dying out at the Grand Bayonne hill is an example. Similarly, on the right bank of the Nive, the heights of Château-Neuf (Mocoron Hill) met the latest advance of the plateau of Saint-Pierre-d'Irube (height {{convert|30|to(-)|35|m|ft|abbr=off}}).&lt;ref group=PH name=p4/&gt; On the right bank of the Adour the heights of Castelnau (today the citadel) with an altitude of {{convert|35|to(-)|40|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and Fort (today Saint-Esprit) with an altitude of {{convert|20|to(-)|25|m|ft|abbr=off}} rise above the Barthes of the Adour, the Nive, Bourgneuf, Saint-Frédéric, Sainte-Croix, Aritxague, and Pontots.&lt;ref group=PH name=p4/&gt;

The area of the commune is {{convert|2,168|ha|abbr=off}} and its altitude varies between {{convert|0|to(-)|55|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://professionnels.ign.fr/rgc#tab-3 ''Geographic Repertoire of communes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108205314/http://professionnels.ign.fr/rgc#tab-3 |date=8 January 2015 }}, published by the [[Institut géographique national]] {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrography===

The city is traversed by the Adour.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandre&quot;&gt;[http://sandre.eaufrance.fr/app/chainage/courdo/htm/Q---0000.php?cg=Q---0000 Watercourse: Adour River (Q—0000)], [[Sandre]] website, consulted on 25 July 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is part of the [[Natura 2000]] network from its source at [[Bagnères-de-Bigorre]] to its exit to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] after Bayonne, between [[Tarnos]] (Landes) for the right bank and [[Anglet]] (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) for the left bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institution-adour.fr/index.php/natura-2000-ladour.html ''The Adour in the Natura 2000 network''], Institution Adour website, consulted on 23 August 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inpn.mnhn.fr/site/natura2000/FR7200724 Page FR7200724 Natura 2000], National Inventory of Natural heritage website, consulted on 23 August 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the [[Nive]], which converges on the left bank of the Adour after {{convert|79.3|km|mi|1|abbr=off}} of a sometimes tumultuous course, two tributaries join the Adour in Bayonne commune: the ''Ruisseau de Portou'' and the ''Ruisseau du Moulin Esbouc''. Tributaries of the Nive are the ''Ruisseau de Hillans'' and the ''Ruisseau d'Urdaintz'' which both rise in the commune.&lt;ref name=Geo/&gt;

===Climate===
The nearest weather station is that of Biarritz-Anglet.

The climate of Bayonne is relatively similar to that of its neighbour Biarritz, described below, with fairly heavy rainfall; The oceanic climate is due to the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean. The average winter temperature is around 8&amp;nbsp;°C and is around 20&amp;nbsp;°C in summer. The lowest temperature recorded was −12.7&amp;nbsp;°C on 16 January 1985 and the highest 40.6&amp;nbsp;°C on 4 August 2003. Rains on the Basque coast are rarely persistent except during winter storms. They often take the form of intense thunderstorms of short duration.

==Communication and transport==
[[File:Transport interurbain autour de Bayonne 03092014.png|thumb|Public transport around Bayonne: railway lines are black, the intercity bus lines Pyrénées-Atlantiques are green and those of Landes purple. The PTU (perimeter of urban transport, which operates the Chronoplus network is uncharted here) is bounded by a red line.]]
[[File:Bayonne - Voies de communication (2).png|thumb|Means of transport (water, roads, bridges, and railways).]]

===Road communications===
Bayonne is located at the intersection of the [[A63 autoroute]] (Bordeaux-Spain) and the D1 extension of the [[A64 autoroute]] (towards [[Toulouse]]). The city is served by three interchanges—two of them on the A63: exit {{Motorway exit|6}} (Bayonne Nord) serves the northern districts of Bayonne but also allows quick access to the centre while exit {{Motorway exit|5}} (Bayonne Sud) provides access to the south and also serves [[Anglet]]. The third exit is the D1 / A64 via the Mousserolles interchange (exit {{Motorway exit|1}} Bayonne Mousserolles) which links the district of the same name and also serves the neighbouring communes of [[Mouguerre]] and [[Saint-Pierre-d'Irube]].

Bayonne was traversed by [[Route nationale 10]] connecting [[Paris]] to [[Hendaye]] but this is now downgraded to a departmental road D810. [[Route nationale]] 117, linking Bayonne to Toulouse has been downgraded to departmental road D817.

===Bridges===
[[File:Bayonne Adour.jpg|thumb|The Saint-Esprit bridge over the [[Adour]].]]

There are several bridges over both the Nive and the Adour linking the various districts.

Coming from upstream on the Adour there is the A63 bridge, then the Saint-Frédéric bridge which carries the D 810, then the railway bridge that replaced the old Eiffel iron bridge, the Saint-Esprit bridge, and finally the Grenet bridge. The Saint-Esprit bridge connects the Saint-Esprit district to the Amiral-Bergeret dock just upstream of the confluence with the river Nive. In 1845 the old bridge, originally made ??of wood, was rebuilt in masonry with seven arches supporting a deck {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide.&lt;ref group=FL name=p118&gt;p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It was then called the Nemours Bridge in honour of [[Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours|Louis of Orleans]], sixth Duke of Nemours, who laid the first stone. The bridge was finally called Saint-Esprit. Until 1868 the bridge had a moving span near the left bank. It was expanded in 1912 to facilitate the movement of horse-drawn [[carriage]]s and motor vehicles.&lt;ref group=FL name=p118/&gt;

On the Nive coming from upstream to downstream there is the A63 bridge then the ''Pont Blanc'' (White bridge)&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The successor to the iron railway bridge ''Raccordement d'Aïtachouria'', the Pont Blanc has been used since 2003 to link the ''Floride Sports Field'' to the wilderness area on the Ansot plain.&lt;/ref&gt; railway bridge, and then D810 bridge, the Génie bridge (or ''Pont Millitaire''), the Pannecau bridge, the Marengo bridge&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Marengo masonry bridge was under [[Napoleon III]].&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the covered markets, and the Mayou Bridge&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Mayou bridge, formerly called ''Major'' or ''Maior'', was rebuilt in stone in 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pannecau bridge was long named ''Bertaco bridge'' and was rebuilt in masonry under [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref group=FL name=p25&gt;p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; According to François Lafitte Houssat, &quot;[...] a municipal ordinance of 1327 provided for the imprisonment of any quarrellsome woman of bad character in an iron cage dropped into the waters of the Nive River from the bridge. The practice lasted until 1780 [...]&quot;&lt;ref group=FL name=p25/&gt; This punishment bore the evocative name of ''cubainhade''.&lt;ref group=DN name=p20&gt;p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cycling network===
The commune is traversed by the ''[[EV1 The Atlantic Coast Route|Vélodyssée]]''. [[Cycling infrastructure|Bicycle paths]] are located along the left bank of the Adour, a large part of the left bank of the Nive, and along various axes of the city where there are some bicycle lanes. The city offers free bicycles on loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayonne.fr/vie-quotidienne/se-deplacer/393-le-velo-en-ville.html ''The bicycle in town – City of Bayonne''], Bayonne official website, consulted on 6 October 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the lines of the ''Chronoplus'' bus network operated by the ''Transdev agglomeration of Bayonne'' link Bayonne to other communes in the urban transport perimeter: [[Anglet]], [[Biarritz]], [[Bidart]], [[Boucau]], [[Saint-Pierre-d'Irube]] and [[Tarnos]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The A1, A2, B, C, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14 and N lines (as at 9 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronoplus.eu/ftp/Plan_reseau_chronoplus.pdf ''Chronoplus Network Map''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203142/http://www.chronoplus.eu/ftp/Plan_reseau_chronoplus.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}, consulted on 25 July 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bayonne free shuttle Bayonne serves the city centre (Grand and Petit Bayonne) by connecting several parking stations; other free shuttles perform other short trips within the commune.

====Interurban networks====
Bayonne is connected to many cities in the western half of the department such as [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]] by the Pyrenees-Atlantiques long distance coach network of ''Transport 64'' managed by the General Council. Since the network restructuring in the summer of 2013, the lines converge on Bayonne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transports64.fr/IMG/pdf/cg64-tiuplanreseau0714.pdf Network map] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726114958/http://www.transports64.fr/IMG/pdf/cg64-tiuplanreseau0714.pdf |date=26 July 2014 }}, Transports 64, consulted on 11 September 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayonne is also served by services from the [[Landes (department)|Landes]] departmental network, ''XL'R''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090912033123/http://www.rdtl.fr/index.php?niveau_id=65&amp;niveau=2 The RDTL network], consulted on 11 September 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rail transport====
The [[Gare de Bayonne]] is located in the Saint-Esprit district and is an important station on the [[Bordeaux-Irun railway]]. It is also the terminus of lines leading from [[Toulouse]] to Bayonne and from Bayonne to [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]]. It is served by [[TGV]], [[Intercités]], [[Lunéa]], and [[TER Aquitaine]] trains (to [[Hendaye]], [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], [[Dax, Landes|Dax]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], and [[Tarbes]]).

====Air transport====
Bayonne is served by the [[Biarritz – Anglet – Bayonne Airport]] ([[IATA code]]: BIQ • [[ICAO airport code|ICAO code]]: LFBZ), located on the communal territories of Anglet and Biarritz.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Only a quarter of the area, the west end of the runway, is located in Biarritz commune.&lt;/ref&gt; The airport was returned to service in 1954 after repair of damage from bombing during the [[Second World War]].

Airport management is carried out by the joint association for the development and operation of the airport of Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne, which includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bayonne Basque Country, the agglomeration of Côte Basque-Adour, the departments of Pyrénées-Atlantiques and Landes, and the commune of [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]]. The airport of Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne had nearly 1.1 million passengers in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudouest.fr/2013/01/10/un-vol-biarritz-paris-a-50-eur-c-est-possible-929290-4037.php ''Record passenger numbers in 2013 for the Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne airport''], Sud-Ouest, 1 October 2013, consulted on 22 August 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has regular connections to [[Paris-Orly]], [[Paris-CDG]], [[Lyon]], [[Nice]], [[Geneva]], and [[London Stansted]] and from March to October 2014 had connections with: [[Aéroport de Marseille Provence|Marseille]], [[Aéroport de Strasbourg-Entzheim|Strasbourg]], [[Aéroport de Lille-Lesquin|Lille]], [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]], [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm-Skavsta]], [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm-Arlanda]], [[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]], [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]], [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo]], and [[Helsinki Airport|Helsinki]].

==Toponymy==

===Etymology===
While the modern [[Basque language|Basque]] spelling is ''Baiona'' and the same in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Toponimia (leku-izenak)&quot;&gt;[http://www.euskaltzaindia.net/index.php?option=com_eoda&amp;view=toponimia&amp;Itemid=471&amp;nonkodea=4.1&amp;lang=fr ''Euskaltzaindia''], Academy of the Basque language, consulted on 5 August 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the name ''Bayonne'' poses a number of problems both historical and linguistic which have still not been clarified&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iglesias&quot;&gt;Hector Iglesias, [http://www.ikerketak.com/louvrage-dhector-iglesias-au-format-pdf.php ''Names of Places and people in Bayonne, Anglet and Biarritz in the 18th century''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132340/http://www.ikerketak.com/louvrage-dhector-iglesias-au-format-pdf.php |date=2 April 2015 }}, éditions Elkar, Donostia-Saint-Sébastien, 2000, consulted on 25 July 2014, {{ISBN|2-913156-32-0}}, p. 34 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different interpretations of its meaning.

The termination ''-onne'' in ''Bayonne'' can come from many in hydronyms ''-onne'' or toponyms derived from that. In certain cases the element ''-onne'' follows an Indo-European theme: ''*ud-r/n'' (Greek ''húdōr'' giving hydro, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''watt'' meaning &quot;water&quot;) hence ''*udnā'' meaning &quot;water&quot; giving ''unna'' then ''onno'' in the glossary of [[Vienne]].&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionary of the Gallic language. A linguistic approach to continental old Celtic'', éditions Errance, Paris, 2003, {{ISBN|2-87772-237-6}}, p. 48 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Unna'' therefore would refer to the Adour. This toponymic type evoking a river traversing a locality is common. The appellative ''unna'' seems to be found in the name of the [[Garonne]] (''Garunna'' 1st century; ''Garonna'' 4th century). However it is possible to see a pre-Celtic suffix ''-ona'' in the name of the [[Charente (river)|Charente]] (''Karantona'' in 875) or the [[Charentonne]] (''Carentona'' in 1050).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rsNpi7IVulEC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;ots=dQLqOkg7Hb&amp;dq=%22carentona%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carentona%22&amp;f=false ''General Toponymy of France''], Ernest Nègre, 28 July 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It could also be an augmentative [[Gascon language|Gascon]] from the original [[Latin]] radical ''Baia-'' with the suffix ''-ona'' in the sense of &quot;vast expanse of water&quot; or a name derived from the Basque ''bai'' meaning &quot;river&quot; and ''ona'' meaning &quot;good&quot;, hence &quot;good river&quot;.

The proposal by Eugene Goyheneche repeated by Manex Goyhenetche and supported by Jean-Baptiste Orpustan is ''bai una'', &quot;the place of the river&quot; or ''bai ona'' &quot;hill by the river&quot;—''Ibai'' means &quot;river&quot; in Basque and ''muinoa'' means &quot;hill&quot;.

&quot;It has perhaps been lost from sight that many urban place names in France, from north to south, came from the element ''Bay-'' or ''Bayon-'' such as: [[Bayons]], [[Bayonville]], [[Bayonvillers]] and pose the unusual problem of whether they are Basque or Gascon&quot; adds Pierre Hourmat.&lt;ref group=PiH name=p3&gt;p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most ancient form of Bayonne: ''Baiona'', clearly indicates a feminine or a theme of ''-a'' whereas this is not the case for Béon or Bayon. In addition, the ''Bayon-'' in Bayonville or Bayonvillers in northern France is clearly the personal Germanic name ''Baio''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbpVLN1tRNoC&amp;lpg=PA926&amp;ots=fgbNelToQM&amp;dq=Bayonville%20ernest%20n7gre&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA926#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''General Toponymy of France''], Ernest Nègre, 28 July 2014 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old attestations===
The names of the Basque province of [[Labourd]] and the locality of Bayonne have been attested from an early period with the place name ''Bayonne'' appearing in the Latin form ''Lapurdum'' after a period during which the two names could in turn designate a Viscounty or Bishopric.&lt;ref name=Orpustan&gt;Jean-Baptiste Orpustan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ie-LeqGXat8C ''New Basque Toponymy''], Presses universitaires de Bordeaux, 2006, {{ISBN|2 86781 396 4}} p. 19, 26 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Labourd'' and ''Bayonne'' were synonymous and used interchangeably until the 12th century before being differentiated: Labord for the province and Bayonne for the city.&lt;ref name=Orpustan/&gt; The attribution of Bayonne as ''Civitas Boatium'', a place mentioned in the [[Antonine Itinerary]] and by Paul Raymond in his 1863 dictionary, has been abandoned. The city of the ''Boïates'' may possibly be [[La Teste-de-Buch]] but is certainly not Bayonne.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Achille Luchaire, ''Annals of the Faculty of Letters of Bordeaux (1879)'', note 12 and 24, regarding the ''Notitia Provinciarum'' mentioning the ''civitas Boatium'' (var. ''Boasium, Bohatium, Boaccensium, Boacium'') &quot;whose identification with Bayonne, proposed by Scaliger and Valois, is absolutely inadmissible (see Desjardins, Gaule rom., II, 874, note 1)&quot; {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Prehistory===
In the absence of accurate objective data there is some credence to the probable existence of a fishing village on the site in a period prior to [[ancient times]]. Numerous traces of human occupation have been found in the Bayonne region from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] especially in the discoveries at [[Saint-Pierre-d'Irube]], a neighbouring locality.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Neanderthal Stone tools (from 80,000 to 45,000 BC corresponding to the [[Mousterian]] period, the [[Riss Glaciations]], and [[Würm II]])&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the presence of a mound about {{convert|14|m|ft|abbr=off}} high has been detected in the current Cathedral Quarter overlooking the Nive which formed a natural protection and a usable port on the left bank of the Nive. At the time the mound was surrounded north and west by the Adour swamps. At its foot lies the famous &quot;Bayonne Sea&quot;—the junction of the two rivers—which may have been about {{convert|1,200|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide between Saint-Esprit and the Grand Bayonne and totally covered the current location of Bourg-Neuf (in the district of Petit Bayonne). To the south the last bend of the Nive widens near the Saint-Léon hills.&lt;ref&gt;Association Lauburu, ''The Cathedral in the heart of the city'', 1992 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Eugène Goyheneche, ''Bayonne and the Bayonnaise Region from the 12th to the 15th century'', Thesis by the E.N.C., 1949 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the narrowing of the Adour valley allows easier crossing than anywhere else along the entire length of the estuary.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Laborde. ''History of Bayonne'', 1991 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, the strategic importance of this height was so obvious it must be presumed that it has always been inhabited.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Ancient times===
[[File:Aquitani tribes map-fr.svg|thumb|Map of [[Novempopulania]] indicating the position of the [[Tarbelli]] territory north-west of the Pyrenees.]]

The oldest documented human occupation site is located on a hill overlooking the Nive and its confluence with the Adour.&lt;ref group=&quot;PiH&quot; name=&quot;p3&quot; /&gt;

In the 1st century AD, during the Roman occupation, Bayonne already seems to have been of some importance since the Romans surrounded the city with a wall to keep out the [[Tarbelli]], [[Aquitani]], or the [[proto-Basque]] who then occupied a territory that extended south of modern-day [[Landes (department)|Landes]], to the modern French Basque country, the [[Chalosse]], the valleys of the [[Adour]], the mountain streams of [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques]], and to the [[Gave d'Oloron]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Athanase Walckenaer, ''Ancient Historical Geography and comparison of the Cisalpine and Transalpine Gauls, followed by a geographical analysis of ancient routes and accompanied by a nine map Atlas'', Vol. 1, P. Dufart, 1839, 1085 pages {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological discoveries of October and November 1995 provided a shred of evidence to support this projection. In the four layers of sub-soil along the foundation of the Gothic cathedral (in the &quot;apse of the cathedral&quot; area) a 2-metre depth was found of old objects from the end of the 1st century—in particular sigillated Gallic ceramics from [[Montans]] imitating Italian styles, thin-walled bowls, and fragments of [[amphorae]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Sigillata ceramics of red brick colour, the resulting relief decoration is decorated before firing by stamping&lt;/ref&gt; In the &quot;southern sector&quot; near the cloister door there were objects from the second half of the 1st century as well as coins from the first half of the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Week in Basque Country'', M. Esteban, March 1996 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very high probability of human presence, not solely military, seems to provisionally confirm the occupation of the site at least around the 3rd century.

A Roman [[Castra|castrum]] dating to the end of the 4th century has been proven as a fortified place of [[Novempopulania]]. Named ''Lapurdum'', the name became the name of the province of ''Labourd''.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The ''Notitia Dignitatum imperii Romani'', dating from 340 to 420 AD, mentions the seat of the tribune of the cohort of Novempopulania in these terms: &quot;In provincia Novempopulana tribunus cohortis Novempopulanae Lapurdo&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Goyheneche the name ''Baiona'' designated the city, the port, and the cathedral while that of ''Lapurdum'' was only a territorial designation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/38/73/91/PDF/origine_dialectes_definitiboa.pdf ''On the presumed origin of the division of the Basque language''], Hector Iglesias, consulted on 5 August 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This Roman settlement was strategic as it allowed the monitoring of the trans-Pyrenean roads and of local people rebellious to the Roman power. The construction covered 6 to 10 hectares according to several authors.&lt;ref&gt;Renée Mussot-Goulard, ''The Gascons'', Atlantica, 2001 {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Gérard Coulon, ''The Gallo-Romains: life, work, beliefs, diversions—54 BC – 486 AD'', Paris, 2006, Errance, Hespérides collection, {{ISBN|2-87772-331-3}}, p. 21 {{in lang|fr}}, retains the number 10 hectares.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;According to Eugène Goyheneche in ''Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre'', Société nouvelle d’éditions régionales et de diffusion, Pau, 1979, BnF FRBNF34647711, the old Roman wall which is still visible in parts was in the shape of a polygon of {{convert|1,125|m|ft|abbr=off}} perimeter in an area of {{convert|6|to(-)|9|ha|abbr=off}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The geographical location of the locality at the crossroads of a river system oriented from east to west and the road network connecting Europe to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from north to south predisposed the site to the double role of fortress and port.&lt;ref group=EG name=p149&gt;p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The city, after being Roman, alternated between the [[Vascones]] and the English for three centuries from the 12th to the 15th century.

The Romans left the city in the 4th century and the Basques, who had always been present, dominated the former Novempopulania province between the [[Garonne]], the Ocean, and the Pyrénées. Novempopulania was renamed [[Vasconia]] and then Gascony after a Germanic deformation (resulting from the [[Visigoth]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] invasions). Basquisation of the plains region was too weak against the advance of romanization. From the mixture between the Basque and Latin language [[Gascon language|Gascon]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Allières, ''The Basques'', Paris, Presses universitaires de France,?March 2003 (1st ed. 1997), 127 p. {{ISBN|213053144X}} and {{ISBN|9782130531449}}, {{OCLC|77097933}}. {{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation on Bayonne for the period from the [[High Middle Ages]] are virtually nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;group=Note&gt;Peter Hourmat, (''History of Bayonne from its origins to the French Revolution of 1789'', Society of Sciences Letters Arts of Bayonne,1986, P. 27 to 35 {{in lang|fr}})deplores the lack of sources for the period 5th century to the 10th century: &quot;If the existence of a major military site is attested by the remains of the tower walls of a castrum, the headquarters or refuge of a cohort in the last days of the Roman Empire, in the half a millennium that followed the collapse of the latter plunges us into an almost total ignorance of who occupied the area of the castrum and the identity of the people. A heavy silence covers the fate of Lapurdum and documents at our disposal for five centuries can be counted on the fingers of one hand and these lead to different or contradictory interpretations ... . So this story becomes a long series of question marks, for example that of Novempopulania&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Treaty of Andelot]] signed in 587 between [[Guntram]], king of Burgundy, and [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], mentions Lapurdo; it documents the return to Brunhilda of several cities including Aire, Couserans and ''Lapurdo'', each &quot;with its territories&quot; (&quot;cum terminibus&quot;). Manex Goyhenetche indicates that in the 6th century, the term ''civitas'' was used to designate a fortress. &quot;The [[Franks|Frankish]] dynasties of Austrasia and Neustria by the Treaty of Andelot, consolidated their grip on part of the former territory of the ''Nine Peoples'' [...] In the 4th century Lapurdum continued to exist and by the end of the 6th century returned to its function as a fortress. Lapurdum controlled firstly the routes leading to the Pyrenean passes and secondly the [[cabotage]] routes of the Frankish fleets from [[Bordeaux]] to [[Asturias]] &quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manex Goyhenetche, ''General History of Basque country, Prehistory, Roman era, Middle Ages'', Vol. 1, Elkarlanean, Donostia and Bayonne, 1998, 492 pages, {{ISBN|2-913156-20-7}}, BnF FRBNF37031711, p. 134 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of two Norman intrusions: one questionable in 844 and a second attested in 892.&lt;ref group=EG name=p152&gt;p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Labourd was created in 1023 Bayonne was the capital and the Viscount resided there.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Vicount resided in Chatelet (''lou Castet''), next to the entry to the current ''Cinq Cantons'' (Five Cantons) which was the Roman gate leading to the port (source: Eugene Goyheneche, ''The Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre'', New Society regional editions and distribution, Pau, 1979 (Record BNF FRBNF34647711).&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Bayonne proper started in 1056 when Raymond II the Younger, Bishop of Bazas, had the mission to build the Church of Bayonne&lt;ref group=Note&gt;It can be deduced that it existed prior to that date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=EG name=&quot;p152&quot;/&gt;

The construction was under the authority of Raymond III of Martres, [[Bishop of Bayonne]] from 1122 to 1125, combined with Viscount Bertrand for the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral, the rear of which can still be seen today, and the first wooden bridge across the Adour extending the Mayou bridge over the Nive, which inaugurated the heyday of Bayonne.&lt;ref group=EG name=p152/&gt; From 1120 new districts were created under population pressure. The development of areas between the old Roman city of Grand Bayonne and the Nive also developed during this period, then between the Nive and the Adour at the place that became Petit Bayonne. A [[Jacobin]] Convent was located there in 1225 then that of the [[Cordeliers]] in 1247.&lt;ref group=EG name=p152/&gt; Construction of and modifications to the defences of the city also developed to protect the new districts.&lt;ref group=PiH name=p9&gt;p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1130 the King of Aragon [[Alfonso the Battler]] besieged the city without success. Bayonne came under English rule when [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] married [[Henry II of England]] in 1152.&lt;ref group=PiH name=p6&gt;p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This alliance gave Bayonne many commercial privileges. The Bayonnaises became carriers of Bordeaux wines and other south-western products like resin, ham, and [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] to England.&lt;ref group=EG name=p171&gt;p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayonne was then an important military base. In 1177 King Richard separated the Viscounty of Labourd whose capital then became [[Ustaritz]]. Like many cities at the time, in 1215 Bayonne obtained the award of a municipal charter and was emancipated from feudal powers.&lt;ref&gt;On 12 April 1215 [[John, King of England]], granted Bayonne a legal personality that would last throughout the Middle Ages and, to some extent, until the [[French Revolution]]. The form of the charter resembled that of [[La Rochelle]]. According to Eugene Goyheneche, &quot;the city is governed by the &quot;Hundred Peers&quot; who were actually a mayor, twelve deputies, twelve councilors, and seventy-five peers who were co-opted and proposed each year by the mayor for the king's choice. The mayor was head of the administrative, judiciary, and military: he had custody of the keys to the city and some mayors were admirals in the bayonnaise fleet. The king was represented by a marshal&quot; (source: Eugene Goyheneche, The Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre, Societe new regional editions and distribution, Pau,1979 (Record BNF FRBNF34647711) {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The official publication in 1273 of a [[Coutume]] unique to the city, remained in force for five centuries until the separation of Bayonne from Labourd.&lt;ref group=EG name=p160&gt;p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=Note&gt;Relations with Labourd were often difficult and caused many bloody conflicts. The most famous of them took place in 1343 when the mayor of Bayonne, Pé de Poyane, killed five labourdin nobles: an episode which, according to Eugene Goyheneche, had its origin in a fictional story of ''On the Proudines bridge'' at [[Villefranque, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Villefranque]], retold by [[Augustine Chaho]] and [[Hippolyte Taine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayonnaise industry at that time was dominated by shipbuilding: wood ([[oak]], [[beech]], [[chestnut]] from the Pyrenees, and [[pine]] from [[Landes forest|Landes]]) being overabundant.&lt;ref group=EG name=p162&gt;p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also maritime activity in providing crews for [[whaling]], commercial marine or, and it was often so at a time when it was easy to turn any merchant ship into a warship, the English [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref group=EG name=p163&gt;p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=Note&gt;For example a Bayonnais fleet participated in the [[Siege of Calais (1346)|Siege of Calais]] led by the English in 1346 which consisted of 15 vessels and 439 men (source: Eugene Goyheneche, The Basque Country: Soule, Labourd, Lower Navarre, Society new regional editions and distribution, Pau,1979 (Record BNF FRBNF34647711), p. 163. {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean de Dunois]] – a former companion at arms of [[Joan of Arc]]—captured the city on 20 August 1451 and annexed it to the Crown &quot;without making too many victims&quot;, but at the cost of a war indemnity of 40,000 gold [[Écu]]s payable in a year,&lt;ref group=PH name=p159&gt;p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;—thanks to the opportunism of the bishop who claimed to have seen &quot;a large white cross surmounted by a crown which turns into a fleur-de-lis in the sky&quot; to dissuade Bayonne from fighting against the royal troops.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The siege lasted nine days from 12 to 20 August 1451 according to Pierre Hourmat, ''History of Bayonne origins to the French Revolution of 1789'', Society of Arts Science &amp; Arts of Bayonne,1986, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=PH name=p142&gt;p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city continued to be fortified by the kings of France to protect it from danger from the Spanish border. In 1454 [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] created a separate judicial district: the ''[[Seneschal]] of Lannes''&lt;ref&gt;Léon Cadier, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140716001642/http://1886.u-bordeaux3.fr/items/show/9538 '' Seneschal of Lannes under Charles VII, royal administration and provincials states''], A.

Over time, the &quot;Seneschal of the Sword&quot; which was at Dax lost any role other than protocol and Bayonne, along with Dax and Saint-Sever, became the de facto seat of a separate Seneschal under the authority of a &quot;lieutenant-general of the Seneschal&quot;.&lt;ref group=PH name=p160&gt;p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1462 King [[Louis XI]] authorized the holding of two annual fairs&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Two annual fairs: one on the first day of Lent and the other 1 August: &quot;[...] grant them free fairs in perpetuity of all Aydes, imposicions, impostz and any other subsidies qualxconques, which one will be held the first day of karesme and the other on the first day of August [...]&quot; as [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-ZZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA469 letters patent of Louis XI] established at [[Montferrand, Puy-de-Dôme|Montferrand]] in May 1462.&lt;/ref&gt; by letters patent after signing the Treaty of Bayonne after which it was confirmed by the coutoumes of the inhabitants in July 1472 following the death of [[Charles de Valois, Duke de Berry]], the king's brother.&lt;ref group=PH name=p164&gt;p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the [[Spanish Inquisition]] raged in the Iberian Peninsula [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] fled Spain and also later, Portugal, then settled in Southern France, including in [[Saint-Esprit (Pyrénées-Atlantiques)]], a northern district of Bayonne located along the northern bank of the [[Adour]] river. They brought with them [[chocolate]] and the recipe for its preparation.&lt;ref group=DN name=p27&gt;p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; . In 1750, the Jewish population in [[Saint-Esprit (Pyrénées-Atlantiques)]] is estimated to have reached about 3,500 people.

The golden age of the city ended in the 15th century with the loss of trade with England and the silting of the port of Bayonne created by the movement of the course of the Adour to the north.&lt;ref group=EG name=p187&gt;p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 16th century [[Labourd]] suffered the emergence of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].

On 11 April 1518 the plague raged in [[Saint-Jean-de-Luz]] and the city of Bayonne &quot;inhibited and prohibited for all peasants and city inhabitants and other foreigners to maintain relationships at the location and Parish of Saint-Jean-de-Luz where people have died of the plague&quot;.

In 1523 Marshal [[Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec]] resisted the Spaniards under [[Philibert of Chalon]] in the service of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] and lifted the siege of Bayonne.&lt;ref group=PiH name=p11&gt;p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at Château-Vieux that the ransom demand for the release of Francis I, taken prisoner after his defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]], was gathered.&lt;ref group=PiH name=p11/&gt; &lt;ref group=Note&gt;Francis I was replaced as a captive by his two eldest sons: [[Francis III, Duke of Brittany]], and [[Henry II of France]] who were finally released in 1530 after payment of the ransom.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meeting in 1565 between [[Catherine de Medici]] and the envoy of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]: the Duke of Alba, is known as the ''Interview of Bayonne''. At the time that [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]] tore each other apart in parts of the kingdom of France, Bayonne seemed relatively untouched by these troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Hiribarren, ''Bayonne at the beginning of the [[Wars of Religion]]'', Revue d’histoire de Bayonne, du Pays basque et du Bas-Adour, Vol. 159, 2004, p. 95–122 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An iron fist from the city leaders did not appear to be unknown.

In the 16th century the king's engineers, under the direction of Louis de Foix, were dispatched to rearrange the course of the Adour by creating an estuary to maintain the river bed. The river discharged in the right place to the Ocean on 28 October 1578.}&lt;ref group=PH name=p214&gt;p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; The port of Bayonne then attained a greater level of activity.

From 1611 to 1612 the college Principal of Bayonne was a man of 26 years old with a future: [[Cornelius Jansen]] known as ''Jansénius'', the future [[Bishop of Ypres]]. Bayonne became the birthplace of [[Jansenism]], an austere science which strongly disrupted the monarchy of [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Hourmat, Bulletin SSLAB, Collection No. 157, ''The City of Bayonne Library'', p. 257 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Hourmat, Bulletin SSLAB, Collection No. 158, ''The City of Bayonne Library'', p. 158 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sporadic conflicts that troubled the French countryside from the mid 17th century, Bayonne peasants were short of powder and projectiles.

===French Revolution and Empire===
Activity in Bayonne peaked in the 18th century.

In 1808 at the [[Castle of Marracq|Château of Marracq]] the act of abdication of the Spanish king [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] in favour of [[Napoleon]] was signed under the &quot;friendly pressure&quot; of the Emperor.

Also in 1808 the French Empire imposed on the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] the Convention of Bayonne to buy from France the debts owed to it by [[Prussia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MagocsiSedlar1974-49&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Robert Magocsi|author2=Jean W.

In 1854 the railway arrived from Paris bringing many tourists eager to enjoy the beaches of [[Biarritz]]. Bayonne turned instead to the [[steel]] industry with the forges of the Adour.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The Forges of the Adour were actually located in the commune of [[Boucau]] on the right bank of the river.&lt;/ref&gt; The Port took on an industrial look but its slow decline seemed inexorable in the 19th century. The discovery of the Lacq gas field restored a certain dynamism.

The Treaty of Bayonne was concluded on 2 December 1856. It overcame the disputes in fixing the Franco-Spanish border in the area extending from the mouth of the [[Bidassoa]] to the border between [[Navarre]] and [[Aragon]].

The city built three light railway lines to connect to Biarritz at the beginning of the 20th century. The most direct line, that of the ''Tramway Bayonne-Lycée–Biarritz'' was operated from 1888 to 1948. In addition a line further north served Anglet, operated by the ''Chemin de fer Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz'' company from 1877 to 1953. Finally a line following the Adour to its mouth and to the Atlantic Ocean by the bar in Anglet, was operated by ''VFDM réseau basque'' from 1919 to 1948.

On the morning of 23 December 1933, sub-prefect Anthelme received Gustave Tissier, the director of the ''Crédit Municipal de Bayonne''. He responded well, with some astonishment, to his persistent interview. It did not surprise him to see the man unpacking what became the scam of the century.

&quot;Tissier, director of the ''Crédit Municipal'', was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of forgery and misappropriation of public funds. He had issued thousands of false bonds in the name of ''Crédit Municipal'' [...]&quot;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;It was in these terms that the newspaper ''Le Courrier de Bayonne'' recounted the event a few days later.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
In 2012 the commune had 45,855 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;At the beginning of the 21st century, the methods of identification have been modified by [https://web.archive.org/web/20160306074946/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100 Law No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306074946/https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100 |date=6 March 2016 }}, the so-called &quot;law of local democracy&quot; and in particular Title V &quot;census operations&quot; allows, after a transitional period running from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For communes with a population greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is conducted annually and the entire territory of these communes is taken into account at the end of the period of five years. The first &quot;legal population&quot; after 1999 under this new law came into force on 1 January 2009 and was based on the census of 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the ancient road used by pilgrims descending to Bayonne then either along the coast on the ''Way of Soulac'' or because they landed there from England, for example, to join the [[French Way]] as soon as possible in [[Pamplona]]. The ''Way of Bayonne'' joins the French Way further downstream at [[Burgos]].

The Protestant church is located at the corner of Rue Albert-I st and Rue du Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eglise-protestante-unie.fr/Lieux-Communs/Temple-de-Bayonne/(language)/fre-FR The Temple of Bayonne], Reformed Church consulted on 29 July 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A gospel church is located in the Saint-Esprit districtit where there is also a church belonging to the [[Gypsy]] Evangelical Church of the Protestant Federation of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eglises.org/france/64/ List of Evangelical churches in Pyrénées-Atlantiques], consulted on 29 July 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following comments apply to the two previous tables:&lt;ref group=Note&gt;These remarks are not the result of a statistical study of the data presented; they are only indicative.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the bulk of economic activity is provided by companies in the tertiary sector;
*Agriculture is almost non-existent Note 54;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Part of the commune is part of the town is in the [[appellation d'origine controlee]] (AOC) zone of [[Ossau-Iraty]] but there were no producers in 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*less than 5% of the activity is from the industrial sector which remains focused on establishments of less than 50 employees, as also are construction-related activities;
*public administration, education, health and social services are activities of over 20% of establishments, confirming the importance of Bayonne as an administrative centre.

In 2013 549 new establishments were created in Bayonne including 406 [[Sole proprietorship]]s.&lt;ref group=&quot;Insee&quot;&gt;''DEN T1 – Creation of Enterprises by sector of activity in 2011''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=&quot;Insee&quot;&gt;''DEN T2 – Creation of individual entreprises by sector of activity in 2011''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workshops and Industry===
Bayonne has few such industries, as indicated in the previous tables. There is ''Plastitube'' specializing in plastic packaging (190 employees).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunet&quot;/&gt; The [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]] liqueur company set up a distillery in 1912 at Quai Amiral-Bergeret and has long symbolized the economic wealth of Bayonne. Industrial activities are concentrated in the neighbouring communes of [[Boucau]], [[Tarnos]] ([[Turbomeca]]), [[Mouguerre]], and [[Anglet]].

Bayonne is known for its fine chocolates, produced in the town for 500 years, and Bayonne ham, a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby [[Espelette]]. [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]], the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of [[mayonnaise]], supposedly a corruption of ''Bayonnaise'', the French adjective describing the city's people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.

Bayonne is now the centre of certain craft industries that were once widespread, including the manufacture of ''[[makila]]s'', traditional Basque walking-sticks. The Fabrique Alza just outside the city is known for its ''palas'', bats used in ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', the traditional Basque sport.

===Service activities===
The active tertiary sector includes some large retail chains such as those detailed by geographer [[Roger Brunet]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunet&quot;&gt;[http://tresordesregions.mgm.fr Roger Brunet personal website], consulted on 5 August 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; BUT (240 staff), [[Carrefour]] (150 staff), [[E.Leclerc]] (150 staff), [[Leroy Merlin]] (130 staff), and [[Galeries Lafayette]] (120 employees). Banks, cleaning companies (Onet, 170 employees), and security ([[Brink's]], 100 employees) are also major employers in the commune, as is urban transport which employs nearly 200 staff. Five health clinics, providing a total of more than 500 beds, each employ 120 to 170 staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunet&quot;/&gt;

===The port of Bayonne===
[[File:BBC-Magellan à Bayonne.jpg|thumb|The cargo ship ''BBC-Magellan'' in the port of Bayonne in 2014.]]

The port of Bayonne is located at the mouth of the Adour, downstream of the city. It also occupies part of communes of Anglet and Boucau in [[Pyrenees-Atlantiques]] and [[Tarnos]] in [[Landes (department)|Landes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayonne.port.fr/Documents/fiches_pedagogiques/carteportbayonne.pdf The Port of Bayonne] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170323/http://www.bayonne.port.fr/Documents/fiches_pedagogiques/carteportbayonne.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }}, official website, consulted on 14 September 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It benefits greatly from the natural gas field of Lacq to which it is connected by pipeline. This is the 9th largest French port for trade with an annual traffic of about 4.2 million tonnes of which 2.8 is export. It is also the largest French port for export of [[maize]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunet&quot;/&gt; It is the property of the Aquitaine region who manage and control the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayonne.port.fr/Documents/fiches_pedagogiques/port_concede.pdf The port of Bayonne] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914113802/http://www.bayonne.port.fr/Documents/fiches_pedagogiques/port_concede.pdf |date=14 September 2014 }}, official website, consulted on 14 September 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Metallurgical products movement are more than one million tons per year and maize exports to Spain vary between 800,000 and 1 million tons. The port also receives refined oil products from the [[Total S.A.|Total]] oil refinery at [[Donges]] (800,000 tons per year). Fertilizers are a traffic of 500,000 tons per year and [[sulphur]] from Lacq, albeit in sharp decline, is 400,000 tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayonne.port.fr/Documents/fiches_pedagogiques/trafic_2008_enbref.pdf Traffic in the port of Bayonne in 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025759/http://www.bayonne.port.fr/Documents/fiches_pedagogiques/trafic_2008_enbref.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}, Port of Bayonne official website, consulted on 14 September 2014 {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The port also receives [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]] vehicles from Spain and Portugal and wood both tropical and from Landes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brunet&quot;/&gt;

===Tourism services===

Due to its proximity to the ocean and the foothills of the Pyrenees as well as its historic heritage, Bayonne has developed important activities related to tourism.&lt;ref group=&quot;Insee&quot;&gt;''EMP T8 – Employment by sector of activity'' {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2012 there were 15 hotels in the city offering more than 800 rooms to visitors, but there were no camp sites.&lt;ref group=&quot;Insee&quot;&gt;''TOU T1 – Number and capacity of hotels at 31 December 2012'' {{in lang|fr}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tourist infrastructure in the surrounding urban area of Bayonne complements the local supply with around 5800 rooms spread over nearly 200 hotels and 86 campsites offering over 14,000 beds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=TOU&amp;millesime=2013&amp;typgeo=AU2010&amp;typesearch=inclusion&amp;codgeo=Bayonne+%2864102%29&amp;territoire=OK Key Tourism statistics for the Urban area of Bayonne at 31 December 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914114219/http://insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau_local.asp?ref_id=TOU&amp;millesime=2013&amp;typgeo=AU2010&amp;typesearch=inclusion&amp;codgeo=Bayonne+%2864102%29&amp;territoire=OK |date=14 September 2014 }}, consulted on 14 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sights==
[[File:Old castle, Bayonne, Pyrenees, France-LCCN2001698608.jpg|thumb|The Château Vieux]]
The Nive divides Bayonne into Grand Bayonne and Petit Bayonne with five bridges between the two, both quarters still being backed by [[Vauban]]'s walls. The houses lining the Nive are examples of Basque architecture, with half-timbering and shutters in the national colours of red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the [[Adour]], where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located. Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and [[City and town halls|Hôtel de Ville]].

The [[Bayonne Cathedral|Cathédrale Sainte-Marie]] is an imposing, elegant [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building, rising over the houses, glimpsed along the narrow streets. It was constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. The south tower was completed in the 16th century but the cathedral was only completed in the 19th century with the north tower. The cathedral is noted for its charming [[cloister]]s. There are other details and sculptures of note, although much was destroyed in the [[French Revolution|Revolution]].

Nearby is the Château Vieux, some of which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were based, including the English [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]].
[[File:BayonneCatedral.JPG|thumb|Sainte-Marie Cathedral]]

The Musée Basque is the finest ethnographic museum of the entire Basque Country. It opened in 1922 but has been closed for a decade recently for refurbishment. It now has special exhibitions on Basque agriculture, seafaring and ''[[Basque pelota|pelota]]'', handicrafts and Basque history and way of life.

The [[Musée Bonnat]] began with a large collection bequeathed by the local-born painter [[Léon Bonnat]]. The museum is one of the best galleries in south west France and has paintings by [[Edgar Degas]], [[El Greco]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], and [[Francisco Goya]], among others.

At the back of Petit Bayonne is the Château Neuf, among the ramparts. Now an exhibition space, it was started by the newly arrived French in 1460 to control the city. The walls nearby have been opened to visitors. They are important for plant life now and Bayonne's [[Jardin botanique de Bayonne|botanic gardens]] adjoin the walls on both sides of the Nive.

The area across the Adour is largely residential and industrial, with much demolished to make way for the railway. The Saint-Esprit church was part of a bigger complex built by [[Louis XI of France|Louis&amp;nbsp;XI]] to care for [[Way of St James|pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela]]. It is home to a wooden ''Flight into Egypt'' sculpture.

Overlooking the quarter is Vauban's 1680 Citadelle. The soldiers of Wellington's army who died besieging the citadelle in 1813 are buried in the nearby English Cemetery, visited by [[Queen Victoria]] and other British dignitaries when staying in [[Biarritz]].

The distillery of the famous local liqueur [[Izarra (liqueur)|Izarra]] is located on the northern bank of the Adour and is open to visitors.
