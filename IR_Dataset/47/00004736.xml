The '''Bastard Operator From Hell''' ('''BOFH''') is  a fictional rogue [[computer operator]] who takes out his anger on [[user (computing)|user]]s and others who pester him with their computer problems, uses his expertise against his enemies and manipulates his employer.&lt;ref name=PR/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JF&quot; /&gt;

Several other people have written stories about BOFHs, but those by Simon Travaglia are considered canonical.&lt;ref name=&quot;JF&quot; /&gt; 
The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to [[Usenet]] by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in ''[[Datamation]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays the qualities of the original.&lt;ref name=PR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2008/09/the-bofh-lives-88-of-it-workers-would-steal-data-if-fired/|title=The BOFH lives: 88% of IT workers would steal data if fired|last=Paul|first=Ryan|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond |title=The New Hacker's Dictionary|isbn=978-0-262-68092-9|year=1996|publisher=The MIT Press|page=80|title-link=The New Hacker's Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early accounts of the BOFH took place in a university; later the scenes were set in an office workplace. In 2000 (BOFH 2k), the BOFH and his pimply-faced youth (PFY) assistant moved to a new company.

The main protagonist in [[Charles Stross]]'s ''[[The Laundry Files]]'' series of novels named himself Bob Oliver Francis Howard in reference to the BOFH. As Bob Howard is a self-chosen pseudonym, and Bob is a network manager when not working as a computational demonologist, the name is all too appropriate. In the novella 'Pimpf' he  acquires a pimply-faced young assistant by the name of Peter-Fred Young.
