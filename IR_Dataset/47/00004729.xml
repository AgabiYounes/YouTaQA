'''''Batman &amp; Robin''''' is a 1997 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] characters [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]]. It is the fourth and final installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' initial [[Batman (1989 film series)|''Batman'' film series]], a sequel to ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and the only film in the series made without the involvement of [[Tim Burton]]. Directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and written by [[Akiva Goldsman]], it stars [[George Clooney]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Mr. Freeze|Victor Fries / Mr. Freeze]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Dick Grayson / Robin, alongside [[Uma Thurman]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Michael Gough]], [[Pat Hingle]], and [[Elle Macpherson]]. The film follows the titular characters as they attempt to prevent Mr. Freeze and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. It is also to date the only live-action film appearance of [[Batgirl]], portrayed by Silverstone, who helps the titular characters fight the villains.

Warner Bros. fast-tracked development for ''Batman &amp; Robin'' following the box office success of ''Batman Forever''. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on ''[[A Time to Kill (1996 film)|A Time to Kill]]'', while [[Val Kilmer]] decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Saint (1997 film)|The Saint]]''. Schumacher had a strong interest in casting [[William Baldwin]] in Kilmer's place before George Clooney won the role. [[Principal photography]] began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the [[shooting schedule]].

''Batman &amp; Robin'' premiered in Los Angeles on June 12, 1997, and went into general release on June 20. Making $238.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $160 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970620&amp;slug=2545507|title=Entertainment &amp; the Arts {{!}} `Batman' Bites! -- `Er's' Clooney Brings His Bedside Manner To This Cloyingly Cuddly Caped Crusader {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2019-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was critically panned and often ranks among the [[list of films considered the worst|worst films ever]], where it was criticized for its [[toyetic]] and [[camp]] approach and its homosexual innuendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/mikenelsonsmovie00nels | url-access = registration | page = [https://archive.org/details/mikenelsonsmovie00nels/page/79 79] | title = Mike Nelson's Movie Megacheese | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 978-0-380-81467-1 | author1 = Nelson | first1 = Michael J | date = 2000-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.empireonline.com/features/50-worst-movies-ever/default.asp?film=1 | title = The 50 Worst Movies Ever | work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | accessdate = 2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the lowest-grossing live-action ''Batman'' film to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/franchise/Batman#tab=summary|title=Batman Franchise Box Office History - The Numbers|website=www.the-numbers.com|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the film's poor reception, Warner Bros. cancelled a sequel, ''[[Batman in film#Batman Unchained|Batman Unchained]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-movie-series-list-unmade-802032|title='Batman' Movie Series: List of Unmade Projects - Hollywood Reporter|author=Aaron Couch|date=June 14, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed the film series with ''[[Batman Begins]]'' in 2005.

As a result of ''Batman &amp; Robin''â€™s overwhelmingly negative reception the cast and crew, most notably Clooney &amp; Schumacher himself had frequently disowned and apologized for the film over the years since its release.

==Plot==

&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
Set [[Batman Forever|two years]] after the defeat of [[Two-Face]] and the [[Riddler]], [[Batman]] and his new partner, [[Robin (character)|Robin]], come into conflict in the form of a new foe, [[Mr. Freeze]], who has left a string of diamond robberies in his wake. During a confrontation in the natural history museum, Mr. Freeze steals a bigger diamond and flees, freezing Robin and leaving Batman unable to pursue him. Later, Batman and Robin learn that Mr. Freeze was originally Dr. Victor Fries, a doctor working to develop a cure for MacGregor's syndrome to heal his terminally ill [[Nora Fries|wife]]. After a lab accident, however, Fries was rendered unable to live at normal temperatures and forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds in order to survive.

At a [[Wayne Enterprises]] lab in Brazil, botanist [[Poison Ivy (character)|Dr. Pamela Isley]] is working under the deranged [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]], experimenting with a drug named Venom. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn the violent, but diminutive, convicted serial murderer Antonio Diego into a hulking monstrosity, who he dubs &quot;[[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]]&quot;. When Isley threatens to expose Woodrue's experiments, he attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins. Despite Woodrue's efforts, Isley is resurrected, transforming into the beautiful and seductive [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] before exacting revenge; she kills Woodrue with her poisonous kiss, and sets fire to the lab, leaving it to burn down while she escapes with Bane. She finds that [[Wayne Enterprises]] funded Woodrue, though they cut Woodrue's funding when he intended to weaponize the Venom drug, thus she appropriates Bane as a muscle-bound thug, taking him with her to [[Gotham City]]. Meanwhile, [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at [[Wayne Manor]] until she goes back to school.

Wayne Enterprises presents a new telescope for Gotham Observatory at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people. Batman says that this project is in conflict with the main goals of the Wayne Corporation. That night, a charity event is held by [[Wayne Enterprises]] with special guests, Batman and Robin, and she decides to use her abilities to seduce them. Mr. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Although he is captured by Batman and detained in [[Arkham Asylum]], he eventually [[Prison escape|escape]]s with the help of Poison Ivy, who killed two security guards with her kiss in the process. Meanwhile, Dick discovers that Barbara has participated in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor's syndrome.

Batman and Robin begin to have crime fighting relationship problems because of Ivy's seductive ability with Robin, but Bruce eventually convinces Dick to trust him. Poison Ivy is then able to contact Robin once more; she kisses him but fails to kill him due to Robin wearing rubber lips. Robin says that the rubber lips are immune to her charms. Meanwhile, Barbara discovers the [[Batcave]], where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes [[Batgirl]]. Ivy captures Robin, but he gets rescued by Batman, and Batgirl arrives and subdues Ivy to get eaten by her throne plant, before revealing her identity to the pair.

Batman, Robin and Batgirl decide to go after Mr. Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Mr. Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane, but they eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before reverting to his original form and is left helpless on the ground.

Meanwhile Batman and Mr. Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Mr. Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to thaw the city, and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Poison Ivy during her fight with Batgirl, who had informed the latter that she killed Mr. Freeze's wife. However, Batman informs Mr. Freeze that she is still alive, in cryogenic slumber before being moved to [[Arkham Asylum]], waiting for Mr. Freeze to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Mr. Freeze for the cure Mr. Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred, and Mr. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him the medicine he had developed.

Mr. Freeze is then detained in Arkham Asylum. Poison Ivy is also imprisoned in Arkham Asylum with a vengeful Mr. Freeze as her cellmate (due to his own cell is in the process of being modified for his laboratory needs) and he plans to make Poison Ivy's life a living hell while staying for the attempted murder of his wife. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor and fight crime with them.

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of ''Batman &amp; Robin'' on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. &quot;There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make ''Batman &amp; Robin'' more [[family-friendly]],&quot; Schumacher explained. &quot;We decided to do a less depressing ''Batman'' movie, and less torture and more heroic.

==Cancelled sequel and reboot==
{{main|Batman Begins}}
During the filming of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', [[Warner Bros.]] was impressed with the [[dailies]], prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film. However, writer [[Akiva Goldsman]] turned down an offer to write the script.&lt;ref name=mike/&gt; In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the script for a fifth ''Batman'' film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael| last=Fleming | url = https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/helmer-s-3rd-at-bat-1117435255/ | title = Helmer's 3rd At Bat |work=Variety | date = February 21, 1997 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120212162411/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255| archive-date=February 12, 2012 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Los Angeles Times'' described their film as &quot;continuing in the same vein with multiple villains and more silliness&quot;.{{r|greenberg20050508}} Titled ''Batman Unchained'', Protosevich's script had the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the main villain. Through the use of his fear [[toxin]], he resurrects the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] as a hallucination in Batman's mind. [[Harley Quinn]] appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Brian| last=Linder | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html | title = Rumblings From Gotham | work=[[IGN]] | date = July 27, 2000 | accessdate = October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clooney, O'Donnell, Silverstone, and Coolio were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Scarecrow. It was also hoped that [[Jack Nicholson]] would reprise the role of the Joker. However, following the poor critical reception of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', Clooney vowed never to reprise his role.&lt;ref name=scarecrow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael| last=Fleming | url = https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/schumacher-shrinks-bond-intrigue-grows-111759024/ | title = Schumacher trims sails |work=Variety | date = November 11, 1997 | accessdate = November 11, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120203212438/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121| archive-date=February 3, 2012 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' film and an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most.&lt;ref name=ass/&gt; Schumacher felt he &quot;owe[d] the Batman culture a real ''Batman'' movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jen/&gt; He approached Warner Bros. about doing ''Batman: Year One'' in mid-1998,&lt;ref name=Jen&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Jensen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html |title=Winging It |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 4, 1998 |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019113057/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C285969%2C00.html |archive-date=October 19, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were more interested in hiring [[Darren Aronofsky]]. Aronofsky and Miller developed a ''Year One'' script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. [[Christopher Nolan]] was eventually hired to helm the next ''Batman'' film in January 2003, resulting in the [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name=ass&gt;{{cite book | first = David | last = Hughes | title = Tales From Development Hell | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | date = March 2004 | location = London | pages = [https://archive.org/details/talesfromdevelop00davi/page/192 192â€“211] | chapter = The Dark Knight Strikes Out | isbn = 1-84023-691-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/talesfromdevelop00davi/page/192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot;, an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's ''Batman &amp; Robin''. The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot;. [[Dan Riba]] (director), [[Bruce Timm]]; Robert Goodman (writers). ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. October 10, 1998. No. 19, season 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', director [[Zack Snyder]] and comic book artist [[Dave Gibbons]] chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple [[Batsuit]] design from ''Batman &amp; Robin'' for the [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]] costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Frosty | title = Exclusive Zack Snyder Video Interview Backstage at Saturn Awards | work=Collider.com | date = June 26, 2008 | url = http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/8331/tcid/1 | accessdate = November 14, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081121030239/http://www.collider.com/entertainment/news/article.asp/aid/8331/tcid/1| archive-date= November 21, 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Dave Gibbons]] | title = Watchmen's artist tells us how the famed graphic novel changed his life and gives some thoughts on the upcoming movie and game | work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] | date = December 2008 | page = 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is referenced in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode &quot;Legends of the Dark Mite!&quot;, when [[Bat-Mite]] briefly uses his powers to transform Batman's costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher ''Batman'' films, before declaring it &quot;Too icky&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Legends of the Dark Mite!&quot;. [[Ben Jones (cartoonist)|Ben Jones]] (director), [[Paul Dini]] (writer). ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]''. May 29, 2009. No. 19, season 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Batman from ''Batman &amp; Robin'' later appeared as part of an army of Batmen gathered from across the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] in &quot;Night of the Batmen!&quot;, complete with the blue rubber Batsuit.

Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reception of ''Batman &amp; Robin'' and how it could come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', which was originally planned for release at around the same time as ''Batman &amp; Robin'' but was subsequently delayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stomptokyo1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-subzero.html |title=Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: Subzero |publisher=Stomptokyo.com |date=March 25, 1998 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''SubZero'' received a far stronger positive response from critics than ''Batman &amp; Robin'', with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a ''Batman'' villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;stomptokyo1&quot; /&gt;
