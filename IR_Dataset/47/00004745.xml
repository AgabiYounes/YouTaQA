{{Black People}}
'''Black people''' is a [[Human skin color|skin group]]-based classification used for specific people with a mid to dark brown [[complexion]]. Not all black people have dark skin; however, in certain countries, often in socially based systems of [[racial classification]] in the [[Western world|Western World]], the term ''black'' is used to describe persons who are perceived as [[Dark skin|dark-skinned]] compared to other populations. It is mostly used for the people of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n descent and the [[indigenous peoples]] of [[Oceania]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Different societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified &quot;black&quot;, and these [[Social construction|social constructs]] have changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for &quot;blackness&quot; vary. In the [[United Kingdom]], &quot;black&quot; was historically equivalent with &quot;[[person of color]]&quot;, a general term for non-European peoples. In other regions such as [[Australasia]], settlers applied the term &quot;black&quot; or it was used by local populations with different histories and ancestral backgrounds.

For many other individuals, communities and countries, &quot;black&quot; is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined, especially in African cultures with little to no colonial history. Some have pointed out that labeling people groups &quot;black&quot; is erroneous as the people described as  &quot;black&quot; have a brown skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Levinson, =Meira|title=No Citizen Left Behind|year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674065291|page=70|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LztBPNsDLBYC&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], resident scholar at Brazil's University of the State of Bahia, in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the [[Arab world]], including Arabs in North Africa, self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in [[Latin America]].

Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] had a mother who was a dark-skinned [[Nubians|Nubian]] [[Sudan]]ese ([[Sudanese Arabs|Sudanese Arab]]) woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]. In response to an advertisement for an acting position, as a young man he said, &quot;I am not white but I am not exactly black either. My blackness is tending to reddish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoW4pO4q9VwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP1,M1 Joseph Finklestone, ''Anwar Sadat: Visionary Who Dared''], pp. 5–7, 31. {{ISBN|0-7146-3487-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more African women than men. They used more enslaved African female in domestic service and agriculture than males. The men interpreted the [[Quran]] to permit sexual relations between a male master and his enslaved females outside of marriage (see [[Ma malakat aymanukum and sex]]),&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2, pp. 112–113, footnote 44. See also commentary on verses {{Quran-usc-range|23|1|6}}: Vol. 3, notes 7–1, p. 241; 2000, Islamic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] 4:24.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to many [[mixed-race]] children. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she was considered as ''[[umm walad]]'' or &quot;mother of a child&quot;, a status that granted her privileged rights. The child was given rights of inheritance to the father's property, so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father.&lt;ref name=hunwick/&gt; Because the society was [[patrilineal]], the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free.

Some succeeded their fathers as rulers, such as Sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], who ruled [[Morocco]] from 1578 to 1608. He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave; his mother was [[Fulani]] and a [[concubine]] of his father.&lt;ref name=hunwick&gt;{{cite web|author=Hunwick, John|title=Arab Views of Black Africans and Slavery|url=https://glc.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/events/race/Hunwick.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1991, non-Arabs of the [[Zaghawa people]] of [[Sudan]] attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab [[apartheid]] campaign, segregating Arabs and non-Arabs (specifically, people of [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ancestry).&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Hilde F. |last=Johnson|title=Waging Peace in Sudan: The Inside Story of the Negotiations that Ended Africa's Longest Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhlarBGyoQQC|year=2011|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-453-6|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudanese Arabs, who controlled the government, were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan's non-Arab citizens.

In the [[Sahara]], the native [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] [[Berbers|Berber]] populations kept &quot;[[negro]]&quot; slaves. Most of these captives were of [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] extraction, and were either purchased by the Tuareg nobles from slave markets in the [[Sudan (region)|Western Sudan]] or taken during raids. Their origin is denoted via the [[Tamahaq language|Ahaggar Berber]] word ''[[Ikelan|Ibenheren]]'' (sing. ''Ébenher''), which alludes to slaves that only speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. These slaves were also sometimes known by the borrowed [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] term ''Bella''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicolaisen, Johannes|title=Ecology and Culture of the Pastoral Tuareg: With Particular Reference to the Tuareg of Ahaggar and Ayr|year=1963|publisher=National Museum of Copenhagen|page=16|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hLUbAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Africa===
{{further|Bantu peoples in South Africa}}
In [[South Africa]], the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between [[European ethnic groups|European]] men and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Khoisan]] women from various tribes, resulting in mixed-race children. As the European settlers acquired control of territory, they generally pushed the mixed-race and Bantu and Khoisan populations into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: ''Black'', ''White'', ''[[Asian people|Asian]]'' (mostly [[India]]n), and ''[[Coloureds|Coloured]]''.&lt;!--These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law.--&gt; The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some [[Cape Malays|Malay]] ancestry, especially in the [[Western Cape]]). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]].

The [[apartheid]] bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the [[Population Registration Act]] of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black, the &quot;[[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]]&quot; was used. A pencil was inserted into a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil, rather than having it pass through, as it would with smoother hair. If so, the person was classified as Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nullis, Clare|title=Township tourism booming in South Africa|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2007/01/08/township-tourism-booming-in-south-africa/|date=8 January 2007|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such classifications sometimes divided families.

[[Sandra Laing]] is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her [[Human skin colour|skin colour]] and [[hair#hair texture|hair texture]], although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors. At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school. The officials' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', which won numerous awards. During the apartheid era, those classed as &quot;Coloured&quot; were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as &quot;Black&quot;. The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites, creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks.

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a &quot;Non-racial democracy&quot;. In an effort to redress past injustices, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of [[affirmative action]] policies for Blacks; under these they define &quot;Black&quot; people to include &quot;Africans&quot;, &quot;Coloureds&quot; and &quot;Asians&quot;. Some [[affirmative action]] policies favor &quot;Africans&quot; over &quot;Coloureds&quot; in terms of qualifying for certain benefits. Some South Africans categorized as &quot;African Black&quot; say that &quot;Coloureds&quot; did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. &quot;Coloured&quot; South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying, &quot;we were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC ([[African National Congress]])&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/in-south-africa-after-apartheid-colored-community-is-the-big-loser/|title=Not White Enough, Not Black Enough|author=Eusebius McKaiser|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatred for Black People; by Shehu Sani; Xlibris Corporation, 2013; {{ISBN|9781493120765}}; page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/21228/Adhikari_article_2004.pdf?sequence=1|title='Not Black Enough': Changing Expressions of Coloured Identity in Post-Apartheid South Africa|author=Mohamed Adhikari|journal=South African Historical Journal|volume=51|year=2004|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that [[Chinese South Africans]] who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendants) are to be reclassified as &quot;Black people,&quot; solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also &quot;disadvantaged&quot; by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece &quot;We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese&quot;], ''The Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than by appearance, &quot;Coloureds&quot; can usually be distinguished from &quot;Blacks&quot; by language. Most speak [[Afrikaans]] or English as a [[first language]], as opposed to [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]].

Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards. The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high. The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners' families under the [[patrilineal]] [[kinship system]]. As a result, few distinctive Afro-Arab communities have survived in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A6645-2004Jan10|work=The Washington Post|title=A Legacy Hidden in Plain Sight|author=Labb, Theola|date=11 January 2004|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~yajaffar/african.html|title=Dr Susan|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq, with a reported 1.2 million black people, and they attest to a history of discrimination.

Though slavery — which in Iraq included Arabs as well as Africans — was banned in the 1920s, it continued until the 1950s, African-Iraqis say. Recently, they have begun to campaign for recognition as a minority population, which would grant them the same benefits as Christians, including reserved seats in Parliament...&quot;Black people here are living in fear,&quot; said Jalal Dhiyab Thijeel, an advocate for the country's estimated 1.2 million African-Iraqis. &quot;We want to end that.&quot;&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alamin M.

To the present day there are Arab princes in Saudi Arabia who, in the Western world, would be regarded as 'Black'.

During the [[Qajar dynasty]], many wealthy households imported black African women and children as slaves to perform domestic work. This slave labor was drawn exclusively from the [[Zanj]], who were [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples that lived along the [[African Great Lakes]], in an area roughly comprising modern-day [[Tanzania]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Malawi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bagley&quot;&gt;F.R.C.

In [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|a 1967 referendum]] over 90% of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national [[census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/indigenous-australia-timeline-1901-to-1969|title=Indigenous Australia Timeline – 1901 to 1969|date=3 November 2011|publisher=Australian Museum|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term &quot;black&quot; and use their ancestry as a source of pride. Activist [[Bob Maza]] said:

Black Canadians often draw a distinction between those of [[Afro-Caribbean]] ancestry and those of other African roots. The term ''African Canadian'' is occasionally used by some Black Canadians who trace their heritage to the first slaves brought by British and French colonists to the North American mainland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples&quot;/&gt; Promised freedom by the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands of [[Black Loyalists]] were resettled by the Crown in Canada afterward, such as [[Thomas Peters (revolutionary)|Thomas Peters]]. In addition, an estimated ten to thirty thousand [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|fugitive slaves]] reached freedom in Canada from the [[Southern United States]] during the antebellum years, aided by people along the [[Underground Railroad]].

There were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.24 million enslaved West Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:&lt;ref name=&quot;Lovejoy&quot;&gt;Lovejoy, Paul E.

The variants ''neger'' and ''negar'', derive from the Spanish and Portuguese word {{lang|es|negro}} (black), and from the now-pejorative French ''nègre'' (negro). Etymologically, ''negro'', ''noir'', ''nègre'', and ''[[nigger]]'' ultimately derive from ''nigrum'', the stem of the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|niger}} (black) (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈniɡer]}} which, in every other [[grammatical case]], [[grammatical gender]], and [[grammatical number]] besides [[nominative case|nominative]] masculine singular, is ''nigr-'', the ''r'' is [[Alveolar trill|trilled]]).&lt;!--Romance language nouns (typically) derive from the accusative case, not the nominative case quoted in English. --&gt;

By the 1900s, ''nigger'' had become a pejorative word in the [[United States]]. In its stead, the term ''[[colored]]'' became the mainstream alternative to ''[[negro]]'' and its derived terms. After the [[civil rights movement]], the terms ''colored'' and ''negro'' gave way to &quot;black&quot;. ''Negro'' had superseded ''colored'' as the most polite word for [[African Americans]] at a time when ''black'' was considered more offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Elizabeth, [http://www.thespartandaily.com/news/2004/02/24/CampusNews/Origins.Of.Black.History.Month.Discussed-1498219.shtml &quot;Origins of Black History Month&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002025209/http://www.thespartandaily.com/news/2004/02/24/CampusNews/Origins.Of.Black.History.Month.Discussed-1498219.shtml|date=2 October 2011}}, ''Spartan Daily'', Campus News. San Jose State University, 24 February 2004. Accessed 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This term was accepted as normal, including by people classified as Negroes, until the later [[Civil Rights]] movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] of his own race as &quot;Negro&quot; in his famous speech of 1963, [[I Have a Dream]]. During the American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably [[Malcolm X]], objected to the word ''Negro'' because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, Tom W|year=1992|title=Changing racial labels: from 'Colored' to 'Negro' to 'Black' to 'African American'|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=56|issue=4|pages=496–514|doi=10.1086/269339|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c5820f80ceea54d6bc21d0066ea4f32357b1669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm X preferred ''Black'' to ''Negro'', but later gradually abandoned that as well for ''Afro-American'' after leaving the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Liz Mazucci, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/Souls.Going_Back_To_Our_Own.pdf &quot;Going Back to Our Own: Interpreting Malcolm X's Transition From 'Black Asiatic' to 'Afro-American'&quot;], ''Souls'' 7(1), 2005, pp. 66–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1960s, various other terms for African Americans have been more widespread in popular usage. Aside from ''Black American'', these include ''Afro-American'' (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and ''African American'' (used in the United States to refer to Black Americans, people often referred to in the past as ''American Negroes'').&lt;ref&gt;Christopher H. Foreman, The African-American predicament, Brookings Institution Press, 1999, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 200 years that black people were in the [[United States]], they primarily identified themselves by their specific [[ethnic groups of Africa|ethnic group]] (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Bakongo]], or [[Wolof people|Wolof]]. However, when the first captives were brought to [[the Americas]], they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]] and in some cases from the south-east coast such as [[Mozambique]]. A new ''African-American'' identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the [[Black church]] and [[African-American English]]. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm|title=LINGUISTICS AND AFRICA {{!}} Black or African {{!}} Sub-Saharan Africa {{!}} Feminism {{!}} Pre-Colonial {{!}} Spiritual vs Religious|last=|first=|date=|website=www.africanholocaust.net|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.&lt;ref&gt;Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Africans_in_Colonial_Louisiana.html?id=Arybfb4UWtwC ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century''], Louisiana State University Press, 1992/1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US racial or ethnic classification &quot;black&quot; refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including [[albinos]], if they are believed by others to have African ancestry (in any discernible percentage). There are also certain cultural traits associated with being &quot;[[African American]]&quot;, a term used effectively as a synonym for &quot;black person&quot; within the United States.

In March 1807, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the transatlantic slave trade illegal]], as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under [[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 9|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]].)

By that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term &quot;African&quot; became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of &quot;African&quot; from their institutions and replace it with &quot;[[Negro]]&quot; or &quot;Colored American&quot;. A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. African Americans popularly used the terms &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; for themselves until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594200831/ ''African American Journeys to Africa''], pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black'' was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma. In his 1963 &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493|people=Martin Luther King, Jr.|title=I Have a Dream |medium=Google Video|location=Washington, D.C.|date=28 August 1963|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315154454/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493|archivedate=15 March 2010|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] uses the terms ''negro'' fifteen times and ''black'' four times. Each time he uses ''black'' it is in parallel construction with ''white''; for example, &quot;black men and white men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, Tom W.|title=Changing Racial Labels: From &quot;Colored&quot; to &quot;Negro&quot; to &quot;Black&quot; to &quot;African American&quot;|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=56|issue=4|pages=496–514|oclc=192150485|date=Winter 1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1086/269339|jstor=2749204|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9c5820f80ceea54d6bc21d0066ea4f32357b1669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the successes of the [[civil rights movement]], a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of ''Negro'', activists promoted the use of ''black'' as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term &quot;[[Black Power]]&quot; by Kwame Toure ([[Stokely Carmichael]]) and the popular singer [[James Brown]]'s song &quot;[[Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud]]&quot;.
[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Jordan]], an African American basketball player.]]
In 1988, the civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]] urged Americans to use instead the term &quot;African American&quot; because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate. [[Maulana Karenga]] argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Others have argued that &quot;black&quot; is a better term because &quot;African&quot; suggests foreignness, although Black Americans helped found the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=McWhorter, John H.|title=Why I'm Black, Not African American|work=Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2004|url=https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/why-im-black-not-african-american-0153.html|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.&lt;ref name=Relethford2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Relethford, JH|title=Human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations|journal=Human Biology; an International Record of Research|volume=72|issue=5|pages=773–80|year=2000|pmid=11126724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriver2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pages=387–399|doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y|url=https://homepages.uc.edu/~nortonhr/MoCHA/Publications_files/Shriver%20et%20el%202003.pdf|pmid=12579416|volume=112|issue=4|title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping|date=April 2003|author1=Shriver M.D.|author2=Parra E.J.|author3=Dios S.|journal=Human Genetics|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Black&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American|author=Newport, Frank|publisher=Gallup|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have a slight preference for &quot;black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miller, Pepper|author2=Kemp, Herb|title=What's Black About?

====One-drop rule====
[[File:Frederick Douglass (circa 1879).jpg|thumb|upright|Multiracial social reformer [[Frederick Douglass]].]]
From the late 19th century, the South used a [[colloquial]] term, the ''[[one-drop rule]]'', to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web|author=James, F. Davis|title=Who is Black? One Nation's Definition|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the [[American Civil War]]. For instance, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.

Outside the U.S., some other countries have adopted the one-drop rule, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one-drop &quot;rule&quot; applies varies greatly from country to country.

The one-drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Page]], [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/page_5-1.html A Credit to His Races], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', 1 May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and was maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=25|title=Presenting the Triumph of the One-Drop Rule|last=Sweet|first=Frank|date=1 April 2006|work=The One-Drop Rule|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Frank Sweet is not a reliable source. His is a self-published fringe viewpoint.|date=September 2017}} One of the results of the one-drop rule was the uniting of the African-American community.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Some of the most prominent abolitionists and civil-rights activists of the 19th century were multiracial, such as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Robert Purvis]] and James Mercer Langston. They advocated equality for all.

Due to the often political&lt;ref name=Eze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. [[Toni Morrison]] once described [[Bill Clinton]] as the first black [[President of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2002/02/21/clinton_88/|title=Blacks and Bill Clinton|author=Hansen, Suzy|date=20 February 2002|work=Salon|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; because, as she put it, he displayed &quot;almost every trope of blackness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1998/10/05/comment-6543|title=Comment|author=Morrison, Toni|authorlink=Toni Morrison|date=5 October 1998|journal=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, &quot;Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first to come from the broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [Arthur] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christopher Hitchens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/18/clinton.usa|title=Bill Clinton: Is he the most crooked President in history?|date=18 April 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1637/is_200204/ai_n6880693|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228195245/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1637/is_200204/ai_n6880693|url-status=dead|archivedate=28 February 2008|title=Find Articles 404 File not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the lack of action during the [[Rwandan genocide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/mar/31/usa.rwanda|title=US chose to ignore Rwandan genocide|author=Carroll, Rory|date=31 March 2004|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[welfare reform]], which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst [[child poverty]] since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/jun1999/welf-j02.shtml|title=Clinton's welfare reform has increased child poverty|author=Roberts, Larry|date=2 June 1999|publisher=World Socialist website|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2016/04/08/soul-brother-bill-clinton-and-black-americans/|title=Soul Brother?

The question of blackness also arose in the Democrat [[Barack Obama]]'s [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]]. Commentators have questioned whether Obama, who was elected the first president with black ancestry, is &quot;black enough&quot;, contending that his background is not typical because his mother was [[white American]], and his father was a black [[Kenyan American|Kenyan immigrant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;obama-speech&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obama-time&quot;/&gt; Obama chose to identify as black and [[African-American]].&lt;ref name=Kroft&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-excerpt-sen-barack-obama/|title=A Transcript Excerpt Of Steve Kroft's Interview With Sen.

In July 2012, Ancestry.com reported on historic and [[DNA]] research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the [[Virginia]] colony. An [[indentured servant]], he was &quot;bound for life&quot; in 1640 after trying to escape. The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women, likely indentured servants and working-class like them. Their [[multi-racial]] children were free because they were born to free [[English people|English]] women. Over time, Obama's line of the Bunch family (as they became known) were property owners and continued to &quot;marry white&quot;; they became part of white society, likely by the early to mid-18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harman&quot;&gt;Anastasia Harman, Natalie D.

Approximately 12 million people were shipped from Africa to the [[Americas]] during the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from 1492 to 1888. Of these, 11.5 million of those shipped to [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unslaverymemorial.org/history.html United Nations Slavery Memorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210063033/http://unslaverymemorial.org/history.html|date=10 December 2013 }}: &quot;Accurate figures are still not available but at a conservative estimate, using the figures that have been generated by the latest Slave Trade Database, of the estimated millions transported, Portugal dominated the trade with 5.8 million or 46%, while Great Britain transported 3.25 million or 26%, France accounted for 1.38 million or 11%, and Spain 1.06 million or 8%. So it is unmistakable, that the 4 leading colonial powers accounted for a combined total of 11.5 million Africans or 92% of the overall trade. The remainder was transported by the US 305,326, the Netherlands 554,336, and Denmark/Baltic 111,041. There were several stages to the trade. During the first phase between 1501 and 1600, an estimated 277,509 Africans or just 2% of the overall trade, were sent to the Americas and Europe. During the 17th century, some 15% or 1,875,631 Africans embarked for the Americas. The period from 1701 to the passage of the British Abolition Act in 1807 was the peak of the trade. Here an estimated 7,163,241 or 57% of the trafficking in Africans transpired, with the remaining 26% or 3,204,935 occurring between 1808 and 1866.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas, with 5.5 million African slaves imported, followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million, the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans, and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unslaverymemorial.org/history.html United Nations Slavery Memorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210063033/http://unslaverymemorial.org/history.html|date=10 December 2013}}:&quot;In the Americas, Brazil was the largest importer of Africans, accounting for 5.5 million or 44%, the British Caribbean with 2.76 million or 22%, the French Caribbean 1.32 million, and the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland accounting for 1.59 million. The relatively high numbers for Brazil and the British Caribbean is largely a reflection of the dominance and continued expansion of the plantation system in those regions. Even more so, the inability of the enslaved population in these regions to reproduce meant that the replacement demand for laborers was significantly high.

===Brazil===
{{Main|Afro-Brazilians}}
The concept of race in [[Brazil]] is complex. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between an individual of unmixed West African ancestry and a very light [[mulatto]] individual, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on various combinations of [[Human hair color|hair color]], [[Hair#Hair Texture|hair texture]], [[eye color]], and [[Human skin color|skin color]]. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. In Brazil, people are classified by appearance, not heredity.&lt;ref name=skidmore&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skidmore, Thomas E.|title=Fact and Myth: Discovering a Racial Problem in Brazil|journal=Working Paper|volume=173|url=http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/publications/workingpapers/WPS/173.pdf|date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that achieving [[Social mobility|upward mobility]] and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree, arguing that &quot;[[Racial whitening|whitening]]&quot; of one's social status may be open to people of [[mixed race]], a large part of the population known as ''[[pardo]]'', but a person perceived as ''preto'' (black) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Telles, Edward Eric|title=Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwJoyyXm7ZkC|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-11866-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwJoyyXm7ZkC&amp;pg=PA95 95–98]|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Telles, Edward E.|title=Racial Ambiguity Among the Brazilian Population|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|url=http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_012_01.pdf|volume=25|pages=415–441|date=3 May 2002|publisher=California Center for Population Research|doi=10.1080/01419870252932133|issue=3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115211322/http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_012_01.pdf|archivedate=15 January 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the years 1500 to 1850, an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil. The territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Telles|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YwJoyyXm7ZkC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=1500+1850 24]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-ancestry outside Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government in Brazil and the later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-[[miscegenation]] or segregation laws. As in other Latin American countries, [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of [[mixed race]] (''pardo'') often tended to marry white spouses, and their descendants became accepted as white. As a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown)&amp;nbsp;— a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook: Brazil|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, a philosophy of [[racial whitening]] emerged in Brazil, related to the assimilation of mixed-race people into the white population through intermarriage. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835, roughly 50% of the population was ''preto'' (black; most were [[Slavery in Latin America|enslaved]]), a further 20% was ''pardo'' (brown), and 25% white, with the remainder [[Amerindian]]. Some classified as pardo were tri-racial.

By the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from Europe and Asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing.&lt;ref name=&quot;skidmore&quot; /&gt; A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since 1822 and the end of the colonial period) African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;V.F.

====Race relations in Brazil====

Because of the acceptance of [[miscegenation]], Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white. In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were racially mixed, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Phillips, Tom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/25/brazil-2010-census-kalunga|title=Brazil's census offers recognition at last to descendants of runaway slaves|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=25 August 2010|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of the [[racial democracy]] in Brazil has drawn some criticism, based on economic issues. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white or predominantly European in ancestry. One-third of the population lives under the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]], with blacks and other [[people of color]] accounting for 70 percent of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barrolle, Melvin Kadiri|title=African 'Americans' in Brazil|publisher=New America Media|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b8d531de860940110af2433244782c6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516030431/http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b8d531de860940110af2433244782c6|url-status=dead|archivedate=16 May 2007|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 United States, African Americans, including multiracial people, earned 76.8% as much as white people. By contrast, black and mixed race Brazilians earned on average 58% as much as whites in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;EconomistSlaverysLegacies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery's legacies|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21706510-american-thinking-about-race-starting-influence-brazil-country-whose-population|work=The Economist|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color. Other social factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roland, Edna Maria Santos|title=The Economics of Racism: People of African Descent in Brazil|url=http://www.falapreta.org.br/durban/racism.doc|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614014314/http://www.falapreta.org.br/durban/racism.doc|archivedate=14 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators{{Who|date=September 2016}} observe that the United States practice of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[white supremacy]] in the South, and discrimination in many areas outside that region, forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle, whereas the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent between those with more or less ancestry and helped sustain an image of the country as an example of post-colonial harmony. This has hindered the development of a common identity among black Brazilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;EconomistSlaverysLegacies&quot;/&gt;

Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;Tom Phillips, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/17/brazil-census-african-brazilians-majority &quot;Brazil census shows African-Brazilians in the majority for the first time&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 17 November 2011. Retrieved 6 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as [[Detroit]] and [[New Orleans]], have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Whitaker, &quot;[https://archive.today/20120708052602/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n4_v46/ai_9329550/pg_3 Blacks in Brazil: The Myth and the Reality]&quot;, ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.

Patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term ''negro'' to encompass all African-descended people, in order to stimulate a &quot;black&quot; consciousness and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/03/opinion/oe-rodriguez3|title=Brazil Separates Into a World of Black and White|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 September 2006|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Black Venezuelans came directly from Africa having been brought as slaves during colonization;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://antropologiayecologiaupel.blogspot.com/2011/03/procedencia-de-los-esclavos-negros-en.html|author=University of the Andes (Venezuela)|title=Historia de Venezuela – Procedencia de los Esclavos Negros en Venezuela|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=6 May 2018|author-link=University of the Andes (Venezuela)}}&lt;/ref&gt; others have been descendants of immigrants from the Antilles and Colombia. The blacks were part of the [[Venezuelan War of Independence|independence movement]], and several managed to be heroes. There is a deep-rooted heritage of African culture in Venezuelan culture, as demonstrated in many traditional Venezuelan music and dances, such as the [[Tambor (dance)|Tambor]], a musical genre inherited from the blacks of the colony, or the [[Joropo|Llanera music]] or the [[Gaita zuliana]] that both are a fusion of all the three major peoples that contribute to the cultural heritage. Also the black inheritance is present in the gastronomy.

There are entire communities of blacks in the [[Barlovento, Venezuela|Barlovento]] zone, as well as part of the [[Bolívar (state)|Bolívar state]] and in other small towns; they also live peaceably among the general population in the rest of Venezuela. Currently blacks represent a relative majority in the Venezuelan population, although many are actually [[Multiracial|mixed people]].
