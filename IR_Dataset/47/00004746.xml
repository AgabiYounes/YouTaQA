&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Plague''' is an [[infectious disease]] caused by the [[Enterobacteriaceae|bacterium]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.&lt;ref name=WHO2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Plague|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 November 2017|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include [[fever]], weakness and [[headache]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=Symptoms Plague|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/symptoms/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=en-us|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this begins one to seven days after exposure.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; In the [[bubonic plague|bubonic form]] there is also swelling of [[lymph nodes]], while in the [[septicemic plague|septicemic form]] tissues may [[necrosis|turn black and die]], and in the [[pneumonic plague|pneumonic form]] shortness of breath, cough and chest pain may occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Sym/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Bubonic and septicemic plague are generally spread by [[flea]] bites or handling an infected animal.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Sym/&gt; The pneumonitic form is generally spread between people [[Airborne disease|through the air]] via infectious droplets.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Sym/&gt; Diagnosis is typically by finding the bacterium in fluid from a lymph node, blood or [[sputum]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Those at high risk may be [[vaccinated]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; Those exposed to a case of pneumonic plague may be treated with preventive medication.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; If infected, treatment is with [[antibiotic]]s and [[supportive care]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; Typically antibiotics include a combination of [[gentamicin]] and a [[fluoroquinolone]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Doc&gt;{{cite web|title=Resources for Clinicians Plague|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/healthcare/clinicians.html|website=CDC|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=en-us|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of death with treatment is about 10% while without it is about 70%.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ Plague|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=en-us|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Globally about 600 cases are reported a year.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; In the United States infections occasionally occur in rural areas, where the bacteria are believed to circulate among [[rodents]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Cau&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmission Plague|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/transmission/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=en-us|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has historically occurred in large [[outbreaks]], with the best known being the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century, which resulted in more than 50 million deaths.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Bubonic plague===
{{Main|Bubonic plague}}

[[File:Plague -buboes.jpg|thumb|Swollen inguinal lymph glands on a person infected with the bubonic plague. The swollen lymph glands are termed ''buboes'' from the Greek word for groin, swollen gland: ''bubo''.]]

When a flea bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated blood, the plague-carrying bacteria are passed into the tissue. ''Y. pestis'' can reproduce inside cells, so even if [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]], they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the [[lymphatic system]], which drains [[interstitial fluid]]. Plague bacteria secrete several [[toxin]]s, one of which is known to cause [[beta blocker|beta-adrenergic blockade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=SD |last2=Montie |first2=TC |title=Beta-adrenergic blocking activity of Yersinia pestis murine toxin |journal=Infection and Immunity |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=85–93 |year=1977 |pmid=198377 |pmc=421197 |url=http://iai.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=198377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Y. pestis'' spreads through the [[lymphatic vessels]] of the infected human until it reaches a [[lymph node]], where it causes acute [[lymphadenopathy|lymphadenitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sebbane|first1=F|last2=Jarret|first2=C.O.|last3=Gardner|first3=D|last4=Long|first4=D|last5=Hinnebusch|first5=B.J.|title=Role of ''Yersinia pestis'' plasminogen activator in the incidence of distinct septicemic and bubonic forms of flea-borne plague|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|volume=103|issue=14|pages=5526–5530|doi=10.1073/pnas.0509544103|pmid=16567636|ref=harv|pmc=1414629|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swollen lymph nodes form the characteristic [[bubo]]es associated with the disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symptoms &amp;#124; Plague|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/symptoms/|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and autopsies of these buboes have revealed them to be mostly [[bleeding|hemorrhagic]] or [[necrosis|necrotic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sebbane|first1=F|last2=Gardner|first2=D|last3=Long|first3=D|last4=Gowen|first4=B.B.|last5=Hinnebusch|first5=B.J.|title=Kinetics of Disease Progression and Host Response in a Rat Model of Bubonic Plague|journal=Am J Pathol|volume=166|issue=5|pages=1427–1439|doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)62360-7|pmid=15855643|ref=harv|pmc=1606397|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the lymph node is overwhelmed, the infection can pass into the bloodstream, causing ''secondary septicemic plague'' and if the lungs are seeded, it can cause ''secondary pneumonic plague''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plague|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/healthcare/clinicians.html|accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Septicemic plague===
{{Main|Septicemic plague}}
[[File:PlagueTypes.jpg|thumb|Septicemic plague resulting in necrosis]]
Lymphatics ultimately drain into the bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter the blood and travel to almost any part of the body. In [[septicemia|septicemic]] plague, bacterial endotoxins cause [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with [[antibiotics]] reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagle1948&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wagle PM| title=Recent advances in the treatment of bubonic plague| journal=Indian J Med Sci| year=1948| volume=2| pages=489–94| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer1950&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Meyer KF| title=Modern therapy of plague| year=1950| journal=J Am Med Assoc| volume=144| pages=982–85| pmid=14774219| issue=12| doi=10.1001/jama.1950.02920120006003| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DattGupta1948&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Datt Gupta AK| title=A short note on plague cases treated at Campbell Hospital| journal=Ind Med Gaz| year=1948| volume=83| pages=150–51| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Pneumonic plague===
{{Main|Pneumonic plague}}
The [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] form of plague arises from [[infection]] of the [[human lung|lungs]]. It causes coughing and sneezing and thereby produces [[Airborne disease|airborne]] droplets that contain [[bacteria]]l cells and are likely to infect anyone inhaling them. The [[incubation period]] for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness and spitting or vomiting of blood. The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases mortality is nearly 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Ryan |editor-first=K. J. |editor2-last=Ray |editor2-first=C. G. |title=Sherris Medical Microbiology: An Introduction to Infectious Diseases |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=4th |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Hoffman SL| title=Plague in the United States: the &quot;Black Death&quot; is still alive| journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine| year=1980| volume=9| pages=319–22| doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(80)80068-0| issue=6| pmid=7386958| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:Xenopsylla chepsis (oriental rat flea).jpg|thumb|The [[Oriental rat flea]] (Xenopsylla cheopsis) engorged with blood after a blood meal. This species of flea is the primary [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the transmission of ''Yersinia pestis'', the organism responsible for bubonic plague in most plague [[epidemic]]s in Asia, Africa and South America. Both male and female fleas [[hematophagy|feed on blood]] and can transmit the infection.]]
[[File:Ulceration of flea bite cause by yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|A child bitten by a flea [[Infection|infected]] with the bacterium ''Yersinia pestis''. ''Y. pestis'', a member of the family [[Enterobacteriaceae]], has caused the bite to become [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerated]].]]
Transmission of ''Y. pestis'' to an uninfected individual is possible by any of the following means.&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;&gt;''Plague Manual: Epidemiology, Distribution, Surveillance and Control'', pp. 9, 11. WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* droplet contact&amp;nbsp;– coughing or sneezing on another person
* direct physical contact&amp;nbsp;– touching an infected person, including sexual contact
* indirect contact&amp;nbsp;– usually by touching soil contamination or a contaminated surface
* airborne transmission&amp;nbsp;– if the microorganism can remain in the air for long periods
* fecal-oral transmission&amp;nbsp;– usually from contaminated food or water sources
* vector borne transmission&amp;nbsp;– carried by insects or other animals.
''Yersinia pestis'' circulates in animal reservoirs, particularly in rodents, in the natural foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.&lt;ref name=PM/&gt;
Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the [[flea]]s (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'') that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yersin|first=Alexandre|year=1894|orig-year=|title=La peste bubonique à Hong-Kong|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/index.php?p=3&amp;cote=epo1234&amp;do=page|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|volume=8|pages=662–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
{{Main|Plague vaccine}}
Since human plague is rare in most parts of the world, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with [[enzootic]] plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western [[United States]]. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with ''Y. pestis'' organisms resistant to antimicrobials: (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with ''Y. pestis''; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plague Vaccine |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041848.htm|publisher=CDC|date=June 11, 1982|accessdate=Apr 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic review by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jefferson T, Demicheli V, Pratt M |title=Vaccines for preventing plague |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000976 |year=2000 |pmid=10796565 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000976 |editor1-last=Jefferson |editor1-first=Tom |ref=harv|last2=Demicheli |last3=Pratt |pmc=6532692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==
If diagnosed in time, the various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are [[streptomycin]], [[chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracycline]]. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, [[gentamicin]] and [[doxycycline]] have proven effective in [[monotherapy|monotherapeutic]] treatment of plague.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mwengee2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Mwengee W| title=Treatment of Plague with Genamicin or Doxycycline in a Randomized Clinical Trial in Tanzania| year=2006| journal=Clin Infect Dis| volume=42| pmid=16447105| issue=5| pages=614–21| doi=10.1086/500137| last2=Butler| first2=Thomas| last3=Mgema| first3=Samuel| last4=Mhina| first4=George| last5=Almasi| first5=Yusuf| last6=Bradley| first6=Charles| last7=Formanik| first7=James B.| last8=Rochester| first8=C. George| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plague bacterium could develop [[drug resistance]] and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in [[Madagascar]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/en/health/antibiotic-resistance/news/drugresistant-plague-a-major-threat-say-scient.html Drug-resistant plague a 'major threat', say scientists], SciDev.Net.&lt;/ref&gt; Further outbreaks in Madagascar were reported in November 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-november-2014-plague/en/ |title=Plague – Madagascar |date=21 November 2014 |publisher=World Health Organisation |access-date=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/response-plague-madagascar/en/ |title=WHO scales up response to plague in Madagascar |date=1 October 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
{{Main|Epidemiology of plague}}
[[File:World distribution of plague 1998.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|Distribution of plague infected animals 1998]]
Globally about 600 cases are reported a year.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; In 2017 the countries with the most cases include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt; It has historically occurred in large [[outbreaks]], with the best known being the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century which resulted in greater than 50 million dead.&lt;ref name=WHO2017/&gt;

==Biological weapon==
Plague has a long history as a [[biological weapon]]. Historical accounts from [[ancient China]] and [[medieval Europe]] detail the use of infected animal carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the [[Xiongnu]]/[[Huns]], [[Mongols]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. [[Han Dynasty]] General [[Huo Qubing]] is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by [[catapult]] into cities under siege.&lt;ref&gt;Schama, S. (2000). ''A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World? 3000BC–AD1603, First Edition'', BBC Worldwide, London, p226.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1347, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] possession of [[Feodosia|Caffa]], a great trade emporium on the [[Crimean peninsula]], came under siege by an army of [[Mongol]] warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] under the command of [[Janibeg]]. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. This event might have led to the transfer of the plague ([[Black Death]]) via their ships into the south of [[Europe]], possibly explaining its rapid spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no9/01-0536.htm |author=Wheelis M. |title=Biological warfare at the 1346 siege of Caffa |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |year = 2002 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971–75 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] developed weaponised plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas. During the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]], [[Unit 731]] deliberately infected [[Chinese people|Chinese]], Korean and Manchurian [[civilian]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] with the plague bacterium. These subjects, termed &quot;maruta&quot; or &quot;logs&quot;, were then studied by [[dissection]], others by [[Human Subject Research#Human vivisection|vivisection]] while still conscious. Members of the unit such as [[Shiro Ishii]] were exonerated from the [[Tokyo tribunal]] by [[Douglas MacArthur]] but 12 of them were prosecuted in the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] in 1949 during which some admitted having spread [[bubonic plague]] within a 36-km radius around the city of [[Changde]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Barenblatt, ''A plague upon Humanity'', HarperCollns, 2004, pp. 220–21&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishii innovated bombs containing live mice and fleas, with very small explosive loads, to deliver the weaponized microbes, overcoming the problem of the explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

After World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as [[diphtheria]]), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in USSR bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=May 2014}}

The plague can be easily treated with antibiotics, which some countries, such as the United States, have large supplies on hand if such an attack should occur, thus making the threat less severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Marcia|publisher=F.A.
