'''Benzodiazepines''' ('''BZD''', '''BDZ''', '''BZs'''), sometimes called &quot;'''benzos'''&quot;, are a class of [[psychoactive drug]]s whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a [[benzene]] ring and a [[diazepine]] ring. The first such drug, [[chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), was [[role of chance in scientific discoveries|discovered accidentally]] by [[Leo Sternbach]] in 1955, and made available in 1960 by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]], which, since 1963, has also marketed the benzodiazepine [[diazepam]] (Valium).&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-517668-5&quot;/&gt; In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treating Alcohol and Drug Problems in Psychotherapy Practice Doing What Works|date=2011|publisher=Guilford Publications|location=New York|isbn=9781462504381|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hCHzJkZ8JIC&amp;pg=PA47}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are in the family of drugs commonly known as [[minor tranquilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldberg|first1=Raymond|title=Drugs Across the Spectrum|date=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111782009|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZlsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Medical uses --&gt;
Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA) at the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], resulting in [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]] ([[Sleep induction|sleep-inducing]]), [[anxiolytic]] (anti-anxiety), [[anticonvulsant]], and [[muscle relaxant]] properties. High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause  [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]].&lt;ref name=ip2002/&gt; These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating [[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[spasm|muscle spasms]], [[alcohol withdrawal]] and as a [[premedication]] for medical or dental procedures.&lt;ref name=pmid18175099/&gt; Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short, intermediary, or long-acting. Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.&lt;ref name=sddat/&gt;

&lt;!-- Side effects --&gt;
Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and [[paradoxical effect]]s such as aggression or behavioral [[disinhibition]] occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic.&lt;ref name=pmid18922233/&gt; Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodds_2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dodds TJ | title = Prescribed Benzodiazepines and Suicide Risk: A Review of the Literature | journal = The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28257172 | doi = 10.4088/PCC.16r02037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term use is controversial because of concerns about [[drug tolerance|decreasing effectiveness]], [[physical dependence]], [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]], and an increased risk of [[dementia]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=pmid18671662/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19062773/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid29926372&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hong-Bae|last2=Myung|first2=Seung-Kwon|last3=Park|first3=Yon Chul|last4=Park|first4=Byoungjin|date=2017-02-01|title=Use of benzodiazepine and risk of cancer: A meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=International Journal of Cancer|volume=140|issue=3|pages=513–525|doi=10.1002/ijc.30443|issn=1097-0215|pmid=27667780}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long-term, stopping benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=asapdacg /&gt; The elderly are at an increased risk of both short- and [[long-term effects of benzodiazepines|long-term adverse effects]],&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=ohop/&gt; and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the [[Beers Criteria|Beers List]] of inappropriate medications for older adults.&lt;ref name=agsubc2015&gt;{{cite journal| author=By the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel| title=American Geriatrics Society 2015 Updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults | journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | year= 2015 | volume= 63 | issue= 11 | pages= 2227–46 | pmid=26446832 | doi=10.1111/jgs.13702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy.

Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous [[coma|deep unconsciousness]]. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the [[barbiturate]]s, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[depressant]]s such as [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[opioid]]s, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases.&lt;ref name=pmid9780123/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA requires strong warnings for opioid analgesics, prescription opioid cough products, and benzodiazepine labeling related to serious risks and death from combined use|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm518697.htm|website=FDA|accessdate=1 September 2016|date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken [[poly drug use|in combination]] with other [[Drug abuse|drugs of abuse]].&lt;ref name=Charlson_2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10707430/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid10622686/&gt;

===Panic disorder===
Because of their effectiveness, tolerability, and rapid onset of [[anxiolytic]] action, benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of anxiety associated with panic disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762816&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens JC, Pollack MH | title = Benzodiazepines in clinical practice: consideration of their long-term use and alternative agents | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 66 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 21–7 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15762816 | quote = The frequent use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety is likely a reflection of their effectiveness, rapid onset of anxiolytic effect, and tolerability. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is disagreement among expert bodies regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder. The views range from those holding benzodiazepines are not effective long-term &lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004/&gt; and should be reserved for treatment-resistant cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bandelow B, Zohar J, Hollander E, Kasper S, Möller HJ | title = World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Guidelines for the Pharmacological Treatment of Anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders | journal = The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 171–99 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12516310 | doi = 10.3109/15622970209150621 | last-author-amp = y }}&lt;/ref&gt; to those holding they are as effective in the long term as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) guidelines&lt;ref name=&quot;APA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/pracGuide/loadGuidelinePdf.aspx?file=PanicDisorder_2e_PracticeGuideline |format = PDF |title= APA Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Panic Disorder, Second Edition |author=Work Group on Panic Disorder |date=January 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; note that, in general, benzodiazepines are well tolerated, and their use for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]], [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, and psychotherapy should be based on the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of [[substance abuse]]. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience supports continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients, stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;

Guidelines issued by the UK-based [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), carried out a systematic review using different methodology and came to a different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of [[placebo-controlled studies]], they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and [[physical dependence]] develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including [[rebound anxiety]] occurring after six weeks or more of use.&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=McIntosh A, Cohen A, Turnbull N |title=Clinical guidelines and evidence review for panic disorder and generalised anxiety disorder |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg022fullguideline.pdf |publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Primary Care |year=2004 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Barbui C, Cipriani A |title=Proposal for the inclusion in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines of a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor for Generalised Anxiety Disorder |url=http://who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/17/application/Section24_GAD.pdf |publisher=WHO Collaborating Centre for Research and Training in Mental Health |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of [[anxiety disorders]], although specific [[antidepressants]] and psychological therapies are recommended as the [[first-line treatment]] options with the [[anticonvulsant]] drug [[pregabalin]] indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cloos JM, Ferreira V | title = Current use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 90–5 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19122540 | doi = 10.1097/YCO.0b013e32831a473d }}&lt;/ref&gt; NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without [[agoraphobia]] is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as [[cognitive behavioural therapy]] are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004 /&gt;

Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally; however, very occasionally lorazepam or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of [[panic attack]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;

===Generalized anxiety disorder===
Benzodiazepines have robust efficacy in the short-term management of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17881433&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin JL, Sainz-Pardo M, Furukawa TA, Martín-Sánchez E, Seoane T, Galán C | title = Benzodiazepines in generalized anxiety disorder: heterogeneity of outcomes based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 774–82 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17881433 | doi = 10.1177/0269881107077355 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), benzodiazepines can be used in the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.&lt;ref name=NICECG022&gt;{{cite web |title=Clinical Guideline 22 (amended). Anxiety: management of anxiety (panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, and generalised anxiety disorder) in adults in primary, secondary and community care |pages=23–25 |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG022NICEguidelineamended.pdf |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514111817/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG022NICEguidelineamended.pdf |archive-date=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) recommends benzodiazepines [[alprazolam]], [[bromazepam]], [[lorazepam]], and [[diazepam]] only as a second-line choice, if the treatment with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines can be used for a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating [[rumination (psychology)|ruminative worry]], the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16933543&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Canadian Psychiatric Association | title = Clinical practice guidelines.

===Insomnia===
[[File:Normison.jpg|thumb|[[Temazepam]] (Normison) 10 mg tablets]]

Benzodiazepines can be useful for short-term treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due to the risk of dependence. The Committee on Safety of Medicines report recommended that where long-term use of benzodiazepines for insomnia is indicated then treatment should be intermittent wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20141205150130/http:/www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/pl-p/documents/websiteresources/con2024428.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness.&lt;ref name=&quot;nice-hypnotics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology Appraisal Guidance 77.

Since the release of non benzodiazepines in 1992 in response to safety concerns, individuals with insomnia and other sleep disorders have increasingly been prescribed nonbenzodiazepines (2.3% in 1993 to 13.7% of Americans in 2010), less often prescribed benzodiazepines (23.5% in 1993 to 10.8% in 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaufmann_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufmann CN, Spira AP, Alexander GC, Rutkow L, Mojtabai R | title = Trends in prescribing of sedative-hypnotic medications in the USA: 1993-2010 | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 637–45 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 26711081 | pmc = 4889508 | doi = 10.1002/pds.3951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/pre96/019908_S000_AP&amp;AE_LTRS&amp;FPL.pdf|title=Approval letter for Ambien|date=|website=Food and Drug Administration|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear as to whether the new [[nonbenzodiazepine|non benzodiazepine]] hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines.

===Seizures===
Prolonged convulsive [[epileptic seizure]]s are a [[medical emergency]] that can usually be dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent [[anticonvulsants]]. In a hospital environment, [[intravenous]] [[clonazepam]], [[lorazepam]], and [[diazepam]] are first-line choices. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so [[rectal]] diazepam or [[buccal mucosa|buccal]] [[midazolam]] are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.&lt;ref name=SIGN70&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign70.pdf |title=Diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults |accessdate=2009-06-05 |author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network |year=2005 |pages=17–9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126152302/http://sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign70.pdf |archive-date=2009-01-26 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NICECG020&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG020fullguideline.pdf |title=Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Review for the Epilepsies: diagnosis and management in adults and children in primary and secondary care |accessdate=2009-06-02 |vauthors=Stokes T, Shaw EJ, Juarez-Garcia A, Camosso-Stefinovic J, Baker R |date=October 2004 |publisher=Royal College of General Practitioners |pages=61, 64–65 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When benzodiazepines were first introduced, they were enthusiastically adopted for treating all forms of [[epilepsy]]. However, drowsiness and [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] become problems with continued use and none are now considered [[first-line treatment|first-line]] choices for long-term epilepsy therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19298435&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shorvon SD | title = Drug treatment of epilepsy in the century of the ILAE: the second 50 years, 1959-2009 | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 50 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = 93–130 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19298435 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1167.2009.02042.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clobazam]] is widely used by specialist epilepsy clinics worldwide and clonazepam is popular in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19298435&quot;/&gt;   Clobazam was approved for use in the United States in 2011.

Therefore, the dose is slowly tapered over a period of up to six months or longer.&lt;ref name=NICECG020/&gt;

===Alcohol withdrawal===
[[Chlordiazepoxide]] is the most commonly used benzodiazepine for [[alcohol detoxification]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9270461&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashworth M, Gerada C | title = ABC of mental health. Addiction and dependence--II: Alcohol | journal = BMJ | volume = 315 | issue = 7104 | pages = 358–60 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9270461 | pmc = 2127236 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.315.7104.358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[diazepam]] may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed for a short period of time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;{{rp|275|date=November 2012}} The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to [[Causes of seizures#Breakthrough seizure|breakthrough seizures]], and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. [[Oxazepam]] and [[lorazepam]] are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with [[cirrhosis]], because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through [[Glucuronidation|conjugation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kraemer KL, Conigliaro J, Saitz R | title = Managing alcohol withdrawal in the elderly | journal = Drugs &amp; Aging | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 409–25 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10408740 | doi = 10.2165/00002512-199914060-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prater CD, Miller KE, Zylstra RG | title = Outpatient detoxification of the addicted or alcoholic patient | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 1175–83 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10507746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines are the preferred choice in the management of [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]], in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe [[delirium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebell MH | title = Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 73 | issue = 7 | pages = 1191 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16623205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peppers MP | title = Benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal in the elderly and in patients with liver disease | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–57 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8700792 | doi = 10.1002/j.1875-9114.1996.tb02915.x | doi-broken-date = 2020-02-21 | url = https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1875-9114.1996.tb02915.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anxiety===
Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in the treatment of acute anxiety, as they bring about rapid and marked or moderate relief of symptoms in most individuals;&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004/&gt; however, they are not recommended beyond 2–4 weeks of use due to risks of tolerance and dependence and a lack of long-term effectiveness. As for insomnia, they may also be used on an irregular/&quot;as-needed&quot; basis, such as in cases where said anxiety is at its worst. Compared to other pharmacological treatments, benzodiazepines are twice as likely to lead to a relapse of the underlying condition upon discontinuation. Psychological therapies and other pharmacological therapies are recommended for the long-term treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Antidepressants have higher remission rates and are, in general, safe and effective in the short and long term.&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004/&gt;

===Other indications===
Benzodiazepines are often prescribed for a wide range of conditions:
* They can sedate patients receiving [[mechanical ventilation]] or those in extreme distress. Caution is exercised in this situation due to the risk of [[respiratory depression]], and it is recommended that [[benzodiazepine overdose]] treatment facilities should be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Devlin JW, Roberts RJ | title = Pharmacology of commonly used analgesics and sedatives in the ICU: benzodiazepines, propofol, and opioids | journal = Critical Care Clinics | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 431–49, vii | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19576523 | doi = 10.1016/j.ccc.2009.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Benzodiazepines are indicated in the management of breathlessness (shortness of breath) in advanced diseases, in particular where other treatments have failed to adequately control symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Steffen T.|last2=Higginson|first2=Irene J.|last3=Booth|first3=Sara|last4=Harding|first4=Richard|last5=Weingärtner|first5=Vera|last6=Bausewein|first6=Claudia|date=2016-10-20|title=Benzodiazepines for the relief of breathlessness in advanced malignant and non-malignant diseases in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD007354|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007354.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27764523|pmc=6464146}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Benzodiazepines are effective as medication given a couple of hours before surgery to relieve anxiety.

Because of their muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause [[hypoventilation|respiratory depression]] in susceptible individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated in people with [[myasthenia gravis]], [[sleep apnea]], [[bronchitis]], and [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-683-30128-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-444-50998-4&quot;/&gt; Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with [[personality disorders]] or [[intellectual disability]] because of frequent [[paradoxical reactions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-683-30128-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-444-50998-4&quot;/&gt; In [[major depressive disorder|major depression]], they may precipitate [[suicide|suicidal tendencies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Committee on Safety of Medicines |year=1988 |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=CON2024428&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased |format=PDF |title=Benzodiazepines, dependence and withdrawal symptoms |publisher=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency |accessdate=2009-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222015417/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dDocName=CON2024428&amp;RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased |archive-date=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-444-50998-4&quot;/&gt; Individuals with a history of alcohol, [[opioid]] and [[barbiturate]] abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-58829-211-8&quot;/&gt;

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] has categorized benzodiazepines into either [[Pregnancy category|category D or X]] meaning potential for harm in the unborn has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Roach SS, Ford SM |title=Introductory Clinical Pharmacology |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/introductoryclin0000roac |chapter-url-access=registration |edition=8th |year=2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-7595-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductoryclin0000roac/page/236 236] |chapter=Sedatives and hypnotics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to benzodiazepines during pregnancy has been associated with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]] in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate.

===Cognitive effects===
The short-term use of benzodiazepines adversely affects multiple areas of cognition, the most notable one being that it interferes with the formation and consolidation of memories of new material and may induce complete [[anterograde amnesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-683-30128-4&quot; /&gt; However, researchers hold contrary opinions regarding the effects of long-term administration. One view is that many of the short-term effects continue into the long-term and may even worsen, and are not resolved after stopping benzodiazepine usage. Another view maintains that cognitive deficits in chronic benzodiazepine users occur only for a short period after the dose, or that the anxiety disorder is the cause of these deficits.

While the definitive studies are lacking, the former view received support from a 2004 meta-analysis of 13 small studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762814&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart SA | title = The effects of benzodiazepines on cognition | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 66 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 9–13 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15762814 | url = http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0202.pdf | access-date = 2009-06-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051213232324/http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0202.pdf | archive-date = 2005-12-13 | url-status=dead | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14731058&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker MJ, Greenwood KM, Jackson M, Crowe SF | title = Cognitive effects of long-term benzodiazepine use: a meta-analysis | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–48 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14731058 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200418010-00004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meta-analysis found that long-term use of benzodiazepines was associated with moderate to large adverse effects on all areas of cognition, with [[Spatial visualization ability|visuospatial]] memory being the most commonly detected impairment. Some of the other impairments reported were decreased IQ, visiomotor coordination, information processing, verbal learning and concentration. The authors of the meta-analysis&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14731058&quot; /&gt; and a later reviewer&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762814&quot; /&gt; noted that the applicability of this meta-analysis is limited because the subjects were taken mostly from withdrawal clinics; the coexisting drug, alcohol use, and psychiatric disorders were not defined; and several of the included studies conducted the cognitive  measurements during the withdrawal period.

===Long-term worsening of psychiatric symptoms===
While benzodiazepines may have short-term benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use can result in a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced|depression]] and suicidality,&lt;ref name=&quot;Michelini_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lydiard_1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lydiard RB, Brawman-Mintzer O, Ballenger JC | title = Recent developments in the psychopharmacology of anxiety disorders | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 660–8 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8803355 | doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.64.4.660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep,&lt;ref name=&quot;Psychiatry_2008&quot; /&gt; withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders,&lt;ref name=&quot;Michelini_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lydiard_1996&quot; /&gt; inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gelpin E, Bonne O, Peri T, Brandes D, Shalev AY | title = Treatment of recent trauma survivors with benzodiazepines: a prospective study | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 57 | issue = 9 | pages = 390–4 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 9746445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosen CS, Greenbaum MA, Schnurr PP, Holmes TH, Brennan PL, Friedman MJ | title = Do benzodiazepines reduce the effectiveness of exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder? | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 12 | pages = 1241–8 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24434093 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.13m08592 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelm FH, Roth WT | title = Acute and delayed effects of alprazolam on flight phobics during exposure | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 831–41 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9299803 | doi = 10.1016/s0005-7967(97)00033-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matar MA, Zohar J, Kaplan Z, Cohen H | title = Alprazolam treatment immediately after stress exposure interferes with the normal HPA-stress response and increases vulnerability to subsequent stress in an animal model of PTSD | journal = European Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–95 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19167197 | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2008.12.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michelini_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curran HV, Collins R, Fletcher S, Kee SC, Woods B, Iliffe S | title = Older adults and withdrawal from benzodiazepine hypnotics in general practice: effects on cognitive function, sleep, mood and quality of life | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 1223–37 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14580077 | doi = 10.1017/s0033291703008213 | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/14113/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michelini_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Prescribing benzodiazepines in clinical practice|vauthors=Pary R, Lewis S |date = 2008|journal = Resident and Staff Physician |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=8–17|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tolerance====
The main problem of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence|dependence]]. Tolerance manifests itself as diminished pharmacological effect and develops relatively quickly to the sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant actions of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to anti-anxiety effects develops more slowly with little evidence of continued effectiveness beyond four to six months of continued use.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; In general, tolerance to the amnesic effects does not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10779253&quot; /&gt; However, controversy exists as to tolerance to the anxiolytic effects with some evidence that benzodiazepines retain efficacy&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16528135&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nardi AE, Perna G | title = Clonazepam in the treatment of psychiatric disorders: an update | journal = International Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 131–42 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16528135 | doi = 10.1097/01.yic.0000194379.65460.a6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposing evidence from a systematic review of the literature that tolerance frequently occurs&lt;ref name=Perugi /&gt;&lt;ref name=cgftmamoa2004 /&gt; and some evidence that anxiety may worsen with long-term use.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; The question of tolerance to the amnesic effects of benzodiazepines is, likewise, unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15762818&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Otto MW, Bruce SE, Deckersbach T | title = Benzodiazepine use, cognitive impairment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders: issues in the treatment of a patient in need | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 66 Suppl 2 | issue = Suppl 2 | pages = 34–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15762818 | url = http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0206.pdf | access-date = 2009-06-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051214010100/http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v66s02/v66s0206.pdf | archive-date = 2005-12-14 | url-status=dead | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that partial tolerance does develop, and that, &quot;memory impairment is limited to a narrow window within 90 minutes after each dose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15078112&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chouinard G | title = Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 65 Suppl 5 | issue = Suppl 5 | pages = 7–12 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15078112 | url = http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v65s05/v65s0502.pdf | access-date = 2009-06-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051213232617/http://psychiatrist.com/supplenet/v65s05/v65s0502.pdf | archive-date = 2005-12-13 | url-status=dead | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major disadvantage of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michelini_1996&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Long-term use of benzodiazepines: tolerance, dependence and clinical problems in anxiety and mood disorders|vauthors=Michelini S, Cassano GB, Frare F |date = 1996|journal = Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=29 |issue = 4|pages=127–134 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-979558 |pmid = 8858711|access-date = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, benzodiazepines are unlikely to be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety.

====Withdrawal symptoms and management====
[[File:Chlordiazepoxidetabletsgeneric.JPG|thumb|alt=White bottle on blue pad atop a desk. The bottle cap is off, and is upside down on the pad in front of the bottle. In the cap are a dozen black-and-yellow capsules.|[[Chlordiazepoxide]] 5&amp;nbsp;mg capsules, which are sometimes used as an alternative to [[diazepam]] for [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]]. Like diazepam it has a long [[elimination half-life]] and long-acting [[active metabolites]].]]

Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt reduction of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (two to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—[[Rebound effect|rebound]] and [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal]]. Rebound symptoms are the return of the symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of [[physical dependence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15078112&quot; /&gt;

The most frequent symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, [[tremor]]s, agitation, fearfulness, and [[Spasm|muscle spasms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15078112&quot; /&gt; The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, [[suicidal]] behavior, [[psychosis]], [[seizures]], and [[delirium tremens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-856667-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Harrison PC, Gelder MG, Cowen P |title=Shorter Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry |edition=5th |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |pages=461–2 |chapter=The misuse of alcohol and drugs |isbn=978-0-19-856667-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe symptoms usually occur as a result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19062773&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lader M, Tylee A, Donoghue J | title = Withdrawing benzodiazepines in primary care | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–34 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19062773 | doi = 10.2165/0023210-200923010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms may also occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are typically less severe and may persist as part of a protracted [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|withdrawal syndrome]] for months after cessation of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-19-852518-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Judith | last1 = Collier | first2 = Murray | last2 = Longmore | first3 = Keith | last3 = Amarakone | name-list-format = vanc | title = Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCxoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA368|date=31 January 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-150476-1|page=368 |chapter=Psychiatry }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for many months or in some cases a year or longer. Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity. Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time, eventually disappearing altogether.&lt;ref name=pmid1675688&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ashton H | title = Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines | journal = Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment | volume = 8 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 19–28 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1675688 | doi = 10.1016/0740-5472(91)90023-4 | url = http://benzo.org.uk/ashpws.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines have a reputation with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large part due to the withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested,&lt;ref name=pmid19062773 /&gt; but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, [[environmental stresses]], and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BNF_2009&quot;/&gt;{{rp|183–184|date=November 2012}}

Withdrawal is best managed by transferring the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam because it has the longest half-life of all of the benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions.&lt;ref name=pmid19062773/&gt; [[Chlordiazepoxide]], which also has a long half-life and long-acting [[active metabolites]], can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://benzo.org.uk/manual/ |title=Benzodiazepines: how they work &amp; how to withdraw (aka The Ashton Manual) |author=Ashton CH |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Lal R, Gupta S, Rao R, Kattimani S |title=Substance Use Disorder |url=http://www.whoindia.org/en/Section20/Section22_1674.htm |accessdate=2009-06-06 |year=2007 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |page=82 |chapter=Emergency management of substance overdose and withdrawal |chapterurl=http://www.whoindia.org/LinkFiles/Mental_Health_&amp;_substance_Abuse_Emergency_management_of_Substance_Overdose_and_Withdrawal-Manual_For_Nursing_Personnel.pdf |quote=Generally, a longer-acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam is used and the initial dose titrated downward |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613203853/http://whoindia.org/LinkFiles/Mental_Health_%26_substance_Abuse_Emergency_management_of_Substance_Overdose_and_Withdrawal-Manual_For_Nursing_Personnel.pdf |archive-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s are contraindicated during benzodiazepine withdrawal as they are [[cross tolerant]] with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence.&lt;ref name=tdamobd2004 /&gt; Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; During withdrawal, [[fluoroquinolone]]-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smmgp.org.uk/download/guidance/guidance025.pdf | title = Guidance for the use and reduction of misuse of benzodiazepines and other hypnotics and anxiolytics in general practice | last1 = Ford | first1 = Chris | last2 = Law | first2 = Fergus | name-list-format = vanc | date = July 2014 | website =smmgp.org.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially [[clozapine]], [[olanzapine]] or low potency [[phenothiazines]] e.g. [[chlorpromazine]] as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ebadi |first1=Manuchair | name-list-format = vanc | title = Desk Reference for Clinical Pharmacology |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=ihxyHbnj3qYC |edition=2nd |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=CRC Press |location=USA |isbn=978-1-4200-4743-1 |page=512 |chapter=Alphabetical presentation of drugs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial associations ===

==Interactions==
Individual benzodiazepines may have different [[drug interaction|interactions]] with certain drugs. Depending on their [[metabolism]] pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by [[cytochrome P450]] (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through [[glucuronidation]], such as [[lorazepam]], [[oxazepam]], and [[temazepam]], and, in general, have few drug interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-444-50998-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Meyler L, Aronson JK |title=Meyler's Side Effects of Drugs: the International Encyclopedia of Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions |edition=15th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=429–43 |isbn=978-0-444-50998-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many drugs, including [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], some [[antibiotic]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, and [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They reduce the rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]], the antibiotic [[rifampicin]], and the [[anticonvulsants]] [[carbamazepine]] and [[phenytoin]], accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-58829-211-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biadmtad&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Norman TR, Ellen SR, Burrows GD | title = Benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders: managing therapeutics and dependence | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | volume = 167 | issue = 9 | pages = 490–5 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9397065 | url = http://www.mja.com.au/public/mentalhealth/course/06norman.pdf | doi = 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1997.tb126684.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, [[opioid]]s and other [[depressant|central nervous system depressants]] potentiates their action.

[[Image:GABAA-receptor-protein-example.png|thumb|left|alt=Figure of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor complex where the five subunits (two alpha, two beta, and one gamma) are symmetrically arranged in a pentagon shape about a central ion conduction pore.

Benzodiazepines work by increasing the effectiveness of the endogenous chemical, [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]], to decrease the excitability of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Olsen RW, Betz H |veditors=Siegel GJ, Albers RW, Brady S, Price DD |title=Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects |edition=7th |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |pages=291–302 |chapter=GABA and glycine |isbn=978-0-12-088397-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces the communication between neurons and, therefore, has a calming effect on many of the functions of the brain.

GABA controls the excitability of neurons by binding to the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;/&gt; The GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is a [[multiprotein complex|protein complex]] located in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]] between neurons. All GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors contain an [[ion channel]] that conducts [[chloride]] ions across neuronal [[cell membrane]]s and two binding sites for the [[neurotransmitter]] gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), while a subset of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor complexes also contain a single binding site for benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex does not alter binding of GABA. Unlike other positive allosteric modulators that increases ligand binding, benzodiazepine binding acts as a positive allosteric modulator by increasing the total conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane when GABA is already bound to its receptor.  This increased chloride ion influx hyperpolarizes the neuron's [[membrane potential]]. As a result, the difference between resting potential and threshold potential is increased and [[action potential|firing]] is less likely.
Different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and, therefore, control distinct [[biological neural network|neuronal circuits]]. Hence, activation of different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16376150&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudolph U, Möhler H | title = GABA-based therapeutic approaches: GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subtype functions | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–23 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16376150 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2005.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, their similarities are too great to separate them into individual categories such as anxiolytic or hypnotic. For example, a hypnotic administered in low doses produces anxiety-relieving effects, whereas a benzodiazepine marketed as an anti-anxiety drug at higher doses induces sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Basant K. |last2=Tyrer |first2=Peter |title=Sciences Basic to Psychiatry |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KTbfRIqjLtUC |accessdate= 11 July 2009 |edition=2nd |date=28 August 1998 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |isbn=978-0-443-05514-0 |pages=155–156 |chapter=Clinical psychopharmacology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KTbfRIqjLtUC&amp;pg=PA149 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subset of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors that also bind benzodiazepines are referred to as benzodiazepine receptors (BzR). The GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is a [[heteromer]] composed of five subunits, the most common ones being two ''α''s, two ''β''s, and one ''γ'' (α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ1). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α&lt;sub&gt;1–6&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;1–3&lt;/sub&gt;, and γ&lt;sub&gt;1–3&lt;/sub&gt;). GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors that are made up of different combinations of subunit subtypes have different properties, different distributions in the brain and different activities relative to pharmacological and clinical effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8783370&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnston GA | title = GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor pharmacology | journal = Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | pages = 173–98 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8783370 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(95)02043-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the α and γ subunits on the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. Binding also requires that alpha subunits contain a [[histidine]] amino acid residue, (''i.e.'', [[GABRA1|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[GABRA2|α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[GABRA3|α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[GABRA5|α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors). For this reason, benzodiazepines show no affinity for GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors containing [[GABRA4|α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[GABRA6|α&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] subunits with an [[arginine]] instead of a histidine residue.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15157182&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wafford KA, Macaulay AJ, Fradley R, O'Meara GF, Reynolds DS, Rosahl TW | title = Differentiating the role of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor subtypes | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 32 | issue = Pt3 | pages = 553–6 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15157182 | doi = 10.1042/BST0320553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once bound to the benzodiazepine receptor, the benzodiazepine [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] locks the benzodiazepine receptor into a conformation in which it has a greater affinity for the [[gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] [[neurotransmitter]].

Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure, and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the [[allosteric]] modification of a specific kind of [[neurotransmitter receptor]], the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;/&gt; Other less important [[mode of action|modes of action]] are also known.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9504140&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16780077&quot;/&gt;

The term ''benzodiazepine'' is the [[IUPAC nomenclature|chemical name]] for the [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] ring system (see figure to the right), which is a fusion between the [[benzene]] and [[diazepine]] ring systems.&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;{{BlueBook1993 |pages=40–3 }}; {{cite journal |author=Moss GP |year=1998 |title=Nomenclature of fused and bridged fused ring systems (IUPAC Recommendations 1998) |url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1998/pdf/7001x0143.pdf |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=143–216 |doi=10.1351/pac199870010143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature]], a [[diazepine]] is a heterocycle with two [[nitrogen]] atoms, five [[carbon]] atom and the maximum possible number of cumulative [[double bond]]s.

Benzodiazepine drugs are substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines, although the chemical term can refer to many other compounds that do not have useful pharmacological properties. Different benzodiazepine drugs have different side groups attached to this central structure. The different side groups affect the binding of the molecule to the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and so modulate the pharmacological properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-088397-X&quot;/&gt; Many of the pharmacologically active &quot;classical&quot; benzodiazepine drugs contain the 5-phenyl-1''H''-benzo[''e''] [1,4]diazepin-2(3''H'')-one substructure (see figure to the right).&lt;ref name=CAS&gt;[[CAS registry number]]:{{CAS|2898-08-0|1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one}}; other names: Ro 05-2921, dechlorodemethyldiazepam.&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines have been found to mimic protein reverse turns structurally, which enable them with their biological activity in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ripka WC, De Lucca GV, Bach AC, Pottorf RS, Blaney JM | title = Protein β-turn mimetics I.

[[Nonbenzodiazepine]]s also bind to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor and possess similar pharmacological properties.

It was marketed by [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] from 1960 branded as ''Librium''.]]

The first benzodiazepine, [[chlordiazepoxide]] (''Librium''), was synthesized in 1955 by [[Leo Sternbach]] while working at [[Hoffmann–La Roche]] on the development of tranquilizers. The pharmacological properties of the compounds prepared initially were disappointing, and Sternbach abandoned the project. Two years later, in April 1957, co-worker Earl Reeder noticed a &quot;nicely crystalline&quot; compound left over from the discontinued project while spring-cleaning in the lab. This compound, later named chlordiazepoxide, had not been tested in 1955 because of Sternbach's focus on other issues. Expecting pharmacology results to be negative, and hoping to publish the chemistry-related findings, researchers submitted it for a standard battery of animal tests. The compound showed very strong [[sedative]], [[anticonvulsant]], and [[muscle relaxant]] effects. These impressive clinical findings led to its speedy introduction throughout the world in 1960 under the brand name ''Librium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid34039&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sternbach LH | title = The benzodiazepine story | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | year = 1979 | pmid = 34039 | doi = 10.1021/jm00187a001 | quote = During this cleanup operation, my co-worker, Earl Reeder, drew my attention to a few hundred milligrams of two products, a nicely crystalline base and its hydrochloride.

The new group of drugs was initially greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they were responsible for the largest-ever [[class-action lawsuit]] against [[drugs manufacturers|drug manufacturers]] in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 [[law firms]] that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of [[benzodiazepine dependence|dependence]] and [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = King MB | title = Is there still a role for benzodiazepines in general practice? | journal = British Journal of General Practice | volume = 42 | issue = 358 | pages = 202–5 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1389432 | pmc = 1372025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; [[legal aid]] had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlHouse of Commons&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmhealth/549/99072723.htm |title=Memorandum by Dr Reg Peart |author=Peart R |date=1999-06-01 |website=Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Select Committee on Health, House of Commons, UK Parliament |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This litigation led to changes in the [[British law]], making class action lawsuits more difficult.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

Benzodiazepines have been detected in plant specimens and brain samples of animals not exposed to synthetic sources, including a human brain from the 1940s. However, it is unclear whether these compounds are biosynthesized by microbes or by plants and animals themselves.

In Hong Kong, all benzodiazepines are regulated under Schedule 1 of [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong's]] Chapter 134 ''Dangerous Drugs Ordinance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Hong Kong Government | authorlink = Hong Kong Government | website = Hong Kong Ordinances | title = DANGEROUS DRUGS ORDINANCE&amp;nbsp;– SCHEDULE 1 | url = http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/134/sch1.html | publisher = hklii.org | location = Hong Kong }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously only [[brotizolam]], [[flunitrazepam]] and [[triazolam]] were classed as dangerous drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee KK, Chan TY, Chan AW, Lau GS, Critchley JA | title = Use and abuse of benzodiazepines in Hong Kong 1990-1993--the impact of regulatory changes | journal = Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 597–602 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8523479 | doi = 10.3109/15563659509010615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, benzodiazepines are categorized as [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule IV]] controlled drugs, apart from flunitrazepam, which is a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule III]] drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control |accessdate=2008-12-17 |author=International Narcotics Control Board |authorlink=International Narcotics Control Board |date=August 2003 |publisher=incb.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205125434/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |archivedate=2005-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British law requires that temazepam (but ''not'' midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority).&lt;ref&gt;Home Office (2005).

Benzodiazepines are used recreationally and by problematic drug misusers. [[Death|Mortality]] is higher among [[Poly drug use|poly-drug misusers]] that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases [[Mortality rate|mortality]] among poly-drug users.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlson_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlson F, Degenhardt L, McLaren J, Hall W, Lynskey M | title = A systematic review of research examining benzodiazepine-related mortality | journal = Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 93–103 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19125401 | doi = 10.1002/pds.1694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after as little as three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use has the potential to cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of [[panic attack]]s), and [[agoraphobia]].&lt;ref name=ohop&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=McIntosh A, Semple D, Smyth R, Burns J, Darjee R |title=Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry |edition=1st |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |page=540 |chapter=Depressants |isbn=978-0-19-852783-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines and, in particular, [[temazepam]] are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including [[abscess]]es, [[cellulitis]], [[thrombophlebitis]], arterial puncture, [[deep vein thrombosis]], and [[gangrene]]. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of [[hepatitis]], HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused [[intranasally]], which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9274553&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerada C, Ashworth M | title = ABC of mental health.

A 1999–2005 Australian police survey of detainees reported preliminary findings that self-reported users of benzodiazepines were less likely than non-user detainees to work full-time and more likely to receive government benefits, use methamphetamine or heroin, and be arrested or imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi336.pdf |title=Benzodiazepine use and harms among police detainees in Australia |author=Loxley W |year=2007 |issn=0817-8542 |journal=Trends &amp; Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice |issue=336 |accessdate=2009-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812072936/http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/publications/tandi_pdf/tandi336.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of [[drug assisted rape]] or robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kintz P | title = Bioanalytical procedures for detection of chemical agents in hair in the case of drug-facilitated crimes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 388 | issue = 7 | pages = 1467–74 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17340077 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-007-1209-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, [[anecdotal evidence]] suggests that [[temazepam]] may be the most psychologically [[Substance dependence|habit-forming (addictive)]] benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions in some parts of the world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzab.htm |title=Benzodiazepine abuse |publisher=Benzo.org.uk |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1786493&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Farré M, Camí J | title = Pharmacokinetic considerations in abuse liability evaluation | journal = British Journal of Addiction | volume = 86 | issue = 12 | pages = 1601–6 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1786493 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1991.tb01754.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Busto U, Sellers EM | title = Pharmacokinetic determinants of drug abuse and dependence.

==Veterinary use==
Benzodiazepines are used in [[veterinary]] practice in the treatment of various disorders and conditions. As in humans, they are used in the first-line management of [[seizures]], [[status epilepticus]], and [[tetanus]], and as maintenance therapy in epilepsy (in particular, in cats).&lt;ref name = MVM&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Kahn CM, Line S, Aiello SE |title=The Merck Veterinary Manual|year=2005 |publisher=Wiley |edition=9th |isbn=978-0-911910-50-6 |title-link=Merck Veterinary Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Frey HH | title = Anticonvulsant drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy | journal = Problems in Veterinary Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 558–77 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2520134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Podell M | title = Seizures in dogs | journal = Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 779–809 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8813750 | doi = 10.1016/S0195-5616(96)50105-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are widely used in small and large animals (including horses, swine, cattle and exotic and wild animals) for their anxiolytic and sedative effects, as pre-medication before surgery, for induction of [[anesthesia]] and as adjuncts to anesthesia.&lt;ref name = MVM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite book |author=Gross ME |chapter=Tranquilizers, α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic agonists, and related agents |editor=Adams RH |title=Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics |edition=8th |publisher=Iowa State University Press |year=2001 |pages=325–33 |isbn=978-0-8138-1743-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
