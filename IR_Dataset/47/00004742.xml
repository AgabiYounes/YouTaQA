{{nihongo|'''''Bubblegum Crisis'''''|バブルガムクライシス|Baburugamu Kuraishisu|lead=yes}} is a 1987 to 1991 [[cyberpunk]] [[original video animation]] (OVA) series produced by [[Youmex]] and animated by [[Anime International Company|AIC]] and [[Artmic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Cannes 09: Bubblegum Crisis: The Movie - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/14/cannes-09-bubblegum-crisis-the-movie|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was planned to run for 13 episodes, but was cut short to just 8.

The series involves the adventures of the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of [[mercenaries]] who don [[powered exoskeleton]]s and fight numerous problems, most frequently rogue robots. The success of the series spawned [[#Spin-offs|several sequel series.]]

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Bubblegum Crisis characters}}

The series begins in late 2032, seven years after the Second Great Kanto earthquake has split [[Tokyo]] geographically and culturally in two. During the first episode, disparities in wealth are shown to be more pronounced than in previous periods in post-war Japan. The main adversary is Genom, a [[megacorporation]] with immense power and global influence. Its main product are [[Boomer (Bubblegum Crisis)|boomers]]—artificial cybernetic life forms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machine; also known as &quot;cyberoids&quot;. While Boomers are intended to serve mankind, they become deadly instruments in the hands of ruthless individuals. The AD Police are tasked to deal with Boomer-related crimes. One of the series' themes is the inability of the department to deal with threats due to political infighting, [[red tape]], and an insufficient budget.

==Setting==
The setting displays strong influences from the movies ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Streets of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Animerica2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.12/bubblegumcrisis.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040212053530/http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.12/bubblegumcrisis.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-02-12|title=Animerica: Animerica Feature: Bubblegum Crisis|date=2004-02-12|access-date=2019-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FilmMonthly&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/video_and_dvd/bubblegum_crisis_retrospective_part_i_1.html|title=Film Monthly.com – Bubblegum Crisis Retrospective: Part I|website=www.filmmonthly.com|access-date=2019-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening sequence of episode 1 is modeled on the opening sequence of ''Streets of Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://teleport-city.com/2014/06/02/streets-of-fire/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-04-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905062027/http://teleport-city.com/2014/06/02/streets-of-fire/ |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanoid robots known as &quot;boomers&quot; in the series also resemble Terminators cyborgs from the ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' film.&lt;ref name=&quot;FilmMonthly&quot;/&gt;

Suzuki explained in a 1993 ''[[Animerica]]'' interview the meaning behind the cryptic title: &quot;We originally named the series 'bubblegum' to reflect a world in crisis, like a chewing-gum bubble that's about to burst.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Horibuchi |first= Seiji |date= May 1993 |title= The Animerica interview: Toshimichi Suzuki|url= |journal= [[Animerica]] |location= |volume= 1| number=3|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The series started with [[Toshimichi Suzuki]]'s intention to remake the 1982 film ''[[Techno Police 21C]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Animerica1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/bgc.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407164515/http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/bgc.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-04-07|title=Animerica: Animerica Feature: Bubblegum Crisis|date=2004-04-07 |via=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he met [[Junji Fujita]] and the two discussed ideas, and decided to collaborate on what later became ''Bubblegum Crisis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Animerica1&quot;/&gt; [[Kenichi Sonoda]] acted as character designer, and designed the four female leads. [[Masami Ōbari]] created the mechanical designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Animerica1&quot;/&gt; Obari would also go on to direct episodes 5 and 6.

The OVA series is eight episodes long but was originally slated to run for 13 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/06.php|title=Specials - Anime in Retrospect: Bubblegum Crisis |date=December 2005|website=Animefringe|access-date=2019-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to legal problems between [[Artmic]] and [[Youmex]], who jointly held the rights to the series, the series was discontinued prematurely.

==Release==
In North America, [[AnimEigo]] first released ''Bubblegum Crisis'' to VHS and Laserdisc in 1991 in Japanese with English subtitles. The series is notable in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from [[Japan]] unedited and subtitled in English. While anime has become much more popular in the years since, in 1991, it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America. ''Bubblegum Crisis'' was aired in the US when it first aired on [[PBS]] affiliate [[KTEH-TV|Superstation KTEH]] in the 1990s, and [[STARZ!]]'s [[Encore (TV channel)|Action Channel]] in 2000.

An English dub of the series was produced beginning in 1994 by AnimEigo through Southwynde Studios in Wilmington, NC, and released to VHS and Laserdisc beginning that year. A digitally-remastered compilation, featuring bilingual audio tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by AnimEigo. The company later successfully crowdfunded a collector's edition Blu-ray release through [[Kickstarter]] in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madoverlord/bubblegum-crisis-ultimate-edition-blu-ray-set|title=Bubblegum Crisis Ultimate Edition Blu-Ray Set|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was released on a regular edition Blu-ray on September 25, 2018. The series is currently available for streaming on [[Night Flight Plus]].

===Soundtracks===
There are eight soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous &quot;vocal&quot; albums which feature songs &quot;inspired by&quot; the series as well as many drawn directly from it.

==Legacy==
[[Masaki Kajishima]] and [[Hiroki Hayashi]], who both worked on the ''Bubblegum Crisis'' OAVs, cite the show as being the inspiration for their harem series ''[[Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki]]''. In an interview with AIC, Hayashi described ''Bubblegum Crisis'' as &quot;a pretty gloomy anime. Serious fighting, complicated human relationships, and dark Mega Tokyo.&quot; They thought it would be fun to create some comedy episodes with ideas like the girls going to the hot springs, but it was rejected by the sponsors. He also said that there was a trend to have a bunch of characters of one gender and a single one of the other gender, and asked what if Mackey (Sylia's brother) was a main character, reversing the ''Bubblegum'' scenario. This idea then became the basis for Tenchi. Hayashi said that Mackey is &quot;sort of&quot; the original model for Tenchi.&lt;ref name=&quot;hayashi interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705232238/http://www.aicanime.com/about/interview_hayashi.html | archivedate=July 5, 2011 | url-status=dead | work = AIC Anime English Website | publisher=[[Anime International Company]] | title=Interview with Hiroki Hayashi | date=February 2011 | url=http://www.aicanime.com/about/interview_hayashi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Siembieda]]'s becoming aware of &quot;Boomers&quot; being already in use in this caused him to changed his planned name for the [[Rifts RPG|''Rifts'' RPG]] which he had named after the &quot;Boom Gun&quot;–wielding power armor which was also renamed to ''Glitter Boy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rifts Ultimate Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs==
===''Bubblegum Crash''===
[[File:Bubblegum Crash Total Crash Collection-DVDcover.jpg|thumb|right|DVD cover from ''Bubblegum Crash Total Crash Collection'']]

The success of the series spawned several sequel series. The first of them was the three-part OVA {{nihongo|''Bubblegum Crash''|バブルガムクラッシュ!|Baburugamu Kurasshu!}}. After the split between Artmic and Youmex, Artmic proceeded to make a sequel on their own, ''Bubblegum Crash'', which ran three OVA episodes and is conjectured that it was a shortened version of how ''Crisis'' was to end. Youmex promptly sued Artmic, cutting ''Crash'' short and tying the entire franchise up in legal issues for the next several years.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}}

It is set in 2034, and the Knight Sabers seem to be finished; each of its members—except Nene—have seemingly drifted off to pursue their own goals. But at the same time, parts of a unique [[artificial intelligence]] are stolen by several villains acting under the orders of a mysterious voice. Unexpectedly, Sylia resurfaces and prepares her teammates for battle. And as a gigantic machine drills its way to Mega Tokyo's main nuclear power plant, they meet again with an old and deadly enemy.
