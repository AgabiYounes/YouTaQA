The '''Cholistan Desert''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''صحرائے چولستان'''}}}}; [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: {{Nastaliq|چولستان روہی}}), also locally known as '''Rohi''' ({{Nastaliq|روہی}}), sprawls {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Bahawalpur]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] and covers an area of {{convert|16000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It adjoins the [[Thar Desert]], extending over to [[Sindh]] and into [[India]].

The word Cholistan is derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''chol'',  meaning ''desert''. The people of Cholistan lead a semi-nomadic life, moving from one place to another in search of water and fodder for their animals. The dry bed of the [[Hakra River]] runs through the area, along which many settlements of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been found.

The desert also hosts an annual Jeep rally, known as [[Cholistan Desert Jeep Rally]].

==Culture and traditions==

[[File:Cholistan.jpg|thumb|Cholistani Huts]]
===Local crafts===
As mentioned above, the Indus Valley has always been occupied by the wandering [[Nomad|nomadic]] tribes, who are fond of isolated areas, as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion, enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures. Cholistan till the era of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] had also been isolated from outside influence. During the rule of [[Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar|Mughal Emperor Akbar]], it became a proper productive unit. The entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers. The rulers were the great patrons of art, and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development, influencing each other. Masons, stone carvers, artisans, artists, and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites, and with that flourished new courts, paintings, weaving, and pottery. The fields of architecture, sculpture, terra cotta, and pottery developed greatly in this phase.

===Livestock===
The backbone of Cholistan economy is cattle breeding. It has the major importance for satisfying the area's major needs for cottage industry as well as milk meat and fat. Because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale, milked or shorn for their wool. Moreover, isolated as they were, they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food, clothing, and all the items of daily use. So all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well. The estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 1.6 million.

===Cotton and wool products===
Cholistan produces very superior type of carpet wool as compared to that produced in other parts of Pakistan. From this wool they knit beautiful carpets, rugs and other woolen items. This includes blankets, which is also a local necessity for the desert is not just a land of dust and heat, but winter nights here are very cold, usually below freezing points. Khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton. Khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base. Cholistanis now sell the wool for it brings maximum profit.

===Textiles===
It may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark of craft of Indus valley civilization. Various kinds of khaddar-cloth are made for local consumption, and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here. A beautiful cloth called Sufi is also woven of silk and cotton, or with cotton wrap and silk wool. Gargas are made with numerous patterns and color, having complicated embroidery, mirror, and patchwork. Ajrak is another specialty of Cholistan. It is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth. Cotton turbans and shawls are also made here. Chunri is another form of dopattas, having innumerable colors and patterns like dots, squares, and circles on it.

===Camel products===
Camels are highly valued by the desert dwellers. Camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes, but its skin and wool are also quite worthwhile. Camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs. The camel's leather is also utilized in making kuppies,{{which lang|date=January 2020}} goblets, and expensive lampshades.

===Leatherwork===
Leatherwork is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here. Other than the products mentioned above, Khusa (shoes) is a specialty of this area. Cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship, variety, and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightly colored threads.

===Jewellery ===
The Cholistanis are fond of jewellery, especially gold jewellery. The chief ornaments made and worn by them are ''Nath'' (nose gay), ''Katmala'' (necklace) ''Kangan'' (bracelet), and ''Pazeb'' (anklets). Gold and silver bangles are also a product of Cholistan. The locals similarly work in enamel, producing enamel buttons, earrings, bangles, and rings.

==Forests in Cholistan==
There is a rain forest in Cholistan named &quot;Dodhla Forest&quot;

==Wildlife==
The wildlife of Cholistan desert mostly consists of migratory birds, especially [[Houbara bustard]] who migrates to this part during winters. This species of birds is most famous in the hunting season, even though they are [[endangered]] in [[Pakistan]] ([[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] globally), according to [[IUCN Red List]]. Their population has decreased from 4,746 in 2001 to just a few dozens in recent times.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune.com.pk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/121981/cholistan-wildlife-gazelles-migratory-birds-threatened-by-poachers/|title=Cholistan wildlife: Gazelles, migratory birds threatened by poachers - The Express Tribune|author=|date=22 February 2011|website=tribune.com.pk|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In December 2016, a Qatari prince, had his hunting license rejected due to the species being endangered. Another prince, Dr. Fahad was fined with Rs. 80,000 ($760) and all of the birds he caught were set free for hunting without permit and license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/123630-Qatar-prince-not-allowed-to-hunt-houbara-bustard|title=Qatar prince not allowed to hunt houbara bustard|author=|date=|website=www.geo.tv|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The other endangered species in this desert is [[Chinkara]], their population has also decreased from 3,000 in 2007 to just a few above 1,000 in 2010 due to non-permit hunting of the species by influential political families.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune.com.pk&quot;/&gt;

The Indus civilization was the earliest centre of ceramics, and thus the pottery of Cholistan has a long history. Local soil is very fine and suitable for making pottery. The fineness of the earth can be observed on the Kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like they have been white washed. The chief Cholistani ceramic articles are their surahies,{{which lang|date=January 2020}} piyalas,{{which lang|date=January  and glasses, remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing.

In the early times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed, but from the seventh century onwards, a large number of temples and images were also built on account of the intensified religious passions and the accumulation of wealth in cities. The building activity reached to such an extent that some cities actually became city temples. In fact the area particularly came to be known for its forts, villas, palaces, havelis,{{which lang|date=January  gateways, fortifications, and city walls.
