{{Short description|Classic texts of Chinese literature}}

'''Chinese classic texts''' or '''canonical texts''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|中國|古典|典籍}}|s={{linktext|中国|古典|典籍}}|p=Zhōngguó gǔdiǎn diǎnjí}}) refers to the Chinese texts which originated before the imperial unification by the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC, particularly the &quot;[[Four Books and Five Classics]]&quot; of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] tradition, themselves a customary abridgment of the &quot;[[Thirteen Classics]]&quot;. All of these pre-Qin texts were written in [[classical Chinese]]. All three canons are collectively known as the '''classics''' (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|經}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|经}}}}, ''jīng'', &lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;[[warp (weaving)|warp]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=Voorst&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthology of World Scriptures|author=Voorst, Robert E. Van|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=0-495-50387-8|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese classic texts may more broadly refer to texts written either in [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], in 1912. These can include ''shi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|史}}}}, [[Chinese historiography|historical works]]), ''zi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|子}}}}, [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical works]] belonging to schools of thought other than the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] but also including works on agriculture, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], mathematics, [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], divination, art criticism, and other miscellaneous writings) and ''ji'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|集}}}}, literary works) as well as ''[[jing (Chinese medicine)]]''.

In the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars who wished to take the [[Imperial examination|imperial exams]] to become [[mandarin (official)|government officials]]. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] (or, in some periods, even a military officer) without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the [[Chinese characters]] of the &quot;[[Three Character Classic]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Hundred Family Surnames]]&quot; and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.

Scholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of the books]] during the fall of the Qin dynasty, when many of the original pre-Qin texts were lost.&lt;ref name=Voorst/&gt;

==Before 221 BC==
It is often difficult or impossible to precisely date pre-Qin works beyond their being &quot;pre-Qin&quot;, a period of 1000 years. Information in ancient China was often passed down orally for generations before being written down, so the order of composition of the texts need not be the same as that of their attributed &quot;authors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge History of Ancient China chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The below list is therefore organized in the order found in the [[Siku Quanshu]], the imperial library of the Qing dynasty. The Siku classifies all works into 4 top-level branches: the Confucian Classics and their secondary literature; history; philosophy; and poetry. There are sub-categories within each branch, but due to the small number of pre-Qin works in the Classics, History and Poetry branches, the sub-categories are only reproduced for the Philosophy branch.

=== The Thirteeen Classics ===
The most important pre-Qin works that later became the official curriculum of the imperial examination system from the Song dynasty onward are the [[Thirteen Classics]].  This is a slightly different organization of the works of the Classics branch.  In total, these works total to more than 600,000 characters that must be memorized in order to pass the examination.  Moreover, these works are accompanied by extensive commentary and annotation, containing approximately 300 million characters by some estimates.
