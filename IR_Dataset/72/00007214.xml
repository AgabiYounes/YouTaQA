In [[Greek mythology]], '''Callisto''' or '''Kallisto''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|s|t|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc|Καλλιστώ}} {{IPA-grc|kallistɔ̌ː|}}) was a [[nymph]], or the daughter  of King [[Lycaon (Arcadia)|Lycaon]]; the myth varies in such details.  She was one of the followers of [[Artemis]], or Diana for the Romans, who attracted [[Zeus]] (Jupiter).  He transformed himself into the figure of Artemis and raped her in this disguise.  She became pregnant and when this was eventually discovered, she was expelled from  Artemis's group, after which a furious [[Hera]] (Juno, wife of her seducer) transformed her into a [[Bears in antiquity|bear]].  Later, just as she was about to be killed by her son when he was hunting, she was [[Catasterismi|set among the stars]] as [[Ursa Major]] (&quot;the Great Bear&quot;).  She was the bear-mother of the [[Arcadia]]ns, through her son [[Arcas]] by Zeus.

The [[Callisto (moon)|fourth Galilean moon of Jupiter]] is named after Callisto.

==Myth==
As a follower of Artemis, Callisto, who [[Hesiod]] said&lt;ref&gt;In his lost ''Astronomy'', quoted in ''[[Catasterismi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was the daughter of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]], king of [[Arcadia]],&lt;ref&gt;Other writers gave her a mortal genealogy as the daughter of one or the other of Lycaon's sons: Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; took a vow to remain a virgin, as did all the nymphs of Artemis. But to have sex with her, Zeus disguised himself as Artemis ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]) herself, in order to lure her into his embrace. Callisto was then turned into a [[bear]], as [[Hesiod]] described:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...but afterwards, when she was already with child, was seen bathing and so discovered. Upon this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Either Artemis &quot;slew Kallisto with a shot of her silver bow,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Homer#Works ascribed to Homer|Homerica, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', 316 ff (trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White).&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps urged by the wrath of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] ([[Hera]])&lt;ref&gt;This was the version current in Greece when Pausanias visited in the second century CE ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], VIII.35.8).&lt;/ref&gt; or later [[Arcas]], the [[eponym]] of [[Arcadia]], nearly killed his bear-mother, when she had wandered into the [[Temenos|forbidden precinct]] of Zeus. In every case, Zeus placed them both in the sky as the [[constellation]]s [[Ursa Major]], called ''Arktos'' (αρκτος), the &quot;Bear&quot;, by Greeks, and [[Ursa Minor]].
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Diana and Callisto - WGA20326.jpg|thumb|[[Diana and Callisto (Rubens)|''Diana and Callisto'']] by [[Rubens]], c. 1635]]

According to [[Ovid]],&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. Book II, Lines 405–531; Ovid narrates the myth also in ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', book II.&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Zeus) who took the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno’s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was separated from Diana and the other nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;The transformation of Zeus, with its [[lesbian]] overtones, was rendered as comedy in a lost work by the Attic Amphis ([http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html Theoi Project – Kallisto]).&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto's subsequent pregnancy was discovered several months later while she was bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Diana became enraged when she saw that Callisto was pregnant and expelled her from the group.  Callisto later gave birth to [[Arcas]]. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor|Minor]], respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] that the two might never meet her waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] positions in ancient times (see below).

==In art==
[[File:Callisto - Par Gillis CONGNET.jpg|thumb|[[Gillis Coignet]], 1580]]
Callisto's story was sometimes depicted in [[classical art]], where the moment of transformation into a bear was the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;Gods&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Renaissance on a series of major [[history painting]]s as well as many smaller [[cabinet painting]]s and book illustrations, usually called &quot;Diana and Callisto&quot;, depicted the traumatic moment of discovery of the pregnancy, as the goddess and her nymphs bathed in a pool, following [[Ovid]]'s account.  The subject's attraction was undoubtedly mainly the opportunity it offered for a group of several females to be shown largely nude.&lt;ref&gt;There is a good but by no means complete, selection at [http://iconographic.warburg.sas.ac.uk/vpc/VPC_search/subcats.php?cat_1=5&amp;cat_2=244&amp;cat_3=2345&amp;cat_4=3995 Warburg Institute Iconographic Database, Myths → Callisto's pregnancy discovered by Diana]; more on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1556-1559), was the greatest (though not the first) of these, quickly disseminated by a print by [[Cornelius Cort]].&lt;ref&gt;Brigstocke, 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, as in most subsequent depictions, Diana points angrily, as Callisto is held by two nymphs, who may be pulling off what little clothing remains on her.  Other versions include [[Diana and Callisto (Rubens)|one by Rubens]], and ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto]]'' by [[Rembrandt]], which unusually combines the moment with the arrival of [[Actaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Gods&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic composition is rather unusually consistent.  [[Carlo Ridolfi]] said there was a version by [[Giorgione]], who died in 1510, though his many attributions to Giorgione of paintings that are now lost are treated with suspicion by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Martineau (ed), ''The Genius of Venice, 1500–1600'', 207, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Other, less dramatic, treatments before Titian established his composition are by [[Palma Vecchio]] and [[Dosso Dossi]].

Although Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy, in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  With the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' in religious art, this was the leading recurring subject in history painting that required showing [[pregnancy in art]], which [[Early Modern]] painters still approached with some caution.  In any case, the narrative required that the rest of the group had not previously noticed the pregnancy.

Callisto being seduced by Zeus/Jupiter in disguise was also a popular subject, usually called &quot;Jupiter and Callisto&quot;; it was the clearest common subject with lesbian lovers from classical mythology.  The two lovers are usually shown happily embracing in a bower. The violent rape described by Ovid as following Callisto's realization of what is going on is rarely shown.  In versions before about 1700 Callisto may show some doubt about what is going on, as in the versions by Rubens. It was especially popular in the 18th century, when depictions were increasingly erotic; [[François Boucher]] painted several versions.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Gods&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''Callisto'' is lost.

==Origin of the myth==
[[File:Karel Philips Spierincks - Jupiter and Callisto.jpg|thumb|left|330px|''Jupiter and Callisto'' by [[Karel Philips Spierincks]]. In the background Jupiter's jealous wife Juno is dragging Callisto by the hair.]]
The name ''Kalliste'' ({{lang|grc|Καλλίστη}}), &quot;most beautiful&quot;, may be recognized as an [[epithet]] of the goddess herself, though none of the inscriptions at Athens that record priests of ''Artemis Kalliste'' ({{lang|grc|Ἄρτεμις Καλλίστη}}), date before the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Geagan. &quot;The Athenian Constitution After Sulla&quot; (''Hesperia Supplements'' '''12''' 1967:72, 95).&lt;/ref&gt; Artemis Kalliste was worshiped in Athens in a shrine which lay outside the Dipylon gate, by the side of the road to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Klio: Beiträge Zur Alten Geschichte'' (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften Zu Berlin Institut für Griechisch-Römische Altertumskunde) 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; W. S. Ferguson suggested&lt;ref&gt;In ''Klio'' '''7''' (1907:213f).&lt;/ref&gt; that Artemis Soteira and Artemis Kalliste were joined in a common cult administered by a single priest. The bearlike character of Artemis herself was a feature of the [[Brauronia]].

The myth in ''[[Catasterismi]]'' may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, [[Boötes]], and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. The [[Boötes|constellation Boötes]], was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic ''Astronomia'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀστρονομία}})&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Astronomia'', fragment 3, preserved as a quote in a commentary on [[Aratus]].&lt;/ref&gt; as Arcas, the &quot;Bear-warden&quot; (''Arktophylax''; {{lang|grc|Ἀρκτοφύλαξ}}):&lt;ref&gt;Thus Hesiod is quoted, though Boötes, {{lang|grc|Βοώτης}}, from his very name, is a ''cow'' ({{lang|grc|βοως}}) herdsman.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He is Arkas the son of Kallisto and Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [Arkas] which he had cut up.&lt;ref&gt;The episode is a doublet of the serving up of [[Pelops]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Sebastiano Ricci - Diana and Callisto - WGA19416.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastiano Ricci]], ''Diana and Callisto'', 1712-16]]
The stars of Ursa Major were all circumpolar in Athens of 400 BCE, and all but the stars in the Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.

According to Julien d'Huy, who used phylogenetic and statistical tools, the story could be a recent transformation of a Palaeolithic myth.&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy Julien, Un ours dans les étoiles: recherche phylogénétique Sur un mythe préhistorique. Préhistoire du sud-ouest, 20 (1), 2012: 91-106 [https://www.academia.edu/3226058/Un_ours_dans_les_etoiles_recherche_phylogenetique_sur_un_mythe_prehistorique._-_Prehistoire_du_sud-ouest_20_1_2012_91-106]; A Cosmic Hunt in the Berber sky : a phylogenetic reconstruction of Palaeolithic mythology.
