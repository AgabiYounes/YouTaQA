{{LGBT topics and Christianity}}
Within [[Christianity]], there are a variety of views on [[sexual orientation]] and [[homosexuality]]. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views, and not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality.

This article focuses on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, covering how the extent to which the Bible mentions the subject, whether or not it is condemned, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics. Significant debate has arisen over the proper interpretation of the Levitical code; the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]; and various Pauline passages, and whether these verses condemn same-sex sexual activities.

In January 2018 German bishop [[Franz-Josef Bode]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Osnabrück]], and in February 2018 German Roman Catholic cardinal [[Reinhard Marx]], chairman of the [[German Bishops' Conference]] said in interviews with German journalists that [[blessing of same-sex unions]] is possible in Roman Catholic churches in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/Bischof-Bode-fuer-Segnung-von-Homo-Paaren,segnung100.html NDR.de: Bischof für Segnung von homosexuellen Paaren (German)], 10 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.br.de/nachrichten/kardinal-marx-homosexuelle-100.html Bayrischer Rundfunk.de: &quot;Segnung homosexueller Paare ist möglich&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/reinhard-marx-kardinal-stellt-segnung-homosexueller-paare-in-aussicht-a-1191270.html Spiegel.de: Kardinal Marx stellt Segnung homosexueller Paare in Aussicht]&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria blessing of same sex unions is allowed in two churches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kirchenzeitung.at/site/archiv/article/20836.html | title=Segen für Verliebte in Oberösterreichs Pfarren  | language=de | date=6 February 2018 | work=KirchenZeitung | first=Paul | last=Stütz | accessdate=25 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=30651 Queer.de:Zum Valentinstag: Katholische Diözese segnet auch Homo-Paare](german)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox churches===
{{Expand section|date=January 2019}}
The Orthodox Church shares a long history of Church teachings and canon law with the Catholic Church and has a similar conservative stance on homosexuality. Some [[Orthodox Church]] jurisdictions, such as the [[Orthodox Church in America]], have taken the approach of welcoming people with &quot;homosexual feelings and emotions,&quot; while encouraging them to work towards &quot;overcoming its harmful effects in their lives,&quot; while not allowing the [[sacraments]] to people who seek to justify homosexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26 Orthodox Church in America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709033038/http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26 |date=9 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coptic.net/articles/OnHomosexuality.txt M.

The issue of gay marriage seems to be strongly rejected, even in Greece, where half of Orthodox Christians don't believe that homosexuality should be discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pewforum.org/2017/11/08/orthodox-take-socially-conservative-views-on-gender-issues-homosexuality/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other [[Christian denominations]] do not view monogamous same-sex relationships as sinful or immoral, and may [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|bless such unions and consider them marriages]].

The [[Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals]] (GAAAP), traces its roots back to 1980, making it the oldest LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostal denomination in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.affirmingapostolic.com |title=GAAAP |publisher=Affirmingapostolic.com |accessdate=12 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903095043/http://www.affirmingapostolic.com/ |archivedate= 3 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such organization is the [[Affirming Pentecostal Church International]], currently the largest affirming Pentecostal organization, with churches in the US, UK, Central and South America, Europe and Africa.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lutheran]]&lt;ref name=&quot;LCMS – Homosexuality&quot; /&gt; churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The [[United Church of Canada]] also allows same-sex marriage, and views [[sexual orientation]] as a gift from God. Within the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]], there are openly gay clergy; for example, [[Gene Robinson]] is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion, there are openly gay clergy, too; for example, bishop [[Eva Brunne]] is an openly lesbian Bishop in the [[Church of Sweden]]. Such religious groups and denominations  interpret scripture and doctrine in a way that leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the [[United Church of Canada]], that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that &quot;a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full members of the Church''; and ''b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 Chronology of Marriage and Equality Rights in the United Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425181001/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology#1988 |date=25 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that &quot;human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Same-Sex Marriage Legislation Offers a Win-Win Solution, Says The United Church of Canada,&quot; 2005-FEB-01, United Church of Canada, at: http://www.united-church.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some Christian denominations such as the [[Moravian Church]], believe that the [[Bible]] speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy on homosexuality and the ordination of homosexuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Moravian Interprovincial Faith &amp; Order Commission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html |title=On Homosexuality and Ordination |publisher=The Moravian Interprovincial Faith &amp; Order Commission |accessdate=22 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722092332/http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html |archivedate=22 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Moravian Church in Europe allowed [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessings of same-sex unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idea.de/frei-kirchen/detail/brueder-unitaet-kuenftig-sind-homo-segnungen-moeglich-28126.html|title=Brüder-Unität: Künftig sind Homo-Segnungen möglich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Quakers, those in membership of [[Britain Yearly Meeting]] and [[Friends General Conference]] in the US approve of same-sex marriage and union. Quakers were the first Christian group in the United Kingdom to advocate for equal marriage and [[Quakers in Britain]] formally recognised same-sex relationships in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quakers in Britain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.quaker.org.uk/about-quakers/our-history/marriage-equality|title =Quakers and same sex marriage|work=Quakers in Britain |location=Friends House, London|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian &quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/31/quakers-gay-marriage| title = Quakers said same-sex couples 'miss the public recognition of their partnership in a religious ceremony'|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate = 22 November 2009  | first=Riazat | last=Butt | date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New England Yearly Meeting of Friends&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf |title=Homosexuality and Quakerism |publisher=[[New England Yearly Meeting]] |accessdate=22 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008224923/http://neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf |archivedate= 8 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Methodist Church]] elected a lesbian bishop in 2016, and on May 7, 2018, the Council of Bishops proposed the One Church Plan, which would allow individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBT clergy and perform same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.advocate.com/religion/2018/5/05/methodist-bishops-back-choice-lgbt-clergy-same-sex-marriage Advocate: Methodist Bishops Back Choice on LGBT Clergy, Same-Sex Marriage]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2019, a special session of the General Conference rejected the One Church Plan and voted to strengthen its official opposition to same-sex marriages and ordaining openly LGBT clergy.&lt;ref name=Zauzmer&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/02/26/united-methodist-church-votes-maintain-its-opposition-same-sex-marriage-gay-clergy/|title = United Methodist Church votes to maintain its opposition to same-sex marriage, gay clergy|work = [[The Washington Post]]|date = February 26, 2019|accessdate = February 26, 2019|last1 = Zauzmer|first1 = Julie|last2 = Bailey|first2 = Sarah Pulliam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Various positions====
Churches within [[Lutheranism]] hold stances on the issue ranging from labeling homosexual acts as sinful, to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;LCMS – Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lcms.org/Documents.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=1100| title = What about Homosexuality?|publisher = [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]|accessdate = 26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WELS – Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/social-issues/acceptance-homosexuals |work= WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Acceptance of homosexuals |publisher= [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |date=27 Oct 2009 |accessdate = 27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Denmark]], the [[Church of Norway]] or lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] conducts [[same-sex marriage]]s, while the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;ELCA – Sodomy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4253 |title= ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans |publisher= [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] |accessdate= 22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian [[Mekane Yesus]] Lutheran Church, however, has taken a stand that marriage is inherently between a man and a woman, and has formally broken fellowship with the ELCA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecmy.org/?home=po&amp;page=!news&amp;newscategory=/&amp;article=62|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a doctrinal stand that has cost the Ethiopian church ELCA financial support.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] &quot;recognizes that every human being is valuable in the sight of God, and seeks to minister to all men and women [including homosexuals] in the spirit of Jesus,&quot; while maintaining that homosexual sex itself is forbidden in the Bible.  &quot;Jesus affirmed the dignity of all human beings and reached out compassionately to persons and families suffering the consequences of sin. He offered caring ministry and words of solace to struggling people, while differentiating His love for sinners from His clear teaching about sinful practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adventist.org/information/official-statements/statements/article/go/0/homosexuality/|title=Official Statements - Homosexuality |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] reassures people with same sex attraction they are loved by God and are welcomed as full members of the [[Body of Christ]]. The Church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful including &quot;promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual). The Church is concerned with pressures on young people to engage sexually and encourages abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section I.10 - Human Sexuality|url=https://www.anglicancommunion.org/resources/document-library/lambeth-conference/1998/section-i-called-to-full-humanity/section-i10-human-sexuality|website=anglicancommunion.org|accessdate=4 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[Anglican Communion]] does not approve of homosexual activity, with the exception of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-40036225 BBC:Kirk's General Assembly moves towards allowing gay marriage], 25 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], which is facing a possible exclusion from international Anglican bodies over the issue.{{citation needed|date = January 2020}}

Conservative Quakers, those within [[Friends United Meeting]] and the [[Evangelical Friends International]] believe that sexual relations are condoned only in marriage, which they define to be between a man and a woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;FUM – Homosexuality&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf |title=History of FUM policy regarding the appointment of homosexuals |publisher=[[Friends United Meeting]] |accessdate=22 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008224923/http://neym.org/FUMworkweb/history.pdf |archivedate= 8 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Confessional Lutheran]] churches teach that it is sinful to have homosexual desires, even if they do not lead to homosexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;WELSQA-871&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?process&amp;procID=1518&amp;cuQA_qaID=1&amp;cuTopic_topicID=28&amp;cuItem_itemID=871 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090928041714/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?process&amp;procID=1518&amp;cuQA_qaID=1&amp;cuTopic_topicID=28&amp;cuItem_itemID=871 |archivedate=28 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Human Behavior - Sexual Behavior |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctrinal statement issued by the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] states that making a distinction between homosexual orientation and the act of homosexuality is confusing:
{{quote|&quot;We cannot limit the sin of homosexuality to deeds but not desires, any more than we can limit heterosexual sin to deeds but not desires. Scripture clearly includes desires and inclinations toward sinful actions in the category of sin (Mt 5:27-28). This is true of both homosexual and heterosexual sin.&quot;&lt;ref name=welsstatement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wlsessays.net/files/BrugIsHomosexualityASin.pdf |title=Doctrinal Brief: Is Homosexuality a Sin? |last=Brug |first=John F. |publisher=[[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]] |page=288 |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522213615/http://wlsessays.net/files/BrugIsHomosexualityASin.pdf |archivedate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
However, confessional Lutherans also warn against [[Hypocrisy|selective morality]] which harshly condemns homosexuality while treating other sins more lightly.&lt;ref name=welsstatement/&gt;

===Evangelical churches===
The positions of the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical churches]] are varied. They range from [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] to [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative]], through [[Moderate evangelical theology|moderate]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S.

In opposing interpretations of the Bible that are supportive of homosexual relationships, conservative Christians have argued for the reliability of the Bible,&lt;ref&gt;The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration, by Bruce M.

===== Sex scandals =====
Some evangelical pastors with antigay speeches have been outed.

There was Pastor [[Ted Haggard]], founder of [[nondenominational]] [[charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] [[megachurch]] [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs]], USA. Married with five children, Ted was an anti-gay activist and said he wanted to ban homosexuality from the church.

There was also Baptist Pastor [[George Alan Rekers]] of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in the United States and psychologist member of the [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;PENN BULLOCK, BRANDON K. THORP, [https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/how-george-alan-rekers-and-his-rent-boy-got-busted-by-new-times-6366835 How George Alan Rekers and his rent boy got busted by New Times], miaminewtimes.com, USA, May 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Married and father of children, the antigay activist was recognized with a gay escort, hired for a trip to Europe, in 2010. According to him, he had hired the gay escort to carry his luggage.

====Liberal position====
===== International =====
There are some international evangelical denominations that are [[gay-friendly]], such as the [[Alliance of Baptists]] and [[Affirming Pentecostal Church International]].&lt;ref&gt;William H. Brackney, ''Historical Dictionary of the Baptists'', Editions Scarecrow Press, Canada, 2009, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Thatcher, ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology, Sexuality, and Gender'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2015, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moderate position====
Some churches have a moderate position. Although they do not approve homosexual practices, they show sympathy and respect for homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hunt, ''Contemporary Christianity and LGBT Sexualities'', Routledge, UK, 2016, p. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===== U.S. =====
Reflecting this position, some pastors, for example, showed moderation during public statements.  For example, Pastor [[Joel Osteen]] of [[Lakewood Church]] in [[Houston]] said in 2013 he found it unfortunate that several Christian ministers focus on the homosexuality by forgetting the other sins described in the Bible. He said that Jesus did not come to condemn people, but to save them.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Menzie, [https://www.christianpost.com/news/joel-osteen-talks-preaching-sin-materialism-and-coming-out-in-support-of-gay-marriage-111212/ Joel Osteen Talks Preaching Sin, Materialism, and Gay Marriage], christianpost.com, USA, 20 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other pastors also share this view.&lt;ref&gt;Micah J.

Pastor [[Carl Lentz]] of [[Hillsong Church]] [[New York City]] said in 2014 that [[gays]] were numerous in their church and he prayed that Hillsong was always welcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Cath Martin, christiantoday, [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/hillsong.new.york.pastor.carl.lentz.we.have.a.lot.of.gay.men.and.women.in.our.church.and.i.pray.we.always.do/37918.htm Hillsong New York pastor Carl Lentz: 'We have a lot of gay men and women in our church and I pray we always do'], USA, 6 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Blumberg, huffingtonpost.com, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/hillsong-church-gays_n_6002762.html Hillsong Church Pastors Won't Speak Out On Gays Because Jesus Didn't Either], USA, 17 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Pastor [[Andy Stanley]] of [[North Point Community Church]] in [[Alpharetta, Georgia|Alpharetta]], mentioned in 2015 that the church should be the safest place on the planet for students to talk about anything, including same-sex attraction.&lt;ref&gt;MICHAEL GRYBOSKI, christianpost.com, [http://www.christianpost.com/news/andy-stanley-churches-should-be-safest-place-on-the-planet-for-gay-youth-137739/ Andy Stanley: Churches Should Be 'Safest Place on the Planet' for Gay Youth], USA, 18 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a movement of people who consider themselves &quot;gay Evangelicals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Worthen, nytimes.com, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/opinion/sunday/who-are-the-gay-evangelicals.html Who Are the Gay Evangelicals?], USA, 27 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Composed mainly of young people, the movement is positioned against liberals and conservatives. Recognizing themselves as gay or bisexual, these young people believe that their attraction to same-sex people, while present, does not allow them to have homosexual relationships. They say that their Christian conversion did not instantly change their sexual desires. They insist that the church should always reject homosexual practices, but that it should welcome gay people.

There are also believers gathered in Christian organizations of evangelical orientation, such as ''Your Other Brothers'' or ''Voice of the Voiceless'', who claim they have not been attracted to homosexuality since their [[new birth]], without having recourse to a [[conversion therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Showalter, [https://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-men-struggling-with-homosexuality-find-refuge-in-your-other-brothers-storytelling-project-170964/ Christian Men Struggling With Homosexuality Find Refuge in 'Your Other Brothers' Storytelling Project], christianpost.com, USA, 19 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandelis R.

===== France =====
The French Evangelical Alliance, a member of the European Evangelical Alliance and the [[World Evangelical Alliance]], adopted on 12 October 2002, through its National Council, a document entitled ''Foi, espérance et homosexualité'' (&quot;Faith, Hope and Homosexuality &quot;), in which homophobia, hatred and rejection of homosexuals are condemned, but which denies homosexual practices and full church membership of unrepentant homosexuals and those who approve of these practices.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Lesegretain, ''Les chrétiens et l'homosexualité : l'enquête'', Bouquineo, France, 2011, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Conseil national des évangéliques de France (French National Council of Evangelicals) reaffirmed its position on the issue by opposing marriage of same-sex couples, while not rejecting homosexuals, but wanting to offer them more than a blessing; an accompaniment and a welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Loup Besmond de Senneville, la-croix.com, [http://www.la-croix.com/Religion/Actualite/Benediction-de-couples-homosexuels-critiques-vives-des-protestants-evangeliques-2015-05-18-1313309 Bénédiction de couples homosexuels : critiques vives des protestants évangéliques], France, 18 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The French evangelical pastor Philippe Auzenet, a chaplain of the association Oser en parler, regularly intervenes on the subject in the media. It promotes dialogue and respect, as well as sensitization in order to better understand homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Ciarapica, aleloo.com, [http://www.aleloo.com/journal/index.php/2006/04/30/134-parler-de-l-homosexualite-interview-de-philippe-auzenet Parler de l'homosexualité, interview de Philippe Auzenet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116173746/http://www.aleloo.com/journal/index.php/2006/04/30/134-parler-de-l-homosexualite-interview-de-philippe-auzenet |date=16 January 2017 }}, France, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He also said in 2012 that Jesus would go to a gay bar, because he was going to all people with love.&lt;ref&gt;La Dépêche de Tahiti, [http://consultation.ladepeche.pf/article/societe/%E2%80%9Cjesus-irait-dans-un-bar-gay%E2%80%9D &quot;JÉSUS IRAIT DANS UN BAR GAY&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202012736/http://consultation.ladepeche.pf/article/societe/%E2%80%9Cjesus-irait-dans-un-bar-gay%E2%80%9D |date=2 February 2017 }}, France, 4 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Nigeria =====
Philip Igbinijesu, a pastor of the [[Lagos]] Word Assembly, an [[Evangelical church]], said in a message to his church that the Nigerian law on homosexuality (inciting denunciation) was hateful. He recalled that homosexuals are creatures of God and that they should be treated with respect.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie BOUILLON, liberation.fr, [http://www.liberation.fr/monde/2014/04/11/nigeria-dieu-vous-enverra-un-texto-pour-vous-remercier_995593 Nigeria &quot;Dieu vous enverra un texto pour vous remercier&quot;], France, 11 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restorationist churches===
[[Restorationist]] churches, like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-Day Adventist]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] generally teach that homosexuals are 'broken' and can be 'fixed'. The [[Community of Christ]], a branch of Mormonism, fully accepts LGBT persons, performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBT members. Within the Stone-Campbell aligned restorationist churches the views are divergent. The [[churches of Christ]] (A Capella) and the [[Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ]] mostly adhere to a very conservative ideology; socially, politically, and religiously and are generally not accepting of openly LGBT members and will not perform weddings for gay and lesbian couples. The [[Disciples of Christ]], is fully accepting of LGBT persons, often performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBT members. The [[United Church of Christ]] is an officially &quot;open and affirming&quot; church. Other Restorationist churches such as The [[Brethren (religious group)|Brethren]] (see [[Mennonite]]) and [[Millerism|Millerite]] churches, have taken mixed positions but are increasingly accepting with some of their congregations fully accepting LGBT persons in all aspects of religious and political life.

In the 20th century, theologians like [[Jürgen Moltmann]], [[Hans Küng]], [[John A. T. Robinson|John Robinson]], [[David Edward Jenkins|Bishop David Jenkins]], [[Don Cupitt]], and [[John Shelby Spong|Bishop Jack Spong]]  challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as &quot;homosexuality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See generally http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm and subpages therein.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clay Witt, a minister in the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], explains how theologians and commentators like [[John Shelby Spong]], George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding [[Paganism|pagan]] faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: &quot;England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibitions in  {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV|}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV|}} suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm |title=Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev.

In 1986, the [[Evangelical and Ecumenical Women’s Caucus]] (EEWC), then known as the Evangelical Women's Caucus International, passed a resolution stating: &quot;Whereas homosexual people are children of God, and because of the biblical mandate of Jesus Christ that we are all created equal in God's sight, and in recognition of the presence of the lesbian minority in EWCI, EWCI takes a firm stand in favor of civil rights protection for homosexual persons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EoJrHDirVQUC&amp;pg=PA471&amp;lpg=PA471&amp;dq=%22whereas%20homosexual%20people%20are%20children%20of%20god%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22whereas%20homosexual%20people%20are%20children%20of%20god%22&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America: Women and religion: methods of study and reflection|first1=Rosemary Skinner|last1=Keller|first2=Rosemary Radford|last2=Ruether|first3=Marie|last3=Cantlon|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780253346865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBT orientation as currently understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228050848/http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 February 2008 |title=The Bible and Homosexuality |accessdate=4 July 2008 |work=SisterFriends Together |publisher=Grace Unfolding Ministries }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars.&lt;ref name = SLAVERY/&gt;&lt;ref name = WOMEN/&gt;&lt;ref name = ROGERS/&gt; There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles.&lt;ref name = SLAVERY/&gt;&lt;ref name = WOMEN/&gt;&lt;ref name = ROGERS/&gt; They consider some verses such as those they say support [[slavery]]&lt;ref name = SLAVERY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm |title=What the Bible says about slavery |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the inferior treatment of women&lt;ref name = WOMEN&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/ofe_bibl.htm ReligiousTolerance.org].&lt;/ref&gt; as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible. They cite these issues when arguing for a change in theological views on sexual relationships to what they say is an earlier view. They differentiate among various sexual practices, treating rape, prostitution, or temple sex rituals as immoral and those within committed relationships as positive regardless of [[sexual orientation]]. They view certain verses, which they believe refer only to homosexual rape, as not relevant to consensual homosexual relationships.&lt;ref name = ROGERS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ksWrErBqRVUC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=homosexual+rape+sodom+and+gomorrah |title=Jesus, the Bible, and homosexuality; by Jack Rogers |accessdate=12 November 2011|isbn=9780664229399 |last1=Rogers |first1=Jack Bartlett |date=2006-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale professor [[John Boswell]] has argued that a number of [[Early Christians]] entered into homosexual relationships,&lt;ref name=BOS&gt;{{Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | title= The Marriage of Likeness. Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe | publisher= Fontana | year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that certain Biblical figures had homosexual relationships, such as [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] and her mother-in-law [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and the court official Ashpenaz, and [[David and Jonathan|David]] and King [[Saul]]'s son [[David and Jonathan|Jonathan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar.htm |title=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=ReligiousTolerance.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell has also argued that [[adelphopoiesis]], a rite bonding two men, was akin to a religiously sanctioned same-sex union. Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite.&lt;ref name=BOS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Darling Young, &quot;[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9411/articles/darling.html Gay Marriage: Reimagining Church History]&quot;, [[First Things]] 47 (November 1994), pp. 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halsall&quot;&gt;Paul Halsall, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/bosrevdisc-kennedy1.html Reviewing Boswell]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a [[Platonic love|Platonic]] brotherly bond, not a homosexual union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halsall&quot;/&gt; He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boswell2&quot;&gt;John Boswell, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/1979boswell.html The Church and the Homosexual – An Historical Perspective]'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Boswell's critics&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon R.A.J., ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice: Texts and Hermeneutics''. Nashville, TN: Abingdon, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; point out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality as a sin even if they do not prescribe a specific punishment, and that Boswell's arguments are based on sources which reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties, rather than a change in doctrine, from the 12th century onwards.

[[Desmond Tutu]], the former [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has described homophobia as a &quot;crime against humanity&quot; and &quot;every bit as unjust&quot; as apartheid:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/13584 |title=Desmond Tutu: &quot;Homophobia equals apartheid&quot; |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given. ... We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities. We make them doubt that they too are children of God – and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy. We blame them for what they are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sex, Love &amp; Homophobia, published by Amnesty International UK, 2005, foreword by Desmund Tutu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern gay Christian leader [[Justin R. Cannon]] promotes what he calls &quot;Inclusive Orthodoxy&quot; (not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: &quot;Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/about.htm |title=INCLUSIVE ORTHODOXY: Gay Christian Ministry – Bible and Homosexuality? |publisher=Truthsetsfree.net |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's ministry takes a unique and distinct approach from modern liberal Christians while still supporting homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says &quot;...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/index.html |title=Inclusive Orthodoxy ~ The Rev.

Today, many religious people are becoming more affirming of same-sex relationships, even in denominations with official stances against homosexuality. In the United States, people in denominations who are against same-sex relationships are liberalizing quickly, though not as quickly as those in more affirming groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schnabel|first=Landon|date=2016-01-01|title=Gender and homosexuality attitudes across religious groups from the 1970s to 2014: Similarity, distinction, and adaptation|journal=Social Science Research|volume=55|pages=31–47|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2015.09.012|pmid=26680286|url=http://osf.io/3p6wt/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This social change is creating tension within many denominations, and even schisms and mass walk-outs among Mormons and other conservative groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/14/us/mormon-mass-resignation/index.html|title=Mormons leaving church to protest same-sex policy|author1=Susanna Capelouto |author2=Ralph Ellis|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Barna]], a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed. He characterized some of his leading conclusions from the data as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chellew-Hodge, Candace. &quot;[http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God].&quot; ''ReligionDispatches''. 25 June [[2009 in literature|2009]]. . Retrieved 2009-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;People who portray gay adults as [[Godlessness|godless]], [[hedonistic]], Christian bashers are not working with the facts. A substantial majority of gays cite their [[faith]] as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to [[Jesus Christ]] active in their life today.&quot; Barna also found that LGBT people were  more likely to interpret faith as an individual rather than a collective experience.&lt;ref name=BARNAGAY&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |title=Spiritual Profile of Homosexual Adults Provides Surprising Insights |publisher=Barna.org |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106041153/http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |archivedate= 6 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of the online magazine ''Whosoever'', responded to the findings: &quot;All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian [[Religion|religious belief]]. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old &quot;gays vs. God&quot; [[dichotomy]] that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians – they're just not as good as straight ones.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chellew-Hodge 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god |title=New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God, Candace Chellew-Hodge, ReligionDispatches, 25 June 2009 (accessed 2009-06-27) |publisher=Religiondispatches.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his &quot;arrière pensée.&quot;  The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad [[Internal consistency of the Bible|contradictions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chellew-Hodge 2009&quot;/&gt;

Organizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational [[Q Christian Fellowship]] (formerly Gay Christian Network) has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as &quot;Side A&quot; and &quot;Side B&quot;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychristian.net/index.php?

Some organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as [[Courage International]] and [[North Star (organization)|North Star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northstarlds.org |title=North Star web site |publisher=Northstarlds.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate [[same-sex attraction]]s.  [[Love Won Out]] and the now-defunct [[Exodus International]] are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as [[ex-gay]] organizations, though many no longer use the term.  [[Alan Chambers (Exodus International)|Alan Chambers]], the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/nation/na-exgay18 |title=Approaching agreement in debate over homosexuality |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the group [[Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays]] continues to use the term.  In addition, individual Christians identifying as gay who want to subscribe to the conservative ethic are becoming more vocal themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiritual Friendship in 300 Words|url=http://spiritualfriendship.org/2012/08/29/spiritual-friendship-in-300-words/|website=www.spiritualfriendship.org|accessdate=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Other groups]] support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, [[IntegrityUSA]] represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integrityusa.org/ |title=Integrity (US Episcopal) |publisher=Integrityusa.org |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] have the [[Reconciling Ministries Network]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christians have ''Evangelicals Concerned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecwr.org/index.php |title=Evangelicals Concerned: Gay Christians |publisher=Ecwr.org |accessdate=12 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930014647/http://www.ecwr.org/index.php |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[United Church of Christ]] filed a lawsuit challenging North Carolina’s ban on same-sex marriage, which is America’s first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans; the [[Alliance of Baptists]] joined the lawsuit later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9127277.html|title=Rabbis group joins N.C. same-sex marriage suit|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2014/06/06/rabbis-join-marriage-equality-fight|title=Rabbis Join Marriage Equality Fight|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBT members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric. His research shows that those LGBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches &quot;kill the messenger&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121216152744/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 December 2012 |title=Killing The Messenger|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01492.x |date=1 March 2010 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |volume=49 |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |pages=56–72|last1=Pitt|first1=Richard N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by attacking the minister's knowledge about homosexuality, personal morality, focus on sin instead of forgiveness, and motivations for preaching against homosexuality.
