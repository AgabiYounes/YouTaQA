'''Charles Messier''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁl me.sje|lang}}; 26&amp;nbsp;June 1730 – 12&amp;nbsp;April 1817) was a French [[astronomer]]. He published an [[astronomical catalog]]ue consisting of 110&amp;nbsp;[[nebula]]e and faint [[star cluster]]s, which came to be known as the ''[[Messier object]]s''. The purpose of [[list of Messier objects|the catalogue]] was to help astronomical observers, in particular [[comet]] hunters like himself, distinguish between permanent and [[transient astronomical event|transient]] visually diffuse [[astronomical object|objects in the sky]].

==Biography==
Messier was born in [[Badonviller]] in the [[Lorraine]] region of [[Kingdom of France|France]], the tenth of twelve children of Françoise B. Grandblaise and Nicolas Messier, a [[Court usher]]. Six of his brothers and sisters died while young, and his father died in 1741. Charles' interest in astronomy was stimulated by the appearance of the [[Great Comet of 1744|great six-tailed comet in 1744]] and by an annular [[solar eclipse]] visible from his hometown on 25&amp;nbsp;July 1748.

In 1751 Messier entered the employ of [[Joseph Nicolas Delisle]], the astronomer of the [[French Navy]], who instructed him to keep careful records of his observations. Messier's first documented observation was that of the [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury transit]] of 6&amp;nbsp;May 1753, followed by his observations journals at Cluny Hotel and at the French Navy observatories.

In 1764, Messier was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]; in 1769, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]; and on 30&amp;nbsp;June 1770, he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

Messier discovered 13 comets:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comethunter.de/cat2002/com_disc.txt |first=Maik |last=Meyer |title=Catalog of comet discoveries |accessdate=15 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716110006/http://www.comethunter.de/cat2002/com_disc.txt |archivedate=16 July 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomb of Messier in Pere Lachaise, Sept 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Messier's grave in Père Lachaise, Section&amp;nbsp;11]]He also co-discovered Comet C/1801 N1, a discovery shared with several other observers including [[Jean-Louis Pons|Pons]], Méchain, and Bouvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ni4BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=messier-pons+1801&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i7roLgeZlo&amp;sig=ACfU3U3olT_hAA0wVO9IPGr9KIDtPS8bsA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-mYOM6OzlAhXBmq0KHTLtC4gQ6AEwBHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=messier-pons%201801&amp;f=false|title=Blazing a Ghostly Trail: ISON and Great Comets of the Past and Future|last=Grego|first=Peter|date=2013-10-19|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783319017754|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Comet Pons-Messier-Méchain-Bouvard]])

Near the end of his life, Messier self-published a booklet connecting the great comet of 1769 to the birth of [[Napoleon]], who was in power at the time of publishing. According to Meyer:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meyer, Maik |title=Charles Messier, Napoleon, and Comet C/1769&amp;nbsp;P1 |year=2007 |page=3 |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/meyer_icq29_3t6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation| As hard as it may seem to accept, the memoir is an ingratiation to Napoleon in order to receive attention and monetary support. It is full of servility and opportunism. Messier did not even refrain from utilizing astrology to reach his goal. Messier comes quickly to the point on the first page of the memoir, by stating that the beginning of the epoch of Napoleon the Great ... coincides with the discovery of one of the greatest comets ever observed.}}

Messier is buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris, in Section&amp;nbsp;11. The grave is faintly inscribed, and is near the grave of [[Frédéric Chopin]], slightly to the west and directly north, and behind the small mausoleum of the jeweller [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]].{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Messier's occupation as a [[comet]] hunter led him to continually come across fixed diffuse objects in the night sky which could be mistaken for comets. He compiled a [[List of Messier objects|list of them]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=25 February 2008 |title=The Messier Catalog |url=http://messier.seds.org/ |work=SEDS Messier Database |publisher=[[Students for the Exploration and Development of Space|SEDS]] |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with his friend and assistant [[Pierre Méchain]] (who may have found at least 20 of the objects&lt;ref name=jones1991&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kenneth Glyn |last1=Jones |year=1991 |title=Messier's nebulae and star clusters |issue=2 |series=Practical astronomy handbook series |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-37079-5 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuhLR35I9QUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), to avoid wasting time sorting them out from the comets they were looking for. The entries are now known to be 39&amp;nbsp;[[galaxies]], 4&amp;nbsp;[[planetary nebula]]e, 7&amp;nbsp;other types of [[nebula]]e, and 55&amp;nbsp;[[star cluster]]s.

Messier did his observing with a 100&amp;nbsp;mm (four-inch) [[refracting telescope]] from Hôtel de Cluny (now the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]]), in downtown [[Paris]], [[France]]. The list he compiled only contains objects found in the area of the sky Messier could observe, from the north [[celestial pole]] to a declination of about −35.7°&amp;nbsp;. They are not organized scientifically by object type, or by location. The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45&amp;nbsp;objects and was published in 1774 in the journal of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. In addition to his own discoveries, this version included objects previously observed by other astronomers, with only 17 of the 45&amp;nbsp;objects being Messier's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knight |first1=J.D. |title=Meet the Astronomers: Charles Messier |url=http://www.seasky.org/space-exploration/astronomers-charles-messier.html |website=Sea and Sky |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1780 the catalog had increased to 80&amp;nbsp;objects.

The final version of the catalogue was published in 1781, in the 1784 issue of ''[[Connaissance des Temps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Messier |year=1781 |title=Catalogue des Nébuleuses &amp; des amas d'Étoiles |journal=Connoissance des Temps Pour l'Année 1784 (published 1781) |pages=227–267 |bibcode=1781CdT..1784..227M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Original Messier Catalog of 1781 |website=Messier.seds.org |url=http://messier.seds.org/xtra/Mcat/mcat1781.html#messier1781 |accessdate=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://messier.seds.org/xtra/history/m-cat81.html |website=Messier.seds.org |title=Charles Messier's personal copy of his 1781 &quot;Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final [[list of Messier objects]] had grown to 103. On several occasions between 1921 and 1966, astronomers and historians discovered evidence of another seven objects that were observed either by Messier or by Méchain, shortly after the final version was published. These seven objects, [[Messier 104|M&amp;nbsp;104]] through [[Messier 110|M&amp;nbsp;110]], are accepted by astronomers as &quot;official&quot; Messier objects.

The objects' Messier designations, from [[Crab Nebula|M&amp;nbsp;1]] to M&amp;nbsp;110, are still used by professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] today and their relative brightness makes them popular objects in the amateur astronomical community.
