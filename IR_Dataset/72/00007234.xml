'''Constantine II''' ({{lang-la|Flavius Claudius Constantinus Augustus}};&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 223&quot;&gt;Jones, pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt; January/February 316 – 340) was [[Roman Emperor]] from 337 to 340. Son of [[Constantine the Great]] and co-emperor alongside his brothers, his attempt to exert his perceived rights of [[primogeniture]] led to his death in a failed invasion of [[Italy]] in 340.

==Career==
[[File:Solidus Constantine II-heraclea RIC vII 101.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Solidus of Constantine II]]
The eldest son of [[Constantine the Great]] and [[Fausta]], Constantine II was born in [[Arles]] in February 316&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:4&lt;/ref&gt; and raised as a Christian. On 1 March 317, he was made [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:6&lt;/ref&gt; In 323, at the age of seven, he took part in his father's campaign against the [[Sarmatia]]ns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;DiMaio, ''Constantine II (337–340 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt;  At age ten, he became commander of [[Gaul]], following the death of his half-brother [[Crispus]]. An inscription dating to 330 records the title of ''Alamannicus'', so it is probable that his generals won a victory over the [[Alamanni]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  His military career continued when Constantine I made him field commander during the 332 campaign against the [[Goths]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Following the death of his father in 337, Constantine II initially became emperor jointly with his brothers [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;&gt;Eutropius, 10:9&lt;/ref&gt; with the Empire divided between them and their cousins, the ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]s'' [[Dalmatius]] and [[Hannibalianus]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor, 41:20&lt;/ref&gt;  This arrangement barely survived Constantine I’s death, as his sons arranged the slaughter of most of the rest of the family by the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the three brothers gathered together in [[Pannonia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and there, on 9 September 337,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 223&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt; divided the Roman world among themselves. Constantine, proclaimed ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' by the troops&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, pg. 223&quot;/&gt; received [[Gaul]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Hispania]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|left|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by Constantine I: from west to east, the territories of Constantine II, Constans I, [[Dalmatius]] and Constantius II. After the death of Constantine I (May 337), this was the formal division of the Empire, until Dalmatius was killed and his territory divided between Constans and Constantius.]]

He was soon involved in the struggle between factions rupturing the unity of the [[Christian Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  The Western portion of the Empire, under the influence of the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]], favored [[Catholicism]] over [[Arianism]], and through their intercession they convinced Constantine to free [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], allowing him to return to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, &quot;The Later Roman Empire&quot; (Baltimore, 1986), pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; This action aggravated Constantius II, who was a committed supporter of Arianism.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Constantine was initially the guardian of his younger brother Constans, whose portion of the empire was [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]], [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. Constantine soon complained that he had not received the amount of territory that was his due as the eldest son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Annoyed that Constans had received [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] after the death of Dalmatius, Constantine demanded that Constans hand over the African provinces, to which he agreed in order to maintain a fragile peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;&gt;Victor, 41:21&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon, however, they began quarreling over which parts of the African provinces belonged to [[Carthage]], and thus Constantine, and which belonged to [[Italy]], and therefore Constans.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 2:41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complications arose when Constans came of age and Constantine, who had grown accustomed to dominating his younger brother, would not relinquish the guardianship. In 340 Constantine marched into Italy at the head of his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt; Constans, at that time in [[Dacia]], detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibbon, Ch. 18&quot;/&gt;  Constantine was engaged in military operations&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutropius, 10:9&quot;/&gt; and was killed in an ambush outside [[Aquileia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Victor, 41:21&quot;/&gt;  Constans then took control of his deceased brother's realm.
