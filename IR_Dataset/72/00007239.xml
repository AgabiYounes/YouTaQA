The '''ICC Cricket World Cup''' is the [[World cup competition|international championship]] of [[One Day International]] (ODI) [[cricket]]. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), every four years, with first qualification rounds leading up to a semifinals  and then finals tournament. The tournament is one of the [[List of most-watched television broadcasts#List|world's most viewed sporting events]] and is considered the &quot;flagship event of the international cricket calendar&quot; by the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketworldcup.com/about ICC Cricket World Cup: About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601200603/http://www.cricketworldcup.com/about |date=1 June 2013 }} – International Cricket Council. Retrieved 30 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1975 Cricket World Cup|first World Cup]] was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a [[1912 Triangular Tournament|triangular tournament]] of [[Test cricket|Test matches]] was played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England national cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]] onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an [[Cricket World Cup hosts#Unofficial rotation system|unofficial rotation system]], with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.

The World Cup is open to all members of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the [[World Cricket League]] and the [[ICC World Cup Qualifier]]. A total of [[#Overview|twenty teams]] have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the [[2019 Cricket World Cup|recent 2019 tournament]] only had ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] twice each, while [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] made the semi-finals of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 tournament]].

[[England national cricket team|England]] are the current champions after winning the 2019 edition. The next tournament will be held in India in 2023.

{{main|History of the Cricket World Cup}}

The [[Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844|first international cricket match]] was played between Canada and the United States, on 24 and 25 September 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/141170.html| title=The oldest international contest of them all| author=Martin Williamson| publisher=ESPN| access-date=5 July 2012| archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6I89i8dpM?url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/141170.html| archive-date=15 July 2013| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first credited [[Test cricket|Test match]] was played in 1877 between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]], and the two teams competed regularly for [[The Ashes]] in subsequent years. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] was admitted to Test status in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/australia/content/match/62396.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=15 March 1877|title=1st Test Scorecard|accessdate=28 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212191405/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/australia/content/match/62396.html|archive-date=12 February 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative cricket teams were selected to [[International structure of cricket|tour]] each other, resulting in bilateral competition. Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Games]], where [[Great Britain and Ireland at the 1900 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] defeated [[France at the 1900 Summer Olympics|France]] to win the [[Gold medal#Olympic Games|gold medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/columns/engine/match/320838.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=19 August 1900|title=Olympic Games, 1900, Final|accessdate=9 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226014434/http://www.espncricinfo.com/columns/engine/match/320838.html|archive-date=26 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only appearance of cricket at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Olympics]].

The first multilateral competition at international level was the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test-playing nations at the time: England, Australia and South Africa. The event was not a success: the summer was exceptionally wet, making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches, and crowd attendances were poor, attributed to a &quot;surfeit of cricket&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/207248.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The original damp squib|date=23 April 2005|accessdate=29 August 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016161938/http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/207248.html| archivedate = 16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series: a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular [[Asian Test Championship]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/483619.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The run-out that sparked a riot|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=18 February 2015| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141022194822/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/483619.html| archivedate = 22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time, with the addition of [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] in 1928, [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] in 1930, [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1932, and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] in 1952. However, international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three, four or five days.

In the early 1960s, English [[county cricket]] teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day. Starting in [[1962 English cricket season|1962]] with a four-team [[single-elimination tournament|knockout competition]] known as the Midlands Knock-Out Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/510124.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title= The low-key birth of one-day cricket|date=9 April 2011|accessdate=15 July 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130919032251/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/510124.html| archivedate = 19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing with the inaugural [[Friends Provident Trophy|Gillette Cup]] in [[1963 English cricket season|1963]], [[Limited overs cricket|one-day cricket]] grew in popularity in England. A national [[National League (cricket)|Sunday League]] was formed in [[1969 English cricket season|1969]]. The first One-Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain-aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1970–71|1971]], to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd. It was a forty [[over (cricket)|over]] game with eight balls per over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newicc.cricket.org/icc/odi/what_is_one-day_cricket.html |publisher=newicc.cricket.org |title=What is One-Day International cricket? |accessdate=10 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119054342/http://newicc.cricket.org/icc/odi/what_is_one-day_cricket.html |archivedate=19 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, [[Kerry Packer]] established the rival [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) competition. It introduced many of the now commonplace features of [[One Day International cricket]], including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. The success and popularity of the domestic one-day competitions in England and other parts of the world, as well as the early One-Day Internationals, prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/264535.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title=The World Cup&amp;nbsp;– A brief history|accessdate=7 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328095116/http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/264535.html|archive-date=28 March 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prudential World Cups (1975–1983)===
[[File:Prudential Cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Prudential Cup trophy]]
The [[1975 ICC Cricket World Cup|inaugural Cricket World Cup]] was hosted in 1975 by England, the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time. The 1975 tournament started on 7 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENGHOST&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricworld.com/news/wchistory03feb.htm|publisher=cricworld.com|title=The History of World Cup's|accessdate=19 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313181419/http://www.cricworld.com/news/wchistory03feb.htm|archive-date=13 March 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors [[Prudential plc]]. The matches consisted of 60 six-ball overs per team, played during the daytime in traditional form, with the players wearing [[cricket clothing and equipment|cricket whites]] and using red [[cricket ball]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight teams participated in the first tournament: Australia, England, [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|India]], [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]], Pakistan, and the [[West Indies]] (the six Test nations at the time), together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from [[East African cricket team|East Africa]].&lt;ref name=cricket&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; One notable omission was [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], who were [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era#Cricket|banned from international cricket]] due to [[apartheid]]. The tournament was won by the West Indies, who defeated Australia by 17 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in the final at [[Lord's]].&lt;ref name=cricket/&gt; Roy Fredricks of West Indies was the first batsmen who got hit-wicket in ODI during the 1975 World Cup final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/69522/icc-cricket-world-cups-fascinating-facts-part-1|title=50 fascinating facts about World Cups – Part 1|website=Cricbuzz|language=en|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221174220/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/69522/icc-cricket-world-cups-fascinating-facts-part-1|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1979 ICC Cricket World Cup|1979 World Cup]] saw the introduction of the [[ICC Trophy]] competition to select non-Test playing teams for the World Cup,&lt;ref name=&quot;ICCTROPHY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/ICCT2005/ARTICLES/history.html|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|title=ICC Trophy&amp;nbsp;– A brief history|accessdate=29 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126054556/http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/ICCT2005/ARTICLES/history.html|archive-date=26 November 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sri Lanka and [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] qualifying.&lt;ref name=history&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 32–35&lt;/ref&gt; The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament, defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final. At a meeting which followed the World Cup, the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The [[1983 ICC Cricket World Cup|1983 event]] was hosted by England for a third consecutive time. By this stage, Sri Lanka had become a Test-playing nation, and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] qualified through the ICC Trophy. A [[Fielding restrictions (cricket)|fielding circle]] was introduced, {{convert|30|yd|m}} away from the [[stump (cricket)|stumps]]. Four [[fielding (cricket)|fieldsmen]] needed to be inside it at all times.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt; The teams faced each other twice, before moving into the knock-outs. [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|India]] was crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 105–110&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Different champions (1987–1996) ===
India and Pakistan jointly hosted the [[1987 ICC Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]], the first time that the competition was held outside England. The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings, the current standard, because of the shorter daylight hours in the [[Indian subcontinent]] compared with England's summer.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 111–116&lt;/ref&gt; Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final, the closest margin in the World Cup final until the 2019 edition between England and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 155–159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cworldcup/history.htm|publisher=A.Srinivas|title=Cricket World Cup 2003|accessdate=28 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002053148/http://www.geocities.com/cworldcup/history.htm|archivedate=2 October 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1992 ICC Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], held in Australia and New Zealand, introduced many changes to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, [[Day/Night ODI|day/night]] matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era|international sports boycott]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 211–214&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1996 ICC Cricket World Cup|1996 championship]] was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time, with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 215–217&lt;/ref&gt; In the semi-final, Sri Lanka, heading towards a crushing victory over India at [[Eden Gardens]] after the hosts lost eight [[wicket]]s while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252, were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketfundas.com/wc96indslsf1march13.html|publisher=cricketfundas|title=1996 Semi-final scoreboard|accessdate=28 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107001514/http://www.cricketfundas.com/wc96indslsf1march13.html|archive-date=7 November 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at [[Lahore]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 264–274&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian treble (1999–2007)===
In 1999 the [[1999 ICC Cricket World Cup|event]] was hosted by England, with some matches also being held in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iZq8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=1999+cricket+world+cup+host&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d2qJVJyDMYuzUembgYgJ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=1999%20cricket%20world%20cup%20host&amp;f=false |title=Cricket World Cup: A Summary of the Tournaments Since 1975 |author=French Toast |publisher=Smashwords |year=2014 |format=e-book |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626181716/https://books.google.com/books?id=iZq8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=1999+cricket+world+cup+host&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d2qJVJyDMYuzUembgYgJ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=1999%20cricket%20world%20cup%20host&amp;f=false |archive-date=26 June 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve teams contested the World Cup. Australia qualified for the semi-finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 229–231&lt;/ref&gt; They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi-final also against South Africa where a mix-up between South African [[batsman|batsmen]] [[Lance Klusener]] and [[Allan Donald]] saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid-pitch to be [[run out]]. In the final, Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand.&lt;ref&gt;Browning (1999), pp. 232–238&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the [[2003 ICC Cricket World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen.

[[File:ICC CWC 2007 team captains.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The captains of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.]]
The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history. Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams, divided into two groups of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_1975.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=1st tournament|accessdate=19 February 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093647/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_1975.html| archivedate = 17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition consisted of two stages, a group stage and a [[single-elimination tournament|knock-out]] stage. The four teams in each group played each other in the [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stage, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals played against each other in the final. With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott, nine teams played each other once in the group phase, and the top four teams progressed to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199192.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=92 tournament|accessdate=19 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093653/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199192.html |archivedate = 17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was further expanded in 1996, with two groups of six teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199596.html|publisher=[[icc.cricket.org]]|title=96 tournament|accessdate=19 February 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217093658/http://icc.cricket.org/icc/events/summaries/icc_world_cup_199596.html| archivedate = 17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter-finals and semi-finals.

A distinct format was used for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]] and [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]] World Cups. The teams were split into two pools, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the ''Super 6''.&lt;ref name=&quot;super6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC99/WC99_TABLE.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=Super 6|accessdate=19 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222100838/http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC99/WC99_TABLE.html|archive-date=22 February 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Super 6'' teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group. As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;super6&quot;/&gt; The top four teams from the ''Super 6'' stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.

The format used in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/TeamGroupings.html|publisher=cricket world cup|title=World Cup groups|accessdate=28 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126002928/http://www.cricketworldcup.com/TeamGroupings.html|archive-date=26 January 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within each group, the teams played each other in a round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward to the ''Super 8'' round. The ''Super 8'' teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the ''Super 8'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/pdfs/event-overview.pdf|publisher=cricketworldcup.com|title=About the Event|accessdate=2 September 2006|page=1|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905225042/http://www.cricketworldcup.com/pdfs/event-overview.pdf|archive-date=5 September 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top four teams from the ''Super 8'' round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.

The format used in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] and [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricknews.net|publisher=cricknews.net|title=2015 Cricket World Cup|accessdate=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203120741/http://www.cricknews.net/|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Cups featured two groups of seven teams, each playing in a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin format]]. The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter-finals, semi-finals and ultimately the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=K.R. |last=Nayar |title=International Cricket Council approves 14-team cup |url=http://gulfnews.com/sport/cricket/international-cricket-council-approves-14-team-cup-1.829620 |work=[[Gulf News]] |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701153544/http://gulfnews.com/sport/cricket/international-cricket-council-approves-14-team-cup-1.829620 |archive-date=1 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2019 Cricket World Cup|2019 World Cup]], the number of teams participating dropped to 10. Every team were scheduled to play against each other once in a round robin format, before entering the semifinals, a similar format to the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]].

The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup. The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships, and was the first permanent prize in the tournament's history.

Successive World Cup tournaments have generated increasing media attention as One-Day International cricket has become more established. The 2003 World Cup in South Africa was the first to sport a mascot, Dazzler the [[zebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/107543.html|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|title=2003 World Cup launched in Soweto|accessdate=3 December 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141203013838/http://www.espncricinfo.com/southafrica/content/story/107543.html| archivedate = 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An orange [[mongoose]] known as ''Mello'' was the [[mascot]] for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/aids/23619_39027.html|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|title=ICC cricket mascot Mello tours Guyana to raise AIDS awareness|accessdate=4 November 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141104124037/http://www.unicef.org/aids/23619_39027.html| archivedate = 4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stumpy (mascot)|Stumpy]], a blue elephant was the mascot for the 2011 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-02/top-stories/28320620_1_mascot-world-cup-elephant|title=2011 World Cup mascot named as 'Stumpy'|work=The Times of India|location=India|accessdate=16 April 2011|date=2 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429091703/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-02/top-stories/28320620_1_mascot-world-cup-elephant|archive-date=29 April 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February, the opening of the 2015 tournament was celebrated with a [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/2015-cricket-world-cup-this-is-why-theres-a-google-doodle-10044558.html|title=Google release Doodle to mark the start of the 2015 Cricket World Cup|date=13 February 2015|website=The Independent|accessdate=17 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330130438/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/2015-cricket-world-cup-this-is-why-theres-a-google-doodle-10044558.html|archive-date=30 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to England making the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|2019 final]], the match was domestically picked up for terrestrial broadcast by [[Channel 4]] (with a move to [[More4]] later in the match) in a rights share with local telecaster [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-07-11/cricket-world-cup-final-channel-4-live-coverage-england-new-zealand/|title=Channel 4 to show live coverage of England’s Cricket World Cup final|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=11 July 2019|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=15 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715090133/https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-07-11/cricket-world-cup-final-channel-4-live-coverage-england-new-zealand/|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection of hosts==

The International Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/245789.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=Asia to host 2011 World Cup|date=30 April 2006|accessdate=9 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928205442/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/245789.html|archive-date=28 September 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENGHOST&quot;/&gt; India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC79_HISTORY.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=The 1979 World Cup in England&amp;nbsp;– West Indies retain their title|accessdate=19 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523160232/http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC79_HISTORY.html|archive-date=23 May 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1987 Cricket World Cup]] was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC87_HISTORY.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]|title=The 1987 World Cup in India and Pakistan&amp;nbsp;– Australia win tight tournament|accessdate=15 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716040704/http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/WORLD_CUPS/WC_HISTORY/WC87_HISTORY.html|archive-date=16 July 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region, such as South Asia in 1987, 1996 and 2011, [[Australasia]] (in Australia and New Zealand) in 1992 and 2015, Southern Africa in 2003 and [[West Indies]] in 2007.

==Tournament Summary==
Twenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once. Seven teams have competed in every tournament, six of which have won the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; The [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] won the first two tournaments, [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] has won five, [[India national cricket team|India]] has won two, while [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] have each won once. The West Indies ([[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]] and [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]]) and Australia ([[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]], [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]], [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]], [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]]) are the only teams to have won consecutive titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; Australia has played in seven of the twelve finals ([[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]], [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]], [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]], [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]], [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]] and [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]]). [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] has yet to win the World Cup, but has been runners-up two times ([[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]] and [[2019 Cricket World Cup|2019]]). The best result by a non-Test playing nation is the semi-final appearance by [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] in the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]] tournament; while the best result by a non-Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 (second round) by [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt;

Sri Lanka, as a co-host of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996 World Cup]], was the first host to win the tournament, though the final was held in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win a final played in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|title=India power past Sri Lanka to Cricket World Cup triumph|work=BBC Sport|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403035451/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|archive-date=3 April 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and England repeated the feat in 2015 and 2019 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUS2015&quot;/&gt; Other than this, England made it to the final as a host in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]]. Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co-hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015, Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003, and Kenya as semi-finalists in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; In 1987, co-hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi-finals, but were eliminated by England and Australia respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;WCHistory&quot;/&gt; Australia in 1992, England in 1999, South Africa in 2003, and Bangladesh in 2011 have been host teams that were eliminated in the first round.

===Man of the Match in the Final===
There were no Man of the Tournament awards before 1992 but [[Man of the Match]] awards have always been given for individual matches.

To date the award has always gone to a member of the winning side. The Man of the Match award in the final of the competition has been awarded to:&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt;
