'''CORAL''' ('''C'''omputer '''O'''n-line '''R'''eal-time '''A'''pplications '''L'''anguage) is a [[programming language]] originally developed in 1964 at the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] (RRE), [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It was influenced by [[ALGOL]] and [[JOVIAL]] but is not a [[subset]] of either. Coral 66 was subsequently developed by I. F. Currie and M. Griffiths under the auspices of '''IECCA''' ('''I'''nter-'''E'''stablishment '''C'''ommittee for
'''C'''omputer '''A'''pplications). Its official definition,&lt;ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Coral 66 is a general-purpose programming language based on [[ALGOL 60]], with some features from Coral 64, [[JOVIAL]], and [[Fortran|FORTRAN]]. It includes structured record types (as in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and supports the packing of data into limited storage (also as in Pascal). Like [[Edinburgh IMP]] it allows embedded assembler, and also offers good run-time checking and diagnostics. It is specifically intended for [[real-time computing|real-time]] and embedded applications and for use on computers with limited processing power, including those limited to [[fixed point arithmetic]] and those without support for dynamic storage allocation.

The language was an inter-service standard for British military programming, and was also widely adopted for civil purposes in the British control and automation industry. It was used to write software for both the [[Ferranti]]&lt;ref name=RSRE799-&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA084068 |title=The Coral 66 Compiler for Ferranti ARGUS 500 Computer |last=Gorman |first=B |publisher=Royal Signals and Radar Establishment |date=June 1978 |id=Technical Note 799 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The General Electric Company|GEC]] computers from 1971 onwards. Implementations also exist for the Interdata 8/32, [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] platforms and [[HP Integrity]] servers; for the [[Honeywell]], and for the [[Computer Technology Limited]] (CTL, later ITL) [[Information Technology Limited#The Modular One|Modular-1]];&lt;ref name=nsci-19721130/&gt; as well as for [[SPARC]] running [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Intel]] running [[Linux]].

Queen [[Elizabeth II]] sent the first email from a [[head of state]] from the [[Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]] over the [[ARPANET]] on March 26, 1976. The message read â€œThis message to all ARPANET users announces the availability on ARPANET of the Coral 66 compiler provided by the GEC 4080 computer at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, Malvern, England, ... Coral 66 is the standard real-time high level language adopted by the Ministry of Defence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/12/queen-and-the-internet/|title=How the Queen of England Beat Everyone to the Internet|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=2012-12-25|work=Wired|access-date=2020-01-09|issn=1059-1028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Left|first=Sarah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2002/mar/13/internetnews|title=Email timeline|date=2002-03-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A variant of Coral 66 was developed during the late 1970s/early 1980s by the British [[General Post Office|GPO]], in conjunction with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], STC and [[Plessey]], for use on the [[System X (telephony)|System X]] digital telephone exchange control computers, known as PO-CORAL. This was later renamed BT-CORAL when [[British Telecom]] was spun off from the Post Office. Unique features of this language were the focus on real-time execution, message processing, limits on statement execution between waiting for input, and a prohibition on recursion to remove the need for a stack.

As Coral was aimed at a variety of real-time work, rather than general office DP, there was no standardised equivalent to a [[stdio]] [[Library (computing)|library]]. IECCA recommended a primitive I/O package to accompany any compiler (in a document titled ''Input/Output of Character data in Coral 66 Utility Programs''). Most implementers avoided this by producing Coral interfaces to existing Fortran and, later, C libraries.

Perhaps CORAL's most significant contribution to computing was the enforcement of quality control in commercial [[compiler]]s.&lt;ref name=nsci-19721130&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dkUzDol9AcQC |title=Lucid language may help European computers |magazine=New Scientist |page=513 |date=30 November 1972 |accessdate=8 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; To have a CORAL compiler approved by IECCA, and thus allowing a compiler to be marketed as a CORAL 66 compiler, the candidate compiler had to compile and execute an official suite of 25 test programs and 6 benchmark programs. The process was part of the [[British Standard|BS]]&amp;nbsp;5905 approval process. This methodology was observed and adapted later by the [[United States Department of Defense]] for the official certification of [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] compilers.

Source code for a Coral 66 compiler (written in [[BCPL]]) has been recovered and the ''Official Definition of Coral 66'' document by [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] has been scanned; the Ministry of Defence patent office has issued a licence to the Edinburgh Computer History project to allow them to put both the code and the language reference online for non-commercial use.
