[[File:Paris - Bibl. Mazarine - ms. 0924, f 150v.jpg|thumb|The [[rubric]] above this 13th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] translates &quot;twelve articles of faith set out by twelve apostles&quot;.]]

The '''Apostles' Creed''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''Symbolum Apostolorum'' or ''Symbolum Apostolicum''), sometimes titled the '''Apostolic Creed''' or the '''Symbol of the Apostles''', is an early statement of [[Christianity|Christian]] belief—a [[creed]] or &quot;symbol&quot;.{{Efn | Not in the sense that the word &quot;symbol&quot; has in modern English, but in the original meaning of the word, derived from &quot;Latin ''symbolum'', sign, token, from Greek σύμβολον, token for identification (by comparing with its counterpart), from συμβάλλειν, to throw together, compare&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/74/S0957400.html | publisher = Bartleby | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  It is widely used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Anglicanism]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterians]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].

The Apostles' Creed is [[Trinity|trinitarian]] in structure with sections affirming belief in [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] and [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|God the Holy Spirit]]{{Citation needed |date=February 2020}}. The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].

Because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.

The earliest known mention of the expression &quot;Apostles' Creed&quot; occurs in a letter of AD&amp;nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&amp;pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title = Presbyterian Creeds | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press | year = 1985 | ISBN = 978-0-66425496-4 | pages = 62–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed_orr.html |first= James |last=Orr |title=The Apostles' Creed |website=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |publisher=Reformed |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110622082715/http://www.reformed.org/documents/apostles_creed_orr.html |archivedate= June 22, 2011 |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word ''Symbolum'', standing alone, appears around the middle of the third century in the correspondence of [[Cyprian and Justina|St. Cyprian]] and [[Firmilian|St. Firmilian]], the latter in particular speaking of the Creed as the &quot;Symbol of the [[Trinity]]&quot;, and recognizing it as an integral part of the rite of [[baptism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01629a.htm|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180717061750/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01629a.htm|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2018-07-17|website= [[s:en:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Apostles' Creed|Catholic Encyclopedia (year 1913), Vol.1]]|title= The Apostles' Creed in the Catholic Encyclopedia, editions of 1907|language= en|author1= Thurston, Herbert|place= New York|publisher= Robert Appleton Company}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Symbolum Apostolicum'' (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles) appears for the first time in a letter, probably written by [[Ambrose]], from a Council in [[Early centers of Christianity#Milan|Milan]] to [[Pope Siricius]] in about AD&amp;nbsp;390 &quot;Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Ambrose of Milan |url= http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm#Letter42 | title= Letter 42:5 |publisher= Tertullian.org | accessdate = May 19, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605180149/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_05_letters41_50.htm | archivedate = June 5, 2011 | url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ODCC:AC&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Apostles' Creed | title = Dictionary of the Christian Church | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | ISBN = 978-0192802903 | page = 90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But what existed at that time was not what is now known as the Apostles' Creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase &quot;maker of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] and earth&quot;, a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C4I9AAAAYAAJ | first = Gardiner Mumford | last = Day | title = The Apostles' Creed: an interpretation for today | publisher = Scribner | year = 1963 | page = 33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Somme le Roy f.10v.png|thumb|This illumination from a 13th-century manuscript shows the apostles writing the Creed, receiving inspiration from the Holy Spirit.]]
The account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=woD7QYAjV3QC | first = Arthur Cushman | last = McGiffert | title = The Apostles' Creed: Its Origin, Its Purpose, and Its Historical Interpretation | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0559851995 | page = 42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.&lt;ref name = ODCC:AC /&gt;

The earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on {{bibleverse ||Matthew|28:19}},&lt;ref name= ODCC:AC /&gt; part of the [[Great Commission]], and it has been argued that this earlier text was already in written form by the late [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] (c. 180).&lt;ref name= ODCC:AC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Documents of the Christian Church | edition = 2nd | editor-first = Henry | editor-last = Bettenson | publisher = London | year = 1963 | page = 23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Joseph | last = Lynch | title = The Medieval Church | publisher = Longman | place = London and NY | year = 1992 | page = 7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed – even those not found in the [[Old Roman Symbol]] – are found in various writings by [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Novatian]], [[Marcellus of Ancyra|Marcellus]], [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], [[Ambrose]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Nicetas]], and [[Eusebius Gallus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.iv.i.i.v.html |title= Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes | volume = II. The History of Creeds | publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal Library | date= July 13, 2005 | accessdate = May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the ''De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus'' (&quot;''Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books''&quot;) of [[Saint Pirmin|St. Pirminius]] ([[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' 89, 1029 ff.), written between 710 and 714.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JND | last = Kelly | title = Early Christian Creeds | edition = third | place = London | publisher = Longman, Green &amp; Co | year = 1972 | pages = 398–434}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bettenson and Maunder state that it is first from ''Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus'' (''idem quod excarpsus'', excerpt), c. 750.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Bettenson | first1 = Henry | first2 = Chris | last2 = Maunder | title = Documents of the Christian Church | edition = 3 | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1999 | page = 26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This longer Creed seems to have arisen in what is now France and Spain. [[Charlemagne]] imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in Rome, where the [[Old Roman Symbol]] or similar formulas had survived for centuries.&lt;ref name =ODCC:AC/&gt; It has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier.&lt;ref name = &quot;Newadvent&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | contribution = Origin of the Creed | publisher = New advent | contribution-url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01629a.htm}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As can be seen from various creeds all quoted in full below, although the original [[Apostles' Creed#Text in Greek|Greek]] and [[Apostles' Creed#Text in Latin|Latin creeds]] both specifically refer to “[[Resurrection of the dead|the resurrection of the ''flesh'']]” (σαρκὸς ἀνάστασιν and ''carnis resurrectionem''), the versions used by several churches, like the [[Apostles' Creed#Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Apostles' Creed#Church of England|Church of England]], [[Apostles' Creed#Lutheran Church|Lutheran churches]] and [[Apostles' Creed#United Methodist Church|Methodist churches]], talk more generally of “the resurrection of the ''body''”.&lt;ref&gt;Lehtipuu, Outi (2015). ''Debates over the Resurrection of the Dead: Constructing Early Christian Identity''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wolfgang | last = Trillhaas | contribution = Creeds, Lutheran Attitude Toward | title = The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church | editor-first = Julius | editor-last = Bodensieck | place = Minneapolis | publisher = Augsburg | volume = A–E | page = 629}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the phrase &quot;descendit ad inferos&quot; ([[Harrowing of Hell|&quot;he descended into hell&quot;]]) echoes {{bibleverse ||Ephesians|4:9|NIV}}, &quot;κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς&quot; (&quot;he descended into the lower earthly regions&quot;). It is of interest that this phrase first appeared in one of the two versions of Rufinus in AD&amp;nbsp;390 and then did not appear again in any version of the creed until AD&amp;nbsp;650.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Wayne A | last = Grudem | title = Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine | place = Leicester, [[England|ENG]]; Grand Rapids, MI | publisher = Inter-Varsity Press; Zondervan | year = 2004 | page = 586}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This phrase and that on the [[communion of saints]] are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the [[Old Roman Symbol]] nor in the [[Nicene Creed]].

The International Consultation on English Texts (ICET), a first inter-church ecumenical group that undertook the writing of texts for use by English-speaking Christians in common, published ''Prayers We Have in Common'' (Fortress Press, 1970,1971,1975). Its version of the Apostles' Creed was adopted by several churches.&lt;ref name=CNCC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=2 June 2019|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JVB&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanden Bosch |first1=James |date=December 1989 |title=Revised But Not Standard |url=https://www.reformedworship.org/article/december-1989/revised-not-standard |journal=Reformed Worship |volume= |issue=14 |access-date=2 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== English Language Liturgical Consultation ====
The [[English Language Liturgical Consultation]] (ELLC), a successor body to the International Consultation on English Texts (ICET), published in 1988 a revised translation of the Apostles' Creed. It avoided the word &quot;his&quot; in relation to God and spoke of Jesus Christ as &quot;God's only Son&quot; instead of &quot;his only Son&quot;. In the fourth line, it replaced the personal pronoun &quot;he&quot; with the relative &quot;who&quot;, and changed the punctuation, so as no longer to present the Creed as a series of separate statements. In the same line it removed the words &quot;the power of&quot;. It explained its rationale for making these changes and for preserving other controverted expressions in the 1988 publication ''Praying Together'', with which it presented its new version:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Praying Together|url=https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/a42fbdb2/files/uploaded/praying.pdf|publisher=English Language Liturgical Consultation|access-date=2 June 2019|page=22|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic Church===
The initial (1970) English official translation of the [[Roman Missal]] of the [[Catholic Church]] adopted the ICET version, as did catechetical texts such as the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]''.&lt;ref name=CNCC/&gt;&lt;ref name=JVB/&gt;

In 2008 the Catholic Church published a new English translation of the texts of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Roman Rite]], use of which came into force at the end of 2011. It included the following translation of the Apostles' Creed:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.catholicbishops.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Order-of-Mass.pdf |title=Order of Mass |publisher=International Committee on English in the Liturgy, Inc. |year=2010 |format=PDF |page=10 |accessdate=16 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.catholic.org.au/all-downloads/bishops-commissions-1/bishops-commission-for-liturgy-1/national-liturgical-music-board-1/971-new-english-translations-of-ordo-missae-to-be-set-to-music-1/file |title=New English translations of Ordo Missae to be set to music |publisher=[[Catholic Church in Australia]] |publication-date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2019 |format=PDF |page=5}}.

==== Traditional twelve articles of the Creed ====
In its discussion of the contents of the Creed, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' presents it in the traditional division into twelve articles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P13.HTM |title= English translation of the Apostles' Creed | work = The Catechism of the Catholic Church | publisher =Vatican |date= March 25, 1997 |accessdate= April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P14.HTM | work =English translation of the Apostles' Creed | title=Part I, Section II | publisher = Vatican | accessdate = May 19, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000646/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P14.HTM | archivedate = May 14, 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Leonhart:'' Which of the articles of the creed deal with baptism?&lt;br /&gt;''Hans:'' The ninth and tenth articles, where we confess the universal Christian church, the fellowship of the saints and forgiveness of sins, just as the Lord's Supper is also included there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Pipkin |editor1-first=H.

[[Pelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvár]] gives a slightly different division, assigning one phrase to each apostle: [[Saint Peter|Peter]] (No.&amp;nbsp;1), [[John the Apostle|John]] (No.&amp;nbsp;2), [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], son of [[Zebedee]] (No.&amp;nbsp;3), [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]] (No.&amp;nbsp;4), [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] (No.&amp;nbsp;5a: descendit ad infernos...), [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]] (No.&amp;nbsp;5b: ascendit ad caelos...), [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] (No.&amp;nbsp;6), [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] (No.&amp;nbsp;7), [[James, son of Alphaeus|James]], son of [[Alphaeus]] (No.&amp;nbsp;8), [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]] (No.&amp;nbsp;9), [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]] (No.&amp;nbsp;10), [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]] (No.&amp;nbsp;11–12).&lt;ref&gt;{{br-separated entries |Sermones Pomerii de sanctis II.

===Lutheran Church===

====''Evangelical Lutheran Worship''====
The publication ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' published by Augsburg Fortress, is the primary worship resource for the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]]. It presents the official ELCA version, footnoting the phrase &quot;he descended to the dead&quot; to indicate an alternative reading: &quot;or ‘he descended into hell,’ another translation of this text in widespread use&quot;.

The text is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apostles’ Creed|url=http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/Apostles_Creed_Evangelical_Lutheran_Worship.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|I believe in God, the Father almighty, 
     creator of heaven and earth.

I believe in Jesus Christ, God's only Son, our Lord, 
     who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, 
     born of the virgin Mary, 
     suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
     was crucified, died, and was buried; 
     he descended to the dead.* 
     On the third day he rose again; 
     he ascended into heaven, 
     he is seated at the right hand of the Father, 
     and he will come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, 
     the holy catholic church, 
     the communion of saints, 
     the forgiveness of sins, 
     the resurrection of the body, 
     and the life everlasting. Amen.}}

====Church of Denmark====
The [[Church of Denmark]] still uses the phrase &quot;We renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings&quot; as the beginning of this creed, before the line &quot;We believe in God etc.&quot; This is mostly due to the influence of the Danish pastor [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]. See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|Den apostolske trosbekendelse]].

===United Methodist Church===
The [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at No. 881 in the ''[[United Methodist Hymnal]]'', one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]], founders of [[Methodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093223/http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |archivedate= May 18, 2011 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093227/http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |archivedate= May 18, 2011 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable for omitting the line &quot;he descended into hell&quot;, but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/apostles-creed-traditional-ecumenical | title = Apostle's Creed Traditional and Ecumenical Versions | publisher = The United Methodist Church |accessdate= July 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes &quot;he descended to the dead.&quot;

However, when the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in the United States in 1784, John Wesley sent the new American Church a Sunday Service which included the phrase &quot;he descended into hell&quot; in the text of The Apostles' Creed.  &lt;ref&gt;Wesley, &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with other Occasional Services,&quot; 1784, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;. It is clear that Wesley intended American Methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the Creed. 

The ''United Methodist Hymnal'' also contains (at #882) what it terms the &quot;Ecumenical Version&quot; of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word &quot;catholic&quot; is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.

==Liturgical use in Western Christianity==
The Apostles' Creed is used in its direct form or in interrogative forms by Western Christian communities in several of their [[liturgy|liturgical]] rites, in particular those of [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].

=== Rite of Baptism ===
The Apostles' Creed, whose present form is similar to the baptismal creed used in Rome in the third and fourth centuries, actually developed from questions addressed to those seeking baptism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apostles-Creed ''Encyclopædia Britannica'': &quot;Apostles' Creed&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church still today uses an interrogative form of it in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:
:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?

To each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers &quot;I do.&quot; Then the celebrant says:
:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And all respond: Amen.

The [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase &quot;born of the virgin Mary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: &quot;Why use the Apostles’ Creed in a baptism?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. The Apostles' Creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, &quot;Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=&quot;Holy Baptism,&quot; The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]] likewise asks the candidates, sponsors and congregation to recite the Apostles' Creed in answer to similar interrogations, in which it avoids using the word &quot;God&quot; of the Son and the Holy Spirit, asking instead: &quot;Do you believe and trust in his Son Jesus Christ?&quot;, and &quot;Do you believe and trust in the Holy Spirit?&quot; Moreover, &quot;where there are strong pastoral reasons&quot;, it allows use of an alternative formula in which the interrogations, while speaking of &quot;God the Son&quot; and &quot;God the Holy Spirit&quot;, are more elaborate but are not based on the Apostles' Creed, and the response in each case is: &quot;I believe and trust in him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/christian-initiation/baptism-and-confirmation ''Common Worship'': &quot;Holy Baptism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' may also be used, which in its rite of baptism has the minister recite the Apostles' Creed in interrogative form. asking the godparents or, in the case &quot;of such as are of Riper Years&quot;, the candidate: &quot;Dost thou believe in God the Father ...&quot; The response is: &quot;All this I stedfastly believe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Book of Common Prayer'': &quot;[https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/public-baptism-infants The Ministration of Public Baptism to Infants]&quot;; &quot;[https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/public-baptism-such-are-riper The Order of Baptism for those of Riper Years]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lutheran]]s following the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' ([[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]]), like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:
:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?

Following each question, the candidate answers: &quot;Yes, I believe&quot;. If the candidates are unable to answer for themselves, the sponsors are to answer the questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lutheran Service Book|last=The Commission on Worship of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod|first=|publisher=[[Concordia Publishing House]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7586-1217-5|location=St. Louis|pages=268-271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For ELCA Lutherans who use the [[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]] book, the Apostles' Creed appears during the Sacrament of Holy Baptism Rite on p.&amp;nbsp;229 of the hardcover pew edition.

[[Methodism|Methodists]] use the Apostles' Creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the Church's sacramental act. For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.
:Do you believe in God?
:I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
:Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
:I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again; he ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead.
:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit?
:I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The United Methodist Hymnal | chapter = Baptismal Covenant I | page = 35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eucharistic Rite ===
Since the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the [[Roman Missal]] as an alternative, with the indication, &quot;Instead of the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]], especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles' Creed, may be used.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IwV6-e0juMEC&amp;pg=PA528&amp;dq=Roman+Missal+%22baptismal+Symbol%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG3Izq_J3gAhVxVBUIHUJmCHkQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20Missal%20%22baptismal%20Symbol%22&amp;f=false |title=Roman Missal |publisher=Liturgy Training Publications |year=2011 |accessdate=2 February 2019}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles' Creed was already permitted.

=== Liturgy of the Hours ===
The Apostles' Creed is used in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] services of [[Matins]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer (Evensong)]]. It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the [[Canticle]]s, and is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the [[Choir (architecture)|quire]].

Before the 1955 [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|simplification of the rubrics ]] of the [[Roman Breviary]] by [[Pope Pius XII]], the Apostles' Creed was recited at the beginning of [[matins]] and [[prime (liturgy)|prime]], at the end of [[compline]], and in some ''[[preces]]'' (a series of versicles and responses preceded by ''Kyrie, eleison'' (&quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;) and the [[Our Father]])  of prime and compline&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2010/10/compendium-of-reforms-of-roman-breviary_24.html#.XAmmMttKiJB&lt;/ref&gt; on certain days during Advent and Lent.

==Musical settings==
Musical settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum as a [[motet]] are rare. The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, and the Spanish composer [[Fernando de las Infantas]] published two in 1578.

[[Martin Luther]] wrote the hymn &quot;[[Wir glauben all an einen Gott]]&quot; (translated into Engish as &quot;We all believe in one God&quot;) in 1524 as a paraphrase of the Apostles' Creed.

In 1957, [[William P. Latham]] wrote &quot;Credo (Metrical Version of the Apostle’s Creed)&quot; in an SATB arrangement suitable for boys' and men's voices.

In 1979 [[John Michael Talbot]], a [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order Franciscan]], composed and recorded &quot;Creed&quot; on his album, ''The Lord's Supper''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith | first = Michael G | title = Troubador of the Kingdom | newspaper = [[Christianity Today]] | date = February 1, 1985 | page = 88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 [[Graham Kendrick]] published the popular &quot;We believe in God the Father&quot;, closely based on the Apostles' Creed.

The song &quot;Creed&quot; on [[Petra (band)|Petra]]'s 1990 album ''Beyond Belief'' is loosely based on the Apostles' Creed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Powell | first = Mark Allan | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music | publisher = Hendrickson | ISBN = 1565636791 | page = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/696 696] | url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GIA Publications]] published a hymn text in 1991 directly based on the Apostles' Creed, called &quot;I Believe in God Almighty.&quot; It has been sung to hymn tunes from Wales, the Netherlands, and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = I believe in God almighty | title = Hymnary | contribution-url = http://www.hymnary.org/text/i_believe_in_god_almighty}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rich Mullins]] and [[Beaker (musician)|Beaker]] also composed a musical setting titled &quot;Creed&quot;, released on Mullins' 1993 album ''[[A Liturgy, a Legacy, &amp; a Ragamuffin Band]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Powell | first = Mark Allan | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music | publisher = Hendrickson | ISBN = 1565636791 | page = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/615 615] | url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, Mullins' version replaces &quot;one holy catholic church&quot; with &quot;one holy church&quot;.

[[Integrity Music]] under the [[Hosanna! Music]] series, produced a live worship acoustic album in 1993, ‘''Be Magnified''’, &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rothwell, Randy.|title=Be magnified : featuring Randy Rothwell.|date=1993|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/271477619|publisher=Hosanna! Music|oclc=271477619|access-date=2019-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;which featured Randy Rothwell as worship leader, had an upbeat enthusiastic hymn called “The Apostle’s Creed”, written by Randy Rothwell Burbank. 

In 2014 [[Hillsong Music Australia|Hillsong]] released a version of the Apostles' Creed under the title &quot;This I Believe (The Creed)&quot; on their album ''[[No Other Name]]''. [[Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty]] released an expression of the Apostles' Creed under the title &quot;We Believe (Apostle's Creed)&quot; on their 2016 album ''Facing a Task Unfinished''.
