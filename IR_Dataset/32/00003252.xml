'''Amygdalin''' (from [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀμυγδαλή}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|amygdálē}}'' &quot;almond&quot;) is a naturally occurring [[chemical compound]] best known for being falsely promoted as a cancer cure. It is found in many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of [[apricot]]s, [[bitter almonds]], [[apple]]s, [[peach]]es, and [[plum]]s.

Amygdalin is classified as a [[cyanogenic glycoside]] because each amygdalin molecule includes a [[nitrile]] group, which can be released as the toxic [[cyanide]] anion by the action of a [[beta-glucosidase]]. Eating amygdalin will cause it to release cyanide in the human body, and may lead to [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160427 |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |title=Apricot kernels pose risk of cyanide poisoning |date=27 April 2016 |quote=A naturally-occurring compound called amygdalin is present in apricot kernels and converts to hydrogen cyanide after eating. Cyanide poisoning can cause nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, thirst, lethargy, nervousness, joint and muscle various aches and pains, and falling blood pressure. In extreme cases it is fatal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the early 1950s, both amygdalin and a modified form named '''laetrile''' have been promoted as [[alternative cancer treatments]], often under the [[misnomer]] '''vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;''' (neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a [[vitamin]]).&lt;ref name=CaCancer/&gt; Scientific study has found them to be clinically ineffective in treating cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth due to [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref name=Milazzo2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milazzo S, Horneber M | title = Laetrile treatment for cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD005476 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25918920 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005476.pub4 | pmc = 6513327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of [[quackery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lerner IJ | title = The whys of cancer quackery | journal = Cancer | volume = 53 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 815–9 | date = February 1984 | pmid = 6362828 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(19840201)53:3+&lt;815::AID-CNCR2820531334&gt;3.0.CO;2-U }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nightingale SL | title = Laetrile: the regulatory challenge of an unproven remedy | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–8 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6431478 | pmc = 1424606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as &quot;the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most [[Profit (accounting)|remunerative]] cancer quack promotion in medical history&quot;.&lt;ref name=CaCancer/&gt;

Amygdalin is a cyanogenic glycoside derived from the aromatic amino acid [[phenylalanine]]. Amygdalin and [[prunasin]] are common among plants of the family [[Rosaceae]], particularly the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', [[Poaceae]] (grasses), [[Fabaceae]] (legumes), and in other food plants, including [[flaxseed]] and [[manioc]].  Within these plants, amygdalin and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze it are stored in separate locations so that they will mix in response to tissue damage. This provides a natural defense system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mora CA, Halter JG, Adler C, Hund A, Anders H, Yu K, Stark WJ | title = Application of the Prunus spp. Cyanide Seed Defense System onto Wheat: Reduced Insect Feeding and Field Growth Tests | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 64 | issue = 18 | pages = 3501–7 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27119432 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00438 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amygdalin is contained in [[drupe|stone fruit]] kernels, such as [[almond]]s, [[apricot]] (14&amp;nbsp;g/kg), [[peach]] (6.8&amp;nbsp;g/kg), and [[plum]] (4–17.5&amp;nbsp;g/kg depending on variety), and also in the seeds of the [[apple]] (3&amp;nbsp;g/kg) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolarinwa|first=Islamiyat F.|last2=Orfila|first2=Caroline|last3=Morgan|first3=Michael R.A.|date=2014|title=Amygdalin content of seeds, kernels and food products commercially-available in the UK|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0308814613016245|journal=Food Chemistry|language=en|volume=152|pages=133–139|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.11.002|archive-url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/83873/|archive-date=2 March 2015|via=|pmid=24444917}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Benzaldehyde released from amygdalin provides a bitter flavor.

For one method of isolating amygdalin, the stones are removed from the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in [[ethanol]]; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of [[diethyl ether]], amygdalin is precipitated as minute white crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Amygdalin|volume=1|page=900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural amygdalin has the (''R'')-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the (''S'')-epimer is called '''neoamygdalin'''. Although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the (''R'')-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wahab MF, Breitbach ZS, Armstrong DW, Strattan R, Berthod A | title = Problems and Pitfalls in the Analysis of Amygdalin and Its Epimer | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 63 | issue = 40 | pages = 8966–73 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26431391 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laetrile (patented 1961) is a simpler semisynthetic derivative of amygdalin. Laetrile is synthesized from amygdalin by hydrolysis. The usual preferred commercial source is from apricot kernels (''[[Prunus armeniaca]]''). The name is derived from the separate words &quot;[[laevorotatory]]&quot; and &quot;mandelonitrile&quot;. Laevorotatory describes the stereochemistry of the molecule, while mandelonitrile refers to the portion of the molecule from which cyanide is released by decomposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCIpdq&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Laetrile/Amygdalin (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version: General Information | date = March 15, 2017 | pmid = 26389425 | url = https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/laetrile-pdq#section/_5 | website = cancer.gov | publisher = National Cancer Institute | series = Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Health Professionals | access-date = 2017-05-09 | last1 = Pdq Integrative | first1 = Alternative }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 500&amp;nbsp;mg laetrile tablet may contain between 2.5–25&amp;nbsp;mg of hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Jerrold B. Leikin | editor2=Frank P.

Like amygdalin, laetrile is hydrolyzed in the duodenum (alkaline) and in the intestine (enzymatically) to &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-[[glucuronic acid]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[mandelonitrile]]; the latter hydrolyzes to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, that in sufficient quantities causes [[cyanide poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rietjens IM, Martena MJ, Boersma MG, Spiegelenberg W, Alink GM | title = Molecular mechanisms of toxicity of important food-borne phytotoxins | journal = Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–58 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15635687 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.200400078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for laetrile were based on three different hypotheses:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = James A. | last = Duke | name-list-format = vanc | title=CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices | publisher=CRC Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-8493-1279-3 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hypothesis proposed that cancerous cells contained copious beta-glucosidases, which release HCN from laetrile via hydrolysis. Normal cells were reportedly unaffected, because they contained low concentrations of beta-glucosidases and high concentrations of [[rhodanese]], which converts HCN to the less toxic [[thiocyanate]]. Later, however, it was shown that both cancerous and normal cells contain only trace amounts of beta-glucosidases and similar amounts of rhodanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The second proposed that, after ingestion, amygdalin was hydrolyzed to [[mandelonitrile]], transported intact to the liver and converted to a beta-glucuronide complex, which was then carried to the cancerous cells, hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidases to release mandelonitrile and then HCN. Mandelonitrile, however, dissociates to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, and cannot be stabilized by glycosylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFSA2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acute health risks related to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in raw apricot kernels and products derived from raw apricot kernels|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=14|issue=4|year=2016|issn=1831-4732|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4424}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Finally, the third asserted that laetrile is the discovered vitamin B-17, and further suggests that cancer is a result of &quot;B-17 deficiency&quot;. It postulated that regular dietary administration of this form of laetrile would, therefore, actually prevent all incidence of cancer. There is no evidence supporting this conjecture in the form of a physiologic process, nutritional requirement, or identification of any deficiency syndrome.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1154776&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg DM | title = The vitamin fraud in cancer quackery | journal = The Western Journal of Medicine | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 345–8 | date = April 1975 | pmid = 1154776 | pmc = 1129741 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;vitamin B-17&quot; is not recognized by Committee on Nomenclature of the American Institute of Nutrition Vitamins.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCIpdq&quot; /&gt; [[Ernst T.

=== History of laetrile ===
==== Early usage ====
Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830 from [[bitter almond]] seeds (''[[Prunus dulcis]]'') by [[Pierre-Jean Robiquet]] and [[Antoine François Boutron Charlard|Antoine Boutron-Charlard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A chronology of significant historical developments in the biological sciences |work=Botany Online Internet Hypertextbook |publisher=[[University of Hamburg]], Department of Biology |date=18 August 2002 |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01/geschichte.htm |access-date=6 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820063617/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01/geschichte.htm |archive-date=20 August 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig|Liebig]] and [[Friedrich Woehler|Wöhler]] found three [[hydrolysis]] products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and [[prussic acid]] (hydrogen cyanide, HCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Ueber die Bildung des Bittermandelöls |author1=F.

In 1845 amygdalin was used as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous.&lt;ref name=CancerInstitute/&gt; In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative,&lt;ref name=patent&gt;{{Cite patent| inventor-last = Krebs | inventor-first =Ernst T. | inventor2-last =Krebs, Jr. | inventor2-first =Ernst T. | date = 23 May 1961 | title = Hexuronic acid derivatives | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2985664.html | country-code = US | patent-number = 2985664 | author =E Krebs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.&lt;ref name=CancerInstitute/&gt;

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] prohibited the interstate shipment of amygdalin and laetrile in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |title= Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA.

==== Subsequent results ====
In a 1977 controlled, blinded trial, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade1977&quot;/&gt;

Subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. The [[Memorial Sloan&amp;ndash;Kettering Cancer Center]] (MSKCC) concluded that &quot;laetrile showed no beneficial effects.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wade1977/&gt; Mistakes in an earlier MSKCC press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by [[Ralph W. Moss (science writer)|Ralph Moss]], former public affairs official of MSKCC who had been fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of laetrile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budiansky1995&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen |last=Budiansky | name-list-format = vanc |title=Cures or Quackery: How Senator Harkin shaped federal research on alternative medicine |date=9 July 1995 |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/950717/archive_032434.htm |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |access-date=7 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903141336/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/950717/archive_032434.htm |archive-date=3 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in ''Science'' stated that &quot;even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wade1977&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wade N | title = Laetrile at Sloan-Kettering: a question of ambiguity | journal = Science | volume = 198 | issue = 4323 | pages = 1231–4 | date = December 1977 | pmid = 17741690 | doi = 10.1126/science.198.4323.1231 | bibcode = 1977Sci...198.1231W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from these studies were published all together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stock CC, Tarnowski GS, Schmid FA, Hutchison DJ, Teller MN | title = Antitumor tests of amygdalin in transplantable animal tumor systems | journal = Journal of Surgical Oncology | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–8 | year = 1978 | pmid = 642516 | doi = 10.1002/jso.2930100202 }}&lt;br /&gt;

A 2015 [[systematic review]] from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found: {{quotation|&lt;nowiki&gt;The claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data. There is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk–benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=Milazzo2015 /&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The authors also recommended, on ethical and scientific grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or amygdalin be conducted.&lt;ref name=Milazzo2015 /&gt;

Given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] or the [[European Commission]].

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amygdalin showed little or no effect against cancer.&lt;ref name =CancerInstitute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/laetrile/patient/allpages#Section_20|title=Laetrile/Amygdalin|work=National Cancer Institute|date=2005-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 1982 trial by the Mayo Clinic of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/laetrile|title=Laetrile (amygdalin, vitamin B17)|work=cancerhelp.org.uk|date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that &quot;the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range.&quot;

The study concluded &quot;Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment&quot;.

Additionally,  &quot;No controlled clinical trials (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported.&quot;&lt;ref name =CancerInstitute /&gt;

The side effects of laetrile treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, cherry red skin color, liver damage, abnormally low blood pressure, droopy upper eyelid, trouble walking due to damaged nerves, fever, mental confusion, coma, and death.

The [[European Food Safety Agency]]'s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain has studied the potential toxicity of the amygdalin in [[apricot kernels]].  The Panel reported, &quot;If consumers follow the recommendations of websites that promote consumption of apricot kernels, their exposure to cyanide will greatly exceed&quot; the dose expected to be toxic.  The Panel also reported that acute cyanide toxicity had occurred in adults who had consumed 20 or more kernels and that in children &quot;five or more kernels appear to be toxic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EFSA2016&quot; /&gt;

=== Advocacy and legality of laetrile ===
Advocates for laetrile assert that there is a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] between the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[pharmaceutical industry]] and the medical community, including the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Cancer Society]], to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports/&gt;

Advocates of the use of laetrile have also changed the rationale for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a &quot;holistic&quot; nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports/&gt;

Despite the lack of evidence for its use, laetrile developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a &quot;pain-free&quot; treatment of cancer as an alternative to [[surgery]] and [[chemotherapy]] that have significant side effects. The use of laetrile led to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=ConsumerReports&gt;{{Cite book | last = Editors of Consumer Reports Books | title = Health Quackery | place = Vernon, New York | publisher = Consumers Union | year = 1980 | chapter = Laetrile: the Political Success of a Scientific Failure | pages = [https://archive.org/details/healthquackeryco00cons/page/16 16–40] | isbn = 978-0-89043-014-9 | chapter-url-access = registration | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/healthquackeryco00cons | url = https://archive.org/details/healthquackeryco00cons/page/16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA and AMA crackdown, begun in the 1970s, effectively escalated prices on the black market, played into the conspiracy narrative and enabled unscrupulous profiteers to foster multimillion-dollar smuggling empires.&lt;ref&gt;Laetrile: The Cult of Cyanide Poisoning; Promoting Poison for Profit, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, May 1979, pp. 1121–1158.  http://www.ajcn.org/content/32/5/1121.full.pdf retrieved: Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the  1970s, court cases in several states challenged the FDA's authority to restrict access to what they claimed are potentially lifesaving drugs. More than twenty states passed laws making the use of Laetrile legal. After the unanimous Supreme Court ruling in ''Rutherford v. United States'' which established that interstate transport of the compound was illegal, usage fell off dramatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCIpdq&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Curran1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curran WJ | title = Law-medicine notes.
