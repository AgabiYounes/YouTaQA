The '''Azores''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|ɔər|z}} {{Respell|ə|ZORZ}}, &lt;small&gt;also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|eɪ|z|ɔər|z}} {{Respell|AY|zorz}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Azores|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/azores|title=Azores|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/Azores &quot;Azores&quot;]&lt;nowiki&gt; (US) and {{Cite Oxford&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;nowiki&gt;Dictionaries|Azores|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Azores|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-pt|Açores}} {{IPA-pt|ɐˈsoɾɨʃ|}}), officially the '''Autonomous Region of the Azores''' ({{lang|pt|Região Autónoma dos Açores}}), is one of the two [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] (along with [[Madeira]]). It is an [[archipelago]] composed of nine [[High island|volcanic island]]s in the [[Macaronesia]] region of the North Atlantic Ocean, about {{convert|1360|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of continental [[Portugal]], about {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Lisbon]], in [[continental Portugal]], about {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Morocco]], and about {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]].

Its main industries are agriculture, [[dairy farming]], livestock, [[fishing in Portugal|fishing]], and [[tourism in Portugal|tourism]], which is becoming the major service activity in the region. In addition, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in the service and tertiary sectors. The main city of the Azores is [[Ponta Delgada]].

There are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are [[Flores (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]], to the west; [[Graciosa]], [[Terceira]], [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], [[Pico Island|Pico]], and [[Faial Island|Faial]] in the centre; and [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], and the [[Formigas|Formigas Reef]] to the east. They extend for more than {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.

All the islands have [[volcanic]] origins, although some, such as [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], have had no recorded activity since the islands were settled. [[Mount Pico]], on the island of [[Pico Island|Pico]], is the highest point in Portugal, at {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. If measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean to their peaks, which thrust high above the surface of the Atlantic, the Azores are actually some of the tallest mountains on the planet.

The climate of the Azores is very mild for such a northerly location, being influenced by its distance from the continents and by the passing [[Gulf Stream]]. Due to the marine influence, temperatures remain mild year-round. Daytime temperatures normally fluctuate between {{convert|16|C|F}} and {{convert|25|C|F}} depending on season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/en/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/020/|title=Ponta Delgada Climate Normals 1981–2010|publisher=IPMA|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/en/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/026/|title=Angra do Heroísmo Climate Normals 1981–2010|publisher=IPMA|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures above {{convert|30|C|F}} or below {{convert|3|C|F}} are unknown in the major population centres. It is also generally wet and cloudy.

The culture, dialect, cuisine, and traditions of the Azorean islands vary considerably, because these remote islands were settled sporadically over a span of two centuries.

==History==
{{main|History of the Azores}}
A small number of alleged [[Hypogeum|hypogea]], earthen structures carved into rocks that were used for burials, have been identified on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira by Portuguese archaeologist Nuno Ribeiro, who speculated that they might date back 2000 years, implying a human presence on the island before the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |website=Correio da Manhã |language=Portuguese |accessdate=18 June 2011 |title=Estruturas podem ter mais de dois mil anos: Monumentos funerários descobertos nos Açores |date=5 March 2011 |location=Lisbon, Portugal |editor=J.M.A. |publisher=Cofina Media |url=http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/monumentos-funerarios-descobertos-nos-acores |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514153752/http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/detalhe/noticias/ultima-hora/monumentos-funerarios-descobertos-nos-acores |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; These kinds of structures have been used in the Azores to store [[cereals]], however, and suggestions by Ribeiro that they might be burial sites are unconfirmed. Detailed examination and dating to authenticate the validity of these speculations is lacking, thus it is unclear whether these structures are natural or man-made and whether they predate the 15th-century Portuguese colonization of the Azores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Açoreana Oriental |language=Portuguese |accessdate=27 June 2011 |title=Estudos arqueológicos podem indicar presença prévia ao povoamento das ilhas |date=27 June 2011 |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |editor=AO Online |url=http://www.acorianooriental.pt/noticias/view/216916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery===
[[File:Henry_the_Navigator1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Under direction of [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], the Azores were discovered and populated in the early 1400's.]]
The islands were known in the fourteenth century, and parts of them appear in the [[Catalan Atlas]]. In 1427, a captain sailing for [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], possibly [[Gonçalo Velho]], may have rediscovered the Azores, but this is not certain. In [[Thomas Ashe (writer)|Thomas Ashe]]'s 1813 work, ''A History of the Azores'',&lt;ref name=&quot;History1813&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Ashe|title=History of the Azores, or Western Islands|year=1813|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author identified a [[Flemish people|Fleming]], Joshua Vander Berg of [[Bruges]], who made landfall in the archipelago during a storm on his way to [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History1813&quot;/&gt; He stated that the Portuguese explored the area and claimed it for Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;History1813&quot;/&gt; Other stories note the discovery of the first islands ([[São Miguel Island]], [[Santa Maria Island]] and [[Terceira Island]]) by sailors in the service of [[Henry the Navigator]], although there are few documents to support the claims.

Although it is commonly said that the archipelago received its name from {{lang|pt|açor}} ([[northern goshawk|goshawk]]  in Portuguese), a common bird at the time of discovery, it is unlikely that the bird nested or hunted on the islands.

===Settlement===
There were no large animals on Santa Maria, so after its discovery and before settlement began, sheep were let loose on the island to supply future settlers with food. Settlement did not take place right away, however. Portuguese people weren't very interested in living on an isolated archipelago so far from civilization. [[Gonçalo Velho Cabral]] patiently gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433–1436), however, and sailed to establish colonies, first on Santa Maria and then on São Miguel. Settlers cleared bush and rocks to plant crops: grain, grape vines, [[sugar cane]], and other plants suitable for local use and of commercial value. They brought domesticated animals, such as chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats, and [[Domestic pig|pigs]], and built houses and established villages.

The archipelago was largely settled from mainland Portugal. Portuguese settlers came from the provinces of [[Algarve]], [[Minho Province|Minho]], [[Alentejo Province|Alentejo]] and [[Ribatejo Province|Ribatejo]] as well as [[Madeira]]. São Miguel was first settled in 1449, the settlers – mainly from the [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]], Alto Alentejo and Algarve areas of mainland Portugal, under the command of Gonçalo Velho Cabral – landed at the site of modern-day [[Povoação]]. Many of the early settlers were Portuguese Sephardic Jews who were banished/exiled there by the inquisition on mainland Portugal - many had well known Sephardic surnames such as: Pereira, Oliveira, Cardoso, Pimentel, Pinto, Rodrigues, Mendes, or Nunes. 
[[File:Azores old map.jpg|thumb|left|1584 map of the Azores Islands.]]
In 1522, [[Vila Franca do Campo]], then the capital of the island, was devastated by an [[1522 Vila Franca earthquake|earthquake and landslide]] that killed about 5,000 people, and the capital was moved to [[Ponta Delgada]]. The town of Vila Franca do Campo was rebuilt on the original site and today is a thriving fishing and yachting port. Ponta Delgada received its city status in 1546. From the first settlement, the pioneers applied themselves to agriculture and by the 15th century Graciosa exported wheat, barley, wine and brandy. The goods were sent to Terceira largely because of the proximity of the island.
[[File:Ribeira Grande, São Miguel Island, Azores - panoramio (7) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Gaspar Frutuoso]] wrote ''[[Saudades da Terra]]'', the first history of the Azores and [[Macaronesia]], in the 1580's.]]
The first reference to the island of São Jorge was made in 1439 but the actual date of discovery is unknown. In 1443 the island was already inhabited but active settlement only began with the arrival of the noble [[Flemish]] native [[Willem van der Haegen]]. Arriving at [[Topo (Azores)|Topo]], where he lived and died, he became known as ''Guilherme da Silveira'' to the islanders. [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] received the captaincy of the island in 1483. [[Velas]] became a town before the end of the 15th century. By 1490, there were 2,000 Flemings living in the islands of Terceira, Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Flores. Because there was such a large Flemish settlement, the Azores became known as the Flemish Islands or the Isles of Flanders. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was responsible for this settlement. His sister, [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabel]], was married to [[Philip the Good|Duke Philip of Burgundy]] of which Flanders was a part. There was a revolt against Philip's rule and disease and hunger became rampant. Isabel appealed to Henry to allow some of the unruly Flemings to settle in the Azores. He granted this and supplied them with the necessary transportation and goods.

The [[Human settlement|settlement]] of the then-unoccupied islands started in 1439 with people mainly from the continental provinces of Algarve and [[Alentejo]]. In 1583, [[Philip II of Spain]], as [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]], sent his fleet to clear the Azores of a combined multinational force of adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers and soldiers who were attempting to establish the Azores as a staging post for a rival [[pretender]] to the Portuguese throne. Following the success of his fleet at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]] captured enemies were hanged from yardarms, as they were considered pirates by Philip II. Opponents receiving the news variously portrayed Philip II as a despot or &quot;[[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]&quot;; the sort of insult widely made against contemporary monarchs engaged in aggressive empire building and the [[European Wars of Religion]]. An English [[Azores Voyage of 1589|raid of the Azores]] in 1589 successfully plundered some harbouring ships and islands; a repeat eight years later, the [[Islands Voyage]], failed. Spain held the Azores under the &quot;Babylonian captivity&quot; of 1580–1642. In the late 16th century, the Azores and [[Madeira]] began to face problems of overpopulation. Spawning from that particular economic problem, some of the people began to emigrate to [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ImperialAge1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=G.V|last=Scammell|title=The First Imperial Age|year=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iberian Union===
[[File:Desembarcoislasterceiras.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Conquest of the Azores|Battle of Terceira]], part of the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]].]]
{{main|Conquest of the Azores}}
Following the death of [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry, the Cardinal-King of Portugal]] the nation fell into a dynastic crisis with [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580#Claimants to the throne|various pretenders]] to the Crown of Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeloBento34&quot;&gt;Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Following his proclamation in Santarém, [[António, Prior of Crato]] was acclaimed in the Azores in 1580 (through his envoy António da Costa), but was expelled from the continent following the [[Battle of Alcântara (1580)|Battle of Alcântara]].&lt;ref name=MeloBento34/&gt; Yet, through the administration of Cipriano de Figueiredo, governor of Terceira (who continued to govern Terceira in the name of ill-fated, former-king [[Sebastian of Portugal]]), the Azoreans resisted attempts to conquer the islands (including specifically at the [[Battle of Salga]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;MeloBento36&quot;&gt;Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; It was Figueiredo and Violante do Canto who helped organize a resistance on Terceira that influenced some of the response of the other islands, even as internal politics and support for Philip's faction increased on the other islands (including specifically on São Miguel, where the Gonçalvez da Câmara family supported the Spanish pretender).&lt;ref name=MeloBento36/&gt;

The Azores were the last part of the [[Portuguese Empire]] to resist Philip's reign over Portugal ([[Macau]] resisted any official recognition), until the defeat of forces loyal to the Prior of Crato with the [[Conquest of the Azores]] in 1583. Portuguese control with the end of the [[Iberian Union]] in 1640, and the beginning of the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], not by the professional military, who were occupied with warfare on the Portuguese mainland, but by local people attacking a fortified [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] garrison.

===Liberal Wars===
{{see also|Liberal Wars}}
[[File:DpedroI-brasil-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro I of Brazil|King-Emperor Pedro IV &amp; I]] planned and launched his campaign in the [[Liberal Wars]] from the Azores in name of his daughter [[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]].]]
The [[Liberal Wars|Portuguese Civil War]] (1828–1834) had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in [[Praia da Vitória]], the Liberals won over the [[Political absolutism|absolutists]], making [[Terceira Island]] the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency ({{lang|pt|Conselho de Regência}}) of [[Maria II of Portugal]] was established.

Beginning in 1868, Portugal issued its stamps overprinted with &quot;{{lang|pt|AÇORES}}&quot; for use in the islands. Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, Graciosa was host to many prominent figures, including [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], the French writer who passed through upon his escape to America during the French revolution; [[Almeida Garrett]], the Portuguese poet who visited an uncle and wrote some poetry while there; and [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert of Monaco]], the 19th century oceanographer who led several expeditions in the waters of the Azores. He arrived on his yacht ''Hirondelle'', and visited the ''furna da caldeira'', the noted hot springs grotto. In 1869, the author [[Mark Twain]] published ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'', a travel book, where he described his time in the Azores.

From 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three districts, equivalent (except in area) to those in the [[Administrative divisions of Portugal#Districts|Portuguese mainland]]. The division was arbitrary, and did not follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (none of which were on the western group).

*'''Angra do Heroísmo''' consisted of Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa, with the capital at [[Angra do Heroísmo]] on Terceira.
*'''Horta''' consisted of Pico, Faial, Flores, and Corvo, with the capital at [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial.
*'''Ponta Delgada''' consisted of São Miguel and Santa Maria, with the capital at [[Ponta Delgada]] on São Miguel.

===Modern period===
[[File:Crest of the Azores.gif|thumb|left|Symbol of the Azorean autonomist movement in the 19th century.]]
In 1931 the Azores (together with Madeira and Portuguese Guinea) revolted against the [[Ditadura Nacional]] and were held briefly by military rebels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=22 June 2011|title=A History of Spain and Portugal – Ch27|year=1972|location=Madison WI|author=Payne, Stanley|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne27.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525184237/http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne27.htm|archivedate= 25 May 2011 |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, during [[World War II]], the Portuguese ruler [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] leased air and naval bases in the Azores to Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/Braun/dim_14_1_neutrality_europe.asp |title=The Role of Portugal -co-opting Nazi Gold, Jonathan Petropoulos, &quot;Dimensions&quot;, Vol 11, No 1, 1997 |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of these facilities in October 1943 was codenamed ''[[Operation Alacrity]]'' by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M B Barrass |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Bromet.htm |title=Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation: Air Vice-Marshal Sir Geoffrey Bromet |publisher=Royal Air Force Organization (RAFWeb.org) |date=2001–2008 |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a key turning point in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], enabling the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the U.S. Navy to provide aerial coverage in the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]]. This helped them to protect [[convoy]]s and to hunt hostile German [[U-boat]]s.

In 1944, the U.S. constructed a small and short-lived air base on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was constructed on the island of [[Terceira]], and it is named [[Lajes Field]]. This air base is in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a large farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This air base is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field continues to support the American and [[Portuguese Armed Forces]]. 
[[File:Flag of the Azores Liberation Front.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Azores Liberation Front]]'s flag preceded the modern [[flag of the Azores|Azorean flag]].]]
During the [[Cold War]], [[U.S. Navy]] [[P-3 Orion]] [[antisubmarine warfare]] squadrons patrolled the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] for [[Soviet Navy]] [[submarine]]s and surface [[warship]]s. Since its opening, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling American [[cargo plane]]s bound for [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. The U.S. Navy keeps a small [[squadron (naval)|squadron]] of its ships at the harbor of [[Praia da Vitória]], {{convert|3|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} southeast of Lajes Field.

The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from the other islands in the Azores, Europe, Africa, and North America.

Following the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, which deposed the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship in Lisbon, Portugal and its territories across the world entered into a period of great political uncertainty. The [[Azorean Liberation Front]] attempted to take advantage of this instability immediately after the revolution, hoping to establish an independent Azores, until operations ceased in 1975.

In 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores ({{lang|pt|Região Autónoma dos Açores}}), one of the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]], and the subdistricts of the Azores were eliminated.

In 2003, the Azores saw international attention when United States president [[George W. Bush]], British prime minister [[Tony Blair]] and Spanish prime minister [[José María Aznar]] and Portuguese prime minister [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]] held a summit there days before the commencement of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/16/sprj.irq.main/index.html|title=CNN.com - Bush: Monday is 'a moment of truth' on Iraq - Mar. 17, 2003|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[archipelago]] of the Azores is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic Ocean and extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation (between 36.5°–40° North [[latitudes]] and 24.5°–31.5° West [[longitudes]]) in an area approximately {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=off}} wide. The islands of the Azores emerged from what is called the [[Azores Plateau]], a 5.8 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; region that is morphologically accented by a depth of {{convert|2,000|m|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, et al., 2008, p.14&quot;&gt;Machado, et al., 2008, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

From a geostructural perspective the Azores is located above an active [[triple junction]] between three of the world's large tectonic plates (the [[North American Plate]], the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[African Plate]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, et al., 2008, p.14&quot;/&gt; a condition that has translated into the existence of many faults and fractures in this region of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Lúis, 1994, p.439–440&lt;/ref&gt; The westernmost islands of the archipelago ([[Corvo Island|Corvo]] and [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]) are located in the North American Plate, while the remaining islands are located within the boundary that divides the Eurasian and African Plates.

The principal tectonic structures that exist in the region of the Azores are the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], the [[Terceira Rift]], the Azores Fracture Zone and the Glória Fault.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machado, et al., 2008, p.14&quot;/&gt; The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] is the main frontier between the American Plate and the African-Eurasian Plates that crosses the Azores Plateau between the islands of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]] from north to south then to the southwest; it is an extensive form crossed by many transform faults running perpendicular to its north-south orientation, that is seismically active and susceptible to volcanism. 

The Terceira Rift is a system of fractures that extends from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Glória Fault that represents the main frontier between the Eurasian and African Plates. It is defined by a line of submarine volcanoes and island mounts that extend northwest to southeast for about {{convert|550|km|0|abbr=off}}, from the area west of [[Graciosa]] until the islets of the [[Formigas]], that includes the islands of Graciosa, Terceira and São Miguel. Its northwest limit connects to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the southeast section intersects the Gloria Fault southeast of the island of [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]]. 

The Azores Fracture Zone extends from the Glória Fault and encompasses a relatively inactive area to the south of the islands of the Central and Eastern groups north to the Terceira Rift, along a 45° angle. The Glória Fault, for its part, extends {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=off}} along a linear line from the Azores to the [[Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeira, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wide image|Sete Cidades (panorama).JPG|1400px|&lt;center&gt;The [[Lagoa das Sete Cidades]], located within the [[Sete Cidades Massif]], in [[Sete Cidades (Ponta Delgada)|Sete Cidades]], [[São Miguel Island]].&lt;/center&gt;}}

The island's volcanism is associated with the rifting along the [[Azores Triple Junction]]; the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferreira, 2005, p.4&quot;&gt;Ferreira, 2005, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; while supported by buoyant upwelling in the deeper mantle, some associate with an [[Azores hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ting Yang, et al., 2006, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the volcanic activity has centered, primarily, along the [[Terceira Rift]]. From the beginning of the island's settlement, around the 15th century, there have been 28 registered volcanic eruptions (15 terrestrial and 13 submarine). The last significant volcanic eruption, the [[Capelinhos]] volcano ({{lang|pt|Vulcão dos Capelinhos}}), occurred off the coast of the island of Faial in 1957; the most recent volcanic activity occurred in the seamounts and submarine volcanoes off the coast of [[Serreta (Azores)|Serreta]] and in the Pico-São Jorge Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvarg.azores.gov.pt/Cvarg/CentroVulcanologia/geologiaacores/GA+-+Vulcanismo+Historico.htm|title=Erupções vulcânicas históricas|trans-title=Historical Volcanic Eruptions|publisher=Centro de Vulcanologia e Avaliação de Riscos Geológicos (CVARG)|year=2010|accessdate=15 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305153226/http://www.cvarg.azores.gov.pt/Cvarg/CentroVulcanologia/geologiaacores/GA+-+Vulcanismo+Historico.htm|archive-date=5 March 2012|url-status=dead}}; Evidence for the submarine eruptions off the coasts of [[Velas]], [[São Jorge Island]] and Cachorro, [[Santa Luzia (São Roque do Pico)|Santa Luzia]], [[Pico Island]] included primarily from inferences and eyewitness testimonies about sulfuric gases and vapors released from the waters along the coast (15–24 February 1964 and 15 December 1963, respectively)&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands have many examples of volcano-built geomorphology including many of the caves and subterranean lava tubes (such as the [[Gruta das Torres]], [[Algar do Carvão]], [[Gruta do Natal]], Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras), the coastal lava fields (like the coast of [[Feteiras]], [[Faial Island|Faial]], the Mistério of [[Prainha (São Roque do Pico)|Prainha]] or São João on [[Pico Island]]) in addition to the currently inactive cones in central [[São Miguel Island]], the aforementioned Capelinhos on Faial, the volcanic complexes of [[Terceira]]  or [[Plinian]] caldeira of [[Corvo Island]].
The islands of the archipelago were formed through volcanic and seismic activity during the [[Neogene]] Period; the first embryonic surfaces started to appear in the waters of Santa Maria during the [[Miocene epoch]] (from circa 8 million years ago). 
[[File:FAI HOR CBranco Vdock (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Coast of [[Faial Island]].]]
The sequence of the island formation has been generally characterized as: Santa Maria (8.12 Ma), São Miguel (4.1 Ma), Terceira (3.52 Ma), Graciosa (2.5 Ma), Flores (2.16 Ma), Faial (0.7 Ma), São Jorge (0.55 Ma), Corvo (0.7 Ma) and the youngest, Pico (0.27 Ma).&lt;ref name=&quot;Carine, 2010, p.78&quot;&gt;Carine, 2010, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Although all islands have experienced volcanism during their geological history, within recorded &quot;human settlement&quot; history the islands of Santa Maria, Graciosa, Flores, and Corvo have not experienced any volcanic eruptions; in addition to active fumaroles and hot-springs, the remaining islands have had sporadic eruptions since the 14th century. Apart from the [[Capelinhos]] volcano in 1957–58, the last recorded instance of &quot;island formation&quot; occurred off the coast of São Miguel, when the island of [[Sabrina Island (Azores)|Sabrina]] was briefly formed.
[[File:Algar do Carvão - Portugal (236262316).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Algar do Carvão]] volcanic cave on [[Terceira Island]].]]
Owing to its geodynamic environment, the region has been center of intense seismic activity, particularly along its tectonic boundaries on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Terceira Rift. Seismic events although frequent, are usually tectonic or vulco-tectonic in nature, but in general are of low to medium intensities, occasionally punctuated by events of level 5 or greater on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, 2005, p.110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvarg.azores.gov.pt/Cvarg/CentroVulcanologia/geologiaacores/VA+-+Sismicidade+instrumental.htm|title=Actividade Sísmica|trans-title=Seismic Activity|year=2010|accessdate=15 April 2010|language=Portuguese|publisher=CVARG|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305153323/http://www.cvarg.azores.gov.pt/Cvarg/CentroVulcanologia/geologiaacores/VA+-+Sismicidade+instrumental.htm|archive-date=5 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe earthquake was registered in 1757, near [[Calheta (Azores)|Calheta]] on the island of [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], which exceeded 7 on the Richter magnitude scale. In comparison, the 1522 earthquake that was mentioned by historian [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] measured 6.8, but its effects were judged to be X (''Extreme'') on the [[Mercalli intensity scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, 2005, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; and was responsible for the destruction of [[Vila Franca do Campo]] and landslides that may have killed more than 5,000 of the inhabitants.
[[File:Fogo lake - S.Miguel island - Azores (39000072215) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lagoa do Fogo|Fogo lake]] on [[São Miguel Island]].]]
The nine islands that compose the archipelago occupy a surface area of {{convert|2346|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, that includes both the main islands and many islets located in their vicinities. They range in surface area from the largest, São Miguel, at {{convert|759|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|}}  to the smallest, Corvo, at approximately {{convert|17|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|}}.

Each of the islands has its own distinct geomorphological characteristics that make them unique: [[Corvo Island|Corvo]] (the smallest island) is a crater of a major [[Plinian]] eruption; [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] (its neighbor on the [[North American Plate]]) is a rugged island carved by many valleys and escarpments; [[Faial Island|Faial]] characterized for its [[volcano#Shield volcanoes|shield volcano]] and caldera ([[Cabeço Gordo]]); [[Pico Island|Pico]], is the highest point, at  {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, in the Azores and continental Portugal; [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]] is known for its active Furnas do Enxofre and mixture of volcanic cones and plains; [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]] is a long slender island, formed from [[Types of volcanic eruptions|fissural eruptions]] over thousands of years; [[Terceira]], almost circular, is the location of one of the largest craters in the region; [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] is the largest island, and is pitted with many large craters and fields of spatter cones; and [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]], the oldest island, is heavily eroded, being one of the few places to encounter brown sandy beaches in the archipelago. 
[[File:20170913 acores 0009 (48715955942).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Landscape of [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]].]]
These islands can be divided into three recognizable groups located on the Azores Plateau:
* The Eastern Group ({{lang|pt|Grupo Oriental}}) of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], [[Santa Maria Island|Santa Maria]] and [[Formigas Islets]]
* The Central Group ({{lang|pt|Grupo Central}}) of [[Terceira Island|Terceira]], [[Graciosa Island|Graciosa]], [[São Jorge Island|São Jorge]], [[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]]
* The Western Group ({{lang|pt|Grupo Ocidental}}) of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]].
In addition, several sub-surface reefs (particularly the [[Dollabarat]] on the fringe of the Formigas), banks (specifically the [[Princess Alice Bank]] and [[Dom João de Castro Bank|D. João de Castro Bank]], as well as many [[Hydrothermal vents and seamounts of the Azores|hydrothermal vents and sea-mounts]] are monitored by the regional authorities, owing to the complex geotectonic and socioeconomic significance within the economic exclusion zone of the archipelago.

Even though the Azores look very green and sometimes wild, the vegetation has been extremely altered. A great part of it has been wiped out in the past 600 years for its valuable wood (for tools, buildings, boats, [[Wood fuel|fire wood]], and so on) and to clear land for [[agriculture]]. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of [[insect]]s on the Graciosa island have disappeared or will become extinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kostas2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Triantis | first1 = K.

Consequently, some [[Invasive species|invasive]] plants have filled these deserted and disturbed lands. [[Hydrangea]]s are another potential pest, but their threat is less serious. Notwithstanding the fact that hydrangeas were introduced from [[Americas|America]] or [[Asia]], some locals consider them a symbol of the archipelago and propagate them along roadsides, helping the plants to escape into the wild. ''[[Cryptomeria]]'', the Japanese cedar, is a [[conifer]] extensively grown for its timber. The two most common of these alien species are ''[[Pittosporum undulatum]]'' and ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]''. They are usually restricted to ancient agricultural land and only rarely penetrate into undisturbed native vegetation.

The [[Azores High]], an area of high [[atmospheric pressure]], is named after the islands. Under the Köppen climate classification, there are different local climates, one of which is &quot;dry-summer subtropical&quot;, often referred to as &quot;Mediterranean&quot;. Salvador Rivas-Martínez data presents several different bioclimatic zones for the Azores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/tb_med.htm|title=Mapas bioclimáticos y biogeográficos|website=www.globalbioclimatics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seasonal lag]] is extreme in the low-sun half of the year, with December being milder than April in terms of mean temperatures.

Azores have the warmest winters in Europe (still within the European continental plate). During summer the lag is somewhat lower, with August being the warmest month. There has never been a frost, snowfall or freeze recorded at sea level on any of the islands. The coldest weather in winter usually comes from northwesterly [[Air Mass|air masses]] originating from [[Labrador]] in Canada. However, since those air masses are warmed up as they pass across the warmer Atlantic Ocean, temperatures by day even then exceed {{convert|10|C|F}}. The westernmost islands of the archipelago, namely [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] and [[Corvo Island|Corvo]], get the strongest maritime moderation and the most rainfall since both are right on the [[Gulf Stream]] waters.

====Hurricanes====
The Azores are known for small hurricanes. A total of 14 [[Tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone]]s have affected the region in history. Most of them were either [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] or [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storms]] when they affected the region, although several [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|Category 1 hurricanes]] have reached the Azores. Only one major hurricane has ever impacted the Azores; [[Hurricane Ophelia (2017)|Hurricane Ophelia]] in 2017, at Category 3 intensity. The following storms have impacted the region while at Category 1 strength: [[Hurricane Fran (1973)|Hurricane Fran]] in 1973, [[Hurricane Emmy]] in 1976, [[Hurricane Gordon (2006)|Hurricane Gordon]] in 2006, [[Hurricane Gordon (2012)|Hurricane Gordon]] in 2012 and [[Hurricane Alex (2016)|Hurricane Alex]] in 2016. Several tropical storms have hit the region, including [[Tropical Storm Irma (1978)|Tropical Storm Irma]] in 1978, [[Hurricane Bonnie (1992)|Hurricane Bonnie]] in 1992, [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Charley|Hurricane Charley]] in 1992, [[Hurricane Erika (1997)|Hurricane Erika]] in 1997, and [[2016 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Gaston|Hurricane Gaston]] in 2016. Storms that were extratropical when they impacted the region include [[Hurricane Tanya (1995)|Hurricane Tanya]] in 1995, [[Tropical Storm Ana (2003)|Tropical Storm Ana]] in 2003 and [[Tropical Storm Grace (2009)|Tropical Storm Grace]] in 2009. In addition, the [[2005 Azores subtropical storm]] affected the region in October 2005.

==Demographics==
The Azores are divided into 19 municipalities ({{lang|pt|concelhos}}); each municipality is further divided into ''[[freguesia]]s'' (civil administrative parishes), of which there is a [[List of parishes of Portugal|total of 156]] in all of the Azores. 

There are six cities (Portuguese: ''cidades'') in the Azores: [[Ponta Delgada]], [[Lagoa (Azores)|Lagoa]] and [[Ribeira Grande, São Miguel|Ribeira Grande]] on the island of São Miguel; [[Angra do Heroísmo]] and [[Praia da Vitória]] on the island of Terceira, and [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] on Faial. Three of these, [[Ponta Delgada]], [[Angra (Azores)|Angra]] and [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] are considered [[Capital (political)|capital/administrative cities]] to the regional government: homes to the President (Ponta Delgada), the Judiciary (Angra) and the Regional Assembly (Horta). Angra also serves as the ecclesiastical centre of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra]], the episcopal see of the Azores.

===Population===
[[File:Ilha de São Miguel DSC00659 (36586155410) (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Ponta Delgada]], on [[São Miguel Island]], is the largest city in the Azores and the executive capital of the Azores.]]
[[File:Angra do heroismo garden view (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Angra do Heroísmo]], on [[Terceira Island]], is [[UNESCO World Heritage]] and the judicial capital of the Azores.]]
According to the 2011 Census, population in the Azores was 246,746 at a density of {{convert|106|PD/km2}}.

The Azores were uninhabited when Portuguese navigators arrived in the early 15th century; settlement began in 1439 with migrants from several regions of mainland Portugal and from [[Madeira]]. The islands were populated mainly by Portuguese immigrants from the [[Algarve]], [[Alentejo]], and [[Minho (province)|Minho]]; in an effort to escape the dangers of the Portuguese inquisition on mainland Portugal, however, many Portuguese Sephardic Jews settled on the islands in large numbers. Azorean Jews had surnames such as: Rodrigues, Pacheco, Oliveira, Pereira, Pimentel, Nunes, Mendes, Pinto, Álvares, Henriques, Cardozo, Teixeira, Vasconcelos etc. The islands were also settled by Moorish prisoners, and African slaves from Guinea, Cape Verde and São Tomé; Flemish, French and Galicians also contributed to the initial settlement. Thus the Azorean population received a significant contribution from people with genetic backgrounds other than Portuguese.

The nature of the economy dictated that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery]] never became common in the Azores because they were sent to Brazil and the Caribbean. Only a few remained in the Azores for forced labor such as domestic chores, although the islands sometimes served as a waypoint for ships carrying [[History of slavery|African slaves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&amp;pg=PA42| title=Colonialism: An International, Social, Cultural, and Political Encyclopedia|author1=Melvin Eugene Page  |author2=Penny M.

As in [[continental Portugal]], the most frequent [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mtDNA haplogroup]] in the Azores is [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]] (45.2%), followed by [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]] (16.7%), [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]] (10.1%), [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]] (6.5%), [[Haplogroup pre-HV (mtDNA)|pre-HV]] clades (5.6%) and a smaller African [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L haplogroups]] frequency (3.4%) than in Madeira.

===Emigration===

Since the 17th century, many Azoreans have emigrated, mainly to [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/azores.html |title=Azores Islands |publisher=Library.csustan.edu |date=17 January 1997 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512001602/https://www.library.csustan.edu/bsantos/azores.html |archivedate=12 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhode Island]] and Southeastern [[Massachusetts]], especially the cities of [[New Bedford]], Bristol, Barrington, Pawtucket, Central Falls, West Warwick, Hudson, Marlborough, East Providence, River Point, Somerset, Taunton and [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] have been, and remain, the primary destination for Azorean emigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lurdes C. da Silva 22 August 2008 |url=http://www.ojornal.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20087125&amp;BRD=2677&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=543384&amp;rfi=6 |title=Mass.- Azores links inked |publisher=O Jornal |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigrants from the East coast returned to their homeland and taught the American dory fishing technique to the Portuguese who began catching [[cod]] again on the [[Grand Bank]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;SILVA, A.

Northern [[California]] was the final destination for many of the Massachusetts immigrants who then moved on to the [[San Joaquin Valley]], especially the city of [[Turlock, California|Turlock]], just south of Modesto. In the late 1800s many Azoreans emigrated to the [[Hawaii]]an islands. The [[tuna]] fishing industry drew a significant number of Azoreans to the [[Point Loma]] neighborhood of [[San Diego]], in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orbach|first=Michael K.|title=Hunters, Seamen, and Entrepreneurs: The Tuna Seinermen of San Diego|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H16MRRFQMW8C&amp;pg=PA7|year=1977|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03348-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921 to 1977, about 250,000 Azoreans immigrated to Rhode Island and Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwlibrary.csustan.edu/bsantos/immigr.html &quot;Azorean Immigration into the United States&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203140318/http://wwwlibrary.csustan.edu/bsantos/immigr.html |date=3 February 2009 }}. Library.csustan.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Azoreans also moved to [[Bermuda]] and [[Hawaii]] ([[Portuguese immigration to Hawaii]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;/&gt; [[Florianópolis]] and [[Porto Alegre]] in the [[Southern Region, Brazil|Southern Region]] of Brazil were founded by Azoreans, who accounted for over half of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]'s population in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/acores.html Imigrantes: Açorianos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231170219/http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/acores.html |date=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1960 mass immigration currents were registered to Brazil, and many were from the Azores.&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;&gt;Russell King, John Connell (1999).

During the [[Great Recession]] of the early 21st century, Portugal was in a recession from 2011 until 2013 which resulted in high levels of unemployment across the mainland as well as the Azores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_po.html|title=Europe :: Portugal — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Recession led to an increase of out-migration from the Azores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/world/europe/azores-diaspora-holy-christ-of-miracles.html|title=Azorean Diaspora Can’t Resist the Powerful Pull of Home|last=Minder|first=Raphael|date=2015-06-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Main|Political status of the Azores}}
[[File:Palacio de Santana (14826301491) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[:pt:Palácio de Sant'Ana|Sant'Ana Palace]] is the seat of the President of the Azores.]]
[[File:Igr n sra carmo 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[:pt:Palácio dos Capitães-Generais (Angra do Heroísmo)|Palace of the Capitães-Generais]] is a residence of the Azorean President.]]
Since 1976, the Azores is an autonomous region integrated within the framework of the Portuguese Republic. It has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. Its governmental organs include: the Legislative Assembly, a [[unicameral]] parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal [[suffrage]] for a four-year term; the regional government and presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a president, a vice-president and seven regional secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. It is represented in the Council of Ministers by a representative appointed by the president of the Republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older Portuguese representative that was appointed by the president of the Republic, beholden to the Council of State and coincident with the president).

Since becoming a Portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in [[Ponta Delgada]], the legislative branch in [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]], and the judicial branch in [[Angra do Heroísmo]].
[[File:Solarmadrededeus2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Madre de Deus Manor]] is the seat of the [[:pt:Representante da República nos Açores|Representative of the Republic]].]]
[[File:Largo 2 de Março, Ponta Delgada (16863454855) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Conceição Palace, Ponta Delgada|Conceição Palace]] is the headquarters of the Azorean cabinet.]]
The islands of the archipelago do not have independent status in law, except in electoral law and are governed by 19 municipalities that subdivide the islands. In addition, until the administrative reform of the 19th century, the following civil parishes had municipal standing: Topo (today integrated into the municipality of [[Calheta (Azores)|Calheta]], São Jorge); [[Praia (Santa Cruz da Graciosa)|Praia]] (today integrated into municipality of [[Santa Cruz da Graciosa]]); [[Vila de São Sebastião|São Sebastião]] (today an integral part of the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo); Capelas (now part of the municipality of Ponta Delgada); and Água de Pau (now a civil parish in the municipality of Lagoa). These civil parishes still retain their titles of &quot;vila&quot; in name only; the populations of Capelas and neighbouring parish still protest the change and promote the restoration of their status. 

The municipalities are further subdivided into several civil parishes, with the exception of [[Corvo (Azores)|Corvo]] (the only municipality by law without a civil parish, owing to its size).

Azorean politics is dominated by the two largest Portuguese political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party (PS)]] and [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]], the former holding a majority in the Legislative Assembly. The [[Democratic and Social Center / People's Party]] (CDS/PP), the [[Left Bloc]] (BE), the [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition]] (CDU) and the [[People's Monarchist Party (Portugal)|People's Monarchist Party]] (PPM) are also represented. Currently, {{as of|2016|alt=as of the 2016 regional election}}, the President of the Azores is Socialist Party (PS) leader [[Vasco Cordeiro]]. Although the PS dominates the regional politics, the PSD is traditionally popular in city and [[town council]] elections.

===European Union===
As part of Portugal, the Azores are in the [[European Union]] and [[Schengen Area]]. They are also in the [[European Union Customs Union]] and [[VAT]] area,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/territorial-status-eu-countries-certain-territories_en Territorial status of EU countries and certain territories]{{snd}} [[European Commission]], retrieved 18 December 2018&lt;/ref&gt; but levy a lower rate of VAT than applies on the mainland. The Azores, like [[Madeira]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are among [[Special member state territories and the European Union|member state territories with special status]], as one of the designated [[Special member state territories and the European Union#Outermost regions|&quot;Outermost Regions&quot;]].

==Transport==

===Aviation===
[[File:Lajes field (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lajes Air Base]], on [[Terceira Island]], is a joint [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[Portuguese Air Force]] military base.]]
{{main|Aviation in the Azores}}
Each of the nine islands has an airport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flugplaetze.org/PT/ |title=Flughäfen in Portugal (PT) |publisher=Flugplaetze.org |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107025615/http://www.flugplaetze.org/PT/ |archive-date=7 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the majority are airfields rather than airports. The commercial terminals in Ponta Delgada, Horta, Vila do Porto and Santa Cruz das Flores are operated by [[ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal]], a public entity that oversees the operations of airports across Portugal. The remaining, except for [[Lajes Field]], are operated by the Regional Government. Lajes is a military airbase, as well as a commercial airport, and is operated by the Portuguese Armed Forces in conjunction with the United States.

The Azores has had a long history of water transport to overcome distances and establish inter-community contacts and trade. Consequently, the shipbuilding industry developed in many islands, from small fishing boats, to whaling sloops to larger passenger services.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticoline.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=60&amp;lang=en|title=atlanticoline.pt: History|location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal|publisher=Atlânticoline|accessdate=14 March 2011|year=2009|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger traffic to the main islands (São Miguel, Santa Maria, Terceira and Faial) began in the 17th century, and between the 18th–19th century, the ''Pico Yacht'' controlled the lucrative summer traffic season.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt;

After 1871, the ''Insulana Shipping Company'' was the only entity responsible for regular traffic between the islands (except Corvo), Madeira and the United States.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt; Yet, cargo and passenger transportation ceased in the 1970s, and the ships were sold or converted into tuna fishing boats. For the next 20 years, commercial maritime service between the islands ceased (except between Faial-Pico and Lajes das Flores-Vila do Corvo).&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt;

''[[Transmaçor]]'' (Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Lda.) was founded on 22 December 1987, resulting from the fusion of ''Empresa das Lanchas do Pico, Ld'', owners of the ships ''Espalamaca'' and ''Calheta'' (ships that had travelled the canal between Faial and Pico for several years); ''Empresa Açoreana de Transportes Marítimos, Lda'', which operated the ship ''Terra Alta''; and ''Transcanal (Transportes Marítimos do Canal, Lda.)'' operator the traditional boats ''Picaroto'' and ''Manuel José''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmacor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transmacor.pt/site_actual/ |title=Transmaçor – Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Ldª. |editor=Transmaçor |location=Horta (Azores), Portugal |publisher=Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Lda. |language=Portuguese |year=2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310022040/https://transmacor.pt/site_actual/ |archivedate=10 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The societies and companies comprise 80% of the capital, with the remaining shares owned by the Azores Regional Government.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Central Group, the shipping company operates four to six time daily connections between Horta and Madalena throughout the year, using its small fleet of ships (''[[MV Cruzeiro das Ilhas|Cruzeiro das Ilhas]]'', ''[[MV Cruzeiro do Canal|Cruzeiro do Canal]]'', ''Expresso das Ilhas'' and ''Expresso do Triângulo''), in addition to inter-island connections between Faial, Pico, São Jorge and Terceira during the summer months.&lt;ref name=Transmacor/&gt;

Meanwhile, new initiatives began in the late 1990s: the catamaran ''Iapetos'' began services, followed by ''Lady of Mann'' and ''Golfinho Azul'' (chartered by Açorline).&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt;

In 2005, ''[[Atlânticoline]]'' was established, providing services with the ships ''Ilha Azul'' and {{MV|Express Santorini||2}}, later adding the ''Viking'' in 2009.&lt;ref name=ALine/&gt; In 2009, Atlanticoline was involved in a controversial rejection of a 750-passenger, 150-vehicle ship ordered from the ''Estaleiros de Viana do Castelo'' (''Viana do Castelo Shipyards'').&lt;ref name=&quot;ENVC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Atlântida&quot; está há um ano ancorado em Lisboa e ainda sem destino |url=http://www.acorianooriental.pt/noticia/atlantida-esta-ha-um-ano-ancorado-em-lisboa-e-ainda-sem-destino |language=Portuguese |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=28 August 2012 |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |author=Agência Lusa/AO online/Hoje}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Atlantida'', a 50 million Euro cruiser (as part of a two-ship deal with the other named ''Anticiclone'') was rejected in 2009 by Atlanticoline for the under-performance of the power-plant.&lt;ref name=ENVC/&gt; Although it would only result in a five-minute delay between islands, the public company rejected the ship, and the contract was broken over the builder's inability to deliver the required ship on time.&lt;ref name=ENVC/&gt; While, the ship was being shopped to other interested parties ([[Hugo Chávez]] once considered purchasing the ferryboat in 2010), no interested buyers appeared, and ENVC decided to cede the ''Atlantida'' to Atlânticoline as part of the latter's open international competition to charter two ships in 2012.&lt;ref name=ENVC/&gt;

On 20 June 2011, the Regional Government announced that it would purchase 60% of Transmaçor, equivalent to 500,000 Euro of the company's capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;StakeTransmacor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|editor=AO Online|author=Lusa|title=Concluídas negociações para compra da Transmaçor|accessdate=21 June 2011|date=20 June 2011|language=Portuguese|url=http://www.acorianooriental.pt/noticias/view/216797}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this transaction the Autonomous government of the Azores ceded control, of which it once had 88% of the capital.&lt;ref name=StakeTransmacor/&gt; The signed memorandum of understanding concluded negotiations between the various parties involved, under which the liability of Transmaçor (worth a total of 8 million Euro) was divided equally between the Region and businessman [[José Almeida]], who is now the holder of a majority stake in the company.&lt;ref name=StakeTransmacor/&gt;

Similarly, the Regional Government approved the consolidation of the three individual port authorities (Administração dos Portos do Triângulo e Grupo Ocidental, Administração dos Portos da Terceira e Graciosa and the Administração dos Portos das Ilhas de São Miguel e Santa Maria) and regional Portos dos Açores into one entity that resulted in a 2.2 million Euro cost savings, in addition to a reduction from 11 to three administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunadasilhas.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2170:portos-dos-acores--fusao-administrativa-aprovada-na-assembleia-regional&amp;catid=2:regional&amp;Itemid=3 |title=Portos dos Açores – Fusão administrativa aprovada na Assembleia Regional |language=Portuguese |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011 |first=Maria |last=Pinheiro |publisher=Tribuna das Ilhas |location=Horta, Portugal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711054523/http://www.tribunadasilhas.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2170%3Aportos-dos-acores--fusao-administrativa-aprovada-na-assembleia-regional&amp;catid=2%3Aregional&amp;Itemid=3 |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Church of Jesuite Collegium Ponta Delgada (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese_Architecture#Azores_Islands|Azorean architecture]] is typified by the contrast between black volcanic stone and white stucco.]]
Azoreans have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits, from a combination of continental Portuguese customs brought by various waves of immigration and local political and environmental factors.

Religious festivals, patron saints and traditional holidays mark the Azorean calendar. The most important religious events are tied with the festivals associated with the [[cult of the Holy Spirit]], commonly referred to as the festivals of the Holy Spirit (or ''Espírito Santo''), rooted in millenarian dogma and held on all islands from May to September. These festivals are very important to the Azorean people, who are primarily Roman Catholic, and combine religious rituals with processions celebrating the benevolence and egalitarianism of neighbours. 

These events are centred around ''treatros'' or ''impérios'', small buildings that host the meals, adoration and charity of the participants, and used to store the artefacts associated with the events. On Terceira, for example, these impérios have grown into ornate buildings painted and cared for by the local brotherhoods in their respective parishes. The events focus on the members of local parishes, not tourists, but all are welcome, as sharing is one of the main principles of the festivals. Some limited events focus on tourists, including a public event that the city government of Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel holds, which attracts visitors and locals.
[[File:SMG PDL 20090517 SaoJose FestaSSCristo03.JPG|thumb|left|Procession of the [[Cult of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres|Cult of the Holy Lord Christ of the Miracles]].]]
Another event, the Festival of the [[Cult of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres|Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles]] (or ''Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres'') in [[Ponta Delgada]] on the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]], is the largest individual religious event in the Azores, and takes place on [[Rogation Sunday]]. Pilgrims from within the Portuguese diaspora normally travel to Ponta Delgada to participate in an afternoon procession behind the image of Christ along the flower-decorated streets of the city. Although the solemn procession is only held on one day, the events of the Festival of Senhor Santo Cristo occur over a period of a week and involve a ritual of moving the image between the main church and convent nightly, ultimately culminating in the procession, which is televised within the Azores and to the Portuguese diaspora.
The Sanjoaninas Festivities in [[Angra do Heroísmo]] on Terceira are held in June honoring [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], [[Saint Peter]] and [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]], in a large religious celebration.

The festival of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] (or ''Nossa Senhora de Lourdes''), [[patron saint]] of whalers, begins in Lajes on [[Pico Island]] on the last Sunday of August and runs through the week—Whalers Week. It is marked by social and cultural events connected to the tradition of [[Whaling|whale hunting]]. The Wine [[Harvest festival|Harvest Festival]] (or ''Festa das Vindimas''), takes place during the first week of September and is a century-old custom of the people of Pico.

On Corvo the people celebrate their patron saint Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (Our Lady of Miracles) on 15 August every year in addition to the festivals of the Divine Holy Spirit. The Festival da Maré de Agosto (August Sea Festival), takes place every year beginning on 15 August in Praia Formosa on Santa Maria. Also, the Semana do Mar (Sea Week), dedicated almost exclusively to [[Watersport|water sports]], takes place in August in the city of Horta, on Faial.

[[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also celebrated in the Azores. Parades and pageants are the heart of the Carnaval festivities. There is lively music, colorful costumes, hand-made masks, and floats.
The traditional bullfights in the bullring are ongoing as is the running of bulls in the streets.
