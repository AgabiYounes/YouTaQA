==Biography==
[[File:Dresden Fürstenzug 086.JPG|thumb|left|Ernest, Elector of Saxony (1464–1486), Frederick II, Elector of Saxony (1428–1464) and Albert III, Duke of Saxony (1486–1500); from left to right, [[Fürstenzug]], Dresden, Germany]]
Albert was born in [[Grimma]] as the third and youngest son (but fifth child in order of birth) of [[Frederick II, Elector of Saxony|Frederick II the Gentle, Elector of Saxony]], and Margarete of Austria, sister of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Later, he was a member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

After escaping from the hands of [[Kunz von Kaufungen]], who had abducted him together with his brother [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]], he spent some time at the court of the emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Albert III. (duke of Saxony) |display=Albert III.|volume=1|pages=497-498}} Endnote: See
*F. A. von Langenn, ''Herzog Albrecht der Beherzte, Stammvater des königlichen Hauses Sachsen'' (Leipzig, 1838)
*O. Sperling, ''Herzog Albrecht der Beherzte von Sachsen als Gubernator Frieslands'' (Leipzig, 1892).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cheb|Eger (Cheb)]] on 11 November 1464 Albert married [[Sidonie Podiebrad|Zdenka (Sidonie)]], daughter of [[George of Podebrady]], King of [[Bohemia]]; but failed to obtain the Bohemian Crown on the death of George in 1471. After the death of his father in 1464, Albert and Ernest ruled their lands together, but in 1485 a division was made by the [[Treaty of Leipzig]], and Albert received the [[Margraviate of Meissen|Meissen]], together with some adjoining districts, and founded the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Regarded as a capable soldier by the emperor, Albert (in 1475) took a prominent part in the campaign against [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and in 1487 [[Siege of Wiener-Neustadt|led an expedition]] against [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of Hungary, which failed owing to lack of support on the part of the emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

In 1488 he was appointed [[List of Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governor]] of the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]] (until 1493)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hruQ386SfFcC&amp;pg=RA2-PA203&amp;lpg=RA2-PA203&amp;dq=In+1488+he+was+appointed+Governor+of+the+Netherlands+(until+1493&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o7mhxp0A_K&amp;sig=5Pzq-xieFFipcxeORDDEpTARHqU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisx8T9ncDYAhXEL48KHVS6DSIQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201488%20he%20was%20appointed%20Governor%20of%20the%20Netherlands%20(until%201493&amp;f=false|title=Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, Volumes 1-3, A-Z|last=Bietenholz|first=Peter G.|last2=Deutscher|first2=Thomas Brian|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802085771|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-III-duke-of-Saxony | title=Albert III duke of Saxony | work=Britannica | accessdate=24 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marched with the imperial forces to free the Roman king [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] from his imprisonment at Bruges, and when, in 1489, the King returned to Germany, Albert was left as his representative to prosecute the [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria|war against the rebels]]. He was successful in restoring the authority of Maximilian in [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], but failed to obtain any repayment of the large sums of money which he had spent in these campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

His services were rewarded in 1498 when Maximilian bestowed upon him the title of Hereditary Governor (''potestat'') of [[Friesland]], but he had to make good his claim by force of arms. He had to a great extent succeeded, and was paying a visit to Saxony, when he was recalled by news of a fresh rising. The duke recaptured [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], but soon afterwards he died at [[Emden]]. He was buried at Meissen.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Albert, who was a man of great strength and considerable skill in feats of arms, delighted in tournaments and knightly exercises.  His loyalty to the emperor Frederick, and the expenses incurred in this connection, aroused some irritation among his subjects, but his rule was a period of prosperity in Saxony.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;
