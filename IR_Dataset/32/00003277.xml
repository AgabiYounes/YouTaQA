'''Antioxidants''' are [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that inhibit [[Redox|oxidation]]. [[Oxidation]] is a [[chemical reaction]] that can produce [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]], thereby leading to [[chain reaction]]s that may damage the [[cell (biology)|cells]] of organisms. Antioxidants such as [[thiol]]s or [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C) terminate these chain reactions. To balance the [[oxidative stress]], plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as [[glutathione]] and [[enzyme]]s (e.g., [[catalase]] and [[superoxide dismutase]]), produced internally, or the [[dietary]] antioxidants vitamin C and [[vitamin E]].

The term &quot;antioxidant&quot; is mostly used for two entirely different groups of substances: [[industrial chemicals]] that are added to products to prevent oxidation, and naturally occurring compounds that are present in foods and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The former, industrial antioxidants, have diverse uses: acting as [[preservative]]s in food and cosmetics, and being [[redox|oxidation]]-inhibitors in fuels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |doi=10.1002/14356007.a16_719.pub2|chapter=Automotive Fuels |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2007 |vauthors=Dabelstein W, Reglitzky A, Schütze A, Reders K |isbn=978-3-527-30673-2 |name-list-format = vanc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY-YtwEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to diet ===

Although certain levels of antioxidant [[vitamins]] in the diet are required for good health, there is still considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidants are health-promoting in the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shenkin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shenkin A | title = The key role of micronutrients | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16376462 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2005.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodside JV, McCall D, McGartland C, Young IS | title = Micronutrients: dietary intake v. supplement use | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–53 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16313697 | doi = 10.1079/PNS2005464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanner SA, Hughes J, Kelly CN, Buttriss J | title = A review of the epidemiological evidence for the 'antioxidant hypothesis' | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–22 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15153272 | doi = 10.1079/PHN2003543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/?p=ER Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]''.

== Examples of bioactive antioxidant compounds ==
Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water ([[hydrophile|hydrophilic]]) or in lipids ([[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]]). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell [[cytosol]] and the [[blood plasma]], while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect [[cell membrane]]s from lipid peroxidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sies&quot; /&gt; These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot; /&gt; The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in [[Bodily fluid|body fluids]] and tissues, with some such as glutathione or [[ubiquinone]] mostly present within cells, while others such as [[uric acid]] are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in [[pathogen]]s and can be [[virulence factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller RA, Britigan BE | title = Role of oxidants in microbial pathophysiology | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–18 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8993856 | pmc = 172912 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.10.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various antioxidant compounds and antioxidant enzyme systems having [[synergy|synergistic]] and interdependent effects on one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudière J, Ferrari-Iliou R | title = Intracellular antioxidants: from chemical to biochemical mechanisms | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 37 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 949–62 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10541450 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-6915(99)00090-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sies H | title = Strategies of antioxidant defense | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry / FEBS | volume = 215 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–9 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 7688300 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18025.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot; /&gt; The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vertuani&quot; /&gt;

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by [[chelation|chelating]] [[transition metal]]s and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of [[iron-binding proteins]] such as [[transferrin]] and [[ferritin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pathways Ofoxidativedamage&quot;/&gt; [[Selenium]] and zinc are commonly referred to as ''antioxidant nutrients'', but these [[chemical element]]s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

The relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidants is an area of current research, but vitamin C, which exerts its effects as a vitamin by oxidizing polypeptides, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the human body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr&quot; /&gt; However, less data is available for other dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider C | title = Chemistry and biology of vitamin E | journal = Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–30 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15580660 | doi = 10.1002/mnfr.200400049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[polyphenol antioxidant|polyphenols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halliwell B | title = Are polyphenols antioxidants or pro-oxidants?

That is, paradoxically, agents which are normally considered antioxidants can act as conditional [[pro-oxidant]]s and actually increase oxidative stress. Besides ascorbate, medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as [[homocysteine]]. Typically, this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst. The potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above. Another example is the postulated role of [[homocysteine]] in atherosclerosis.

Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or [[fungus|fungal]] spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zallen EM, Hitchcock MJ, Goertz GE | title = Chilled food systems. Effects of chilled holding on quality of beef loaves | journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 67 | issue = 6 | pages = 552–7 | date = December 1975 | pmid = 1184900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as [[propyl gallate]] (PG, E310), [[tert-Butylhydroquinone|tertiary butylhydroquinone]] (TBHQ), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA, E320) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT, E321).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iverson F | title = Phenolic antioxidants: Health Protection Branch studies on butylated hydroxyanisole | journal = Cancer Letters | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–54 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7600543 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3835(95)03787-W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E number index |publisher=UK food guide|url=http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm#antioxidants |accessdate=5 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070304151341/http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn [[rancidification|rancid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robards K, Kerr AF, Patsalides E | title = Rancidity and its measurement in edible oils and snack foods. A review | journal = The Analyst | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–24 | date = February 1988 | pmid = 3288002 | doi = 10.1039/an9881300213 | bibcode = 1988Ana...113..213R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or [[sulfur]]ous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoking]], [[salting (food)|salting]] or [[fermentation (food)|fermenting]]. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in [[aluminium foil]] or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Carlo M, Sacchetti G, Di Mattia C, Compagnone D, Mastrocola D, Liberatore L, Cichelli A | title = Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 52 | issue = 13 | pages = 4072–9 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15212450 | doi = 10.1021/jf049806z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and [[moisturizer]]s to prevent rancidity.

=== Industrial uses ===
[[Image:Antioxidant.png|thumb|right|250px|Substituted [[phenols]] and derivatives of [[p-Phenylenediamine|phenylenediamine]] are common antioxidants used to inhibit gum formation in gasoline (petrol).]]
Antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. A common use is as [[Gasoline additive|stabilizers]] in [[fuel]]s and [[lubricant]]s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=3233–7 |doi=10.1021/ja01617a026 |year=1955 |vauthors=Boozer CE, Hammond GS, Hamilton CE, Sen JN |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=77 |issue=12 |title=Air Oxidation of Hydrocarbons.1II.

Antioxidant [[polymer stabilizers]] are widely used to prevent the degradation of [[polymer]]s such as rubbers, plastics and [[adhesive]]s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why use Antioxidants? |publisher=SpecialChem Adhesives |url=http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |accessdate=27 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211063739/http://www.specialchem4adhesives.com/tc/antioxidants/index.aspx?id= |archivedate=11 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers containing [[double bond]]s in their main chains, such as [[natural rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]], are especially susceptible to [[oxidation]] and [[ozonolysis]]. They can be protected by [[antiozonant]]s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and [[ozone]] attack, the former causing a &quot;crazy paving&quot; effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product. Oxidation and [[UV degradation]] are also frequently linked, mainly because [[UV radiation]] creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce [[peroxy]] radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a [[chain reaction]]. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include [[polypropylene]] and [[polyethylene]]. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of [[secondary carbon atom]]s present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a [[primary carbon atom]]. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in [[low-density polyethylene]].

Other antioxidants are not obtained from the diet, but instead are made in the body. For example, [[ubiquinol]] (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the [[mevalonate pathway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Turunen&quot; /&gt; Another example is [[glutathione]], which is made from amino acids.

=== Measurement and invalidation of ORAC ===
Measurement of antioxidant content in food is not a straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In [[food science]], the [[oxygen radical absorbance capacity]] (ORAC) was once an industry standard for estimating antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives, mainly from the presence of [[polyphenol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao G, Alessio HM, Cutler RG | title = Oxygen-radical absorbance capacity assay for antioxidants | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–11 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8458588 | doi = 10.1016/0891-5849(93)90027-R  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ou B, Hampsch-Woodill M, Prior RL | title = Development and validation of an improved oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay using fluorescein as the fluorescent probe | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 4619–26 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11599998 | doi = 10.1021/jf010586o }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier measurements and ratings by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] were withdrawn in 2012 as biologically irrelevant to human health, referring to an absence of physiological evidence for polyphenols having antioxidant properties ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref name=USDAx&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/docs.htm?docid=15866 |title=Withdrawn: Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods, Release 2 (2010) |date=16 May 2012 |website= |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from ''in vitro'' experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or [[biology]].

Alternative ''in vitro'' measurements of antioxidant content in foods &amp;ndash; also based on the presence of polyphenols &amp;ndash; include the [[Folin-Ciocalteu reagent]], and the [[Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]] assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior RL, Wu X, Schaich K | title = Standardized methods for the determination of antioxidant capacity and phenolics in foods and dietary supplements | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 4290–302 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15884874 | doi = 10.1021/jf0502698 | url = https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/Policy.pdf | accessdate = 24 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161229203509/https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/Policy.pdf | archive-date = 29 December 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]), [[polyphenol]]s and [[tocopherol]]s. The evolution of [[angiosperm]] plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments&amp;nbsp;– particularly during the [[Jurassic]] period&amp;nbsp;– as chemical defences against [[reactive oxygen species]] that are byproducts of [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzie IF | title = Evolution of dietary antioxidants | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 136 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–26 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14527634 | doi = 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00368-9 | hdl = 10397/34754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal [[corrosion]], the [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] of rubber, and the [[polymerization]] of fuels in the [[fouling]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattill HA | title = Antioxidants | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 16 | pages = 177–92 | year = 1947 | pmid = 20259061 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.16.070147.001141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of [[unsaturated fat]]s, which is the cause of [[rancidity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = German JB | volume = 459 | pages = 23–50 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10335367 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-4853-9_3 | isbn = 978-0-306-46051-7 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | title = Impact of Processing on Food Safety | chapter = Food Processing and Lipid Oxidation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of [[Vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[Vitamin E|E]] as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of [[Organism|living organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Jacob RA | title = Three eras of vitamin C discovery | journal = Sub-Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 25 | pages = 1–16 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8821966 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4613-0325-1_1 | isbn = 978-1-4613-7998-0 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kZdtMAEACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knight JA | title = Free radicals: their history and current status in aging and disease | journal = Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 331–46 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9846200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible [[mechanisms of action]] of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moureu C, Dufraisse C |year=1922 |title=Sur l'autoxydation: Les antioxygènes|journal=Comptes Rendus des Séances et Mémoires de la Société de Biologie |volume=86 |pages=321–322|language=French | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into how [[vitamin E]] prevents the process of [[lipid peroxidation]] led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by [[scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging]] [[reactive oxygen species]] before they can damage cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf G | title = The discovery of the antioxidant function of vitamin E: the contribution of Henry A.
