The '''Arno''' is a [[river]] in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Italy]]. It is the most important river of [[central Italy]] after the [[Tiber]].

== Source and route ==
[[File:Ponte Vecchio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&quot;Ponte Vecchio&quot; (The old bridge)]]
[[File:FirenzeArno1547.jpg|thumb|right|[[High water mark]]s of Arno river floods on August 13, 1547 (left) and November 3, 1844 (metal plate on the right). Photographed in Via delle Casine.]] 
The river originates on [[Mount Falterona]] in the [[Casentino]] area of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].

With a length of {{convert|241|km}}, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] at {{convert|60|km|mi}} long, [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] at {{convert|49|km}}, and the [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa (river)|Pesa]], and [[Pescia (River)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than {{convert|8200|sqkm}} and drains the waters of the following subbasins:

*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until its confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.
*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain drained in the 18th century, which until then had been a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.
*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered on the east by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and on the west by the hills around [[Siena]].
*The Sieve's basin, which flows into the Arno immediately before Florence.
*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]], and [[Pistoia]].
*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa, and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from about {{convert|6|m3/s|cuft/s}} to more than {{convert|2000|m3/s|cuft/s}}. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]] but is now several kilometres westwards.

It crosses [[Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trinita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, most recently in [[1966 flood of the Arno|1966]], with {{convert|4500|m3/s|cuft/s}} after rainfall of {{convert|437.2|mm}} in Badia Agnano and {{convert|190|mm}} in Florence, in only 24 hours.

Before Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte. This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the [[Lago di Bientina]], which was once the largest lake in [[Tuscany]] before its reclamation. 

The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between {{convert|0.56|and|3540|m3/s|cuft/s}}. New [[dam]]s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.

The [[1966 flood of the Arno|flood on November 4, 1966]] collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.  New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alison McLean |date=November 2006 | title = This Month in History | journal = Smithsonian | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
From Latin ''Arnus'' (Pliny, ''Natural History'' 3.50). The philologist [[Hans Krahe]] related this toponym on a [[Old European hydronymy|paleo-European]] basis  ''*Ar-n-'', derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''er-'', &quot;flow, move&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edelmiro Bascuas, '' Hidronimia y léxico de origen paleoeuropeo en Galicia'' (page 41)&lt;/ref&gt;
