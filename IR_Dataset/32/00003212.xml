'''Alphonse Gabriel Capone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ə|ˈ|p|oʊ|n}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/al-capone|title=the definition of al capone|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|kaˈpoːne|lang}}; January 17, 1899&amp;nbsp;– January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the nickname &quot;'''Scarface'''&quot;, was an American [[gangster]] and businessman who attained notoriety during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]] as the co-founder and boss of the [[Chicago Outfit]]. His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he went to prison at age 33.

Capone was born in New York City in 1899 to [[Italian Americans|Italian immigrant]] parents. He joined the [[Five Points Gang]] as a teenager, and became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for [[Johnny Torrio]], head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol—the forerunner of the Outfit—and was politically protected through the [[Unione Siciliana]]. A conflict with the [[North Side Gang]] was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall. Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to Capone. Capone expanded the [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor [[William Hale Thompson]] and the city's police meant he seemed safe from law enforcement.

Capone apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games. He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many as &quot;modern-day [[Robin Hood]]&quot;. However, the [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]], in which seven gang rivals were murdered in broad daylight, damaged Chicago's and Capone's image, leading influential citizens to demand government action and newspapers to dub Capone &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot;.

The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone and prosecuted him in 1931 for [[tax evasion]]. During a highly publicized case, the judge admitted as evidence Capone's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior (and ultimately abortive) negotiations to pay the government taxes he owed. He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]]. After conviction, he replaced his defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling, but his appeal ultimately failed. Capone showed signs of [[neurosyphilis]] early in his sentence and became increasingly debilitated before being released after almost eight years of incarceration. On January 25, 1947, Capone died of [[cardiac arrest]] after suffering a stroke.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Al Capone mother.jpg|thumb|upright|A young Capone with his mother]]

Capone was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York State|New York]] on January 17, 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPONE&quot;/&gt; His parents were [[Italian Americans|Italian]] immigrants Gabriele Capone (1865–1920) and Teresa Capone (née Raiola; 1867–1952). His father was a [[barber]] and his mother was a [[sewing|seamstress]], both born in [[Angri]], a town in the [[Province of Salerno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letrescimmiette.info/curiosita-domande-e-stranezze-ad-angri/item/853-angri-le-origini-angresi-di-al-capone.html|title=Al Capone, il gangster americano piu' famoso del mondo era di origini angresi|author=Super User|work=letrescimmiette.info|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capone|last=Kobler|first=John|year=1971|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80499-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/caponelifeworldo00kobl_0/page/23 23]|url=https://archive.org/details/caponelifeworldo00kobl_0/page/23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriele and Teresa had eight other children: [[James Vincenzo Capone|Vincenzo Capone]], who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became a Prohibition agent in [[Homer, Nebraska]]; [[Ralph Capone|Raffaele James Capone]], also known as Ralph &quot;Bottles&quot; Capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry; [[Frank Capone|Salvatore &quot;Frank&quot; Capone]], Ermina Capone, who died at the age of one, Ermino &quot;John&quot; Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, and Mafalda Capone. Ralph and Frank worked with him in his criminal empire. Frank did so until his death on April 1, 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schoenberg|first=Robert J.|title=Mr. Capone|location=New York|publisher=William Morrow &amp; Co.|year=1992|pages=98-99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the [[Chicago Outfit]] for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/arrest_21.html Crime Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207064332/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/arrest_21.html|date=December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Capone family immigrated to the United States, after first moving to [[Fiume]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1893. From that port city, they traveled on a ship to the U.S., where they settled at 95 Navy Street, in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|Navy Yard]] section of [[downtown Brooklyn]]. Gabriele Capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue. When Al was 11, the Capone family moved to 38 Garfield Place in [[Park Slope]], Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAPONE&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Robert L. |title= Mr. Capone|year= 1992 |publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-688-12838-6| pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7VAcMdddNkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=al+capone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capone showed promise as a student, but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial Catholic school. His schooling ended at the age of 14, after he was expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Channel&quot;/&gt; He worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a bowling alley.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Capone was influenced by gangster [[Johnny Torrio]], whom he came to regard as a mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Capone initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. He then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful [[Five Points Gang]] based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer [[Frankie Yale]], a bartender in a [[Coney Island]] dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. Capone inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a Brooklyn night club and was slashed by her brother Frank Gallucio. The wounds led to the nickname &quot;Scarface&quot; which Capone loathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Marriage and family===
Capone married Mae Josephine Coughlin at age 19, on December 30, 1918. She was Irish Catholic and earlier that month had given birth to their son Albert Francis &quot;Sonny&quot; Capone (1918–2004). Albert lost most of his hearing in his left ear as a child. Capone was under the age of 21, and his parents had to consent in writing to the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al Capone: A Biography|author=Luciano J.

===Chicago===
In 1919, Capone left New York City for [[Chicago]] at the invitation of [[Johnny Torrio]], who was imported by crime boss [[Jim Colosimo|James &quot;Big Jim&quot; Colosimo]] as an enforcer. Capone began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted [[syphilis]]. Timely use of [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]] probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Get Capone: The Secret Plot That Captured America's Most Wanted, by Jonathan Eig. p17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, he purchased a small house at 7244 South [[Prairie Avenue]] in the Park Manor neighborhood on the city's [[South Side, Chicago|south side]] for {{US$|5500}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hood |first=Joel |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-talk-caponeapr02,0,5381253.story |title=Capone home on the market – Chicago Tribune Archives |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405100727/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-talk-caponeapr02%2C0%2C5381253.story |archivedate=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the decade, his name began appearing in newspaper sports pages where he was described as a boxing promoter.&lt;ref&gt;Bootleggers and Beer Barons of the Prohibition Era, by J. Anne Funderburg p.235&lt;/ref&gt; Torrio took over Colosimo's crime empire after Colosimo's murder on May 11, 1920, in which Capone was suspected of being involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Channel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?catId=259452&amp;action=view&amp;profileId=262834 |title=Notorious Crime Files: Al Capone |accessdate=2010-11-12 |publisher=Biography.com |work=[[The Biography Channel]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727215147/http://www.biography.com/notorious/crimefiles.do?action=view&amp;profileId=262834&amp;catId=259452 |archivedate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Marilyn|last= Bardsley|url= http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chicago_5.html|title= Chicago|accessdate= 2008-04-03|publisher= Crime Library|work= Al Capone|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080531032517/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/capone/chicago_5.html|archive-date= 2008-05-31|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobler, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller [[North Side Gang]] led by [[Dean O'Banion]] (also known as Dion O'Banion) was of mixed ethnicity, and it came under pressure from the Genna brothers who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that Torrio was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side, despite his pretensions to be a settler of disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Capone: The Man and the Era|url= https://archive.org/details/caponemanera00berg|url-access= registration|last= Bergreen|first= Laurence|year= 1994|publisher= Simon and Schuster Paperbacks|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-684-82447-5|pages= [https://archive.org/details/caponemanera00berg/page/131 131–132]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a fateful step, Torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of O'Banion at his flower shop on November 10, 1924. This placed [[Hymie Weiss]] at the head of the gang, backed by [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Bugs Moran]]. Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders made it a priority to get revenge on his killers.&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, pp&amp;nbsp;134–135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;myalcaponemuseum.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id89.htm|title=Hymie Weiss|website=Myalcaponemuseum.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Capone was a frequent visitor to [[RyeMabee]] in [[Monteagle, Tennessee]] &quot;when he was traveling between Chicago and his Florida estate in Miami.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;npsform&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: RyeMabee|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/17463b67-3e3f-4ce6-9b2b-f29f3430895e|website=National Park Service|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boss===

In January 1925, Capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip when he was shot several times. After recovering, he effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. In turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue. An establishment that refused to purchase liquor from him often got blown up, and as many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. Rivals saw Capone as responsible for the proliferation of brothels in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;myalcaponemuseum.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl, ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), p.362&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), pp.39,40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Disasters and Tragic Events, edited by Mitchell Newton-Matza p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

Capone indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was [[Templeton Rye]] from [[Iowa]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/|title=Templeton Rye of Templeton, Iowa|last=Walker|first=Jason|date=2009-07-07|accessdate=2010-12-04|publisher=Heavy Table| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125042146/http://heavytable.com/templeton-rye-of-templeton-iowa/| archivedate=November 25, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and female companionship. He was particularly known for his flamboyant and costly jewelry. His favorite responses to questions about his activities were: &quot;I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want&quot;; and, &quot;All I do is satisfy a public demand.&quot; Capone had become a national celebrity and talking point.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt;

He based himself in [[Cicero, Illinois]] after using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over town council elections (such as the [[1924 Cicero, Illinois municipal elections|1924 Cicero municipal elections]]), and this made it difficult for the North Siders to target him.&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Added by bob armour |url=http://timelines.com/1923/al-capone-moves-his-gangs-headquarters-to-cicero-illinois |title=Al Capone moves his gang's headquarters to Cicero, Illinois |publisher=Timelines.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522102949/http://timelines.com/1923/al-capone-moves-his-gangs-headquarters-to-cicero-illinois |archive-date=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; His driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss's life in the [[Chicago Loop]]. On September 20, 1926, the North Side Gang used a ploy outside the Capone headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with [[Thompson submachine gun]]s and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. Capone was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later, Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. The owner of Hawthorne's restaurant was a friend of Capone's, and he was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci in January 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-5369641-504083.html |title=Al Capone's Couderay, Wisconsin Hideout Home for Sale; Asking Price $2.6M |publisher=CBS News |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212125601/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-5369641-504083.html |archivedate=February 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capone became increasingly security-minded and desirous of getting away from Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-10-08/justice/wisconsin.capone.hideout.sold_1_capone-family-al-capone-reputed |title=Reputed Capone hideout sold to Wisconsin bank |publisher=CNN |date=8 October 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}{{dead link|date=September 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman]] [[Sleeping car|sleeper car]] on a night train to [[Cleveland]], [[Omaha]], [[Kansas City]], [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], or [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on [[Palm Island (Miami Beach)|Palm Island, Florida]], in [[Biscayne Bay]] between [[Miami]] and [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/life/al-capone-mansion-house-escape-real-estate-property-miami|title=Al Capone's former Miami Beach mansion can be your escape from Canadian winter|publisher=nationalpost.com|date=November 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot;/&gt; He never registered any property under his name.

===Political alliances===
The protagonists of Chicago's politics had long been associated with questionable methods, and even newspaper circulation &quot;wars&quot;, but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. Capone is generally seen as having an appreciable effect in bringing about the victories of Republican [[William Hale Thompson]], especially in the 1927 mayoral race when Thompson campaigned for a wide open town, at one time hinting that he'd reopen illegal saloons.&lt;ref name=&quot;big_bill_232_244&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wendt|first=Lloyd|title=Big Bill of Chicago|year=1953|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|pages=232–244|author2=Herman Kogan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a proclamation helped his campaign gain the support of Capone, and he allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 from the gangster. In the 1927 mayoral race, Thompson beat [[William Emmett Dever]] by a relatively slim margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayors|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/795.html|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Bill Thompson|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/media_detail/S0987|work=Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=January 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson's powerful Cook County [[political machine]] had drawn on the often-parochial Italian community, but this was in tension with his highly successful courting of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, by Steven P. Erie pp.102–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Irish Way: Becoming American in the Multiethnic City, by James R.

Capone continued to back Thompson. Voting booths were targeted by Capone's bomber [[James Belcastro]] in the wards where Thompson's opponents were thought to have support, on the polling day of April 10, 1928, in the so-called [[Pineapple Primary]], causing the deaths of at least 15 people. Belcastro was accused of the murder of lawyer Octavius Granady, an African American who challenged Thompson's candidate for the African American vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. Four policemen were among those charged along with Belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to Capone's organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an independent operator.&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl, ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'', 2nd ed., Checkmark Books (1999), pp.291, 292&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russo, Gus, ''The Outfit'', Bloomsbury (2001), pp.38, 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Evening Independent – Jan 12, 1931, AP, Career of Chicago bomb king halted by bullets&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Afro American – Oct 12, 1929, Chicargo (ANP)Police Named In Granady Killing,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Outfit: The Role Of Chicago's Underworld In The Shaping Of Modern America

The 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre led to public disquiet about Thompson's alliance with Capone and was a factor in [[Anton J.

===Saint Valentine's Day Massacre===

Capone was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the 1929 [[Saint Valentine's Day Massacre]] in an attempt to eliminate [[Bugs Moran]], head of the [[North Side Gang]]. Moran was the last survivor of the North Side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors [[Vincent Drucci]] and [[Hymie Weiss]] had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader [[Dean O'Banion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;five families book&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html Bugs Moran Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903184250/http://www.bugsmoran.net/northsiders/drucci.html |date=2015-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm ''My Al Capone Museum''] [http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id111.htm &quot;Vincent 'The Schemer' Drucci&quot;], Mario Gomes, accessed 2/7/14&lt;/ref&gt;

To monitor their targets' habits and movements, Capone's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse and garage at 2122 North Clark Street, which served as Moran's headquarters. On the morning of Thursday, February 14, 1929,&lt;ref name=cdtsdim&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10609655/chicago_tribune/ |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Slay doctor in massacre |date=February 15, 1929 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tklocty&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14735930/st_valentunes_day/|work=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=Trace killers; lid on city |date=February 16, 1929 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capone's lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police officers to initiate a &quot;police raid&quot;. The ''faux'' police lined the seven victims along a wall and signaled for accomplices armed with machine guns and shotguns. Photos of the slain victims shocked the public and damaged Capone's reputation. Within days, Capone received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on charges of federal Prohibition violations, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Capone: The Man and the Era, by Laurence Bergreen, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

Capone was primarily known for ordering other men to do his dirty work for him. One story, however, has Capone, having discovered that three of his men—Scalise, Anselmi, and Giunta—were conspiring against him with a rival gangster, Joe Aiello, reportedly arranging for the conspirators to dine with him and his [[bodyguard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzOQLlQvBa0C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=al+capone+baseball+bat#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20capone%20baseball%20bat|title=Al Capone: A Biography|last=Iorizzo|first=Luciano J.|publisher=Greenwood|year=2003|isbn=|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a night of drinking, Capone beat the men with a [[baseball bat]] and then [[gangland killing|ordered]] his bodyguards to shoot them, a scene that was included in the 1987 film ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXJ_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT184&amp;dq=al+capone+baseball+bat#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20capone%20baseball%20bat|title=Al Capone: His Life, Legacy, and Legend|last=Bair|first=Deirdre|date=2016-10-25|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780385537162|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deirdre Bair, along with writers and historians such as William Elliot Hazelgrove, have questioned the veracity of the claim.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWMqDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=al+capone+baseball+bat#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20capone%20baseball%20bat|title=Al Capone and the 1933 World's Fair: The End of the Gangster Era in Chicago|last=Hazelgrove|first=William Elliott|date=2017-09-15|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=|isbn=9781442272279|pages=46–47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bair questioned why &quot;three trained killers could sit quietly and let this happen&quot;, while Hazelgrove stated that Capone would have been &quot;hard pressed to beat three men to death with a baseball bat&quot; and that he would have instead let an enforcer perform the murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; But despite claims that the story was first reported by author [[Walter Noble Burns]] in his 1931 book ''The One-way Ride: The red trail of Chicago gangland from prohibition to Jake Lingle'',&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Capone biographers [[Max Allan Collins]] and A.

On March 27, 1929, Capone was arrested by FBI agents as he left a Chicago courtroom after testifying to a grand jury that was investigating violations of federal prohibition laws. He was charged with contempt of court for feigning illness to avoid an earlier appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/al-capone |title=FBI – Al Capone |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706031909/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/al-capone |archivedate=2015-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 1929, Capone was arrested in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania for carrying a concealed weapon.

[[File:Al Capone in Florida.jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]] of Capone in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], 1930]]

In April 1930, Capone was arrested on [[Vagrancy#United States|vagrancy]] charges when visiting Miami Beach; the governor had ordered sheriffs to run him out of the state. Capone claimed that Miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. He was charged with [[perjury]] for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Luisa Yanez, The Miami Herald |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2010-09-27/news/fl-al-capone-trial-20100927_1_gangster-al-capone-alphonse-capone-mock-trial |title=Gangster Al Capone's 1930 trial to return to Miami court – Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a Chicago judge issued a warrant for Capone's arrest on charges of vagrancy, and then used the publicity to run against Thompson in the Republican primary.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Eagle – Sep 17, 1930, Gang leaders face arrest,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al Capone: A Biography By Luciano J.

===Tax evasion===
{{Wikisource|Portal:IRS investigation of Al Capone|IRS investigation of Al Capone}}

[[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] [[Mabel Walker Willebrandt]] recognized that mob figures publicly led lavish lifestyles yet never filed tax returns, and thus could be convicted of tax evasion without requiring hard evidence to get testimony about their other crimes. She tested this approach by prosecuting a South Carolina bootlegger, Manley Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bryson |first=Bill |year=2013 |title=One Summer, America, 1927 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=978-0-375-43432-7 |pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Sullivan]]'' that the approach was legally sound: illegally earned income was subject to income tax; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] rejected the argument that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protected criminals from reporting illegal income.&lt;ref&gt;''Capone: The Man and the Era'' – Page 224&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRS special investigation unit chose [[Frank J. Wilson]] to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided.&lt;ref&gt;''Al Capone: Chicago's King of Crime'', by Nate Hendley, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. On March 13, 1931, Capone was charged with [[income tax evasion]] for 1924, in a secret grand jury.&lt;ref name=scarfacecrusaders/&gt; On June 5, 1931, Capone was indicted by a federal grand jury on 22 counts of income tax evasion from 1925 through 1929; he was released on $50,000 bail.&lt;ref name=scarfacecrusaders/&gt; A week later, [[Eliot Ness]] and his team of [[Untouchables (law enforcement)|Untouchables]] inflicted major financial damage on Capone's operations and led to his indictment on 5,000 violations of the [[Volstead Act]] (Prohibition laws).&lt;ref name=scarfacecrusaders/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins &amp; Schwartz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Max Allan|last2=Schwartz|first2=A.

On June 16, 1931, at the [[Chicago Federal Building]] in the courtroom of Judge [[James Herbert Wilkerson]], Capone plead guilty to income tax evasion and the 5,000 Volstead Act violations as part of a {{frac|2|1|2}}-year prison sentence [[plea bargain]].&lt;ref name=scarfacecrusaders/&gt; However, on July 30, 1931, Judge Wilkerson refused to honor the plea bargain, and Capone's counsel rescinded the guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=scarfacecrusaders/&gt; On the second day of the trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk.

Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers, but these strongly implied Capone's control rather than stating it. Capone's lawyers, who had relied on the plea bargain Judge Wilkerson refused to honor and therefore had mere hours to prepare for the trial, ran a weak defense focused on claiming that essentially all his income was lost to gambling.&lt;ref name=Iorizzo&gt;{{cite book|first1=Luciano J.|last1=Iorizzo|title=Al Capone: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Al_Capone.html?id=KzOQLlQvBa0C|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2003|isbn=978-0-313-32317-1|page=81-82|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been irrelevant regardless, since gambling losses can only be subtracted from gambling winnings, but it was further undercut by Capone's expenses, which were well beyond what his claimed income could support; Judge Wilkerson allowed Capone's spending to be presented at very great length.&lt;ref name=Iorizzo /&gt; The government charged Capone with evasion of $215,000 in taxes on a total income of $1,038,654, during the five-year period.&lt;ref name=scarfacecrusaders/&gt; Capone was convicted on three counts of income tax evasion on October 17, 1931,&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Al-Capone|title=Al Capone - American criminal|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ctcvcapn&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14736139/capone_convicted/ |newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune |last=Kinsley |first=Philip |title=U.S. jury convicts Capone |date=October 19, 1931 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ccotevsr&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kRpWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FuMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6214%2C983876 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Capone convicted of tax evasion |date=October 18, 1931 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sentenced a week later to 11 years in federal prison, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on his back taxes.&lt;ref name=csenelv&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kTdWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5020%2C6914884|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |last=Hackler |first=Victor |title=Capone sentenced 11 years, fined $50,000 |date=October 24, 1931 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpjlpnx&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14342512/1931_10_24_capone_sentenced_front_page/ |newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune |title=Capone in jail; prison next |date=October 25, 1931 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ckmappl&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f5kRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jOgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2892%2C4301 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |last=Brennan |first=Ray |title=Capone kept until Monday for appeal |date=October 25, 1931 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;court&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Visitors to the Court-Historic Trials |publisher=US District Court-Northern District of Illinois |date= |accessdate=2011-02-10 |url=http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/CourtHouseVisitors.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721065913/http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/CourtHouseVisitors.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contempt of court sentence was served concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/capone/caponeverdict.html |title=Selected Documents: Jury Verdict Form (October 17, 1931) |work=Al Capone Trial |first=Douglas O. |last=Linder |publisher=University of Missouri–Kansas City | accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Capone v.

===Imprisonment===

Capone was sent to [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary]] in May 1932, aged 33. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, the {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} Capone was officially diagnosed with [[syphilis]] and [[Gonorrhea|gonorrhoea]]. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his nasal septum. Capone was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent.&lt;ref name=&quot;bergreen 511&quot;&gt;Bergreen, pp. 511–514&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen as a weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict [[Morris Rudensky|Red Rudensky]], feared that Capone would have a breakdown. Rudensky was formerly a small-time criminal associated with the Capone gang, and found himself becoming a protector for Capone.&lt;ref name=&quot;bergreen 511&quot;/&gt; The conspicuous protection of Rudensky and other prisoners drew accusations from less friendly inmates, and fueled suspicion that Capone was receiving special treatment. No solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving Capone to the recently opened [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] off the coast of San Francisco, in August 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;bergreen 511&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergreen, pp. 519–521&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 1936, Capone was stabbed and superficially wounded by fellow-Alcatraz inmate [[James C.

==Chicago aftermath==
The main effect of Capone's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but those involved in the jailing of Capone portrayed it as considerably undermining the city's [[organized crime]] syndicate. Capone's [[underboss]], [[Frank Nitti]] took over as boss of the Outfit after he was released from prison in March 1932, having also been convicted of tax evasion charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;AfterCapone&quot;&gt;Eghigian, Mars. ''After Capone: The Life and World of Chicago Mob Boss Frank &quot;The Enforcer&quot; Nitti.'' Naperville, Ill.: Cumberland House Publishing, 2006. {{ISBN|1-58182-454-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from being smashed, the Outfit continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower level and without the open violence that had marked Capone's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead &quot;front boss&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins &amp; Schwartz&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|468–469, 517–518, 524–527, 538–541}}&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.chicagotribune.com&quot;/&gt; Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Outfit'', John J. Binder, chapter four&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failing health and death==
Due to his failing health, Capone was released from prison on November 16, 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23230440/al_capone_released_from_prison_because/|title=Al Capone released from prison because of illness (paresis caused by syphilis), 1939|date=November 16, 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] for the treatment of [[General paresis of the insane|paresis]] (caused by late-stage syphilis). Hopkins refused to admit him on his reputation alone, but [[Union Memorial Hospital]] accepted him. Capone was grateful for the compassionate care that he received and donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939. A very sickly Capone left Baltimore on March 20, 1940, after a few weeks of inpatient and a few weeks of outpatient care, for [[Palm Island, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-08-30/news/1994242174_1_capone-katz-pimlico|last=Sandler|first=Gilbert|title=Al Capone's hide-out|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=30 August 1994|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/baltimorecounty/news/ph-ms-union-memorial-0329-20120326,0,1307075.story|last=Perl|first=Larry|title=For Union Memorial, Al Capone's tree keeps on giving|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=26 March 2012|accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc2news.com/news/region/baltimore-city/medstar-union-memorial-celebrates-capone-cherry-tree-blooming |last=Slade |first=Fred |title=Medstar Union Memorial celebrates Capone Cherry Tree blooming |publisher=[[WMAR-TV|Abc2News]] |date=10 April 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727231633/http://www.abc2news.com/news/region/baltimore-city/medstar-union-memorial-celebrates-capone-cherry-tree-blooming |archivedate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, after mass production of [[penicillin]] was started in the United States, Capone was one of the first American patients treated by the new drug.&lt;ref&gt;The first use of penicillin in the United States was on March 14, 1942, for a patient with streptococcal sepsis.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was too late for him to reverse the damage in his brain, it did slow down the progression of the disease.&lt;ref name=Penicillin/&gt;

Capone is one of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century and has been the major subject of numerous articles, books, and films. Particularly, from 1925 to 1929, shortly after Capone relocated to Chicago, he enjoyed status as the most notorious mobster in the country. Capone cultivated a certain image of himself in the media, that made him a subject of fascination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themobmuseum.org/blog/al-capone-rise-and-fall/|title=Al Capone: The story behind his rise and fall {{!}} The Mob Museum|date=2016-07-06|work=The Mob Museum|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/things-to-do/the-17-most-notorious-mobsters-from-chicago|title=The 17 most notorious mobsters from Chicago|work=Time Out Chicago|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal masterminds ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted [[fedora]] is based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and parodies of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.
