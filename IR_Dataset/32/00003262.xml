'''Agar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ɡ|ɑːr}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|g|ər}}) or '''agar-agar''' also known as &quot;China grass&quot; is a jelly-like substance, obtained from [[red algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|edition=2|year=2005|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agar is a mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide [[agarose]], and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called [[agaropectin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, Peter W. |author2=Phillips, Glyn O.

Agar has been used as an ingredient in [[dessert]]s throughout Asia, and also as a solid [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] to contain [[Growth medium|culture media]] for [[microbiology|microbiological]] work. Agar can be used as a [[laxative]], an appetite suppressant, a [[vegetarian]] substitute for [[gelatin]], a thickener for [[soup]]s, in [[Fruit preserves#Jelly|fruit preserves]], [[ice cream]], and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in [[brewing]], and for [[sizing]] paper and fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Green Balfour| title = Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, commercial, industrial and scientific...| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5ixCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA13| year = 1857| publisher = | isbn = | page = 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gelling agent in agar is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from ''tengusa'' (''[[Gelidiaceae]]'') and ''[[ogonori]]'' (''[[Gracilaria]]''). For commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from ''ogonori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shimamura|first1=Natsu|title=Agar|url=http://www.tokyofoundation.org/en/topics/japanese-traditional-foods/vol.-4-agar|website=The Tokyo Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2016|date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chemical terms, agar is a [[polymer]] made up of subunits of the sugar [[galactose]].

== History ==
[[Image:Agarose polymere.svg|right|thumb|The structure of an agarose polymer.]]

Agar may have been discovered in Japan in 1658 by Mino Tarōzaemon ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|美濃}} {{linktext|太郎}}{{linktext|左|衞|門}}}}), an innkeeper in current [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto]] who, according to legend, was said to have discarded surplus seaweed soup and noticed that it gelled later after a winter night's freezing.&lt;ref name=&quot;DifcoMan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bd.com/ds/technicalCenter/misc/difcobblmanual_2nded_lowres.pdf|title=Difco &amp; BBL Manual|publisher=Becton Dickinson and Company|editor1=Mary Jo Zimbro |editor2=David A.

Agar was first subjected to chemical analysis in 1859 by the French chemist [[Anselme Payen]], who had obtained agar from the marine algae ''Gelidium corneum''.&lt;ref&gt;Payen, Anselme (1859) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3006f/f523.image.langEN &quot;Sur la gélose et le nids de salangane&quot;] (On agar and swiftlet nests), ''Comptes rendus'' …, '''49''' : 521–530, appended remarks 530–532.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 19th century, agar began to be used heavily as a solid medium for growing various microbes. Agar was first described for use in microbiology in 1882 by the German microbiologist [[Walther Hesse]], an assistant working in [[Robert Koch|Robert Koch's]] laboratory, on the suggestion of his wife [[Fanny Hesse|Fannie Hesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Koch (10 April 1882) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015020075001;view=1up;seq=235 &quot;Die Aetiologie der Tuberculose&quot;] (The etiology of tuberculosis), ''Berliner Klinische Wochenschrift'' (Berlin Clinical Weekly), '''19''' :  221–230.  From p. 225:  ''&quot;Die Tuberkelbacillen lassen sich auch noch auf anderen Nährsubstraten kultiviren, wenn letztere ähnliche Eigenschaften wie das erstarrte Blutserum besitzen.  So wachsen sie beispielsweise auf einer mit Agar-Agar bereiteten, bei Blutwärme hart bleibenden Gallerte, welche einen Zusatz von Fleischinfus und Pepton erhalten hat.&quot;'' (The tubercule bacilli can also be cultivated on other media, if the latter have properties similar to those of congealed blood serum.

With its newfound use in microbiology, agar production quickly increased. This production centered on Japan, which produced most of the world's agar until World War II.&lt;ref name=Loban&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lobban|first1=Christopher S.|last2=Wynne|first2=Michael James|title=The Biology of Seaweeds|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520045859|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QG4tqjFPWJ0C&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=agar+gelling+malay+japan#v=onepage&amp;q=agar%20gelling%20malay%20japan&amp;f=false|language=en |pages=734–735|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the outbreak of World War II, many nations were forced to establish domestic agar industries in order to continue microbiological research.&lt;ref name=Loban/&gt; Around the time of World War II, approximately 2,500 tons of agar were produced annually.&lt;ref name=Loban/&gt; By the mid-1970s, production worldwide had increased dramatically to approximately 10,000 tons each year.&lt;ref name=Loban/&gt; Since then, production of agar has fluctuated due to unstable and sometimes over-utilized seaweed populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lab staple agar hit by seaweed shortage |journal=Nature |volume=528 |issue=7581 |pages=171–172 |publisher=Nature News |author=Ewen Callaway |date=8 December 2015 |doi=10.1038/528171a |pmid=26659158 |bibcode=2015Natur.528..171C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;agar&quot; comes from '''agar-agar''', the [[Malay language|Malay]] name for red algae (''[[Gigartina]]'', ''[[Gracilaria]]'') from which the jelly is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Balfour |first=Edward. |title= The cyclopædia of India and of eastern and southern Asia: commercial, industrial and scientific, products of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures |url= https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.283118 |publisher= B. Quaritch |year= 1885 |isbn= |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as '''Kanten''' ({{lang-ja|寒天}}) (from the phrase '''''kan'''-zarashi [[Tokoroten|tokoro'''ten''']]'' ({{lang|ja|寒曬心太}}) or “cold-exposed agar”), '''Japanese isinglass''', '''Ceylon moss''' or '''Jaffna moss'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agar-agar.org/en/ Agar-Agar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903170258/http://www.agar-agar.org/en/ |date=2011-09-03 }} at Agar-Agar.org&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gracilaria lichenoides'' is specifically referred to as '''agal-agal''' or '''Ceylon agar'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/a/agara012.html |accessdate=22 January 2017 |title=Agar-Agar |publisher=Botanical.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Agar consists of a mixture of two [[polysaccharide]]s: agarose and agaropectin, with agarose making up about 70% of the mixture.&lt;ref name=FAO3/&gt; [[Agarose]] is a linear polymer, made up of repeating units of [[Agarose#Structure|agarobiose]], a disaccharide made up of [[D-galactose]] and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose.&lt;ref name=FAO1/&gt; Agaropectin is a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules that occur in lesser amounts, and is made up of alternating units of D-galactose and L-galactose heavily modified with acidic side-groups, such as sulfate and pyruvate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hyagar.html Agar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016213723/http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hyagar.html |date=October 16, 2007 }} at lsbu.ac.uk Water Structure and Science&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO3&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/AB730E/AB730E03.htm |title=Training manual on Gracilaria culture and seaweed processing in China |chapter=III: Properties, Manufacture, and Application of Seaweed Polysaccharides – Agar, Carageenan, and Algin |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations|date=August 1990 |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FAO1&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5822e/x5822e03.htm |title=Production and Utilization of Products from Commercial Seaweeds|chapter=Chapter 1 – Production, Properties and Uses of Agar |author1=Rafael Armisen |author2=Fernando Galatas |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations |date=1987 |editor=McHugh DJ |isbn=92-5-102612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agar exhibits [[hysteresis]], melting at 85&amp;nbsp;°C (358 K, 185&amp;nbsp;°F) and solidifying from 32–40&amp;nbsp;°C (305–313 K, 90–104&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml |title=All About Agar |publisher=Sciencebuddies.org |accessdate=2011-04-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603081846/http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_ideas/MicroBio_Agar.shtml| archivedate= 3 June 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property lends a suitable balance between easy melting and good gel stability at relatively high temperatures. Since many scientific applications require incubation at temperatures close to human body temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C), agar is more appropriate than other solidifying agents that melt at this temperature, such as gelatin.

==Uses==

=== Culinary ===
[[File:Sago Gulaman.jpg|thumb|''[[Sago]] at [[gulaman]]'' in [[Filipino cuisine]] is made from agar (''[[gulaman]]''), pearl [[sago]], and fruit juice flavored with [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|pandan]]|210x210px]]
Agar-agar is a natural vegetable [[gelatin]] counterpart. It is white and semi-[[translucent]] when sold in packages as washed and dried strips or in powdered form. It can be used to make jellies, [[puddings]], and [[custard]]s. When making jelly, it is boiled in water until the solids dissolve. Sweetener, flavoring, coloring, fruits and or vegetables are then added, and the liquid is poured into [[molding (process)|molds]] to be served as desserts and vegetable [[aspic]]s or incorporated with other desserts such as a layer of jelly in a [[cake]].

Agar-agar is approximately 80% fiber, so it can serve as an intestinal regulator. Its bulking quality has been behind fad diets in Asia, for example the ''kanten'' (the Japanese word for agar-agar&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot; /&gt;) diet. Once ingested, ''kanten'' triples in size and absorbs water. This results in the consumers feeling fuller. This diet has recently received some press coverage in the United States as well. The diet has shown promise in obesity studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maeda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maeda H, Yamamoto R, Hirao K, Tochikubo O | title=Effects of agar (kanten) diet on obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes | date = January 2005 | journal = Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=1 |pmid=15642074 | pages = 40–46 | doi = 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2004.00370.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Asian culinary ====
One use of agar in [[Japanese cuisine]] ([[Wagashi]]) is ''[[anmitsu]]'', a dessert made of small cubes of agar jelly and served in a bowl with various fruits or other ingredients. It is also the main ingredient in ''mizu yōkan'', another popular Japanese food. In [[Philippine cuisine]], it is used to make the jelly bars in the various [[gulaman]] refreshments or desserts such as ''sago gulaman'', ''buko pandan'', ''agar flan'', ''[[halo-halo]]'', and the black and red ''gulaman'' used in various fruit salads. In [[Vietnamese cuisine]], jellies made of flavored layers of agar agar, called ''thạch'', are a popular dessert, and are often made in ornate molds for special occasions. In [[Indian cuisine]], agar agar is known as &quot;China grass&quot; and is used for making desserts. In [[Burmese cuisine]], a sweet jelly known as ''kyauk kyaw'' ([[Burmese language|Burmese]]: ကျောက်ကျော, {{IPA-my|tɕaʊʔtɕɔ́|}}) is made from agar.
[[File:Gong Cha in QV Square 2017.jpg|thumb|A Gong Cha [[Bubble tea|bubble teahouse]] in [[Queen Victoria Village|QV Square]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]]]
Agar jelly is widely used in [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese]] [[bubble tea]]. The bubble teahouses such as [[Gong Cha]] and [[Chatime]] can be seen in [[Australia]], [[United States|the United States,]] the [[United Kingdom]], [[Middle East]] and many Asian countries.

==== Other culinary ====
In [[Russia]], it is used in addition or as a replacement to [[pectin]] in jams and marmalades, as a substitute to gelatin for its superior gelling properties, and as a strengthening ingredient in souffles and custards. Another use of agar-agar is in ''ptich'ye moloko'' ([[bird's milk]]), a rich jellified custard (or soft [[meringue]]) used as a cake filling or chocolate-glazed as individual sweets. Agar-agar may also be used as the gelling agent in gel clarification, a culinary technique used to clarify stocks, sauces, and other liquids. [[Mexico]] has traditional candies made out of Agar gelatin, most of them in colorful, half-circle shapes that resemble a [[melon]] or [[watermelon]] fruit slice, and commonly covered with sugar. They are known in Spanish as ''Dulce de Agar'' (Agar sweets)

Agar-agar is an allowed nonorganic/nonsynthetic additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, texturizer, moisturizer, emulsifier, flavor enhancer, and absorbent in certified organic foods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5096516 Agar-agar Review Sheet], USDA Organic Materials Review, April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbiology ===
[[Image:Agar Plate.jpg|right|thumb|100mm diameter [[Petri dish]]es containing agar gel for bacterial culture]]
{{Main|Agar plate}}

An agar plate or [[Petri dish]] is used to provide a [[growth medium]] using a mix of agar and other nutrients in which microorganisms, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], can be cultured and observed under the microscope. Agar is indigestible for many organisms so that microbial growth does not affect the gel used and it remains stable. Agar is typically sold commercially as a powder that can be mixed with water and prepared similarly to gelatin before use as a growth medium. Other ingredients are added to the agar to meet the nutritional needs of the [[microbe]]s. Many microbe-specific formulations are available, because some microbes prefer certain environmental conditions over others.  Agar is often dispensed using a sterile [[media dispenser]].

==== Motility assays ====
As a gel, an agar or agarose medium is porous and therefore can be used to measure microorganism motility and mobility. The gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agarose in the medium, so various levels of effective viscosity (from the cell's &quot;point of view&quot;) can be selected, depending on the experimental objectives.

A common identification assay involves culturing a sample of the organism deep within a block of nutrient agar. Cells will attempt to grow within the gel structure. Motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized, whereas non-motile species will show growth only along the now-empty path introduced by the invasive initial sample deposition.

Another setup commonly used for measuring chemotaxis and chemokinesis utilizes the under-agarose cell migration assay, whereby a layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a chemoattractant. As a concentration gradient develops from the diffusion of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.

=== Plant biology ===
[[Image:Physcomitrella growing on agar plates.jpg|thumb|''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'' plants growing [[axenic]]ally [[in vitro]] on [[agar plate]]s ([[Petri dish]], 9&amp;nbsp;cm diameter).]]

Research grade agar is used extensively in plant biology as it is supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that allows for seedling germination in Petri dishes under sterile conditions (given that the seeds are sterilized as well). Nutrient and vitamin supplementation for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is standard across most experimental conditions. [[Murashige and Skoog medium|Murashige &amp; Skoog]] (MS) nutrient mix and Gamborg's B5 vitamin mix in general are used. A 1.0% agar/0.44% MS+vitamin dH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solution is suitable for growth media between normal growth temps.

When using agar, within any growth medium, it is important to know that the solidification of the agar is pH-dependent. The optimal range for solidification is between 5.4–5.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Se-Kwon|title=Handbook of marine macroalgae : biotechnology and applied phycology|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=9780470979181|edition=1st imp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the application of KOH is needed to increase the pH to this range. A general guideline is about 600 µl 0.1M KOH per 250 ml GM. This entire mixture can be sterilized using the liquid cycle of an [[autoclave]].

This medium nicely lends itself to the application of specific concentrations of phytohormones etc. to induce specific growth patterns in that one can easily prepare a solution containing the desired amount of hormone, add it to the known volume of GM, and autoclave to both sterilize and evaporate off any solvent that may have been used to dissolve the often-polar hormones. This hormone/GM solution can be spread across the surface of Petri dishes sown with germinated and/or etiolated seedlings.

Experiments with the [[moss]] ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', however, have shown that choice of the gelling agent&amp;nbsp;– agar or [[Gellan gum|Gelrite]] – does influence [[phytohormone]] sensitivity of the [[plant]] [[cell culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birgit Hadeler&quot;&gt;
{{cite journal|title=Gelrite and agar differently influence cytokinin-sensitivity of a moss |journal=Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=369–371|author1 = Birgit Hadeler|author2 = Sirkka Scholz|author3=Ralf Reski |authorlink3=Ralf Reski |doi=10.1016/s0176-1617(11)82071-7|year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
