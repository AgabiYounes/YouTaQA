'''Aveiro''' ({{IPA-pt|aˈvejɾu}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-pt|ɐˈvɐjɾu||Pt-pt Aveiro FF.ogg}}) is a [[city]] and a [[List of municipalities of Portugal|municipality]] in Portugal. In 2011, the population was 78,450,&lt;ref name=ine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xlang=en&amp;xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_indicadores&amp;indOcorrCod=0005889&amp;contexto=pi&amp;selTab=tab0|title=Statistics Portugal|author=|date=|website=www.ine.pt|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an area of {{convert|197.58|km2|mi2}}:&lt;ref name=dgt&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ |title=Áreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e país |access-date=5 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105172426/http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ |archive-date=5 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the second most populous city in the [[Centro Region, Portugal|Centro Region]] of Portugal (after [[Coimbra]]). Along with the neighbouring city of [[Ílhavo]], Aveiro is part of an urban agglomeration that includes 120,000 inhabitants, making it one of the most important populated regions by density in the Centro Region, and primary centre of the Intermunicipal Community of [[Região de Aveiro|Aveiro]] and [[Baixo Vouga]]. Administratively, the president of the municipal government is José Ribau Esteves, elected by coalition between the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[People's Party (Portugal)|Democratic Social Centre]], who governs the ten civil parishes ({{lang-pt|freguesias}}).

==History==

The presence of human settlement in the territory of Aveiro extends to the period associated with the great dolmens of pre-history, which exist in most of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historia&quot;&gt;{{citation|editor=Câmara Municipal |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Aveiro |location=Aveiro, Portugal |year=2011 |url=http://www.cm-aveiro.pt/www/templates/TabTemplate.aspx?id_class=2348&amp;TM=2345S2348 |title=História |language=Portuguese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920182118/http://www.cm-aveiro.pt/www/templates/TabTemplate.aspx?id_class=2348&amp;TM=2345S2348 |archivedate=20 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latinised toponym ‘’Averius’’ derived from the Celtic word ''aber'' (river-mouth, etym.&lt; Brythonic *aber &lt; Proto-Celtic *adberos, compare Welsh [[Aberystwyth]]). &lt;ref&gt; https://www.infopedia.pt/dicionarios/toponimia/Aveiro &lt;/ref&gt;

For a long period Aveiro was an important economic link in the production of salt and commercial shipping.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; It was a centre of salt exploration by the Romans and trade centre through the Middle-ages, registered since 26 January 959 (from the testament of Countess Mumadona Dias to the ''cenóbio'' of Guimarães).&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; During this testament, Mumadona Dias also highlighted the ancient name for Aveiro, this time referring to the monastery's lands in ''Alauario et Salinas'', literally, &quot;''a gathering place or preserve of birds and of great salt''&quot;.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt;
From 11th century onwards, Aveiro became popular with Portuguese royalty.

===Kingdom of Portugal===

[[File:Santa Joana, Princesa de Portugal.jpg|100px|thumb|left|170px|Infanta D. [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|Joana]], daughter of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]]]

Later, King [[John I of Portugal|João I]], on the advice of his son [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Pedro]], who was the [[Donatário|donatary]] of Aveiro, requested the construction of fortification walls.

King [[Duarte de Portugal|D. Duarte]] conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the ''Feira de Março'' (''March Fair''), today still an annual tradition.

The Princess [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]], daughter of [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] lived in Aveiro, entering the convent of Jesus, and lived there until her death on 12 May 1490. During her life her presence brought attention to the town, and favoured it with an elevated level of development for the time.

The first charter ([[foral]]) was conceded by [[Manuel I of Portugal]] on 4 August 1515, as indicated in the ''Livro de Leituras Novas de Forais da Estremadura''. Its geographic position along the Aveiro River had always helped it to subsist and grow, supported by salt market, fishing and maritime commercial development.
By the beginning of the 15th century, there already existed a great wall around the historical centre, intonating the significance of the community and growth of the population.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; This included the founding of many religious institutions and their supports, which assisted during the 17th and 18th century crises associated with silt in the waterway.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in [[metal]]s and [[tile]]s, and creating a reef barrier at the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The walls were subsequently demolished and used to create the docks around the new sand bar.

[[File:Execução do Duque de Aveiro e do Marquês de Tavora.jpg|thumb|170px|left|A depiction of the execution of Duke José Mascarenhas of [[Duchy of Aveiro|Aveiro]]]]

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the river's instability at the mouth (between the Ria and open ocean) resulted in the closure of the canal, impeding the use of the port of Aveiro, and creating stagnation in the waters of the lagoon. This blow to the economy created a social and economic crisis, and resulted in the decrease in the population and emigration. It was at this time that the Church of the Miserícordia was constructed, during the Philippine Dynastic union.

[[File:Jose Estevao Magalhaes.jpg|thumb|170px|right|José Estêvão, parliamentary and 19th-century hero]]

In 1759, King [[Joseph I of Portugal|José I]] elevated the town to the status of city, a few months after condemning the Duke of Aveiro (a title established in 1547 by [[John III of Portugal|João III]]), José Mascarenhas, to death. As a result, Aveiro became known as Nova Bragança: it was later abandoned much later, and returned to Aveiro. In 1774, by request of King José, [[Pope Clement XIV]] instituted the [[Diocese of Aveiro]].

In the 19th century, the Aveirense were active during the [[Liberal Wars]], and it was José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães, a parliamentary member who was determinant in resolving the problem of access along the Ria. He also helped with the development of transport, especially the railway line between Lisbon and Porto. It was the opening of the artificial canals, completed in 1808, that allowed Aveiro to expand economically, marking the beginning in the town's growth.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt;

The municipality was elevated to the status of town, centered on its principal church, consecrated to the Archangel Michael, today the location of the ''Praça da República'' (having been demolished in 1835).

==Geography==
[[File:Aveiro bridge over canal.jpg|thumb|Bridge over canal in Aveiro]]
Located on the shore of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Aveiro is an industrial city with an important [[seaport]].

The seat of the municipality is the city of Aveiro, comprising the five urban parishes with about 73,003 inhabitants. The city of Aveiro is also the capital of the District of [[Aveiro (district)|Aveiro]], and the largest city in the [[Baixo Vouga]] intermunicipal community subregion.

Aveiro is known as &quot;the Portuguese [[Venice]]&quot;, due to its system of canals and boats similar to the Italian city of Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engenium.net/605/estudo-da-deco-diz-que-viseu-e-a-melhor-cidade-para-viver-em-portugal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028221909/http://www.engenium.net/605/estudo-da-deco-diz-que-viseu-e-a-melhor-cidade-para-viver-em-portugal.html |archivedate=28 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Aveiro has a warm-summer [[mediterranean climate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=129541&amp;cityname=Aveiro%2C+Portugal&amp;units=|title=Aveiro, Portugal Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by its proximity to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The maritime influence causes a narrow temperature range resulting in summers averaging around {{convert|24|C|F}} in daytime temperatures, considerably lower than inland areas on the same parallel on the Iberian Peninsula. As typical of mediterranean climates, summers are dry and winters are wet. A coastal feature is that frosts are rare and never severe. The hottest temperature recorded was {{convert|39.3|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipma.pt/en/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/001/|title=Climate Normals 1981-2010 - Aveiro|publisher=IPMA|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures above {{convert|32|C|F}} are extremely occasional, and averages only a couple of times per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=129541&amp;cityname=Aveiro-Portugal|title=Aveiro, Portugal Temperature Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Aveiro was known for many years for its production of [[salt]] and for the moliço [[seaweed]] harvest, which was used as fertilizer before the development of chemicals for that purpose. The boats once used for harvesting now carry tourists on the canals.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerofportugal.com/moliceiro-tours-in-the-ria/, Moliceiro Tours in the Ria&lt;/ref&gt; Salt production has also decreased dramatically with only a few salt ponds still remaining.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerofportugal.com/the-aveiro-salines/, The Aveiro Salines&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is now known for the preponderance of ceramics industries, a reflection of the regions advancements, resulting in a long productive tradition since the late Roman, early Medieval period (reflected in the ceramics kilns).&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt;

Software development is important too, both at the R&amp;D centre for a large telecom company and at the University of Aveiro (UAVR) which is attended by 15,000 students on undergraduate and postgraduate programs. UAVR

==Architecture==
[[File:Catedral de Aveiro.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The front facade of the [[Cathedral of Aveiro]]]]

The architecture of Aveiro is influenced by two phases: the pre-Kingdom era, with a number of historical monuments; and the modernist movements resulting from the expansion of economy during the 19th-20th centuries.

The city's primary landmark is the 15th century Monastery of Jesus ({{lang-pt|Mosteiro de Jesus}}), containing the tomb of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]]'s daughter, [[Joan of Portugal (nun)|St. Joana]] (who died in 1490). The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the ''Museu de Santa Joana'', or simply, the Museum of Aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.

The abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the effects of the boom during that period, including many of the Art Novo and Art Deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and Nationalist tendencies of the Estado Novo regime.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt;  The best of these is in the university campus, where many of the nationalist architects were involved in construction projects.&lt;ref name=Historia/&gt; The Art Novo architecture was built by wealthy families from Brazil; their buildings included homes and shops. Traditional Portuguese decorations such as tiles were used. The concept did not last for a long time, but its presence is very distinctive in Aveiro; it is one of only 20 cities in the world that are included in the [[Réseau Art Nouveau Network]], listing cities in Europe that are known for this architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portoalities.com/en/art-nouveau-in-aveiro-the-venice-of-portugal/ |title=Complete guide to Aveiro, the Venice of Portugal |date=13 September 2016 |publisher= Portoalities  |access-date=25 November 2019 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
