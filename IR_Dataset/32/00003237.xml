AN was the successor of the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), which had moderated its policies over its last decades and finally distanced itself from its former ideology during a convention in [[Fiuggi]] by dissolving into the new party in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Patrizia |last1=Catellani |first2=Patrizia |last2=Milesi |first3=Alberto |last3=Crescentini |title=One root, different branches: Identity, injustice and schisms |work=Extreme Right Activists in Europe: Through the Magnifying Glass |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=National alliance |editor-first=Gino |editor-last=Moliterno |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Italian Culture |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gianfranco Fini]] was the leader of AN from its foundation through 2008, after being elected [[President of the Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|President of the Chamber of Deputies]]. Fini was succeeded by [[Ignazio La Russa]], who managed the merger of the party with [[Forza Italia]] (FI) into [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) in 2009. A group of former AN members, led by La Russa, left FI in 2012 in order to launch the [[Brothers of Italy]] (FdI), while others remained in the PdL and were among the founding members of the new [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] (FI) in 2013.

==History==

===Foundation===
National Alliance, launched in 1994, was officially founded in January 1995, when the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), the former [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] party, merged with conservative elements of the former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], which had disbanded in 1994 after two years of scandals and various splits due to [[Political corruption|corruption]] at its highest levels, exposed by the ''[[Mani pulite]]'' investigation, and the [[Italian Liberal Party]], disbanded in the same year. Former MSI members were however still the bulk of the new party and former MSI leader [[Gianfranco Fini]] was elected leader of the new party.

The AN logo followed a template very similar to that of the [[Democratic Party of the Left]], with the logo of the direct predecessor party in a small circle, as a means of legally preventing others from using it. The name was suggested by an article on the Italian newspaper ''[[Il Tempo (newspaper)|Il Tempo]]'' written in 1992 by [[Domenico Fisichella]], a prominent conservative academic. Starting in the 1990s, the MSI gradually transformed into a mainstream [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] party, culminating in its 1995 dissolution into AN.

===Government participation===
[[File:Gianfranco Fini 2004.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Gianfranco Fini]] in 2004.]]
The party was part of all three [[House of Freedoms]] coalition governments led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Gianfranco Fini was nominated Deputy Prime Minister after the [[2001 Italian general election|2001 general election]] and was Foreign Minister from November 2004 to May 2006.

When Gianfranco Fini visited [[Israel]] in late November 2003 in the function of Italian Deputy Prime Minister, he labeled the racial laws issued by the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] regime in 1938 as &quot;infamous&quot;, as also [[Giorgio Almirante]], historic leader of MSI, had done before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ildomenicale.it/approfondimento.asp?id_approfondimento=16 Il Domenicale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also referred to the [[Italian Social Republic]] as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of &quot;absolute evil&quot;, something which was hardly acceptable to the few remaining hardliners of the party. As a result, [[Alessandra Mussolini]], the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], who had been at odds with the party on a number of issues for a long time, and some hardliners left the party and formed [[Social Action]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;&gt;Piero Ignazi, ''Partiti politici in Italia'', Il Mulino, Bologna 2008, pp. 27-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In occasion of the [[2006 Italian general election|2006 general election]], AN ran within the House of Freedoms, with new allies. The centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favour of the centre-left coalition [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]]. Individually AN received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. In July 2007 a group of splinters led by [[Francesco Storace]] formed [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]], which was officially founded on 10 November. Seven MPs of AN, including [[Teodoro Buontempo]] and [[Daniela Santanchè]], joined the new party.

===The People of Freedom===
In November 2007 [[Silvio Berlusconi]] announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into [[The People of Freedom]] (PdL) party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053 Sky tg24 - Tutte le notizie in formato video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615195058/http://www.skylife.it/html/skylife/tg24/politica.html?idvideo=56053 |date=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_novembre_18/berlusconi_partito_popolo_italiano.shtml «Oggi nasce il partito del popolo italiano». Corriere della Sera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_65043240.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055735/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/visualizza_fdg.html_65043240.html|date=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sudden fall of the [[Prodi II Cabinet|second Prodi government]] in January 2008, the breakup of [[The Union (political coalition)|The Union]] and the subsequent political crisis which led to a fresh general election, Berlusconi hinted that Forza Italia would have probably contested its last election and the new party would have been officially founded only after that election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconi also stated that the new party could see the participation of other parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_gennaio_25/berlusconi_napoli_a48218f8-cb73-11dc-9e0e-0003ba99c667.shtml «Via l'Ici e stretta sulle intercettazioni» Corriere della Sera&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of the &quot;People of Freedom&quot;, allied with the [[Lega Nord|Northern League]] (LN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/191851/notiziario-antiproibizionista-del-25-ottobre-1999 Svolta di Berlusconi, arriva il Pdl: &quot;Forza Italia-An sotto stesso simbolo&quot; - LASTAMPA.it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory of the PdL in the [[2008 Italian general election|2008 general election]], AN was merged into the PdL in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5039109/Mussolinis-heirs-merge-with-Silvio-Berlusconis-Forza-Italia-party.html Mussolini's heirs merge with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party] The Telegraph. 23 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
National Alliance's political program emphasized:
*[[traditionalist Catholic|traditional values]], being often close to the position of the [[Catholic Church]], despite some [[social liberalism|social liberal]] and [[Secularism|secular]] attitudes;
*[[law and order (politics)|law and order]], especially laws aimed at controlling [[immigration]] and implementing [[punishment]];
*support for [[Israel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;/&gt; the United States and [[European integration]]{{citation needed||date=June 2019}};
*[[prohibitionism|prohibition]] of all drugs, including [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].

Distinguishing itself from the MSI, the party distanced itself from [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian fascism|Fascism]] and made efforts to improve relations with [[Jews|Jew]]ish groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;/&gt; With most hardliners leaving the party,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bardi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;/&gt; it sought to present itself as a respectable [[conservatism|conservative]] party and to join forces with [[Forza Italia]] in the [[European People's Party]] and, eventually, in a united party of the centre-right.

Although the party approved the [[market economy]] and held favourable views on [[liberalization]]s and the [[privatization]] of [[public ownership|state industries]], however AN was to the left of Forza Italia on economic issues and sometimes supported [[statism|statist]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Agnew | first = John | title = The dramaturgy of horizons: geographical scale in the 'Reconstruction of Italy' by the new Italian political parties, 1992–1995 | journal = Political Geography | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–121 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/s0962-6298(96)00046-7 | date = February 1997 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is why the party was strong in [[Rome]] and [[Lazio]], where most civil servants live. Moreover, AN presented itself as a party promoting national cohesion, [[nation|national identity]] and [[patriotism]].

Regarding institutional reforms, the party was a long-time supporter of [[presidential democracy|presidentialism]] and a [[plurality voting system]], and came to support also [[federalism]] and to fully accept the alliance with the [[Lega Nord|Northern League]], although the relations with that party were tense at times, especially about issues regarding national unity.

[[Gianfranco Fini]], a moderniser who saw [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[David Cameron]] as role-models, impressed an ambitious political line to the party, combining the pillars of conservative ideology like security, family values and patriotism with a progressive approach in other areas such as [[stem cell]] research and supporting voting rights for legal aliens. Some of these positions were not shared by many members of the party, most of whom staunchly opposed stem cell research and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignazi&quot;/&gt;

==Factions==
National Alliance was a heterogeneous political party and within it members were divided in different factions, some of them very organized:
*'''[[Protagonist Right]]''' (''Destra Protagonista''), headed by [[Maurizio Gasparri]] and [[Ignazio La Russa]], was the bigger faction and the closest to [[Forza Italia]], due to its [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] stances.
*'''[[New Alliance (Italy)|New Alliance]]''' (''Nuova Alleanza''), formerly called '''Right and Freedom''' (''Destra e Libertà''), headed by [[Altero Matteoli]] and [[Adolfo Urso]], was formed by the staunchest supporters of [[Gianfranco Fini]] within the party and supported a [[Liberalism|liberal]] political agenda.
*'''[[Social Right]]''' (''Destra Sociale''), led by [[Gianni Alemanno]], advocated a more &quot;social&quot; approach to economic policy and was considered at the right of the party. It had close ties with the [[General Labour Union (Italy)|General Labour Union]].
*'''''D-Destra''''', led by [[Francesco Storace]], was the most conservative component of the party, proud of the MSI's tradition and in open opposition to Fini. Formed as a split from the Social Right, in July 2007 the group finally left AN and launched [[The Right (Italy)|The Right]].
*'''[[Christian Reformists]]''' (''Cristiano Riformisti'') was a minor [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] faction.

In the party there was also a group named '''Ethic-Religious Council''', whose board members included [[Gaetano Rebecchini]] (founder, ex-DC), [[Riccardo Pedrizzi]] (president), [[Franco Tofoni]] (vice president), [[Luigi Gagliardi]] (secretary-general), [[Alfredo Mantovano]], [[Antonio Mazzocchi]] and [[Riccardo Migliori]]. This was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. Sometimes the group criticized [[Gianfranco Fini]] for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination and stem-cell research, which led some notable ex-DC members as [[Publio Fiori]] to leave the party. Some members of the Council, such as Pedrizzi and Mantovano were described as members of an unofficial '''Catholic Right''' faction.

== Popular support ==
The party had roughly 10–15% support across Italy, having its strongholds in [[Central Italy|Central]] and [[Southern Italy]] ([[Lazio]] 18.6%, [[Umbria]] 15.2%, [[Marche]] 14.3%, [[Abruzzo]] 14.3%, [[Apulia]] 13.2%, [[Sardinia]] 12.9%, [[Tuscany]] 12.6% and [[Campania]] 12.6% in the last [[2006 Italian general election|general election]]), scoring badly in [[Lombardy]] (10.2%) and [[Sicily]] (10.9%), while competing in the North-East ([[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] 15.5% and [[Veneto]] 11.3%).

The party had a good showing in the first general election to which it took part (13.5% in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]]) and reached 15.7% in [[1996 Italian general election|1996]], when Fini tried for the first time to replace [[Silvio Berlusconi]] as leader of the centre-right. From that moment the party suffered an electoral decline, but remained the third force of Italian politics.

In the [[2006 Italian general election|2006 general election]], the final election to which the party participated with its own list, AN won 12.3% of the vote, securing 71 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 41 in the Senate. In the [[2008 Italian general election|2008 general election]] the party had 90 deputies&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Fiamma Nirenstein]], [[Alessandro Ruben]] and [[Souad Sbai]], whose election was supported both by Forza Italia and National Alliance, http://download.alleanzanazionale.it/Elezioni2008/DeputatiPDLinXVIlegislatura.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and 48 senators&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.alleanzanazionale.it/Elezioni2008/SenatoriPDLinXVILEGISLATURA.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121084433/http://download.alleanzanazionale.it/Elezioni2008/SenatoriPDLinXVILEGISLATURA.pdf|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; elected.
