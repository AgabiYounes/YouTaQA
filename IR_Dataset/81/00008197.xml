'''Desmond John Morris''' [[Fellow of the Linnean Society|FLS ''hon. caus.''']] (born 24 January 1928) is an English [[Zoology|zoologist]], [[Ethology|ethologist]] and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painter, as well as a popular author in human [[sociobiology]]. He is known for his 1967 book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'', and for his television programmes such as ''Zoo Time''.

==Early life==
Morris was born in [[Purton]], [[Wiltshire]], to Marjorie (née Hunt) and children's fiction author Harry Morris. In 1933, the Morrises moved to [[Swindon]] where Desmond developed an interest in [[natural history]] and writing. He was educated at [[Dauntsey's School]], a boarding school in Wiltshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Williams, D. |title=Desmond Morris Biography| url=http://www.desmond-morris.com/biography.php| publisher=Desmond-morris.com| accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, he joined the [[British Army]] for two years of [[national service]], becoming a lecturer in [[fine arts]] at the [[Chiseldon|Chiseldon Army College]]. After being demobilised in 1948, he held his first one-man show of his own paintings at the [[Swindon Arts Centre]], and studied [[zoology]] at the [[University of Birmingham]]. In 1950 he held a surrealist art exhibition with [[Joan Miró]] at the London Gallery. He held many other exhibitions in later years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; Also in 1950, Desmond Morris wrote and directed two surrealist films, ''Time Flower'' and ''The Butterfly and the Pin''. In 1951 he began a doctorate at the [[Department of Zoology, University of Oxford]] in [[animal behaviour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; In 1954, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] for his work on the reproductive behaviour of the ten-spined [[stickleback]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/24/the-naked-ape-at-50-desmond-morris-four-experts-assess-impact|title=The Naked Ape at 50|last=Dunbar|first=Robin|date=24 September 2017|website=Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Morris stayed at Oxford, researching the reproductive behaviour of birds. In 1956 he moved to London as Head of the [[Granada TV]] and Film Unit for the [[Zoological Society of London]], and studied the picture-making abilities of apes.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; The work included creating programmes for film and television on animal behaviour and other zoology topics. He hosted Granada TV's weekly ''[[Zoo Time]]'' programme until 1959, scripting and hosting 500 programmes, and 100 episodes of the show ''Life in the Animal World'' for [[BBC Two|BBC2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; In 1957 he organised an exhibition at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London, showing paintings and drawings composed by [[common chimpanzee]]s. In 1958 he co-organised an exhibition, ''The Lost Image'', which compared pictures by infants, human adults, and apes, at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London. In 1959 he left ''[[Zoo Time]]'' to become the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]'s Curator of Mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; In 1964 he delivered the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''Animal Behaviour''. In 1967 he spent a year as executive director of the London [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt;

Morris's books include ''[[The Naked Ape|The Naked Ape: A Zoologist's Study of the Human Animal]]'',{{sfn|Morris|1967|p=}} published in 1967. The book sold well enough for Morris to move to [[Malta]] in 1968 to write a sequel and other books. In 1973 he returned to Oxford to work for the ethologist [[Niko Tinbergen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Romano Harré|Harré, R.]] (2006). &quot;Chapter 5: The Biopsychologists&quot;. ''Key Thinkers in Psychology'', pp. 125-132. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1973 to 1981, Morris was a Research Fellow at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sirc&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sirc.org/about/desmond_morris.html | title=Desmond Morris | publisher=[[Social Issues Research Centre]] | accessdate=1 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he undertook a television series for [[Thames TV]], ''The Human Race'', followed in 1982 by ''Man Watching in Japan'', ''The Animals Road Show'' in 1986 and then several other series.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; [[National Life Stories]] conducted an oral history interview (C1672/16) with Desmond Morris in 2015 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.&lt;ref name=oralhistory&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Science/021M-C1672X0016XX-0001V0 National Life Stories, 'Morris, Desmond (1 of 2) National Life Stories Collection: Science and Religion', The British Library Board, 2015].  Retrieved 9 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
When Morris was 14, his father was killed whilst serving in the armed forces, causing Morris to drift towards surrealism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=My family values: Desmond Morris interview| newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/01/desmond-morris-family-values | accessdate=28 November 2012 | first=Alice | last=Douglas | date=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His grandfather William Morris, an enthusiastic [[Victorian era|Victorian]] naturalist and founder of the Swindon local newspaper,&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt; greatly influenced him during his time living in Swindon.

In July 1952, Morris married Ramona Baulch; they had one son, Jason.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmbiography&quot;/&gt;  In 1978, Morris was elected Vice-Chairman of [[Oxford United F.C.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
