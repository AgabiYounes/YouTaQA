{{infobox dysprosium}}
'''Dysprosium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Dy''' and [[atomic number]] 66. It is a [[rare earth element]] with a metallic silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as [[xenotime]]. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s, the most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of which is &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy.

Dysprosium was first identified in 1886 by [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of [[ion exchange]] techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal neutron absorption cross-section in making control rods in [[nuclear reactor]]s, for its high [[magnetic susceptibility]] (&lt;math&gt;\chi_v \approx 5.44 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;) in data storage applications, and as a component of [[Terfenol-D]] (a magnetostrictive material). Soluble dysprosium salts are mildly toxic, while the insoluble salts are considered non-toxic.

===Physical properties===
[[Image:Dysprosium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|left|Dysprosium sample]]
Dysprosium is a [[rare earth element]] that has a metallic, bright silver luster. It is quite soft, and can be machined without sparking if overheating is avoided. Dysprosium's physical characteristics can be greatly affected by even small amounts of impurities.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| editor = Lide, David R.| chapter = Dysprosium| year = 2007–2008| title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics| volume = 4| pages = 11| location = New York| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-0488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysprosium and [[holmium]] have the highest magnetic strengths of the elements,&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt; especially at low temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;krebs&quot;/&gt; Dysprosium has a simple [[ferromagnetic]] ordering at temperatures below {{convert|85|K|C}}. Above {{convert|85|K|C}}, it turns into a helical [[antiferromagnetic]] state in which all of the atomic moments in a particular [[basal plane]] layer are parallel, and oriented at a fixed angle to the moments of adjacent layers. This unusual antiferromagnetism transforms into a disordered ([[paramagnetic]]) state at {{convert|179|K|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = IRM Quarterly|year = 2000|volume = 10|issue = 3|page = 6|author = Jackson, Mike|url = http://www.irm.umn.edu/quarterly/irmq10-3.pdf|title = Wherefore Gadolinium?

===Chemical properties===
Dysprosium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form [[dysprosium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Dy + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Dysprosium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water (and quite quickly with hot water) to form dysprosium hydroxide:
:2 Dy (s) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 Dy(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Dysprosium metal vigorously reacts with all the halogens at above 200&amp;nbsp;°C:
:2 Dy (s) + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [green]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [white]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 DyBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [white]
:2 Dy (s) + 3 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 DyI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [green]

Dysprosium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing the yellow Dy(III) ions, which exist as a [Dy(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/dysprosium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Dysprosium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Dy (s) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → 2 Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 3 {{chem|SO|4|2-}} (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

The resulting compound, dysprosium(III) sulfate, is noticeably paramagnetic.

===Compounds===
[[File:Dysprosium-sulfate.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Dysprosium sulfate, Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
{{See also|:Category:Dysprosium compounds|l1=Dysprosium compounds}}
Dysprosium halides, such as DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DyBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, tend to take on a yellow color. [[Dysprosium(III) oxide|Dysprosium oxide]], also known as dysprosia, is a white powder that is highly [[magnetic]], more so than iron oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;krebs&quot;/&gt;

Dysprosium combines with various non-metals at high temperatures to form binary compounds with varying composition and oxidation states +3 and sometimes +2, such as DyN, DyP, DyH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and DyH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; DyS, DyS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Dy&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;; DyB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DyB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, DyB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and DyB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as Dy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C and Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=patnaik/&gt;

Dysprosium carbonate, Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and dysprosium sulfate, Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, result from similar reactions.&lt;ref name=heiserman/&gt; Most dysprosium compounds are soluble in water, though dysprosium carbonate tetrahydrate (Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and dysprosium oxalate decahydrate (Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) are both insoluble in water.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = Handbook of Inorganic Compounds |author=Perry, D.

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of dysprosium}}
Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;156&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;158&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;160&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;161&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;162&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, &lt;sup&gt;163&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, and &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy. These are all considered stable, although &lt;sup&gt;156&lt;/sup&gt;Dy can theoretically undergo [[alpha decay]] with a half-life of over 1×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years. Of the naturally occurring isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;164&lt;/sup&gt;Dy is the most [[natural abundance|abundant]] at 28%, followed by &lt;sup&gt;162&lt;/sup&gt;Dy at 26%. The least abundant is &lt;sup&gt;156&lt;/sup&gt;Dy at 0.06%.{{NUBASE2016|ref}}

Twenty-nine [[radioisotopes]] have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, with a [[half-life]] of approximately 3{{e|6}}&amp;nbsp;years, followed by &lt;sup&gt;159&lt;/sup&gt;Dy with a half-life of 144.4&amp;nbsp;days. The least stable is &lt;sup&gt;138&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, with a half-life of 200&amp;nbsp;ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by [[Beta decay#β− decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. However, &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Dy and &lt;sup&gt;159&lt;/sup&gt;Dy decay primarily by [[electron capture]].{{NUBASE2016|name}} Dysprosium also has at least 11 [[metastable isomer]]s, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is &lt;sup&gt;165m&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, which has a half-life of 1.257&amp;nbsp;minutes. &lt;sup&gt;149&lt;/sup&gt;Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, &lt;sup&gt;149m2&lt;/sup&gt;Dy, has a half-life of 28&amp;nbsp;ns.{{NUBASE2016|name}}

==History==
In 1878, [[erbium]] ores were found to contain the oxides of [[holmium]] and [[thulium]]. French chemist [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], while working with [[holmium oxide]], separated dysprosium oxide from it in [[Paris]] in 1886.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeKosky&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title = Spectroscopy and the Elements in the Late Nineteenth Century: The Work of Sir William Crookes|first = Robert K.|last = DeKosky|journal = The British Journal for the History of Science|volume = 6|issue = 4|date = 1973|pages = 400–423|jstor = 4025503|doi = 10.1017/S0007087400012553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Comptes Rendus|volume = 143|pages = 1003–1006|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3058f/f1001.chemindefer|title = L'holmine (ou terre X de M Soret) contient au moins deux radicaux métallique (Holminia contains at least two metal)|language = French|year = 1886|author = de Boisbaudran, Paul Émile Lecoq}}&lt;/ref&gt; His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid, then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide. He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure. On succeeding, he named the element ''dysprosium'' from the Greek ''dysprositos'' (δυσπρόσιτος), meaning &quot;hard to get&quot;. The element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by [[Frank Spedding]] at [[Iowa State University]] in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=nbb&gt;{{cite book|last = Emsley| first = John| title = Nature's Building Blocks| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2001| location = Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA131|pages = 129–132| isbn = 978-0-19-850341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weeks |first1=Mary Elvira |title=The discovery of the elements |date=1956 |publisher=Journal of Chemical Education |location=Easton, PA |url=https://archive.org/details/discoveryoftheel002045mbp |edition=6th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its role in permanent magnets used for wind turbines, it has been argued that dysprosium will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running on renewable energy. But this perspective has been criticised for failing to recognise that most wind turbines do not use permanent magnets and for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2019-03-01|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|volume=49|pages=36–40|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klinger&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klinger |first1=Julie Michelle |title=Rare earth frontiers : from terrestrial subsoils to lunar landscapes |date=2017 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=978-1501714603 |jstor=10.7591/j.ctt1w0dd6d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
[[Image:Xenotímio1.jpeg|thumb|Xenotime]]
While dysprosium is never encountered as a free element, it is found in many [[mineral]]s, including [[xenotime]], [[fergusonite]], [[gadolinite]], [[euxenite]], [[polycrase]], [[blomstrandine]], [[monazite]] and [[bastnäsite]], often with [[erbium]] and [[holmium]] or other rare earth elements. No dysprosium-dominant mineral (that is, with dysprosium prevailing over other rare earths in the composition) has yet been found.&lt;ref&gt;

In the high-[[yttrium]] version of these, dysprosium happens to be the most abundant of the heavy [[lanthanide]]s, comprising up to 7–8% of the concentrate (as compared to about 65% for yttrium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Russian Journal of Non-Ferrous Metals|year = 2008|volume = 49|issue = 1|pages = 14–22|title = Review of the World Market of Rare-Earth Metals|first = A.

==Production==
Dysprosium is obtained primarily from [[monazite]] sand, a mixture of various [[phosphate]]s. The metal is obtained as a by-product in the commercial extraction of yttrium. In isolating dysprosium, most of the unwanted metals can be removed magnetically or by a [[flotation process]]. Dysprosium can then be separated from other rare earth metals by an [[ion exchange]] displacement process. The resulting dysprosium ions can then react with either [[fluorine]] or [[chlorine]] to form dysprosium fluoride, DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or dysprosium chloride, DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These compounds can be reduced using either calcium or lithium metals in the following reactions:&lt;ref name=heiserman&gt;{{cite book|title = Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|author = Heiserman, David L.|pages = [https://archive.org/details/exploringchemica01heis/page/236 236]–238|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 978-0-8306-3018-9|year = 1992|url = https://archive.org/details/exploringchemica01heis|url-access = registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 Ca + 2 DyF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Dy + 3 CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:3 Li + DyCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Dy + 3 LiCl

The components are placed in a [[tantalum]] crucible and fired in a [[helium]] atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate due to differences in density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.&lt;ref name=heiserman/&gt;

About 100 tonnes of dysprosium are produced worldwide each year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysprosium (Dy) - Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects|url=http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Dy-en.htm|website=|publisher=Lenntech Water treatment &amp; air purification Holding B.V.|year=2008|accessdate=2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 99% of that total produced in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradsher, Keith&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/business/global/30smuggle.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;emc=eta1 |title=In China, Illegal Rare Earth Mines Face Crackdown |author=Bradsher, Keith |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysprosium prices have climbed nearly twentyfold, from $7 per pound in 2003, to $130 a pound in late 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradsher, Keith&quot;/&gt; The price increased to $1,400/kg in 2011 but fell to $240 in 2015, largely due to illegal production in China which circumvented government restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2016-raree.pdf Rare Earths] [https://web.archive.org/web/20160506184123/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2016-raree.pdf archive].

[[Neodymium]]–iron–boron [[Neodymium magnet|magnets]] can have up to 6% of the neodymium substituted by dysprosium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|title = Modeling of magnetic properties of heat treated Dy-doped NdFeBparticles bonded in isotropic and anisotropic arrangements|last = Shi|first = Fang, X.|year = 1998|volume = 34|issue = 4|pages = 1291–1293|doi = 10.1109/20.706525|last2 = Shi|first2 = Y.|last3 = Jiles|first3 = D.

Dysprosium is used in [[dosimeter]]s for measuring [[ionizing radiation]]. Crystals of [[calcium sulfate]] or [[calcium fluoride]] are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become [[excited state|excited]] and [[luminescent]]. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;

Nanofibers of dysprosium compounds have high strength and a large surface area. Therefore, they can be used to reinforce other materials and act as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of DyBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NaF to 450&amp;nbsp;°C at 450 bars for 17 hours. This material is remarkably robust, surviving over 100 hours in various aqueous solutions at temperatures exceeding 400&amp;nbsp;°C without redissolving or aggregating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pnl.gov/supercriticalfluid/tech_oxidation.stm |title=Supercritical Water Oxidation/Synthesis|publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|accessdate=2009-06-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420144601/http://www.pnl.gov/supercriticalfluid/tech_oxidation.stm |archivedate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://availabletechnologies.pnl.gov/technology.asp?id=152|title=Rare Earth Oxide Fluoride: Ceramic Nano-particles via a Hydrothermal Method|publisher=Pacific Northwest National Laboratory|accessdate=2009-06-06|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527103533/http://availabletechnologies.pnl.gov/technology.asp?id=152|archivedate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unusual dysprosium ceramic nano-fiber growth in a supercritical aqueous solution|author1=Hoffman, M.M. |author2=Young, J.S. |author3=Fulton, J.L. |journal= J.

Dysprosium iodide and dysprosium bromide are used in high-intensity [[metal-halide lamp]]s. These compounds dissociate near the hot center of the lamp, releasing isolated dysprosium atoms. The latter re-emit light in the green and red part of the spectrum, thereby effectively producing bright light.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gray&gt;{{cite book|title = The Elements|author = Gray, Theodore|pages = [https://archive.org/details/elementsvisualex0000gray/page/152 152–153]|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1-57912-814-2|publisher = Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers|url = https://archive.org/details/elementsvisualex0000gray/page/152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trivalent dysprosium ion (Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) has been studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This idea is the basis for a new generation of UV-pumped white light emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carreira|first1=J. F.

Like many powders, dysprosium powder may present an explosion hazard when mixed with air and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by [[static electricity]]. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water.

Soluble dysprosium salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. Based on the toxicity of dysprosium chloride to [[mice]], it is estimated that the ingestion of 500&amp;nbsp;grams or more could be fatal to a human. The insoluble salts, however, are non-toxic.&lt;ref name=nbb/&gt;
