The '''Denver Broncos''' are a professional [[American football]] franchise based in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]].  The Broncos compete as a member club of the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division. The team began play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|merger]] in 1970. The Broncos are owned by the [[Pat Bowlen]] trust and currently play home games at [[Empower Field at Mile High]] (formerly known as [[Invesco]] Field at Mile High from 2001–2010, [[Sports Authority]] Field at Mile High from 2011–2017, and Broncos Stadium at Mile High from 2018–2019). Prior to that, they played at [[Mile High Stadium]] from 1960 to 2000.

The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL. They did not have a winning season until [[1973 Denver Broncos season|1973]]. In [[1977 Denver Broncos season|1977]], four years later, they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to [[Super Bowl XII]]. Since 1975, the Broncos have become one of the NFL's most successful teams, having suffered only seven losing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/|title=Denver Broncos Team Encyclopedia – Pro-Football-Reference.com|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have won eight [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]] ({{nfly|1977}}, {{nfly|1986}}, {{nfly|1987}}, {{nfly|1989}}, {{nfly|1997}}, {{nfly|1998}}, {{nfly|2013}}, {{nfly|2015}}), and three [[List of Super Bowl champions|Super Bowl]] championships ({{nfly|1997}} ([[Super Bowl XXXII|XXXII]]), {{nfly|1998}} ([[Super Bowl XXXIII|XXXIII]]), {{nfly|2015}} ([[Super Bowl 50|50]])), and share the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses (5 — tied with the [[New England Patriots]]). Thirteen players who have played for Denver are enshrined in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]: [[John Elway]], [[Floyd Little]], [[Shannon Sharpe]], [[Gary Zimmerman]], [[Willie Brown (American football)|Willie Brown]], [[Tony Dorsett]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Andre Reed]], [[Terrell Davis]], [[Brian Dawkins]], [[Ty Law]], [[Champ Bailey]] and [[Steve Atwater]], along with late club owner [[Pat Bowlen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver Broncos Hall of Famers|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/denver-broncos/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ProFootballHOF.com|access-date=May 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|List of Denver Broncos seasons}}

===1960–1969: AFL era===
The '''Denver Broncos''' were founded on August 14, 1959, when [[Minor League Baseball]] owner [[Bob Howsam]] was awarded an [[American Football League]] (AFL) charter franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;profootballhof1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver Broncos Team Facts|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/denver-broncos/team-facts/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ProFootballHOF.com|access-date=February 10, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos won the first-ever AFL game over the [[1960 Boston Patriots season|Boston Patriots]] 13–10, on September 9, 1960. On August 5, [[1967 AFL season|1967]], they became the first-ever AFL team to defeat an [[National Football League|NFL]] team, with a 13–7 win over the [[1967 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] in a preseason game.&lt;ref name=&quot;profootballhof1&quot;/&gt; However, the Broncos were not successful in the 1960s, compiling a record of 39–97–4 during their ten-season run in the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conigliofamily.com/Broncos.htm |title=Denver Broncos: American Football League Charter Members |work=Conigliofamily.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denver came close to losing its franchise in [[1965 Denver Broncos season|1965]], until a local ownership group took control and rebuilt the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/denver_broncos/team_history.html |title=Denver Broncos Team History |work=NFLteamhistory.com |accessdate=November 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003111245/http://www.nflteamhistory.com/nfl_teams/denver_broncos/team_history.html |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's first superstar, &quot;Franchise&quot; [[Floyd Little]], was instrumental in keeping the team in Denver, due to his signing in [[1967 Denver Broncos season|1967]] as well as his [[Pro Bowl]] efforts on and off the field. The Broncos were the only original AFL team that never played in the title game, as well as the only original AFL team never to have a winning season while a member of the AFL during the upstart league's 10-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den |title=Denver Broncos Team Encyclopedia – Pro Football Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–1982===
In 1972, the Broncos hired former [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] coach [[John Ralston (coach)|John Ralston]] as their [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]]. In [[1973 Denver Broncos season|1973]], he was the [[United Press International|UPI]]'s [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Coach of the Year, after Denver achieved its first winning season at 7–5–2. In five seasons with the Broncos, Ralston guided the team to winning seasons three times. Though Ralston finished the [[1976 Denver Broncos season|1976]] season with a 9–5 record, the team, as was the case in Ralston's previous winning seasons, still missed the playoffs. Following the season, several prominent players publicly voiced their discontent with Ralston, which soon led to his resignation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BroncosSportsE-Cyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/denver/broncos.html |title=Sports E-Cyclopedia – Denver Broncos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red Miller]], a long-time assistant coach was hired and along with the [[Orange Crush Defense]] (a nickname originated in 1977, also the brand of [[Orange Crush|the popular orange-flavored soft drink]]) and aging [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] [[Craig Morton]], took the Broncos to what was then a record-setting 12–2 regular season record and their first playoff appearance in [[1977 Denver Broncos season|1977]], and ultimately first [[Super Bowl XII]], in which they were defeated by the [[1977 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] (Morton's former team), 27–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/1977.htm |title=1977 Denver Broncos Statistics|publisher=Pro Football Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1981 Denver Broncos season|1981]], Broncos' owner [[Gerald Phipps]], who had purchased the team in May 1961 from the original owner [[Bob Howsam]], sold the team to Canadian financier [[Edgar Kaiser Jr.]], grandson of shipbuilding industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paton, James|title=Clock runs out for ex-Broncos owner |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/ex-broncos-owner-denied-chance-buy-back-team|newspaper=Rocky Mountain News|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004110729/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/02/ex-broncos-owner-denied-chance-buy-back-team/ |archivedate=October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1984 Denver Broncos season|1984]], the team was purchased by [[Pat Bowlen]], who placed team ownership into a family trust sometime before [[2004 Denver Broncos season|2004]] and remained in day-to-day control until his battle with [[Alzheimer's disease]] forced him to cede the team to [[Joe Ellis]] in [[2014 Denver Broncos season|2014]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BowlenSteppingBack&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BroncosOwner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Klis, Mike&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Klis|first=Mike|title=Pat Bowlen resigns control of Denver Broncos, acknowledges he is dealing with Alzheimer's disease|url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26199148/pat-bowlen-resigns-control-denver-broncos-acknowledges-dealing-alzheimers-disease|newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date=July 23, 2014|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983–1998: John Elway era===
[[Dan Reeves]] became the youngest head coach in the [[National Football League|NFL]] when he joined the Broncos in [[1981 Denver Broncos season|1981]] as vice president and [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]]. [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|Quarterback]] [[John Elway]], who played college football at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]], arrived in [[1983 Denver Broncos season|1983]] via a trade. Originally drafted by the [[Baltimore Colts]] as the first pick of the [[1983 NFL draft|draft]], Elway proclaimed that he would shun football in favor of [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] (he was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] to play [[Center fielder|center field]] and was also a pitching prospect), unless he was traded to a selected list of other teams, which included the Broncos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/elway/timeline.html |title=John Elway Timeline |work=The Sporting News |accessdate=November 28, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920140523/http://www.sportingnews.com/archives/elway/timeline.html |archivedate=September 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Elway, the Broncos had over 24 different starting quarterbacks in its 23 seasons to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football.com/nfl/denverbroncos/index.html|title=Denver Broncos|work=Football.com|accessdate=November 28, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605052411/http://www.football.com/nfl/denverbroncos/index.html|archivedate=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 48 - Sammy Winder.jpg|left|thumb|John Elway (''right'') hands the ball for a rushing play against the Packers in 1984.]]
Reeves and Elway guided the Broncos to six post-season appearances, five [[AFC West]] divisional titles, three [[American Football Conference|AFC]] championships and three [[Super Bowl]] appearances (Super Bowl XXI, XXII and XXIV) during their 12-year span together. The Broncos lost [[Super Bowl XXI]] to the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], 39–20; [[Super Bowl XXII]] to the [[1987 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], 42–10; and [[Super Bowl XXIV]] to the [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], 55–10; the latter score remains the most lopsided scoring differential in Super Bowl history. The last year of the Reeves-Elway era were marked by feuding, due to Reeves taking on play-calling duties after ousting Elway's favorite offensive coordinator [[Mike Shanahan]] after the [[1991 Denver Broncos season|1991]] season, as well as Reeves drafting quarterback [[Tommy Maddox]] out of [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] instead of going with a [[wide receiver]] to help Elway. Reeves was fired after the [[1992 Denver Broncos season|1992]] season and replaced by his protégé and friend [[Wade Phillips]], who had been serving as the Broncos' defensive coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/coach_killers/john_elway_dan_reeves.html|title=RealClearSports – Top 10 Coach Killers – John Elway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/413764-mile-high-feud-john-elway-and-mike-shanahan-still-have-a-beef-but-why#articles/413764-mile-high-feud-john-elway-and-mike-shanahan-still-have-a-beef-but-why|title=Mile High Feud: John Elway and Mike Shanahan Still Have a Beef, but Why?|author=Reid Brooks|work=Bleacher Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsillustrated.cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/1998/playoffs/news/1999/01/24/superbowl_feud/ |title=Reeves' comments rekindle feud with Elway, Shanahan|work=CNN/SI | date=January 24, 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622064747/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/1998/playoffs/news/1999/01/24/superbowl_feud/|archivedate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips was fired after a mediocre [[1994 Denver Broncos season|1994]] season, in which management felt he lost control of the team.

In [[1995 Denver Broncos season|1995]], [[Mike Shanahan]], who had formerly served under Reeves as the Broncos' offensive coordinator, returned as head coach. Shanahan drafted rookie [[running back]] [[Terrell Davis]]. In [[1996 Denver Broncos season|1996]], the Broncos were the top seed in the AFC with a 13–3 record, dominating most of the teams that year. The fifth-seeded [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], however, upset the Broncos 30–27 in the divisional round of the playoffs, ending the Broncos' 1996 run.&lt;ref name=&quot;BroncosSportsE-Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

====1997–1998: Back-to-Back Super Bowl Champions====
During the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|1997]] season, Elway and Davis helped guide the Broncos to their first Super Bowl victory, a 31–24 win over the defending champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. Though Elway completed only 13 of 22 passes, throwing one interception and no touchdowns (he did, however, have a rushing touchdown), Davis rushed for 157 yards and a Super Bowl–record three touchdowns to earn the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award]]—this while overcoming a severe migraine headache that caused him blurred vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl XXXII box score|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbxxxii|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=SuperBowl.com|access-date=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos repeated as Super Bowl champions the following season, defeating the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] (led by Elway's longtime head coach [[Dan Reeves]]) in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], 34–19. Elway was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, with an 80-yard touchdown to wide receiver [[Rod Smith (wide receiver)|Rod Smith]] and one interception.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsillustrated.cnn.com&quot;/&gt;

===1999–2011: Post-Elway era===
[[File:Jaycutler.JPG|thumb|200px|Broncos' quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] in 2007.]]
John Elway retired following the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998]] season, and [[Brian Griese]] started at [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] for the next four seasons. After a 6–10 record in [[1999 Denver Broncos season|1999]], the Broncos recovered in [[2000 Denver Broncos season|2000]], earning a Wild Card playoff berth, but losing to the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] champion [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, former [[Arizona Cardinals]]' quarterback [[Jake Plummer]] replaced Griese in [[2003 Denver Broncos season|2003]], and led the Broncos to two straight 10–6 seasons, earning Wild Card playoff berths both years. However, the Broncos went on the road to face the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in back-to-back seasons and were blown out by more than 20 points in each game, allowing a combined 90 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;BroncosSportsE-Cyclopedia&quot;/&gt;

Jake Plummer led the Broncos to a 13–3 record in [[2005 Denver Broncos season|2005]] and their first [[AFC West]] division title since 1998. After a first-round [[Bye (sports)|bye]], the Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], 27–13, denying New England from becoming the first [[National Football League|NFL]] team ever to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships and they were the first team to beat the Patriots in the playoffs during the Tom Brady era. The Broncos' playoff run came to an end the next week, after losing at home to the [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the AFC Championship game, 34–17. The Steelers went on to win [[Super Bowl XL]].

The Broncos' defense began the first five games of the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|2006]] season allowing only one touchdown—an NFL record that still stands, ESPN commentator and Super Bowl winning QB Joe Theismann gave  that 2006 Denver Defense the name Bad Blue on Monday night football Broncos vs. Ravens but the team struggled down the season stretch. Plummer led the team to a 7–2 record, only to struggle and be replaced by rookie quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]. Cutler went 2–3 as a starter, and the Broncos finished with a 9–7 record, losing the tiebreaker to the [[2006 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] for the final playoff spot. Cutler's first full season as a starter in [[2007 Denver Broncos season|2007]] became the Broncos' first losing season since 1999, with a 7–9 record.

==Rivalries==

===Divisional===
{{see also|American Football League}}

The Denver Broncos have three [[AFC West]] rivals—the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Las Vegas Raiders]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers]]. All teams, along with the Broncos, were charter members of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), with each team placed in the AFL Western Division. The Broncos were barely competitive during the AFL years (1960–69), going a combined 10–49–1 against the Chiefs, Chargers and Raiders.

====Kansas City Chiefs====
{{Further|Broncos–Chiefs rivalry}}
The Broncos have had several memorable matchups with the Chiefs, particularly during the years in which [[John Elway]] was the Broncos' starting [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] (1983–98). The Broncos defeated the Chiefs at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in the divisional round of the [[1997–98 NFL playoffs|1997 NFL playoffs]], en route to their first [[Super Bowl XXXII|Super Bowl]] victory. The Chiefs currently hold a '''65–55''' series lead over the Broncos, including the aforementioned 1997 divisional playoff game.

====Las Vegas Raiders====
{{Further|Broncos–Raiders rivalry}}

The rivalry with the Raiders was ignited in {{nfly|1977}}, when the Broncos advanced to their first [[Super Bowl XII|Super Bowl]] by defeating the defending champion Raiders in the [[1977–78 NFL playoffs|1977 AFC Championship]]. The rivalry intensified in the mid-1990s, when [[Mike Shanahan]] was hired as the Broncos' [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]] in [[1995 Denver Broncos season|1995]]. Shanahan coached the Raiders in {{nfly|1988}} before being fired four games into the {{nfly|1989}} season. The Raiders currently hold a '''65–53–2''' series lead over the Broncos, including 1–1 in the playoffs.

====Los Angeles Chargers====
{{Further|Broncos–Chargers rivalry}}

Unlike their records against the Chiefs and Raiders, the Broncos currently have a winning record against the Chargers, with a '''68–52–1''' series lead, including 1–0 in the playoffs. The Broncos pulled off one of the largest comebacks in [[Monday Night Football]] history, when [[Peyton Manning]] led the Broncos from a 24–0 halftime deficit to a 35–24 win at [[San Diego]]'s [[Qualcomm Stadium]] during the {{nfly|2012}} season. The two teams met in the playoffs for the first time on January 12, 2014, at [[Denver]]'s [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]], with the Broncos winning 24–17.

====Seattle Seahawks====
The Broncos had an old rivalry with the [[Seattle Seahawks]], who were members of the [[AFC West]] from 1977 to 2001, prior to the Seahawks' move to the [[NFC West]] as part of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s {{nfly|2002}} re-alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Banks, Don |title=Seattle moved to NFC in approved realignment plan |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2001/05/22/banks_realign/ |work=Sports Illustrated |date=May 22, 2001 |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 25 years in which the Seahawks resided in the AFC West, the Broncos went 32–18 against the Seahawks, including a loss at Seattle in the [[1983–84 NFL playoffs|1983 NFL playoffs]]. Since 2002, the Broncos have won three of five interconference meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=den&amp;tm2=sea&amp;yr=all |title=Boxscore finder: Denver Broncos vs Seattle Seahawks – Pro-Football-Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two teams met in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] on February 2, 2014, with the Seahawks winning by a score of 43–8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenthal|first=Gregg|title=Seattle Seahawks stomp Broncos for Super Bowl win|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000322899/article/seattle-seahawks-stomp-broncos-for-super-bowl-win|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 2, 2014|access-date=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Aside from the aforementioned [[AFC West]] teams, the Broncos have had intra-conference rivalries over the years with the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[New England Patriots]].

====Cleveland Browns====
{{see also|The Drive|The Fumble}}

The Broncos had a brief rivalry with the Browns that arose from three [[American Football Conference|AFC]] championship matches in 1986, 1987 and 1989. In the [[1986–87 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 23, Cleveland Browns 20 (OT)|1986 AFC Championship]], [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] [[John Elway]] led ''[[The Drive]]'' to secure a tie in the waning moments at [[Cleveland Municipal Stadium]]; the Broncos went on to win in 23–20 in overtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carter, Bob |title=Elway led Broncos on &quot;The Drive&quot; |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_elway_john.html |work=ESPN |date=July 5, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, the two teams met again in the [[1987–88 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 38, Cleveland Browns 33|1987 AFC Championship]] at [[Mile High Stadium]]. Denver took a 21–3 lead, but Browns' quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31–31 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Sammy Winder]] to give Denver a 38–31 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety [[Jeremiah Castille]] stripped Browns' running back [[Earnest Byner]] of the football at the 2-yard line—a play that has been called ''[[The Fumble]]'' by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38–33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Reilly, Rick |title=Byner's fumble spoils Browns shot at 1987 AFC Championship glory |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/painful_moments_in_sports/09/09/Earnest.Byner.Browns/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |date=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two teams met yet again in the [[1989–90 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Denver Broncos 37, Cleveland Browns 21|1989 AFC Championship]] at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37–21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Heisler, Mark |title=This Time, Just Call It Elway : AFC championship: Bronco quarterback is at his best in 37–21 victory over Browns as Denver earns its third trip to the Super Bowl in four seasons. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-15/sports/sp-257_1_super-bowl-xxiv |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 15, 1990 |accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos did not win the Super Bowl after any of the championship games where they defeated the Browns, losing by an aggregate of 136–40.

====Pittsburgh Steelers====
As of the end of the {{nfly|2015}} season, the Broncos and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] have met in postseason play eight times, tied with five other pairings for the second–[[List of NFL playoff games#Most frequent matchups|most frequent playoff matchups]] in [[National Football League|NFL]] playoff history.

Eight years later, the Steelers returned the favor at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|INVESCO Field at Mile High]], defeating the Broncos 34–17 in the [[2005–06 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship: Pittsburgh Steelers 34, Denver Broncos 17|2005 AFC Championship]], and subsequently won [[Super Bowl XL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Andrew|title=Recalling the 2005 AFC Title Game|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/recalling-the-2005-afc-title-game-12462736|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=January 17, 2014|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Wild Card round of the [[2011–12 NFL playoffs|2011 playoffs]], in a game dubbed ''The 3:16 game'', the Broncos stunned the Steelers 29–23 on the first play of overtime, when [[List of Denver Broncos starting quarterbacks|quarterback]] [[Tim Tebow]] connected with [[wide receiver]] [[Demaryius Thomas]] on an 80-yard game-winning touchdown pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Gray|title=Broncos Advance with Postseason Thriller|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-advance-with-postseason-thriller-6775656|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=January 8, 2012|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams met again in the Divisional round of the [[2015–16 NFL playoffs|2015 playoffs]] at Denver, where the Broncos defeated the Steelers 23–16 on their way to a victory in [[Super Bowl 50]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Renck, Troy |title=Peyton Manning, Broncos beat Steelers, punch ticket to AFC championship game |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_29397431/peyton-manning-broncos-beat-steelers-punch-ticket-afc-championship |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=January 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos and uniforms==

===1968–1996===
[[File:Broncos 1968-96 uniforms.png|thumb|left|150px|Denver Broncos uniform set from 1968 to 1996. The logo was designed by Edwin Guy Taylor of Denver. A contest was held through Public Service of Denver to come up with a new logo for the team. Mr. Taylor's submission was selected late in 1967 and adopted soon after. The team briefly wore orange pants with the away jerseys between 1969–1971 and 1978–1979.]]

When the Broncos debuted in {{nfly|1960}}, their original uniforms drew as much attention as their play on the field. They featured white and mustard yellow jerseys, with contrasting brown helmets, brown pants and vertically striped socks. Two years later, the team unveiled a new logo featuring a bucking horse, and changed their team colors to orange, royal blue and white. The {{nfly|1962}} uniform consisted of white pants, orange helmets, and either orange or white jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Saccomano|first=Jim|title=Legend and Legacy: Orange's origin|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/legend-and-legacy-orange-s-origin-14944477|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=February 20, 2015|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|1968}}, the Broncos debuted a design that became known as the &quot;Orange Crush.&quot; Their logo was redesigned so that the horse was coming out of a &quot;D.&quot; Additionally, the helmets were changed to royal blue, with thin stripes placed onto the sleeves, and other minor modifications were added. From 1969 to 1971, and again from 1978 to 1979, the team wore orange pants with their white jerseys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endzone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/white-at-home-in-the-nfl/ |title=White at Home in the NFL – Uni Watch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425040815/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/white-at-home-in-the-nfl/ |archivedate=April 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facemasks became white (from grey) in 1975.

The Broncos wore their white jerseys at home throughout the {{nfly|1971}} season, as well as for {{nfly|1980}} home games vs. the [[San Diego Chargers]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]], the latter in hopes to bring out the &quot;blue jersey jinx&quot; which has followed the Cowboys for decades (it worked, the Broncos won 41–20). The Broncos wore their white jerseys for {{nfly|1983}} home games vs. the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Los Angeles Raiders]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]], but did not wear white at home again for two decades — ''see next section''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endzone&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://endzonesportscharities.org/gunews.htm |title=Endzone's Denver Broncos Game-Used News &amp; Price Guide Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|1994}}, in honor of the 75th anniversary season of the [[National Football League|NFL]], the Broncos wore their {{nfly|1965}} [[throwback uniforms]] for two games—a Week 3 home game against the Raiders, as well a road game at the [[Buffalo Bills]] the following week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endzone&quot;/&gt;

===1997–2011===
The Broncos radically changed their logo and uniforms in {{nfly|1997}}, a design that the team continues to use to this day. The new logos and uniforms were unveiled on February 4, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New uniforms for a new era|url=http://history.denverbroncos.com/1997/02/new-uniforms-for-a-new-era/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=February 4, 1997|access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navy blue replaced royal blue on the team's color scheme. The current logo is a profile of a horse's head, with an orange mane and navy blue outlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012UniformChange&quot;/&gt; The Broncos' popular live animal mascot [[Thunder (mascot)|Thunder]] was the inspiration to incorporate a horse-head profile as part of the logo on the team's helmets.&lt;ref name=Pomeroy&gt;{{cite web|last=Pomeroy|first=L.A.|title=Thunder: Denver's Favorite Bronco |url=http://www.arabianhorses.org/marketplace/mah_articles/MAH_Broncos_Thunder_Dec12.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114152708/http://www.arabianhorses.org/marketplace/mah_articles/MAH_Broncos_Thunder_Dec12.pdf| work=Modern Arabian Horse|publisher=Arabian Horse Association|accessdate=January 26, 2014|archivedate= November 14, 2014 |pages=62–67 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a February 4, 1997 press conference introducing the new logo, the team president and the art director for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], who were the creators of the new design, described it as &quot;a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Broncos unveil new uniform and logo|url=http://www.nfl.com/broncos/news/0204newuni.html|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com/Broncos|date=February 4, 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970419112211/http://www.nfl.com/broncos/news/0204newuni.html|archive-date=April 19, 1997|access-date=June 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Broncos began wearing navy blue jerseys, replacing their longtime orange jerseys that had been the team's predominant home jersey color since 1962. This new uniform design features a new word mark, numbering font and a streak that runs up and down the sides of both the jerseys and the pants. On the navy blue jerseys, the streak is orange, with an orange collar and white numerals trimmed in orange, while on the road white jerseys, the streak is navy blue, with a thin orange accent strip on both sides, a navy collar and navy numerals trimmed in orange; the helmet facemasks became navy blue. When they debuted, these uniforms were vilified by the press and fans, until the Broncos won their first ever [[Super Bowl XXXII|Super Bowl]] in the new design that same season. The navy blue jerseys served as the team's primary home jersey until the end of the {{nfly|2011}} season — ''see next section''.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012UniformChange&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Legan|first=Kenny|title=Orange Crush|url=http://blog.denverbroncos.com/denverbroncos/orange-crush|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=October 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005054511/http://blog.denverbroncos.com/denverbroncos/orange-crush/|archive-date=October 5, 2011|access-date=May 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|2002}}, the Broncos introduced an alternate orange jersey that is a mirror image of the aforementioned navy blue jerseys, but with orange and navy trading places. Like the road white jerseys, the white pants with the navy blue streaks running down the sides are worn with this uniform. This jersey was used only once in the 2002 and {{nfly|2004}} seasons, and were used twice per season from 2008 to 2011. [[Mike Shanahan]], the team's [[List of Denver Broncos head coaches|head coach]] from 1995 to 2008, was not a big fan of the alternate orange jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Broncos' RBs turn in uneven performances |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_15671807 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos previously wore orange jerseys as a throwback uniform in a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] game at the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in {{nfly|2001}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://endzonesportscharities.org/history.htm |title=ESC's Denver Broncos Uniform History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team also introduced navy blue pants in {{nfly|2003}}, with orange side streaks to match with the navy blue jerseys. Though they were part of the uniform change in 1997 (in fact, they were worn for a couple of 1997 preseason games) and most players wanted to wear them, the only player who vetoed wearing them was [[John Elway]], thereby delaying their eventual introduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;2003Uniforms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://endzonesportscharities.org/PDFs/Uni_2003.pdf |title=End Zone Sports Charities}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2011, these pants were primarily used for select prime-time and late-season home games (excluding the {{nfly|2008}} season), and since {{nfly|2012}}, are used exclusively with the now-alternate navy blue jerseys — ''see next section''.

On November 16, 2003, the Broncos wore their white jerseys at home for the first time since {{nfly|1983}}, in a game vs. the [[San Diego Chargers]]. This was compensation for a uniform mix-up, after the teams' first meeting at [[San Diego]]'s [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in Week 2 earlier that season, when the Chargers were the team that was supposed to declare their uniform color. The Chargers were planning to wear their white jerseys, but the visiting Broncos came to the stadium in white, and were fined [[Dollar sign|$]]25,000 by the [[National Football League|NFL]] as a result. When the two teams met at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|INVESCO Field at Mile High]] later that season (Week 11), the NFL allowed the visiting Chargers to choose their uniform color in advance, and they chose navy blue, forcing the Broncos to wear their white jerseys at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;2003Uniforms&quot;/&gt;

In {{nfly|2009}}, in honor of their 50th anniversary season as one of the eight original [[American Football League]] teams, the Broncos wore their 1960 throwback uniforms (brown helmets, mustard yellow and brown jerseys) for games against two fellow AFL rivals—a Week 5 home game vs. the [[New England Patriots]], as well as the following week at the San Diego Chargers.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=NFL announces 2009 AFL 'Legacy Games'|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81029dc6/article/nfl-announces-2009-afl-legacy-games|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=July 19, 2009|access-date=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Klis, Mike |url=http://www.denverpost.com/premium/broncos/ci_13530153 |title=Even if they win, the Broncos figure to look bad in their throwback uniforms Sunday |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012–present===
Beginning in {{nfly|2012}}, the orange jerseys that served as the alternate colored jerseys from 2002 to 2011 became the primary home jersey, while the navy blue jerseys that served as the primary home jersey from 1997 to 2011 switched to alternate designation. The change was made due to overwhelming popularity with the fans, who pressured the Broncos to return to orange as the team's primary home jersey color.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012UniformChange&quot;/&gt; Since the 2012 uniform change, the team has worn the alternate navy blue jerseys for at least one home game per season, with the exception of {{nfly|2013}}, in which the Broncos wore their alternate navy blue uniforms for an October 6, 2013 road game at the [[Dallas Cowboys]], which the Broncos won in a shootout, 51-48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klis|first=Mike|title=Broncos to wear alternate blue uniforms vs. Cowboys in Dallas|url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_24217311/broncos-wear-alternate-blue-uniforms-vs-cowboys-dallas|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=October 1, 2013|access-date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team will either wear the navy blue or the white pants — with the orange side stripes — to match with the alternate navy blue jerseys. The team initially did not wear the white pants with the orange side stripes, until a November 1, 2015 game vs. the [[Green Bay Packers]], in which the Broncos wore said design in order to match the uniform ensemble that was used during the team's [[Super Bowl XXXII]] win over the Packers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Andrew|title=Blue thunder: Broncos to break out blue jerseys against Packers, Raiders|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/blue-thunder-broncos-to-break-out-blue-jerseys-against-packers-raiders-15705441|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=August 20, 2015|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the designated home team in [[Super Bowl 50]], the Broncos — who have an 0–4 [[List of Super Bowl champions|Super Bowl]] record when using their standard orange jerseys — chose to wear their white jerseys as the designated &quot;home&quot; team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Swanson|first=Ben|title=Broncos to wear white uniforms in Super Bowl 50|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-to-wear-white-uniforms-in-super-bowl-50-16746473|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=January 25, 2016|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nfly|2016}}, the Broncos' unveiled a new ''[[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]]'' uniform, which the team wore for a ''[[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]]'' game at the [[2016 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] on October 13, 2016. The uniform kit contained the following features: orange pants, which the team wore for the first time since 1979, orange socks and shoes, along with block-style numerals trimmed in navy blue that mirrored the team's 1968–1996 uniform style. Due to the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s one-helmet rule implemented in 2013, the helmets remained the same, with the team temporarily replacing the modern primary logo with the throwback &quot;D-horse&quot; logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Andrew|title=NFL reveals Color Rush jersey for the Broncos|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/nfl-reveals-color-rush-jersey-for-the-broncos-17676130|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same uniform was used for a Thursday night game against the [[2017 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] during the {{nfly|2017}} season and again during a 2018 game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boniface|first=Daniel|title=What do you think about the Denver Broncos &quot;color rush&quot; uniforms?|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2017/12/13/denver-broncos-color-rush-uniforms/|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=December 13, 2017|access-date=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home field==
[[File:Denver Mile High Stadium postcard (c. 1970s-1980s).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mile High Stadium]] was the home of the Broncos from 1960 to 2000]]
For most of their history, the Denver Broncos played in [[Mile High Stadium]]. The [[American Football League|AFL]] Broncos played at the [[University of Denver]]'s [[DU Stadium|Hilltop Stadium]] from time to time, including the first-ever victory of an AFL team over an [[National Football League|NFL]] team: The Broncos beat the [[Detroit Lions]] on August 5, 1967, in a preseason game. The team has sold out every home game (including post-season games) since the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in {{nfly|1970}}, with the exception of two replacement games during the {{nfly|1987}} strike (but both were sold out before the strike).

During home games, the attendance is announced to the crowd, along with the number of no-shows (the fans subsequently boo the no-shows). The fans are also known to chant &quot;IN-COM-PLETE!&quot; every time the visiting team throws an [[Forward pass|incomplete pass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - FAQs|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/faq|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium's legendary home-field advantage is regarded as one of the best in the NFL, especially during the playoffs. The Broncos had the best home record in pro football over a 32-year span from 1974 to 2006 (191–65–1). Mile High Stadium was one of the NFL's loudest stadiums, with steel flooring instead of [[concrete]], which may have given the Broncos an advantage over opponents, plus the advantage of altitude conditioning for the Broncos. In {{nfly|2001}}, the team moved into then-named [[Empower Field at Mile High|Invesco Field at Mile High]], built next to the former site of the since-demolished Mile High Stadium. Sportswriter [[Woody Paige]], along with many of Denver's fans, however, often refused to call the stadium by its full name, preferring to use &quot;Mile High Stadium&quot; because of its storied history and sentimental import. Additionally, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' had an official policy of referring to the stadium as simply &quot;Mile High Stadium&quot; in protest, but dropped this policy in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/guide/guide-to-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high/ |title=Guide To Sports Authority Field At Mile High |work=CBS Denver |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Invesco Field at Mile High.jpg|left|thumb|[[Empower Field at Mile High]] has been the Broncos' home since 2001]]
Prior to the [[2011 Denver Broncos season|2011]] season, [[Englewood, Colorado|Englewood]]-based [[Sports equipment|sporting goods]] [[retail]]er [[Sports Authority]] claimed the [[naming rights]] of Invesco Field, which became known as '''Sports Authority Field at Mile High'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Gray|title=A New Home|url=http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/A-New-Home/14d4a137-b809-4347-9eef-bfdf909b6106|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=August 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909015239/http://www.denverbroncos.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/A-New-Home/14d4a137-b809-4347-9eef-bfdf909b6106|archive-date=September 9, 2011|access-date=May 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Broncos stadium renamed Sports Authority Field at Mile High|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2011/08/16/broncos-stadium-renamed-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high/|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the summer of 2016, Sports Authority went bankrupt, the stadium was renamed Broncos Stadium at Mile High, and the Broncos sought out a naming rights sponsor until September 2019 when they agreed to rename the stadium '''Empower Field at Mile High'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Worthington, Danika |author2=Wolfe, Cameron |title=Mile High Stadium will get a new naming sponsor after Sports Authority, Broncos chief says |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/07/27/sports-authority-logos-stripped-broncos/ |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The altitude has also been attributed as part of the team's home success. The stadium displays multiple references to the stadium's location of {{convert|5280|ft|mi}} above sea level, including a prominent mural just outside the visiting team's locker room. The team training facility, the UCHealth Training Center (formerly known as the Paul D. Bowlen Memorial Broncos Centre), is a state-of-the-art facility located in [[Dove Valley, Colorado|Dove Valley]]. With {{convert|13.5|acre}} of property, the facility hosts three full-size fields, a complete weight and training facility, and a cafeteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Training Camp|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/nfl/trainingcamp/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denver Broncos and UCHealth announce major health partnership|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/denver-broncos-and-uchealth-announce-major-health-partnership-15542975|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=July 30, 2015|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their more than half-century of existence, the Broncos have never been shut out at home, a streak of over 400 games as of the {{nfly|2016}} season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/den/ |title=Denver Broncos Franchise Encyclopedia – Pro Football Reference |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, the Broncos announced that the stadium would receive $30 million upgrades including a new video board in the south end zone three times larger than the previous display. The renovations were finished before kickoff of the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Gray|title=Broncos Announce Stadium Upgrades|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/news/broncos-announce-stadium-upgrades-9163945|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|date=December 21, 2012|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|List of Denver Broncos broadcasters}}
The Broncos' flagship radio station is currently [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], 850AM, a 50,000-watt station owned by [[iHeartMedia]]. [[Dave Logan (American football)|Dave Logan]] is the play-by-play announcer, with former Broncos' wide receiver [[Ed McCaffrey]] serving as the color commentator beginning in 2012, replacing [[Brian Griese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jones, Lindsay |title=Ed McCaffrey joins KOA Broncos broadcast team |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2012/07/31/ed-mccaffrey-joins-koa-broncos-broadcast-team/14562 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ed McCaffrey was replaced by Rick lewis.  Until 2010, preseason games not selected for airing on national television were shown on [[KCNC-TV|KCNC]], channel 4, which is a [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]], as well as other CBS affiliates around the [[Rocky Mountain]] region. On May 26, 2011, the Broncos announced that [[KUSA-TV|KUSA]] channel 9, an [[NBC]] affiliate also known as '''9NEWS''' in the [[Rocky Mountain]] region, will be the team's new television partner for preseason games.&lt;ref name=&quot;BroadcastPartners&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver Broncos Radio Affiliates|url=https://www.denverbroncos.com/audio/affiliates|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DenverBroncos.com|access-date=May 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Broncos began a partnership with [[KJMN]], 92.1 FM, a leading [[Spanish language]] radio station owned by [[Entravision|Entravision Communications]] (EVC). The partnership also includes broadcasting rights for a half-hour weekly TV show on [[KCEC (TV)|KCEC]], the local [[Univision]] affiliate operated by [[Entravision|Entravision Communications]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BroadcastPartners&quot;/&gt;

==Notable fans and in the media==
* Tim McKernan, a.k.a. [[Barrel Man (Denver Broncos)|Barrel Man]], began wearing a barrel in 1977 after making a $10 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|10|1977|r=-1|fmt=c}} in {{inflation/year|US}}) bet with his brother, Scott, that by wearing one he could get on television. McKernan won the bet, and the barrel he had painted to look like an [[Orange Crush]] soda can became his signature costume, and resulted in him becoming one of the Broncos' most recognized fans and a popular mascot. McKernan died on December 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Espinoza, Annette |title=Tim McKernan, &quot;Barrel Man&quot; to Broncos fans, dies at 69 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_13934615 |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=December 5, 2009 |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The animated television show ''[[South Park]]'', set in [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]], often mentions the Denver Broncos; show creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] both grew up in Colorado as devout Broncos fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ryan|title=Denver Broncos owe success to &quot;South Park&quot; hilariously claim creators Parker and Stone|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/01/24/denver-broncos-owe-success-south-park-hilariously-claim-creators-parker-stone/25685/|newspaper=The Denver Post|date=January 24, 2014|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' season 5 episode [[Cape Feare]], when the family are to be given new identities, Homer imagines himself as John Elway, scoring a (consolation) touchdown against San Francisco. Conversely, in the 1996 episode &quot;[[You Only Move Twice]]&quot;, Hank Scorpio gives Homer Simpson the Denver Broncos as a thank-you gift for helping him. However, Homer complains that he wanted to own the [[Dallas Cowboys]], as the Broncos team that just arrived are playing very sloppy football on his front lawn (a reference to the team losing four Super Bowl appearances, three by significant margins including [[Super Bowl XII]] against Dallas). Incidentally, the Broncos were 13–3 in the 1996 season, and won the Super Bowl the next two seasons. Only two seasons later in the Super Bowl-centric episode &quot;[[Sunday, Cruddy Sunday]]&quot;, Homer chooses Denver as his [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] pick over Moe's choice of the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. In the episode, &quot;[[The Bonfire of the Manatees]]&quot;, Homer picks the Broncos to win the Super Bowl over the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. The two teams later did play against each other in [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] which aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the U.S. home of ''The Simpsons''.
* In the 1979 ''[[Mork &amp; Mindy]]'' episode &quot;Hold That Mork&quot;, Mork's character, played by [[Robin Williams]], became the first male [[Denver Broncos Cheerleaders|cheerleader in Broncos' history]]. As a member of the &quot;Pony Express&quot;, he trotted out on the field at [[Mile High Stadium]] during an actual Broncos' game vs. the [[New England Patriots]] on November 11, 1979. The episode aired exactly two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jhabvala, Nicki |title=Robin Williams, aka &quot;Mork&quot;, made Broncos history as first male cheerleader |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/11/robin-williams-denver-broncos-cheerleader/28744/ |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=August 11, 2014 |accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many former Broncos are now in broadcasting, including [[Shannon Sharpe]], [[Mark Schlereth]], [[Alfred Williams]], [[Tom Jackson (American football, born 1951)|Tom Jackson]], [[Ed McCaffrey]], [[Brian Griese]], [[David Diaz-Infante]], [[Terrell Davis]] and [[Brandon Stokley]]. Some former Broncos work in radio, [[KKFN]] and [[KDFD]] in Denver, Colorado.
