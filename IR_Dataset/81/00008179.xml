A '''dye''' is a [[color|colour]]ed substance that chemically bonds to the [[wikt:substrate|substrate]] to which it is being applied. This distinguishes dyes from pigments which do not chemically bind to the material they colour. The dye is generally applied in an [[aqueous solution]], and may require a [[mordant]] to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Booth|first=Gerald|chapter=Dyes, General Survey|year=2000|publisher=Wiley-VCH |doi=10.1002/14356007.a09_073|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|isbn=3527306730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both dyes and pigments are colored, because they absorb only some wavelengths of visible [[light]]. Dyes are usually soluble in water whereas  [[pigment]]s are insoluble. Some dyes can be [[Precipitation (chemistry)|rendered insoluble]] with the addition of [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] to produce a [[lake pigment]].

==History==
[[Textile]] dyeing dates back to the [[Neolithic]] period. Throughout history, people have dyed their textiles using common, locally available materials. Scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors such as the natural invertebrate dyes [[Tyrian purple]] and crimson [[kermes (dye)|kermes]] were highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based dyes such as [[isatis tinctoria|woad]], [[Indigo dye|indigo]], [[Saffron (use)|saffron]], and [[rubia|madder]] were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using [[resist dyeing]] techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth. Dyes from the [[New World]] such as [[cochineal]] and [[Haematoxylum campechianum|logwood]] were brought to Europe by the [[Spain|Spanish]] treasure fleets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=89Qs0uba9VAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=dyes+brought+to+europe+from+spain#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lasers in the Conservation of Artworks: Proceedings of the International Conference Lacona VII, Madrid, Spain, 17 - 21 September 2007|first1=Marta|last1=Castillejo|first2=Pablo|last2=Moreno|first3=Mohamed|last3=Oujja|first4=Roxana|last4=Radvan|first5=Javier|last5=Ruiz|date=15 August 2008|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=8 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203882085}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EElNckPn0FUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=dyestuffs+carried+to+america+by+colonists#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Natural Dyes and Home Dyeing (formerly Titled: Natural Dyes in the United States)|first=Rita J.|last=Adrosko|date=8 November 1971|publisher=Courier Corporation|accessdate=8 November 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780486226880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early dyes were obtained from  [[animal]], [[vegetable]] or [[mineral]] sources, with no to very little processing. By far the greatest source of dyes has been from the [[plant kingdom]], notably roots, berries, bark, leaves and wood, only few of which are used on a commercial scale.

The first synthetic dye, [[mauveine|mauve]], was discovered [[serendipity|serendipitously]] by [[William Henry Perkin]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of mauveine started a surge in synthetic dyes and in organic chemistry in general. Other [[aniline]] dyes followed, such as [[fuchsine]], [[safranine]], and [[induline]].

In 1891 [[Paul Ehrlich]] discovered that certain cells or organisms took up certain dyes selectively. He then reasoned that a sufficiently large dose could be injected to kill pathogenic microorganisms, if the dye did not affect other cells. Erlich went on to use a compound to target syphillis, the first time a chemical was used in order to selectively kill bacteria in the body, he also used methylene blue to target the plasmodium responsible for malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chemistry³: Introducing inorganic, organic and physical chemistry: Amazon.co.uk: Andy Burrows, Andy Parsons, Gareth Price, Gwen Pilling, John Holman: 8601404499050: Amazon.co.uk|last=|first=|date=|pages=1005–1006|id={{ASIN|0199277893|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemistry ==
The colour of a dye is dependent upon the ability of the substance to absorb light within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum (400-700&amp;nbsp;nm). An earlier theory known as Witt theory stated that a coloured dye had two components, a chromophore which imparts colour by absorbing light in the visible region (some examples are [[Nitro compound|nitro]], [[Azo compound|azo]], quinoid groups) and an auxochrome which serves to deepen the colour. This theory has been superseded by modern electronic structure theory which states that the colour in dyes is due to excitation of valence π-electrons by visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bafana|first=Amit|last2=Devi|first2=Sivanesan Saravana|last3=Chakrabarti|first3=Tapan|date=2011-09-28|title=Azo dyes: past, present and the future|journal=Environmental Reviews|volume=19|issue=NA|pages=350–371|doi=10.1139/a11-018|issn=1181-8700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyes are classified according to their solubility and chemical properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry&quot;/&gt;

'''[[Acid dye]]s''' are [[water]]-[[soluble]] [[anionic]] dyes that are applied to [[fiber]]s such as [[silk]], [[wool]], [[nylon]] and modified [[acrylic fiber]]s using neutral to acid dye baths. Attachment to the fiber is attributed, at least partly, to salt formation between anionic groups in the dyes and [[cationic]] groups in the fiber. Acid dyes are not substantive to [[Cellulose|cellulosic]] fibers. Most synthetic food colors fall in this category. Examples of acid dye are Alizarine Pure Blue B, [[Acid red 88]], etc.

'''Basic dyes''' are water-soluble [[cationic]] dyes that are mainly applied to [[acrylic fiber]]s, but find some use for wool and silk. Usually [[acetic acid]] is added to the dye bath to help the uptake of the dye onto the fiber. Basic dyes are also used in the coloration of [[paper]].

'''Direct''' or '''[[substantive dye]]ing''' is normally carried out in a neutral or slightly [[alkaline]] dye bath, at or near [[boiling point]], with the addition of either [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) or [[sodium sulfate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Direct dyes are used on [[cotton]], paper, [[leather]], wool, silk and [[nylon]]. They are also used as [[pH indicator]]s and as [[staining (biology)|biological stains]].

'''[[Mordant dye]]s''' require a [[mordant]], which improves the fastness of the dye against water, [[light]] and [[perspiration]]. The choice of mordant is very important as different mordants can change the final color significantly. Most natural dyes are mordant dyes and there is therefore a large literature base describing dyeing techniques. The most important mordant dyes are the synthetic mordant dyes, or chrome dyes, used for wool; these comprise some 30% of dyes used for wool, and are especially useful for black and navy shades. The mordant [[potassium dichromate]] is applied as an after-treatment.  It is important to note that many mordants, particularly those in the heavy metal category, can be hazardous to health and extreme care must be taken in using them.

'''[[Vat dye]]s''' are essentially insoluble in water and incapable of dyeing fibres directly. However, reduction in [[alkaline liquor]] produces the water-soluble [[alkali]] [[metal]] [[salt]] of the dye. This form is often colorless, in which case it is referred to as a [[Leuco dye]], and has an affinity for the textile fibre. Subsequent [[oxidation]] reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to [[Indigo dye|indigo]], the original vat dye.

'''[[Reactive dyes]]''' utilize a [[chromophore]] attached to a [[substituent]] that is capable of directly [[chemical reaction|reacting]] with the fiber substrate. The [[covalent]] bonds that attach reactive dye to natural fibers make them among the most permanent of dyes. &quot;Cold&quot; reactive dyes, such as [[Procion MX]], [[Cibacron F]], and [[Drimarene K]], are very easy to use because the dye can be applied at room temperature. Reactive dyes are by far the best choice for dyeing [[cotton]] and other [[cellulose]] fibers at home or in the art studio.

'''[[Disperse dye]]s''' were originally developed for the dyeing of [[cellulose acetate]], and are water-insoluble. The dyes are finely ground in the presence of a dispersing agent and sold as a paste, or spray-dried and sold as a powder. Their main use is to dye [[polyester]], but they can also be used to dye nylon, [[cellulose triacetate]], and acrylic fibers. In some cases, a dyeing [[temperature]] of {{convert|130|C|F}} is required, and a pressurized dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fiber. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of dispersing agent used during the grinding.

'''Azoic dyeing''' is a technique in which an insoluble [[Azo dye]] is produced directly onto or within the fiber. This is achieved by treating a fiber with both diazoic and coupling [[wikt:component|components]]. With suitable adjustment of dyebath conditions the two components react to produce the required insoluble azo dye. This technique of dyeing is unique, in that the final color is controlled by the choice of the diazoic and coupling components. This method of dyeing cotton is declining in importance due to the toxic nature of the chemicals used.

'''[[Sulfur dye]]s''' are inexpensive dyes used to dye cotton with dark colors. Dyeing is effected by heating the fabric in a solution of an organic compound, typically a nitrophenol derivative, and sulfide or [[polysulfide]].  The organic compound reacts with the sulfide source to form dark colors that adhere to the fabric. Sulfur Black 1, the largest selling dye by volume, does not have a well defined chemical structure.

==Food dyes==
One other class that describes the role of dyes, rather than their mode of use, is the [[food coloring|food dye]].  Because food dyes are classed as [[food additive]]s, they are manufactured to a higher standard than some industrial dyes. Food dyes can be direct, mordant and vat dyes, and their use is strictly controlled by [[law|legislation]]. Many are [[Azo compound|azo]] dyes, although [[anthraquinone]] and [[triphenylmethane]] compounds are used for colors such as [[green]] and [[blue]]. Some naturally occurring dyes are also used.

==Other important dyes==
A number of other classes have also been established, including:
* Oxidation bases, for mainly hair and fur
* [[Laser dye]]s:[[rhodamine 6G]] and [[coumarin]] dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first = F. J. |editor1-last=Duarte |editor1-link=F. J. Duarte |editor2-first=L. W. |editor2-last=Hillman |title=Dye Laser Principles |work=Academic |location=New York |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leather]] dyes, for leather
* [[Fluorescent brightener]]s, for textile fibres and paper
* [[Solvent dye]]s, for wood staining and producing colored lacquers, solvent inks, coloring oils, waxes.
* Contrast dyes, injected for magnetic resonance imaging, are essentially the same as clothing dye except they are coupled to an agent that has strong paramagnetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6123921/description.html|title=patentstorm.us|website=Patentstorm.us|accessdate=8 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612104958/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6123921/description.html|archive-date=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mayhems dye, used in water cooling for looks, often rebranded RIT dye

== Pollution ==
Dyes produced by the textile, printing and paper industries can end up in waste waters and are therefore a potential source of pollution of rivers and waterways.&lt;ref name=Brindley2009&gt;{{cite news |last= Brindley |first=Lewis |date=July 2009 |title= New solution for dye wastewater pollution |url= https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/new-solution-for-dye-wastewater-pollution/3002870.article|work= [[Chemistry World]]|location= |access-date=2018-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various porous materials, often used to adsorb harmful chemicals in general, have been specifically tested to remove dyes from aqueous environments, especially those who could combine wide availability, fast kinetics and strong adsorption capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal =Journal of Environmental Management |volume=90 |issue=8 |date=June 2009 |pages=2313–2342 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.11.017 |title=Application of low-cost adsorbents for dye removal – A review|last=Gupta|first= V.K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
