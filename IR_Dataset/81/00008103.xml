Deforestation has many causes: trees can be cut down to be used for building or sold as fuel (sometimes in the form of [[charcoal]] or [[timber]]), while cleared land can be used as [[pasture]] for [[livestock]] and [[plantation]]. Disregard of ascribed value, lax forest management, and deficient environmental laws are some of the factors that lead to large-scale deforestation.

The removal of trees without sufficient [[reforestation]] has resulted in [[Habitat destruction|habitat damage]], [[biodiversity loss]], and [[arid]]ity. Deforestation causes [[extinction]], changes to climatic conditions, [[desertification]], and displacement of populations, as observed by current conditions and in the past through the [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sahney, S.|author2=Benton, M.J.|author3=Falcon-Lang, H.J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2010|title=Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica|journal=Geology|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1079–1082|bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S|doi=10.1130/G31182.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deforestation also has adverse impacts on [[biosequestration]] of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]], increasing negative feedback cycles contributing to  [[global warming]]. [[Global warming]] also puts increased pressure on communities who seek [[food security]] by clearing forests for agricultural use and reducing arable land more generally. Deforested regions typically incur significant other environmental effects such as adverse [[soil erosion]] and degradation into [[wikt:wasteland|wasteland]].

According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat, the overwhelming direct cause of deforestation is agriculture. [[Subsistence farming]] is responsible for 48% of deforestation; [[commercial agriculture]] is responsible for 32%; [[logging]] is responsible for 14%, and fuel wood removals make up 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/pub_07_financial_flows.pdf|title=Investment and financial flows to address climate change|work=unfccc.int|publisher=UNFCCC|page=81 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) found that &quot;the role of population dynamics in a local setting may vary from decisive to negligible&quot;, and that deforestation can result from &quot;a combination of population pressure and stagnating economic, social and technological conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=population1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/WPdirect/WPan0050.htm|title=Population and deforestation|author=Marcoux, Alain|date=August 2000|work=SD Dimensions|publisher=Sustainable Development Department, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628184520/http://www.fao.org/sd/WPdirect/WPan0050.htm|archivedate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degradation of forest ecosystems has also been traced to economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation.&lt;ref name=economicvalue&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/external/academic/forest-es-2003-en.pdf|last=Pearce|first=David W|title=The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystems|journal=Ecosystem Health|volume= 7|issue=4|date=December 2001|pages=284–296|doi=10.1046/j.1526-0992.2001.01037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no economic value that is readily apparent to the forests' owners or the communities that rely on forests for their well-being.&lt;ref name=economicvalue /&gt; From the perspective of the developing world, the benefits of forest as carbon sinks or biodiversity reserves go primarily to richer developed nations and there is insufficient compensation for these services. Developing countries feel that some countries in the developed world, such as the United States of America, cut down their forests centuries ago and benefited economically from this deforestation, and that it is hypocritical to deny developing countries the same opportunities, i.e. that the poor should not have to bear the cost of preservation when the rich created the problem.&lt;ref name=costarica&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is there too much or too little natural forest in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica?|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=30|issue=3|doi=10.1139/x99-225|year=2000|pages=495–506|last1=Bulte|first1=Erwin H|last2=Joenje|first2=Mark|last3=Jansen|first3=Hans GP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when actively growing can a tree or forest remove carbon, by storing it in plant tissues. Both the decay and the burning of wood release much of this stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Although an accumulation of wood is generally necessary for carbon sequestration, in some forests the network of symbiotic fungi that surround the trees' roots can store a significant amount of carbon, storing it underground even if the tree which supplied it dies and decays, or is harvested and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1231923| pmid=23539604|bibcode = 2013Sci...339.1615C|title = Roots and Associated Fungi Drive Long-Term Carbon Sequestration in Boreal Forest| journal=Science| volume=339| issue=6127| pages=1615–8|last1 = Clemmensen|first1 = K.

Mature forests alternate between being net sinks and net sources of carbon dioxide (see [[carbon dioxide sink]] and [[carbon cycle]]).

In deforested areas, the land heats up faster and reaches a higher temperature, leading to localized upward motions that enhance the formation of clouds and ultimately produce more rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2004/jun/HQ_04183_deforestation.html NASA Data Shows Deforestation Affects Climate In The Amazon].

===Hydrological===
The [[water cycle]] is also affected by deforestation. Trees extract [[groundwater]] through their roots and release it into the atmosphere. When part of a forest is removed, the trees no longer transpire this water, resulting in a much [[dry climate|drier climate]]. Deforestation reduces the content of water in the soil and groundwater as well as atmospheric moisture. The dry soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation|work=UN Secretary-General’s Report|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=11 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduces soil cohesion, so that [[Soil erosion|erosion]], flooding and [[landslide]]s ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.uwec.edu/jolhm/eh2/rogge/index.htm|author=Rogge, Daniel |work=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire |title=Deforestation and Landslides in Southwestern Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/413717.stm China's floods: Is deforestation to blame?] BBC News. 6 August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrinking [[forest cover]] lessens the landscape's capacity to intercept, retain and [[Transpiration|transpire]] precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. Forests return most of the water that falls as precipitation to the atmosphere by transpiration. In contrast, when an area is deforested, almost all precipitation is lost as run-off.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, P. H. and Berg, L. R. (2006) ''Environment'', 5th ed, John Wiley &amp; Sons. p. 406. {{ISBN|0471704385}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That quicker transport of surface water can translate into [[flash flood]]ing and more localized floods than would occur with the forest cover. Deforestation also contributes to decreased [[evapotranspiration]], which lessens atmospheric moisture which in some cases affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans. According to one study, in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Economic Costs of China's Environmental Degradation: Project on Environmental Scarcities, State Capacity, and Civil Violence, a Joint Project of the University of Toronto and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|chapter-url = http://www.library.utoronto.ca/pcs/state/chinaeco/forest.htm|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091230071928/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/pcs/state/chinaeco/forest.htm|url-status = dead|archive-date = 30 December 2009|publisher = Committee on Internat.

Trees, and plants in general, affect the [[water cycle]] significantly:&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* their canopies intercept a proportion of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which is then evaporated back to the atmosphere ([[Interception (water)|canopy interception]]);
* their litter, stems and trunks slow down [[surface runoff]];
* their roots create [[macropore]]s – large conduits – in the soil that increase [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of water;
* they contribute to terrestrial evaporation and reduce [[Water content|soil moisture]] via [[transpiration]];
* their [[plant litter|litter]] and other organic residue change soil properties that affect the capacity of soil to store water.
* their leaves control the [[humidity]] of the atmosphere by [[transpiration|transpiring]]. 99% of the water absorbed by the roots moves up to the leaves and is transpired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/ageng/irrigate/eb66w.htm &quot;Soil, Water and Plant Characteristics Important to Irrigation&quot;.] North Dakota State University.&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, the presence or absence of trees can change the quantity of water on the surface, in the soil or groundwater, or in the atmosphere. This in turn changes erosion rates and the availability of water for either ecosystem functions or human services. Deforestation on lowland plains moves cloud formation and rainfall to higher elevations.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The forest may have little impact on flooding in the case of large rainfall events, which overwhelm the storage capacity of forest soil if the soils are at or close to saturation.

Due to surface [[plant litter]], forests that are undisturbed have a minimal rate of [[erosion]]. The rate of erosion occurs from deforestation, because it decreases the amount of litter cover, which provides protection from [[surface runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soil Erosion and Conservation|last=Morgan|first=R.P.C|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009|isbn=9781405144674|location=|pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of erosion is around 2 metric tons per square kilometre.&lt;ref name =Homestead&gt;{{Cite book|title=21st Century Homestead: Sustainable Agriculture III: Agricultural Practices|last=Henkel|first=Marlon|publisher=Lulu.com|year=|isbn=9781312939752|location=|pages=110}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} This can be an advantage in excessively leached tropical rain forest soils. Forestry operations themselves also increase erosion through the [[road building|development of]] ([[forest road|forest]]) [[road]]s and the use of mechanized equipment.

Deforestation in China's Loess Plateau many years ago has led to soil erosion; this erosion has led to valleys opening up. The increase of soil in the runoff causes the Yellow River to flood and makes it yellow colored.&lt;ref name=Homestead /&gt;

Greater erosion is not always a consequence of deforestation, as observed in the southwestern regions of the US. In these areas, the loss of grass due to the presence of trees and other shrubbery leads to more erosion than when trees are removed.&lt;ref name=Homestead /&gt;

Soils are reinforced by the presence of trees, which secure the soil by binding their roots to soil bedrock.

The forest area change may follow a pattern suggested by the [[forest transition]] (FT) theory,&lt;ref name=&quot;MeyfroidtLambin2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-090710-143732|title=Global Forest Transition: Prospects for an End to Deforestation|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume=36|pages=343–371|year=2011|last1=Meyfroidt|first1=Patrick|last2=Lambin|first2=Eric F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby at early stages in its development a country is characterized by high forest cover and low deforestation rates (HFLD countries).&lt;ref name=rud/&gt;

Then deforestation rates accelerate (HFHD, high forest cover – high deforestation rate), and forest cover is reduced (LFHD, low forest cover – high deforestation rate), before the deforestation rate slows (LFLD, low forest cover – low deforestation rate), after which forest cover stabilizes and eventually starts recovering. FT is not a &quot;law of nature&quot;, and the pattern is influenced by national context (for example, human population density, stage of development, structure of the economy), global economic forces, and government policies. A country may reach very low levels of forest cover before it stabilizes, or it might through good policies be able to &quot;bridge&quot; the forest transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

FT depicts a broad trend, and an extrapolation of historical rates therefore tends to underestimate future BAU deforestation for counties at the early stages in the transition (HFLD), while it tends to overestimate BAU deforestation for countries at the later stages (LFHD and LFLD).

Countries with high forest cover can be expected to be at early stages of the FT. GDP per capita captures the stage in a country's economic development, which is linked to the pattern of natural resource use, including forests. The choice of forest cover and GDP per capita also fits well with the two key scenarios in the FT:

(i) a forest scarcity path, where forest scarcity triggers forces (for example, higher prices of forest products) that lead to forest cover stabilization; and

(ii) an economic development path, where new and better off-farm employment opportunities associated with economic growth (= increasing GDP per capita) reduce the profitability of frontier agriculture and slows deforestation.&lt;ref name=rud/&gt;

{{Further|Timeline of environmental history}}

===Prehistory===
The [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]]&lt;ref name=Benton/&gt; was an event that occurred 300 million years ago. Climate change devastated tropical rainforests causing the extinction of many plant and animal species. The change was abrupt, specifically, at this time climate became cooler and drier, conditions that are not favorable to the growth of rainforests and much of the biodiversity within them. Rainforests were fragmented forming shrinking 'islands' further and further apart. Populations such as the sub class [[Lissamphibia]] were devastated, whereas [[Reptile|Reptilia]] survived the collapse. The surviving organisms were better adapted to the drier environment left behind and served as legacies in succession after the collapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[File: Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, ax heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]
Rainforests once covered 14% of the earth's land surface; now they cover a mere 6% and experts estimate that the last remaining rainforests could be consumed in less than 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taylor |first= Leslie |title= The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs: A Guide to Understanding and Using Herbal Medicinals |publisher= Square One |year= 2004 |isbn= 9780757001444 |url= https://archive.org/details/healingpowerofra00tayl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe there is little solid evidence before 7000 BC. Mesolithic [[hunter-gatherer|foragers]] used fire to create openings for [[red deer]] and [[wild boar]]. In Great Britain, shade-tolerant species such as [[oak]] and [[Ash tree|ash]] are replaced in the [[palynology|pollen record]] by [[hazel]]s, brambles, grasses and nettles. Removal of the forests led to decreased [[transpiration]], resulting in the formation of upland [[peat bog]]s. Widespread decrease in [[elm]] [[pollen]] across Europe between 8400–8300 BC and 7200–7000 BC, starting in southern Europe and gradually moving north to Great Britain, may represent land [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] by fire at the onset of [[Neolithic]] agriculture.

The [[Neolithic period]] saw extensive deforestation for [[Agriculture|farming land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254115/hand-tool/39205/Neolithic-tools|title=hand tool: Neolithic tools|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archaeolink.co.uk/Neolithic-Age.html|title=Neolithic Age from 4,000 BC to 2,200 BC or New Stone Age|website=www.archaeolink.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304122056/http://www.archaeolink.co.uk/Neolithic-Age.html|archive-date=4 March 2007|access-date=2 October 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone axes were being made from about 3000 BC not just from flint, but from a wide variety of hard rocks from across Britain and North America as well. They include the noted [[Langdale axe industry]] in the [[English Lake District]], quarries developed at [[Penmaenmawr]] in [[North Wales]] and numerous other locations. Rough-outs were made locally near the quarries, and some were polished locally to give a fine finish. This step not only increased the [[mechanical strength]] of the axe, but also made penetration of wood easier. [[Flint]] was still used from sources such as [[Grimes Graves]] but from many other mines across Europe.

Evidence of deforestation has been found in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]]; for example the environs of the [[Palace of Knossos]] were severely deforested in the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (22 December 2007). [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes &quot;Knossos fieldnotes&quot;], ''The Modern Antiquarian''&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout prehistory, humans were hunter gatherers who hunted within forests. In most areas, such as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], the tropics, Central America, and the Caribbean,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.school.eb.com/comptons/article-9310969?query=deforestation&amp;ct= Encyclopćdia Britannica Online School Edition]. School.eb.com. Retrieved 29 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; only after shortages of wood and other forest products occur are policies implemented to ensure forest resources are used in a sustainable manner.

Three regional studies of historic erosion and alluviation in [[ancient Greece]] found that, wherever adequate evidence exists, a major phase of erosion follows the introduction of farming in the various regions of Greece by about 500–1,000 years, ranging from the later Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Land Use and Soil Erosion in Prehistoric and Historical Greece|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|volume=17 |issue=4 |pages= 379–396|url=http://www.esf.edu/cue/documents/vanAndel-etal_LandUse-HistoricGreece_1990.pdf|doi=10.1179/009346990791548628|year=2013 |last1=Van Andel|first1=Tjeerd H.|last2=Zangger|first2=Eberhard|last3=Demitrack|first3=Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thousand years following the mid-first millennium BC saw serious, intermittent pulses of soil erosion in numerous places. The historic [[silting]] of ports along the southern coasts of [[Asia Minor]] (''e.g.'' [[Clarus]], and the examples of [[Ephesus]], [[Priene]] and [[Miletus]], where harbors had to be abandoned because of the silt deposited by the Meander) and in coastal [[Syria]] during the last centuries BC.

[[Easter Island]] has suffered from heavy [[soil erosion]] in recent centuries, aggravated by agriculture and deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The_Mystery_of_Easter_Island.html &quot;The Mystery of Easter Island&quot;], ''Smithsonian Magazine'', 1 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] gives an extensive look into the collapse of the ancient Easter Islanders in his book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse]]''. The disappearance of the island's trees seems to coincide with a decline of its civilization around the 17th and 18th century. He attributed the collapse to deforestation and over-exploitation of all resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/09easter_island.htm|title=Historical Consequences of Deforestation: Easter Island (Diamond 1995)|publisher=mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/24/042.html|title=Jared Diamond, Easter Island's End|publisher=hartford-hwp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous silting up of the harbor for [[Bruges]], which moved port commerce to [[Antwerp]], also followed a period of increased settlement growth (and apparently of deforestation) in the upper river basins. In early medieval [[Riez]] in upper [[Provence]], alluvial silt from two small rivers raised the riverbeds and widened the floodplain, which slowly buried the Roman settlement in alluvium and gradually moved new construction to higher ground; concurrently the headwater valleys above Riez were being opened to pasturage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Land Management: Challenges &amp; Strategies|last=Iyyer|first=Chaitanya|publisher=Global India Publications|year=2009|isbn=9789380228488|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical [[progress trap]] was that cities were often built in a forested area, which would provide wood for some industry (for example, construction, shipbuilding, pottery). When deforestation occurs without proper replanting, however; local wood supplies become difficult to obtain near enough to remain competitive, leading to the city's abandonment, as happened repeatedly in Ancient [[Asia Minor]]. Because of fuel needs, mining and metallurgy often led to deforestation and city abandonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Ecological Degradation|last=Chew|first=Sing C.|publisher=AltaMira Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=69–70|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With most of the population remaining active in (or indirectly dependent on) the agricultural sector, the main pressure in most areas remained land [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] for crop and cattle farming. Enough wild green was usually left standing (and partially used, for example, to collect firewood, timber and fruits, or to graze pigs) for wildlife to remain viable. The elite's (nobility and higher clergy) protection of their own hunting privileges and game often protected significant woodland.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of Diversity and Discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781443867061|location=|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major parts in the spread (and thus more durable growth) of the population were played by monastical 'pioneering' (especially by the [[Benedictine]] and [[commerce|Commercial]] orders) and some [[feudal]] lords' recruiting farmers to settle (and become tax payers) by offering relatively good legal and fiscal conditions. Even when speculators sought to encourage towns, settlers needed an agricultural belt around or sometimes within defensive walls. When populations were quickly decreased by causes such as the [[Black Death]], the [[European colonization of the Americas#Disease and indigenous population loss|colonization of the Americas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Brierley et al 2019&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2018.12.004 |title=Earth system impacts of the European arrival and Great Dying in the Americas after 1492 |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |volume=207 |pages=13–36 |year=2019 |last1=Koch |first1=Alexander |last2=Brierley |first2=Chris |last3=Maslin |first3=Mark M. |last4=Lewis |first4=Simon L. |bibcode=2019QSRv..207...13K }}&lt;/ref&gt; or devastating warfare (for example, [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongol]] hordes in eastern and central Europe, [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany), this could lead to settlements being abandoned. The land was reclaimed by nature, but the [[secondary forest]]s usually lacked the original [[biodiversity]]. The [[Mongol invasions and conquests]] alone resulted in the reduction of 700 million tons of carbon from the atmosphere by enabling the re-growth of carbon-absorbing forests on depopulated lands over a significant period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://carnegiescience.edu/news/war-plague-no-match-deforestation-driving-co2-buildup|title=War, Plague No Match For Deforestation In Driving CO2 Buildup|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=20 January 2011|website= |publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|access-date=22 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1100 to 1500 AD, significant deforestation took place in [[Western Europe]] as a result of the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]. The large-scale building of wooden sailing ships by European (coastal) naval owners since the 15th century for exploration, [[Colonialism|colonisation]], [[slave trade]]–and other trade on the high seas consumed many forest resources. [[Piracy]] also contributed to the over harvesting of forests, as in Spain. This led to a weakening of the domestic economy after Columbus' discovery of America, as the economy became dependent on colonial activities (plundering, mining, cattle, plantations, trade, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of Diversity and Discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781443867061|location=pg.309|pages=703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Changes In the Land'' (1983), [[William Cronon]] analyzed and documented 17th-century English colonists' reports of increased seasonal flooding in [[New England]] during the period when new settlers initially cleared the forests for agriculture. They believed flooding was linked to widespread forest [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] upstream.

The massive use of [[charcoal]] on an industrial scale in [[Early Modern Europe]] was a new type of consumption of western forests; even in Stuart England, the relatively primitive production of charcoal has already reached an impressive level. Stuart England was so widely deforested that it depended on the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] trade for ship timbers, and looked to the untapped forests of [[New England]] to supply the need. Each of Nelson's [[Royal Navy]] war ships at Trafalgar (1805) required 6,000 mature oaks for its construction. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] planted [[oak]] forests to supply the French navy in the future. When the oak plantations matured in the mid-19th century, the masts were no longer required because shipping had changed.

[[Norman F. Cantor]]'s summary of the effects of late medieval deforestation applies equally well to Early Modern Europe:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cantor, Norman F. |title=The civilization of the Middle Ages: a completely revised and expanded edition of Medieval history, the life and death of a civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qiYM2_HhJgC|date=9 June 1994|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-092553-6|page=564}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Europeans had lived in the midst of vast forests throughout the earlier medieval centuries. After 1250 they became so skilled at deforestation that by 1500 they were running short of wood for heating and cooking. They were faced with a nutritional decline because of the elimination of the generous supply of wild game that had inhabited the now-disappearing forests, which throughout medieval times had provided the staple of their carnivorous high-protein diet. By 1500 Europe was on the edge of a fuel and nutritional disaster [from] which it was saved in the sixteenth century only by the burning of soft coal and the cultivation of potatoes and maize.}}

==Industrial era==
In the 19th century, introduction of [[steamboat]]s in the [[United States]] was the cause of deforestation of banks of major rivers, such as the [[Mississippi River]], with increased and more severe flooding one of the environmental results. The steamboat crews cut wood every day from the riverbanks to fuel the steam engines. Between [[St. Louis]] and the confluence with the [[Ohio River]] to the south, the Mississippi became more wide and shallow, and changed its channel laterally. Attempts to improve navigation by the use of [[Snagboat|snag pullers]] often resulted in crews' [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] large trees 100 to {{convert|200|ft|m}} back from the banks. Several French colonial towns of the [[Illinois Country]], such as [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]] and St. Philippe, [[Illinois]], were flooded and abandoned in the late 19th century, with a loss to the cultural record of their [[archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;Norris, F. Terry (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HwH3kdOgvfAC&amp;pg=PA73 &quot;Where Did the Villages Go?

The wholescale clearance of woodland to create agricultural land can be seen in many parts of the world, such as the [[Central forest-grasslands transition]] and other areas of the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]]. Specific parallels are seen in the 20th-century deforestation occurring in many developing nations.

Because of this omission, the most harmful impacts of deforestation (such as habitat loss) could be increasing despite a possible decline in the global rate of deforestation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they are based largely on reporting from forestry departments of individual countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0629-deforestation.html|title=Remote sensing versus self-reporting}}&lt;/ref&gt; which do not take into account unofficial activities like illegal logging.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank estimates that 80% of logging operations are illegal in [[Bolivia]] and 42% in [[Colombia]], while in [[Peru]], illegal logging accounts for 80% of all logging activities.

===Reducing emissions===
{{Main|Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation}}
Main international organizations including the United Nations and the World Bank, have begun to develop programs aimed at curbing deforestation. The blanket term [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) describes these sorts of programs, which use direct monetary or other incentives to encourage developing countries to limit and/or roll back deforestation. Funding has been an issue, but at the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties-15 (COP-15) in Copenhagen in December 2009, an accord was reached with a collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, that will approach US$30 billion for the period 2010–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009 |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant work is underway on tools for use in monitoring developing country adherence to their agreed REDD targets. These tools, which rely on remote forest monitoring using satellite imagery and other data sources, include the [[Center for Global Development]]'s FORMA (Forest Monitoring for Action) initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/forestmonitoringforactionforma Forest Monitoring for Action (FORMA) : Center for Global Development : Initiatives: Active].

Climateprogress.org (16 December 2009). Retrieved 29 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] and partners launched Open Foris – a set of open-source software tools that assist countries in gathering, producing and disseminating information on the state of forest resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/254098/icode/|title=FAO - News Article: FAO sets standards to improve national forest monitoring systems|website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools support the inventory lifecycle, from needs assessment, design, planning, field data collection and management, estimation analysis, and dissemination. Remote sensing image processing tools are included, as well as tools for international reporting for [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD) and MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marc|last=Steininger|title=REDD+ MEASUREMENT, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV) MANUAL|url=http://www.conservation.org/publications/Documents/FCMC_REDD-MRV-Manual-Summary.pdf|website=Conservation.org|publisher=US Aid|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FAO's [http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/en/ Global Forest Resource Assessments].

In evaluating implications of overall emissions reductions, countries of greatest concern are those categorized as High Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (HFHD) and Low Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (LFHD). Afghanistan, Benin, Botswana, Burma, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, [[Deforestation in Haiti|Haiti]], Honduras, Indonesia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mongolia, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Togo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zimbabwe are listed as having Low Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (LFHD). Brazil, Cambodia, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Equatorial Guinea, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Venezuela, Zambia are listed as High Forest Cover with High Rates of Deforestation (HFHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD): An Options Assessment Report |publisher=Meridian Institute for the Government of Norway |year= 2009 |url= http://www.africaclimatesolution.org/features/REDD-Options_Assessment_Report.pdf|pages=75–77 |accessdate= 24 November 2011 |author=Angelsen, Arild|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control can be made by the companies. In 2018 the biggest palm oil traider, Wilmar, decided to control his suppliers for avoid deforestation. This is an important precedent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holder |first1=Michael |title='Potential breakthrough': Palm oil giant Wilmar steps up 'no deforestation' efforts |url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3067932/potential-breakthrough-palm-oil-giant-wilmar-steps-up-no-deforestation-efforts |website=Business Green |accessdate=11 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Payments for conserving forests====

In Bolivia, deforestation in upper river basins has caused environmental problems, including soil erosion and declining water quality. An innovative project to try and remedy this situation involves landholders in upstream areas being paid by downstream water users to conserve forests. The landholders receive US$20 to conserve the trees, avoid polluting livestock practices, and enhance the biodiversity and forest carbon on their land. They also receive US$30, which purchases a beehive, to compensate for conservation for two hectares of water-sustaining forest for five years. Honey revenue per hectare of forest is US$5 per year, so within five years, the landholder has sold US$50 of honey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/payments-for-watershed-services-a-driver-of-climate-compatible-development/?loclang=en_gb ''Payments for watershed services: A driver of climate compatible development''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 30 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The project is being conducted by [[Fundación Natura Bolivia]] and Rare Conservation, with support from the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]].

=== Land rights ===
[[File:Shennongjia virgin forest.jpg|thumb|Transferring [[land rights]] to indigenous inhabitants is argued to efficiently conserve forests.]]
Transferring rights over land from public domain to its [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous inhabitants]] is argued to be a cost-effective strategy to conserve forests.&lt;ref name=Guardian1&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/22/india-follow-china-saving-forest-people-land-rights|title=India should follow China to find a way out of the woods on saving forest people|newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=7 August 2016|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the protection of such rights entitled in existing laws, such as India's [[The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006|Forest Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=Guardian1/&gt; The transferring of such rights in [[China]], perhaps the largest [[land reform]] in modern times, has been argued to have increased forest cover.&lt;ref name=rightsandresources&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rightsandresources.org/en/publication/view/chinas-forest-tenure-reforms-impacts-and-implications-for-choice-conservation-and-climate-change/|title=China's forest tenure reforms|publisher=rightsandresources.org|accessdate=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923153921/http://rightsandresources.org/en/publication/view/chinas-forest-tenure-reforms-impacts-and-implications-for-choice-conservation-and-climate-change/|archive-date=23 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], forested areas given tenure to indigenous groups have even lower rates of [[clearing (geography)|clearing]] than [[national park]]s.&lt;ref name=rightsandresources/&gt;

===Farming===
New methods are being developed to farm more intensively, such as high-yield [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] crops, [[greenhouse]], [[autonomous building]] gardens, and [[hydroponic]]s. These methods are often dependent on chemical inputs to maintain necessary yields. In cyclic [[agriculture]], cattle are grazed on farm land that is resting and rejuvenating. Cyclic agriculture actually increases the fertility of the soil. Intensive farming can also decrease soil nutrients by consuming at an accelerated rate the trace minerals needed for crop growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The most promising approach, however, is the concept of [[forest gardening|food forests]] in [[permaculture]], which consists of agroforestal systems carefully designed to mimic natural forests, with an emphasis on plant and animal species of interest for food, timber and other uses. These systems have low dependence on [[fossil fuels]] and [[agro-chemicals]], are highly self-maintaining, highly productive, and with strong positive impact on soil and water quality, and [[biodiversity]].

===Monitoring deforestation===

There are multiple methods that are appropriate and reliable for reducing and monitoring deforestation. One method is the &quot;visual interpretation of aerial photos or satellite imagery that is labor-intensive but does not require high-level training in computer image processing or extensive computational resources&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Another method includes hot-spot analysis (that is, locations of rapid change) using expert opinion or coarse resolution satellite data to identify locations for detailed digital analysis with high resolution satellite images.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Deforestation is typically assessed by quantifying the amount of area deforested, measured at the present time.
From an environmental point of view, quantifying the damage and its possible consequences is a more important task, while conservation efforts are more focused on forested land protection and development of land-use alternatives to avoid continued deforestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Deforestation rate and total area deforested, have been widely used for monitoring deforestation in many regions, including the Brazilian Amazon deforestation monitoring by INPE.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; A global satellite view is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest |title=Global Forest Change – Google Crisis Map|work=Google Crisis Map|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.nature.com/news/warning-to-forest-destroyers-this-scientist-will-catch-you-1.20730 |title=Warning to forest destroyers: this scientist will catch you|volume=538|issue=7623|pages=24–26|work=Nature News &amp; Comment|date=4 October 2016|accessdate=12 October 2016|doi=10.1038/538024a|last1=Popkin|first1=Gabriel|bibcode=2016Natur.538...24P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forest management===
Efforts to stop or slow deforestation have been attempted for many centuries because it has long been known that deforestation can cause environmental damage sufficient in some cases to cause societies to collapse. In [[Tonga]], paramount rulers developed policies designed to prevent conflicts between short-term gains from converting forest to farmland and long-term problems forest loss would cause,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 301–302 {{ISBN|0-14-311700-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while during the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared ''Collapse: How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed''; Viking Press 2004, pp. 320–331 {{ISBN|0-14-311700-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the shōguns developed a highly sophisticated system of long-term planning to stop and even reverse deforestation of the preceding centuries through substituting timber by other products and more efficient use of land that had been farmed for many centuries. In 16th-century Germany, landowners also developed [[silviculture]] to deal with the problem of deforestation. However, these policies tend to be limited to environments with ''good rainfall'', ''no dry season'' and ''very young [[soil]]s'' (through [[volcano|volcanism]] or [[glaciation]]). This is because on older and less fertile soils trees grow too slowly for silviculture to be economic, whilst in areas with a strong dry season there is always a risk of forest fires destroying a tree crop before it matures.

In the areas where &quot;[[slash-and-burn]]&quot; is practiced, switching to &quot;[[slash-and-char]]&quot; would prevent the rapid deforestation and subsequent degradation of soils. The [[biochar]] thus created, given back to the soil, is not only a durable [[carbon sequestration]] method, but it also is an extremely beneficial [[Soil conditioner|amendment]] to the soil. Mixed with [[biomass]] it brings the creation of [[terra preta]], one of the richest soils on the planet and the only one known to regenerate itself.

====Sustainable practices====
[[File:Bamboo Feb09.jpg|thumb|Bamboo is advocated as a more sustainable alternative for cutting down wood for fuel.&lt;ref name=bamboo/&gt;]]
Certification, as provided by global certification systems such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council]], contributes to tackling deforestation by creating market demand for timber from sustainably managed forests. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), &quot;A major condition for the adoption of sustainable forest management is a demand for products that are produced sustainably and consumer willingness to pay for the higher costs entailed. Certification represents a shift from regulatory approaches to market incentives to promote sustainable forest management. By promoting the positive attributes of forest products from sustainably managed forests, certification focuses on the demand side of environmental conservation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/011/i0350e/i0350e00.HTM &quot;State of the World's Forests 2009&quot;]. United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rettet den Regenwald|Rainforest Rescue]] argues that the standards of organizations like FSC are too closely connected to [[timber industry]] interests and therefore do not guarantee environmentally and socially responsible forest management. In reality, monitoring systems are inadequate and various cases of fraud have been documented worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainforest-rescue.org/topics/tropical-timber/faq Facts about Tropical Timber]. Rainforest Rescue. Retrieved 13 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nations have taken steps to help increase the number of trees on Earth. In 1981, China created National Tree Planting Day Forest and forest coverage had now reached 16.55% of China's land mass, as against only 12% two decades ago.&lt;ref name=battling&gt;Gittings, John (20 March 2001). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/20/worlddispatch.china &quot;Battling China's Deforestation&quot;.] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using fuel from [[bamboo]] rather than wood results in cleaner burning, and since bamboo matures much faster than wood, deforestation is reduced as supply can be replenished faster.&lt;ref name=bamboo&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/in-africas-vanishing-forests-the-benefits-of-bamboo/?ref=global-home|title=In Africa's vanishing forests, the benefits of bamboo|work=New York Times|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=26 July 2012|first=Tina|last=Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforestation===
{{Main|Reforestation}}
In many parts of the world, especially in East Asian countries, reforestation and [[afforestation]] are increasing the area of forested lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year = 2005|title = Global Consequences of Land Use|volume = 309|issue = 5734| pages = 570–574|doi = 10.1126/science.1111772|pmid = 16040698|journal = Science|last1 = Foley|first1 = J.

K.|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..570F|url = http://rcin.org.pl/Content/31092}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of woodland has increased in 22 of the world's 50 most forested nations. Asia as a whole gained 1 million [[hectare]]s of forest between 2000 and 2005. Tropical forest in El Salvador expanded more than 20% between 1992 and 2001. Based on these trends, one study projects that global forestation will increase by 10%—an area the size of India—by 2050.&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;James Owen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170907212622/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/11/061113-forests.html &quot;World's Forests Rebounding, Study Suggests&quot;]. ''National Geographic News'', 13 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of China]], where large scale destruction of forests has occurred, the government has in the past required that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in other forest services. The government claims that at least 1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] trees have been planted in China every year since 1982. This is no longer required today, but 12 March of every year in China is the Planting Holiday. Also, it has introduced the [[Green Wall of China]] project, which aims to halt the expansion of the Gobi desert through the planting of trees. However, due to the large percentage of trees dying off after planting (up to 75%), the project is not very successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} There has been a 47-million-hectare increase in forest area in China since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Owen/&gt; The total number of trees amounted to be about 35 billion and 4.55% of China's land mass increased in forest coverage. The forest coverage was 12% two decades ago and now is 16.55%.&lt;ref name=battling/&gt;

An ambitious proposal for China is the Aerially Delivered Re-forestation and Erosion Control System and the proposed Sahara Forest Project coupled with the [[Seawater Greenhouse]].

In Western countries, increasing consumer demand for wood products that have been produced and harvested in a sustainable manner is causing forest landowners and [[Wood industry|forest industries]] to become increasingly accountable for their forest management and timber harvesting practices.

The [[Arbor Day Foundation]]'s Rain Forest Rescue program is a charity that helps to prevent deforestation. The charity uses donated money to buy up and preserve rainforest land before the [[lumber]] companies can buy it. The Arbor Day Foundation then protects the land from deforestation. This also locks in the way of life of the primitive tribes living on the forest land. Organizations such as [[Community Forestry International]], [[Cool Earth]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Conservation International]], [[African Conservation Foundation]] and [[Greenpeace]] also focus on preserving forest habitats. Greenpeace in particular has also mapped out the forests that are still intact&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327183443/http://www.intactforests.org/publications/intactforests_poster_preview.pdf The world’s last intact forest landscapes]. intactforests.org&lt;/ref&gt; and published this information on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intactforests.org|work=intactforests.org|title=World Intact Forests campaign by Greenpeace}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Resources Institute in turn has made a simpler thematic map&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100724183523/http://www.wri.org/map/worlds-forests-restoration-perspective The World's Forests from a Restoration Perspective], WRI&lt;/ref&gt; showing the amount of forests present just before the age of man (8000 years ago) and the current (reduced) levels of forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/maps/pdf/WOR_THEM_Forests.pdf|title=Alternative thematic map by Howstuffworks; in pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These maps mark the amount of afforestation required to repair the damage caused by people.

===Forest plantations===
In order to acquire the world's demand for wood, it is suggested that high yielding forest plantations are suitable according to forest writers Botkins and [[Sedjo]]. Plantations that yield 10 cubic meters per hectare a year would supply enough wood for trading of 5% of the world's existing forestland. By contrast, natural forests produce about 1–2 cubic meters per hectare; therefore, 5–10 times more forestland would be required to meet demand. Forester Chad Oliver has suggested a forest mosaic with high-yield forest lands interspersed with conservation land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Botkin, Daniel B. |title=No man's garden: Thoreau and a new vision for civilization and nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OvF40zunJR4C&amp;pg=PA246|year=2001|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-55963-465-6|pages=246–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, planted forests increased from 4.1% to 7.0% of the total forest area between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payn, T. 2015&quot;&gt;Payn, T. et al. 2015. Changes in planted forests and future global implications, Forest Ecology and Management 352: 57–67&lt;/ref&gt; Plantation forests made up 280 million ha in 2015, an increase of about 40 million ha in the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015. Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. How are the world’s forests changing?&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, planted forests consist of about 18% exotic or introduced species while the rest are species native to the country where they are planted. In South America, Oceania, and East and Southern Africa, planted forests are dominated by introduced species: 88%, 75% and 65%, respectively. In North America, West and Central Asia, and Europe the proportions of introduced species in plantations are much lower at 1%, 3% and 8% of the total area planted, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payn, T. 2015&quot;/&gt;

In the country of Senegal, on the western coast of Africa, a movement headed by youths has helped to plant over 6 million mangrove trees. The trees will protect local villages from storm damages and will provide a habitat for local wildlife. The project started in 2008, and already the Senegalese government has been asked to establish rules and regulations that would protect the new mangrove forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenstrup|first=Allen|title=Forests|year=2010|publisher=Morgan Reynolds Publishing|location=Greensboro, North Carolina|isbn=978-1-59935-116-2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While demands for agricultural and urban use for the human population cause the preponderance of deforestation, military causes can also intrude. One example of deliberate deforestation played out in the U.S. [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|zone of occupation]] in Germany after [[World War II]] ended in 1945. Before the onset of the [[Cold War]], defeated Germany was still considered a potential future threat rather than a potential future ally. To address this threat, the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] made attempts to [[Industrial plans for Germany|lower German industrial potential]], of which forests were deemed{{by whom|date=June 2018}} an element. Sources in the U.S. government admitted that the purpose of this was that the &quot;ultimate destruction of the war potential of German forests&quot;. As a consequence of the practice of clear-felling, deforestation resulted which could &quot;be replaced only by long forestry development over perhaps a century&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Balabkins, Nicholas (1964) &quot;Germany Under Direct Controls; Economic Aspects Of Industrial Disarmament 1945–1948, Rutgers University Press. p. 119. The two quotes used by Balabkins are referenced to, respectively: U.S. office of Military Government, ''A Year of Potsdam: The German Economy Since the Surrender'' (1946), p. 70; and U.S. Office of Military Government, ''The German Forest Resources Survey'' (1948), p. II. For similar observations see G.W. Harmssen, ''Reparationen, Sozialproduct, Lebensstandard'' (Bremen: F. Trujen Verlag, 1948), I, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations in [[war]] can also cause deforestation. For example, in the 1945 [[Battle of Okinawa]], [[bombardment]] and other [[Military operation|combat operations]] reduced a lush tropical landscape into &quot;a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Higa, Takejiro. [http://nisei.hawaii.edu/object/11_takejiro.html Battle of Okinawa], The Hawaii Nisei Project&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation can also result from the intentional [[military tactics|tactics]] of [[military forces]]. [[clearing (geography)|Clearing]] forest became an element in the Russian Empire's successful [[Caucasian War|conquest of the Caucasus]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;

Deforestation eliminates a great number of species of plants and animals which also often results in an increase in disease.&lt;ref name=CHGE&gt;[http://www.chgeharvard.org/topic/biodiversity-and-infectious-diseases Biodiversity and Infectious Diseases] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512175341/http://www.chgeharvard.org/topic/biodiversity-and-infectious-diseases |date=12 May 2016 }}, Center for Health and the Global Environment, [[Harvard T.H.

Deforestation is occurring all over the world and has been coupled with an increase in the occurrence of disease outbreaks. In [[Malaysia]], thousands of acres of forest have been cleared for pig farms. This has resulted in an increase in the zoonosis the Nipah virus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebulletin.org/deforestation-and-emerging-diseases Deforestation and emerging diseases | Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists].

Another pathway through which deforestation affects disease is the relocation and dispersion of disease-carrying hosts. This disease emergence pathway can be called &quot;[[Colonisation (biology)|range expansion]]&quot;, whereby the host's range (and thereby the range of pathogens) expands to new geographic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Range Expansion and Population Dynamics of an Invasive Species: The Eurasian Collared-Dove (''Streptopelia decaocto'')|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=10|pages=e111510|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111510|pmid=25354270|year=2014|last1=Scheidt|first1=Spencer N.|last2=Hurlbert|first2=Allen H.|pmc=4213033|bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k1510S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through deforestation, hosts and reservoir species are forced into neighboring habitats. Accompanying the reservoir species are pathogens that have the ability to find new hosts in previously unexposed regions. As these pathogens and species come into closer contact with humans, they are infected both directly and indirectly.

A catastrophic example of range expansion is the 1998 outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/338818|pmid=11938496|title=Nipah Virus Encephalitis Outbreak in Malaysia|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=34|pages=S48–51|year=2002|last1=Lam|first1=Sai Kit|last2=Chua|first2=Kaw Bing}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a number of years, deforestation, drought, and subsequent fires led to a dramatic geographic shift and density of [[Megabat|fruit bats]], a reservoir for Nipah virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/nipah/|title=Nipah Virus (NiV)|date=25 February 2019|website=|publisher=cdc.gov|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation reduced the available fruiting trees in the bats’ habitat, and they encroached on surrounding orchards which also happened to be the location of a large number of pigsties. The bats, through proximity spread the Nipah to pigs. While the virus infected the pigs, mortality was much lower than among humans, making the pigs a virulent host leading to the transmission of the virus to humans. This resulted in 265 reported cases of [[encephalitis]], of which 105 resulted in death. This example provides an important lesson for the impact deforestation can have on human health.

Another example of range expansion due to deforestation and other [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] habitat impacts includes the [[Capybara]] rodent in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.mongabay.com/2010/12/deforestation-sparks-giant-rodent-invasions/ Deforestation sparks giant rodent invasions]. News.mongabay.com (15 December 2010). Retrieved 13 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This rodent is the host of a number of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] diseases and, while there has not yet been a human-borne outbreak due to the movement of this rodent into new regions, it offers an example of how [[habitat destruction]] through deforestation and subsequent movements of species is occurring regularly.

A now well-developed theory is that the spread of [[HIV]] it is at least partially due deforestation. Rising populations created a food demand and with deforestation opening up new areas of the forest the hunters harvested a great deal of primate bushmeat, which is believed to be the origin of HIV.&lt;ref name=CHGE/&gt;
