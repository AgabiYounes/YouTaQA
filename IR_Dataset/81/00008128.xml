{{Sociolinguistics}}
The term '''dialect''' (from [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|dialectus}}, {{wikt-lang|la|dialectos}}, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|διάλεκτος}}, {{grc-tr|διάλεκτος}}, &quot;discourse&quot;, from {{wikt-lang|grc|διά}}, {{grc-tr|διά}}, &quot;through&quot; and {{wikt-lang|grc|λέγω}}, {{grc-tr|λέγω}}, &quot;I speak&quot;) is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of [[linguistic]] phenomena:

* One usage refers to a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/dialect Oxford Living Dictionaries – English.] Retrieved 18 January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], especially if close to one another on the [[dialect continuum]]. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as [[social class]] or [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-Webster Online dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; A dialect that is associated with a particular [[social class]] can be termed a [[sociolect]], a dialect that is associated with a particular [[ethnic group]] can be termed an [[ethnolect]], and a geographical/regional dialect may be termed a regiolect&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt and Schilling, Natalie. 2016.

According to this definition, any variety of a given language can be classified as &quot;a dialect&quot;, including any [[standard language|standardized varieties]]. In this case, the distinction between the &quot;standard language&quot; (i.e. the &quot;standard&quot; dialect of a particular language) and the &quot;[[nonstandard dialect|nonstandard]]&quot; (vernacular) dialects of the same language is often [[arbitrary]] and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations or prevalence and prominence.&lt;ref name=&quot;chao&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Chao |first=Yuen Ren |title=Language and Symbolic Systems |date=1968 |publisher=CUP archive |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se87AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyons |first=John |title=Language and Linguistics |date=1981 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/languagelinguist0000lyon |url-access=registration |quote=language standard dialect. |page=[https://archive.org/details/languagelinguist0000lyon/page/25 25] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=How Myths about Language Affect Education: What Every Teacher Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPsVxfVDXp0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the definitions of the terms &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary or sociopolitical motives.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcworther&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWhorter|first1=John|title=What's a Language, Anyway?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/|accessdate=19 July 2016|agency=The Atlantic|date=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;dialect&quot; is however sometimes restricted to mean &quot;non-standard variety&quot;, particularly in non-specialist settings and non-English linguistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Benedikt Perak, Robert Trask, Milica Mihaljević |date=2005| title=Temeljni lingvistički pojmovi |url= https://www.academia.edu/819390/Temeljni_lingvistički_pojmovi |language=sh|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schilling-Estes&gt;Schilling-Estes, Natalies.

* The other usage of the term &quot;dialect&quot;, specific to [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] settings in a few countries like [[Italy]], [[France]] (see ''[[:fr:patois|patois]]'') and the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Peter G.

In other words, it does not actually derive from the politically dominant language and is therefore not one of its [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]], but it is rather a separate and independently evolved language, albeit often historically [[cognate]] and/or [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]]. In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standardized language would not itself be considered a &quot;dialect&quot;, as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, be it in terms of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|linguistic prestige]], social or political (e.g. [[official language|official]]) status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Thus, these &quot;dialects&quot; are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same [[Language family|subfamily]] as the dominant language and may even, to a varying degree, share some [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standardized language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or [[speech community]] as the standardized language and instead may better fit various parties’ criteria for a separate language. The term &quot;dialect&quot; used this way implies a political connotation, being mostly used to refer to low-prestige languages (regardless of their actual degree of distance from the national language), languages lacking institutional support, or those perceived as unsuitable for writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Defenders of the Indigenous Languages of the Archipelago |title = Filipino is Not Our Language: Learn why it is Not and Find Out what it is |year = 2007 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3oLAQAAMAAJ | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation &quot;dialect&quot; is also used popularly to refer to the unwritten or non-codified languages of developing countries or isolated areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fodde Melis | first= Luisanna |title = Race, Ethnicity and Dialects: Language Policy and Ethnic Minorities in the United States |year = 2002 |isbn = 9788846439123 |publisher = FrancoAngeli |language = en |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal | first=David |title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |edition=6 |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4051-5296-9 |language=en |page=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the term &quot;[[vernacular|vernacular language]]&quot; would be preferred by linguists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=927 |title=Dialect, Language, Nation |first=Einar | last=Haugen |series=''American Anthropologist'' New Series, Vol. 68, No. 4 |language=en |jstor= 670407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features that distinguish dialects from each other can be found in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]) and [[grammar]], as well as in pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where the salient distinctions are only or mostly  to be observed in pronunciation, the more specific term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' may be used instead of ''dialect''. Other types of speech varieties include [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in lexicon; [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s; and [[argot]]s. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].

==Standard and non-standard dialect==
A ''[[standard dialect]]'' (also known as a &quot;standardized dialect&quot; or &quot;standard language&quot;) is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the &quot;correct&quot; form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a normative spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that variety (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[British English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].

A [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete grammar and vocabulary, but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]], [[New York English]], [[New England English]], [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic American]] or [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] / [[Baltimorese|Baltimore]] English, [[Scouse]], [[Brummie]], [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.

There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Cysouw, Michael; Good, Jeff. (2013). &quot;Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion 'Language'.&quot; ''Language Documentation and Conservation''. 7. 331–359. {{hdl|10125/4606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The western in its origins distinction (dichotomy) between dialect and language  is therefore subjective (arbitrary) and depends upon the user's preferred frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/ch/article/download/ch.2016.011/2342 [[Tomasz Kamusella]]. 2016. The History of the Normative Opposition of 'Language versus Dialect:' From Its Graeco-Latin Origin to Central Europe’s Ethnolinguistic Nation-States (pp 189-198). ''Colloquia Humanistica''. Vol 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there has been discussion about whether or not the [[Limón Creole English]] should be considered &quot;a kind&quot; of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendants of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends upon which University they represent.

=== Mutual intelligibility ===
One criterion, which is often considered to be purely linguistic,  is that of [[mutual intelligibility]]: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comrie2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lR9WDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|title=The World's Major Languages|last=Comrie|first=Bernard|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=978-1-317-29049-0|editor=Bernard Comrie|pages=2–3|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this definition cannot consistently delimit languages in the case of a [[dialect continuum]] (or dialect chain), containing a sequence of varieties, each mutually intelligible with the next, but where widely separated varieties may not be mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comrie2018&quot; /&gt;
Further problems with this criterion are that mutual intelligibility occurs in varying degrees, and that it is difficult to distinguish from prior familiarity with the other variety. Reported mutual intelligibility may also be affected by speakers' attitudes to the other speech community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Sociolinguistic definitions ===
[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local varieties in the West Germanic dialect continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=10}}]]
Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is the [[sociolinguistic]] notion of [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|linguistic authority]]. According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.
Thus these varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, [[Standard German]], which is said to be autonomous.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=10}}
In contrast, speakers in the Netherlands of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] varieties similar to Westphalian would instead consult a dictionary of [[Standard Dutch]].
Similarly, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the [[Middle High German]] group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would consult a different dictionary in such a case.

Within this framework, [[William Alexander Stewart|W. A. Stewart]] defined a ''language'' as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it, noting that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a ''dialect'' of a language defined in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot;/&gt;
In these terms, [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.{{sfnp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}
In the framework of [[Heinz Kloss]], these are described as languages by ''[[abstand and ausbau languages|ausbau]]'' (development) rather than by ''abstand'' (separation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | surname = Kloss | given = Heinz |  author-link = Heinz Kloss

  | year = 1967 | pages = 29–41
  | jstor = 30029461
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other situations, a closely related group of varieties possess considerable (though incomplete) mutual intelligibility, but none dominates the others.
To describe this situation, the editors of the ''Handbook of African Languages'' introduced the term ''dialect cluster'' as a classificatory unit at the same level as a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | title = A Handbook of African Languages

  | jstor = 1156320
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar situation, but with a greater degree of mutual unintelligibility, has been termed a ''language cluster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political factors ===
In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the [[elite]] class, comes to be identified as the &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;proper&quot; version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction and is contrasted with other varieties. As a result of this, in some contexts, the term &quot;dialect&quot; refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of &quot;dialect&quot;, language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':
* if they have no [[Standard variety|standard]] or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,
* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),
* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,
* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.

The status of &quot;language&quot; is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages in China, despite their mutual unintelligibility.

Modern [[nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate &quot;language&quot; is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate &quot;people&quot;, and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a &quot;dialect&quot; tends to be seen not as &quot;a people&quot; in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy or even armed conflict.

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|&quot;אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט&quot;}}: &quot;[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]&quot;) in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question &quot;what is a language?&quot; is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.

==={{anchor|languoid}}Terminology ===

By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a &quot;dialect&quot; of ''some'' language—&quot;everybody speaks a dialect&quot;. According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages.

The terms &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although it is often perceived to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/|title=There's No Such Thing as a ’Language’|last=McWhorter|first=John|date=2016-01-19|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is nothing contradictory in the statement &quot;the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]&quot;.

There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language. Perhaps the most common is &quot;[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=finegan&gt;{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;[[lect]]&quot; is another.  A more general term is &quot;languoid&quot;, which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Languoid &quot;Languoid&quot;] at ''Glottopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialect and accent==

[[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]] writes that &quot;Many linguists [...] subsume differences of accent under differences of dialect.&quot;{{r|Lyons}} In general, ''[[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]'' refers to variations in pronunciation, while ''dialect'' also encompasses specific variations in [[grammar]] and [[vocabulary]].{{sfnp|Lyons|1981|p=268}}

==Examples==

{{see also|Mesoamerican languages#Language vs. dialect|l1=Mesoamerican languages § Language vs. dialect}}

=== German ===
When talking about the German language, the term [[German dialects]] is only used for the traditional regional varieties. That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.

The German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. [[German dialectology]] traditionally names the major dialect groups after [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from which they were assumed to have descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutewriters.com/german-language-dialect-variations/|title=From dialect to variation space|last=Danvas|first=Kegesa|date=2016|website=Cutewriters|publisher=Cutewriters Inc.|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South. In cities, dialects are less common than in the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.

The situation in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries. The [[Swiss German]] dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is only spoken in education, partially in media, and with foreigners not possessing knowledge of Swiss German. Most Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.

The [[Low German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects. This reflects the modern situation where they are [[Dachsprache|roofed]] by standard German. This is different from the situation in the [[Middle Ages]] when Low German had strong tendencies towards an [[ausbau language]].

The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in Germany are excluded from the German dialects.

===Italy===
{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}
Italy is an often quoted example of a country where the second definition of the word &quot;dialect&quot; (''dialetto'') is most prevalent. Italy is in fact home to a [[Languages of Italy|vast array of languages]], most of which are [[Romance language|Latin-based]], lack [[mutual intelligibility]] with one another, and have their own local varieties; twelve of them ([[Arberesh language|Albanian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[French language|French]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Friulian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Occitan]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]) underwent [[Italianization]] to a varying degree (ranging from the critically [[Endangered language|endangered state]] displayed by Sardinian and Greek to the vigorous promotion of [[South Tyrolean dialect|South Tyrolean]]), but are officially recognized as [[Languages of Italy#Historical linguistic minorities|minority languages]] (''minoranze linguistiche storiche'') nowadays, in light of their distinctive historical development. Yet, most of the [[regional language]]s spoken across the peninsula are often colloquially referred to in non-linguistic circles as Italian ''dialetti'', since even the prestigious [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]] have had [[Vernacular|vulgar]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] as their [[Abstand and ausbau languages|reference language]] since the [[Middle Ages]]. However, only a few of them are actually derived from modern Italian, the majority being rather evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] separately and individually from one another and independently of Italian, long prior to the popular diffusion of the latter throughout what is now [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerrato&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/magazine/chiasmo/lettere_e_arti/1_identita_ssas_lingua_italiano.html|title=Che lingua parla un italiano?|publisher=Treccani.it|author=Domenico Cerrato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Risorgimento]], Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of Italian republicanism and [[Italian nationalism]], like the Lombard [[Alessandro Manzoni]], stressed the importance of establishing a uniform [[national language]] in order to better create an Italian [[national identity]].&lt;ref&gt;An often quoted paradigm of Italian nationalism is the ode on the [[Revolutions of 1820|Piedmontese revolution of 1821]] ([https://it.wikisource.org/wiki/Marzo_1821 ''Marzo 1821'']), wherein the Italian people are portrayed as &quot;one by military prowess, by language, by religion, by history, by blood, and by sentiment&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[unification of Italy]] in the 1860s, Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the other ones became to be institutionally regarded as subordinate dialects to Italian, and negatively associated with a lack of education.

In the early 20th century, the vast [[conscription]] of Italian men from all throughout Italy during [[World War I]] is credited with facilitating the diffusion of Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military. With the popular spread of standard Italian out of the intellectual circles, because of the mass-media and the establishment of [[public education]], Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to Italian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerrato&quot; /&gt; While [[dialect levelling|&quot;dialect&quot; levelling]] has increased the number of Italian speakers and decreased the number of speakers of other languages native to Italy, Italians in different regions have developed variations of standard Italian specific to their region. These variations of standard Italian, known as [[regional Italian]], would thus more appropriately be called &quot;dialects&quot; in accordance with the first linguistic definition of &quot;dialect&quot;, as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Loporcaro | first= Michele | year= 2009 | title= Profilo linguistico dei dialetti italiani | location= Bari | publisher= Laterza | ref= harv | language=Italian }}; {{cite book | last= Marcato | first= Carla | year= 2007 | title= Dialetto, dialetti e italiano | location= Bologna | publisher= Il Mulino | ref= harv | language=Italian}}; {{cite book| last= Posner | first= Rebecca | year= 1996 | title= The Romance languages | location= Cambridge | publisher= Cambridge University Press | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maiden/&gt;&lt;ref name=repetti&gt;{{cite book |last=Repetti |first=Lori |title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&amp;q=dialects+of+italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some degree of influence from the local or regional native languages and accents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerrato&quot; /&gt;

The most widely spoken languages of Italy fall within a family of which even Italian is part, the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian group]]. This wide category includes:
*the complex of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Central Italian|Central Italian dialects]], such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] in [[Rome]], with the addition of some distantly [[Corsican language|Corsican]]-derived varieties ([[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]]) spoken in Northern [[Sardinia]];
*the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan group]] (also known as &quot;Intermediate Meridional Italian&quot;), which encompasses not only [[Naples]]' and [[Campania]]'s speech but also a variety of related neighboring varieties like the [[Irpinian dialect]], [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] and Southern [[Marche]]giano, [[Molisan]], [[Calabrian language#Northern Calabrian (Cosentino)|Northern Calabrian or Cosentino]], and the [[Bari dialect]]. The [[Cilentan dialect]] of [[Salerno]], in [[Campania]], is considered significantly influenced by the Neapolitan and the below-mentioned language groups;
*the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian group]] (also known as &quot;Extreme Meridional Italian&quot;), including [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]] and centro-southern [[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]].

Modern Italian is heavily based on the [[Florentine dialect]] of [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cerrato&quot; /&gt; The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the [[12th century]], and it first spread outside the Tuscan linguistic borders through the works of the so-called ''tre corone'' (&quot;three crowns&quot;): [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. Florentine thus gradually rose to prominence as the ''volgare'' of the [[literate]] and [[upper class]] in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula and Sicily as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the Italian [[educated]] class as well as Italian travelling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of [[Tuscany]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.

Aside from the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] languages, the second most widespread family in Italy is the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic group]], spanning throghout much of [[Northern Italy]]'s languages and dialects (such as [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Emilian-Romagnol language|Emilian-Romagnol]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicily's]] and [[Gallo-Italic of Basilicata|Basilicata's]] Gallo-Italic in [[southern Italy]], etc.).

Finally, other languages from a number of different families follow the last two major groups: the [[Gallo-Romance languages]] ([[French language|French]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and its [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]]); the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]] ([[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Ladin language|Ladin]]); the [[Ibero-Romance languages]] ([[Sardinia]]'s [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]]); the [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]], [[Southern Bavarian]], [[Walser German]] and the [[Mòcheno language]]; the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Arbëresh language]]; the [[Hellenic language|Hellenic]] [[Griko language]] and [[Calabrian Greek]]; the [[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Slavomolisano dialect]]; and the various [[Slovene language]]s, including the [[Gail Valley dialect]] and [[Istrian dialect]]. The [[Sardinian language|language indigenous to Sardinia]], while being Romance in nature, is considered to be a specific linguistic family of its own, separate from all the other Neo-Latin groups; it is often subdivided into the [[Campidanese Sardinian|Centro-Southern]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Centro-Northern]] dialects.

Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which all the Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages; some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the [[dialect continuum]] are more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], a language in [[Northern Italy]]'s [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]] that includes the [[Bergamasque dialect]], would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]-speaking individual. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with an Occitan, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or French speaker than with an Italian or Sicilian speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian-speaking person would have a greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.

Today, the majority of Italian nationals are able to speak Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region.

=== The Balkans ===
The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrates this point. Serbo-Croatian has two major formal variants ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]). Both are based on the ''[[Shtokavian]]'' dialect and therefore mutually intelligible with differences found mostly in their respective local vocabularies and minor grammatical differences. Certain dialects of Serbia (''[[Torlakian]]'') and Croatia (''[[Kajkavian]]'' and ''[[Chakavian]]''), however, are not mutually intelligible even though they are usually subsumed under Serbo-Croatian. How these dialects should be classified in relation to Shtokavian remains a matter of dispute.

[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although largely mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and certain dialects of Serbo-Croatian ([[Torlakian dialect|Torlakian]]), is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in [[North Macedonia]], which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's North Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers &quot;[[Lebanese language|Lebanese]]&quot; to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin script]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.

===North Africa===
In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the [[Darija]]s (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]]. Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries. Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.

===Ukraine===
The [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. In the 19th century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of the [[Russian Empire]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language on its own. According to these claims, the differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in reality the dialects in Ukraine were developing independently from the dialects in the modern Russia for several centuries, and as a result they differed substantially.

Following the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk Treaty]], the [[German Empire]] briefly [[Ukraine during World War I|gained control over Ukraine]] during [[World War I]], but was eventually defeated by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], with major involvement by Russian Bolsheviks. After Bolsheviks managed to conquer the rest of Ukraine from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], Ukraine became part of the USSR, whence a process of [[Ukrainization]] was begun, with encouragement from Moscow. However, in the late 1920s - early 1930s, the process started to reverse. Witnessing the Ukrainian cultural revival spurred by the Ukrainization in the early 1920s, and fearing that it might lead to an independence movement, Moscow started to remove from power and in some cases [[Executed Renaissance|physically eliminate the public proponents]] of Ukrainization. The appointment of [[Pavel Postyshev]] as the secretary of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] marked the end of [[Ukrainization]], and the opposite process of [[Russification]] started. After World War II, citing [[Ukrainian collaboration with Nazi Germany]] in an attempt to gain independence as the reason, Moscow changed its policy towards increasing repression of the Ukrainian language.

Today the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called [[Surzhyk]], developing in Ukraine, also known as [[balachka]] in Ukrainian ethnic territories controlled by Russia.

===Moldova===
There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of &quot;Romanian expansionism&quot;, rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan–Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion Bărbuţă, described the dictionary as a politically motivated &quot;absurdity&quot;.

===Greater China===
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese#Classification}}
Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, [[Chinese characters]] have developed from [[logograms]] that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties of the spoken language]] are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] often show traces of [[Old Chinese]] or [[Middle Chinese]]. From the [[Ming dynasty]] onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], [[Standard Mandarin]] was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as ''fangyan'' (regional speech). [[Cantonese]] is still the most commonly-used language in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] has been accepted in [[Taiwan]] as an important local language alongside [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].

{{Main|Interlingua}}

One language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.&lt;ref name=&quot;coljld&quot;&gt;[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814204450/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2006-08-14 }}. New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from such concepts as the [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[Standard Average European]], linguists{{who|date=July 2013}} developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Researchers at the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.&lt;ref name = &quot;jawmqc&quot;&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.&lt;ref name = &quot;coljld&quot;/&gt; This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.&lt;ref name = &quot;jawmqc&quot;/&gt;
