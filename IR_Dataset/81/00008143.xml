&lt;br /&gt;{{Calendar}}
'''December''' is the twelfth and final month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian Calendar]]s. It is also the last of seven months to have a length of 31 days. [[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry décembre.jpg|right|thumb|December, from the ''Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry'']]

December got its name from the Latin word ''decem'' (meaning [[10 (number)|ten]]) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the [[Roman calendar#Legendary 10-month calendar|calendar of Romulus]] {{circa|750 {{sc|bc}}}} which began in March. The winter days following December were not included as part of any month. Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.&lt;ref name=Macrobius&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''[[Saturnalia]]'', tr. Percival Vaughan Davies (New York: Columbia University Press, 1969), book I, chapters 12–13, pp. 89–95.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Ancient Rome]], as one of the four [[Agonalia]], this day in honor of [[Sol Indiges]] was held on December 11, as was [[Septimontium]]. [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|Dies natalis]] (birthday) was held at the temple of [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] on December 13, [[Consualia]] was held on December 15, [[Saturnalia]] was held December 17–23, [[Opiconsivia]] was held on December 19, [[Divalia]] was held on December 21, [[Larentalia]] was held on December 23, and the dies natalis of [[Sol Invictus]] was held on December 25. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. 

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] referred to December–January as [[Ġēolamonaþ]] (modern English: &quot;[[Yule]] month&quot;). The [[French Republican Calendar]] contained December within the months of [[Frimaire]] and [[Nivôse]].

==Astronomy==
[[File:Hans Bol - Adriaen Collaert - Emblemata evangelica - Erfgoedfonds Koning Boudewijnstichting - Fonds du Patrimoine Fondation Roi Baudouin - 12.jpg|thumb|Month December depicted in Hans Bol's and Adriaen Collart's ''Emblematica Evangelica.'' ]]
December contains the [[winter solstice]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the day with the fewest daylight hours, and the [[summer solstice]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the day with the most daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). December in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to [[June]] in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the astronomical [[winter]] is traditionally 21 December or the date of the solstice.

Meteor showers occurring in December are the [[Andromedids]] (September 25 – December 6, peaking around November 9), the  [[Canis-Minorids]] (December 4 – December 15, peaking around December 10–11), the [[Coma Berenicids]] (December 12 to December 23, peaking around December 16), the [[Delta Cancrids]] (December 14 to February 14, the main shower from January 1 to January 24, peaking on January 17), the [[Geminids]] (December 13–14), the [[Monocerotids]] (December 7 to December 20, peaking on December 9. This shower can also start in November), the [[Phoenicids]] (November 29 to December 9, with a peak occurring around 5/6 December), the [[Quadrantids]] (typically a January shower but can also start in December), the [[Sigma Hydrids]] (December 4–15), and the [[Ursids]] (December 17-to December 25/26, peaking around December 22).

==Astrology==
*The [[zodiac]] signs for the month of December are [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (until December 21) and [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] (December 22 onwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zodiac signs and date ranges used in astrology|url=http://mistupid.com/zodiac/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
