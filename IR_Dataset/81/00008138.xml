'''Dino Zoff''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdiːno dˈdzɔf}}; born 28 February 1942) is an Italian former professional [[Goalkeeper (association football)|football goalkeeper]] and is the oldest ever winner of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], which he earned as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] of the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 tournament]] in Spain, at the age of 40 years, 4 months and 13 days, also winning the award for best [[FIFA World Cup awards|goalkeeper of the tournament]], and being elected to the team of the tournament for his performances, keeping two clean-sheets, an honour he also received after winning the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] on home soil; he is the only Italian player to have won both the World Cup and the European Championship.&lt;ref name=rai&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rai.it/dl/raisport/Articoli/ContentItem-656fbe5d-8c4d-4963-bbbb-a4a73be9484f.html|title=I 70 anni di Dino Zoff|publisher=[[RAI]]|accessdate=15 July 2016|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoff also achieved great club success with Juventus, winning 6 [[Serie A]] titles, 2 [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and a [[1976–77 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], also reaching two [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]] finals in the [[1972–73 European Cup|1972–73]] and [[1982–83 European Cup|1982–83]] seasons, as well as finishing second in the [[1973 Intercontinental Cup|1973 Intercontinental Cup final]].

In 2004 [[Pelé]] named him as one of the [[FIFA 100|100 greatest living footballers]]. In the same year, Zoff placed fifth in the [[UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll]], and was elected as [[UEFA Jubilee Awards|Italy's golden player of the past 50 years]]. He also placed second in the [[1973 Ballon d'Or]], as he narrowly missed out on a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Juventus. In 1999, Zoff placed 47th in [[World Soccer magazine|World Soccer Magazine's]] ''100 Greatest Players of the Twentieth Century''.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Soccer Players of the Century&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamHons/HonsWldSocPlyrsCent.html|title=World Soccer Players of the Century|publisher=World Soccer|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring as a footballer, Zoff went on to pursue a [[Association football manager|managerial]] career, coaching the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]], with which he reached the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|Euro 2000 Final]], and several other Italian clubs, including his former club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], with which he won an [[1989–90 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and a [[1989–90 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] double during the [[1989–90 Serie A|1989–90 season]], trophies he had also won as a player. In September 2014, Zoff published his Italian autobiography ''Dura Solo un Attimo la Gloria'' (&quot;Glory only Lasts a Moment&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dura solo un attimo la gloria&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/22-09-2014/zoff-si-inventa-scrittore-dura-solo-attimo-gloria-90524322651.shtml|title=Calcio, Zoff si inventa scrittore: &quot;Dura solo un attimo la gloria&quot;|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=22 September 2014|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dino Zoff was born in [[Mariano del Friuli]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], [[Italy]] into a farming family. Upon his father's suggestion, Zoff initially also pursued studies to be a mechanic in case his football career proved to be unsuccessful. As a young aspiring footballer, Zoff was also interested in other sports, and his two main role models were the cyclist [[Fausto Coppi]], and the race walker [[Abdon Pamich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff: The quiet genius&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy’s towering guardian|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=44786/profile.html|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Udinese, Mantova and Napoli===
[[File:Zoff, Juliano en Hamrin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Zoff (left) with Napoli in January 1970, beside [[Antonio Juliano]] and [[Kurt Hamrin]], at Schiphol for the match of [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] versus [[Ajax F.C.|Ajax Amsterdam]].]]

Zoff's career got off to an inauspicious start, when at the age of fourteen he had trials with [[Inter Milan]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], but was rejected due to a lack of height.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff: The quiet genius&quot;/&gt; Five years later, having grown by 33 centimetres (supposedly due to his grandmother Adelaide's recommended increased daily intake of eight eggs),&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff: The quiet genius&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vecchietti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2051724.html?rss=2051724+I+%27vecchietti%27+del+Campionato+Europeo+UEFA|title=I 'vecchietti' del Campionato Europeo UEFA|publisher=UEFA.com|language=Italian|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he made his [[Serie A]] debut with [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] on 24 September 1961, in a 5–2 defeat to [[AC Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], although Zoff was not criticised for any of the goals he conceded.&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dino-zoff_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=Zoff, Dino|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport|author1=Fabrizio Maffei|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoff made only four appearances in his [[1961–62 Serie A|first season]] for Udinese, as they were relegated to [[Serie B]]. He played the [[1962–63 Serie B|next season]] as the club's starting goalkeeper, helping the club to [[1963–64 Serie A|Serie A promotion]], before moving to [[Mantova F.C.|Mantova]] in 1963, where he spent four seasons, making 131 appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dino Zoff|url=http://www.uniparmaclub.it/ita/campioni/Dino%20Zoff.pdf|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His performances for Mantova in the top flight caught the attention of larger clubs, while Italy's national coach at the time, [[Edmondo Fabbri]], even considered bringing him as a back-up for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], although he ultimately chose to bring Enrico Albertosi, [[Roberto Anzolin]], and [[Pierluigi Pizzaballa]] instead. In 1967, Zoff was transferred to [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], in exchange for fellow goalkeeper Claudio Bandoni, and a transfer fee of 130 million Lire; he spent five seasons in Naples, making 143 Serie A appearances with the club. During this time, he began to achieve increasing recognition in Italy, also making his International debut with the [[Italy national football team|Italian national side]] in 1968, and earning a place in Italy's squads at [[UEFA Euro 1968|Euro 68]] and the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff - biografia&quot;/&gt;

===Juventus===
Following his achievements with the national side, and due to his performances during his time with Napoli, Zoff was signed by [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 1972, at the age of 30, where he resumed his success. In eleven years with Juventus, Zoff won the [[Serie A]] championship six times, the [[Coppa Italia]] twice and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] once, also reaching two [[European cup finals|European Cup finals]], another semi-final in [[1977–78 European Cup|1978]] (during which Zoff played a decisive role in the club's shoot-out victory over [[Ajax F.C.|Ajax]] in the quarter-finals by saving two penalties),&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff fa 75&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://it.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ita/news/newsid=1760638.html|title=Dino Zoff fa 75: cinque grandi partite|publisher=UEFA.com|language=Italian|author1=Paolo Menicucci|date=28 February 2017|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the semi-finals of the [[European Cup Winners' Cup 1979–80|European Cup Winners' Cup]] during the 1979–80 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt; In 1973, he placed second in the [[1973 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]], following his [[1972–73 Serie A|Serie A title]] victory, also narrowly missing out on an historical [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Juventus, after reaching both the [[1972–73 European Cup|European Cup]] and the [[Coppa Italia]] finals that season, in which his club were defeated, however; Juventus also finished as runners-up in the [[1973 Intercontinental Cup]] that year. In winning the [[1977 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Athletic Bilbao]], Zoff came out on top against his 'twin', the Basque goalkeeper [[José Ángel Iribar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/iribar-jose.html|title=Iribar Josè: il gemello di Zoff|trans-title=Iribar Josè: Zoff's twin|publisher=Storie di Calcio|author1=Giuseppe Ottomano|language=it|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2014/06/12/mundial_futbol/1402597532_108260.html|title=&quot;Casillas va a tener un papel estelar&quot;|trans-title=&quot;Casillas will have a starring role&quot;|newspaper=[[El País]]|author=Eduardo Rodrigálvarez|language=es|date=12 June 2014|accessdate=14 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Zoff made 479 [[Juventus F.C. statistics and records|appearances for Juventus]] in all competitions, making 330 [[Serie A]] appearances with the club (all of which came consecutively, a club record),&lt;ref name=&quot;Zoff shares Buffon record&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/node/12813|title=Zoff shares Buffon record|publisher=Football Italia|date=13 November 2011|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 74 in the [[Coppa Italia]], 71 in [[UEFA club competitions|European Competitions]], and 4 in other Club Competitions. He is currently [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus's]] 6th record appearance holder in all competitions, their 7th all-time appearance holder in Serie A, their 3rd all-time appearance holder in the Coppa Italia, their 7th all-time appearance holder in [[Juventus F.C. in European football|UEFA Club competitions]], and their 9th all-time appearance holder in international club competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=44786/quotes.html|title=Classic Football: Dino Zoff – I was there| publisher= FIFA Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Juventus FC - 1975 - Dino Zoff &amp; Massimo Piloni.jpg|thumb|Zoff (left) with Juventus in 1975, beside his substitute [[Massimo Piloni]]; on background, [[Fabio Capello]].]]

Zoff won his final Serie A championship with Juventus during the [[1981–82 Serie A]] season, also winning the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Italy national football team|Italy]] that year, as his team's captain. During the following [[1982–83 Serie A|1982–83]] season, the final season of his career, Dino Zoff won the [[Coppa Italia]] with [[1981–82 Serie A|defending Serie A champions]] Juventus, and he reached his second [[1983 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] with the club in 1983; Juventus were defeated 1–0 by [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] in Athens on 25 May, after Zoff was beaten by [[Felix Magath]]'s long-distance strike; this was the final match of his career. His final league appearance came in a 4–2 home win over [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] on 15 May 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt;

===Club records===
Upon retirement, Zoff held the records for the oldest [[Football records in Italy|Serie A]] player, at the age of 41, and the most [[Serie A]] appearances (570 matches) for more than 20 years, until the [[2005–06 Serie A|2005–06 season]], when the records were broken by [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] goalkeeper [[Marco Ballotta]], and [[A.C. Milan]] defender [[Paolo Maldini]] respectively. Behind only former A.C. Milan goalkeeper [[Sebastiano Rossi]], who overtook him during the 1993–94 season, Zoff has [[Football records in Italy#Goalkeeping|conceded the fewest goals in a single Serie A season]]; behind only [[Gianluigi Buffon]] and Sebastiano Rossi, he has also gone the [[Football records in Italy|most time unbeaten in Serie A]] without conceding a goal, producing a 903-minute unbeaten streak during the 1972–73 season, a record that stood until Rossi overtook him in the 1993–94 season;{{refn|[[Gianpiero Combi]]'s Italian league record unbeaten streak of 934 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal was set during the [[1925–26 Prima Divisione]] season, prior to the establishment of the Serie A in the [[1929–30 Serie A|1929–30 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;20.12.1902&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2014/12/20/news/20_dicembre_1902_nasce_combi_il_nonno_di_zoff_e_buffon-103364637/|title=20 dicembre 1902: nasce Combi, il &quot;nonno&quot; di Zoff e Buffon|newspaper=La Repubblica|language=Italian|date=20 December 2014|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From the third match (Juventus 6–0 Milan on 25 October 1925) to thirteenth match (Parma 0–3 Juventus on 28 February 1926) of the [[1925–26 Prima Divisione|1925–26 FIGC Football Championship]] according to {{in lang|it}} [http://www.juworld.net/partite-della-juventus.asp?Pagina=14&amp;c=Campionato%20a%20gironi All Juventus FC matches: Italian Federal Championship (pages 14 and 15)] - www.juworld.net.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/20/torino-juventus-serie-a-match-report-gianluigi-buffon-record|title=Gianluigi Buffon sets goalkeeping record as Juventus sweep aside Torino|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=&quot;combi-record&quot;|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Buffon broke the record during the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/81164/zoff-buffon-best|title=Zoff: 'Buffon is the best'|publisher=Football Italia|date=12 March 2016|accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buffon sets new Serie A record&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/81599/buffon-sets-new-serie-record|title=Buffon sets new Serie A record|publisher=Football Italia|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also held the Serie A record for most consecutive clean sheets alongside Rossi (9), until Gianluigi Buffon overtook them both with his 10th consecutive clean sheet in 2016. With 570 Serie A appearances, Zoff is also the [[Football records in Italy#Appearances|sixth highest appearance holder in Serie A]] of all time, and he is the fourth oldest player in Serie A to have ever played a match.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; He holds the record for most consecutive matches played in Serie A (332), a streak which went unbroken from 21 May 1972 (in a 0–0 home draw with Napoli against [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]]), until his final league appearance with Juventus in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt; At 41 years and 86 days, Zoff is also the oldest player to have appeared in a European Cup or UEFA Champions League Final.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juventus rallies around stricken legend Dino Zoff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/seri/news/895283|title=Juventus rallies around stricken legend Dino Zoff|publisher=The Score|date=28 November 2015|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Prior to representing the senior Italian side, Zoff had won a gold medal with the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-23 side]] at the [[1963 Mediterranean Games]]. On 20 April 1968, Zoff made his senior debut for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], playing in a 2–0 win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the quarter finals of the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championships]], in Naples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nazionale in cifre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=1096&amp;squadra=1|title=Nazionale in cifre: Zoff, Dino|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoff ended up being promoted to starting goalkeeper over his perceived career rival [[Enrico Albertosi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2002/ottobre/18/Zenga_Tacconi_quando_rivalita_era_ga_0_0210182815.shtml|title=Zenga e Tacconi: quando la rivalità era uno spettacolo|newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|author1=Fabio Bianchi|date=18 October 2002|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the tournament, and Italy proceeded to win the European Championship on home soil, with Zoff taking home a winners' medal after only his fourth international appearance, keeping two clean sheets, and winning the award for the best goalkeeper of the tournament. Zoff was left out of the Italian starting eleven in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], however, and was Albertosi's deputy throughout the tournament, as Italy went on to reach the [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] of the World Cup, and was defeated 4–1 by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. He returned to the starting line-up, however, ahead of Albertosi, in Italy's disappointing [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] campaign, during which they would be eliminated in the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Sandro Pertini Spagna 1982.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|[[Franco Causio]], the Italian president [[Sandro Pertini]], Zoff (lower left) and the coach [[Enzo Bearzot]] on their return from Spain with the 1982 World Cup they just won.]]

From 1972 onwards, Zoff became Italy's undisputed number 1, and he participated in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] with Italy, during which he managed a fourth-place finish, keeping 3 clean-sheets. Italy were eliminated in the semi-final, in a 2–1 loss to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. After the match, Zoff was criticised for making a fairly uncommon error, as he was beaten by a strike from distance by [[Arie Haan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Zoff was also Italy's starting goalkeeper once again at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] on home soil, however, helping his side to reach the semi-finals, finishing the tournament in fourth place once again. During the 1980 European Championship, Zoff kept three clean sheets, only conceding one goal in the bronze medal match, which Italy would lose on penalties; Zoff was elected as the goalkeeper of the tournament once again, an honour he had previously managed after winning the tournament in 1968. Throughout these two tournaments, Zoff established a record for most consecutive minutes unbeaten in a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]], which was later beaten by [[Iker Casillas]] in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]]. Zoff had also established the record for most minutes unbeaten European Championship qualifying, which was also beaten, by compatriot Buffon in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|2011]]. He still holds the record, however, for most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal at the European Championships including qualifying, having kept eight consecutive cleans sheets between 1975 and 1980, while going unbeaten for 784 minutes. Alongside Casillas, Buffon, and [[Thomas Myhre]], he is the goalkeeper with the fewest goals conceded in a single edition of the European Championships, having conceded only one goal in the 1968 European Championships; of these players, only Zoff and Casillas won the title while achieving this feat.

Zoff's greatest accomplishment, however, came in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] in Spain, where he captained Italy to victory in the tournament at the age of 40, making him the oldest ever winner of the World Cup; throughout the tournament, he kept two clean sheets, and produced a crucial goal-line save in the final minutes of the last second-round group match against favourites Brazil on 5 July, which enabled the Italians to earn a 3–2 victory and advance to the semi-finals of the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World Cup Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/|title=World Cup Hall of Fame: Dino Zoff|newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912055524/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/zoff/|archivedate=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;esclusiva&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/calcio/2013/articoli/1014373/dino-zoff-in-esclusiva-su-premium-calcio-buffon-meglio-di-me-no-sono-piu-bravo-io-.shtml|title=Dino Zoff, in esclusiva su Premium Calcio: &quot;Buffon meglio di me?

Due to his performances, he was voted as the [[World Cup Golden Glove|Best Goalkeeper of the Tournament]]. Regarding Zoff's importance during Italy's victorious World Cup campaign, his manager [[Enzo Bearzot]] said of him:&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
{{Quote|&quot;He was a level-headed goalkeeper, capable of staying calm during the toughest and the most exhilarating moments. He always held back both out of modesty and respect for his opponents. At the end of the Brazil match, he came over to give me a kiss on the cheek, without saying a single word. For me, that fleeting moment was the most intense of the entire World Cup.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff: The quiet genius&quot;/&gt;}}

Zoff also holds the record for the longest stretch (1142 minutes) without allowing any goals in international football, set between 1972 and 1974. That clean sheet stretch was ended by Haitian player [[Emmanuel Sanon|Manno Sanon]]'s beautiful goal during the 1974 World Cup. Zoff made his final appearance for Italy on 29 May 1983, in a 2–0 away loss to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], in a [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying|Euro 1984 qualifying match]]. At the time of his retirement, Zoff's 112 caps were the most ever by a member of the Italian national team. He currently sits in sixth place in this category, as well as second among goalkeepers, with Gianluigi Buffon having surpassed the latter record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Style of play==
Zoff was a traditional, effective, and experienced goalkeeper, who usually favoured efficiency and caution over flamboyance when making saves, although he was also capable of producing spectacular dives and decisive saves when necessary due to his strength and athleticism. He was particularly regarded for his outstanding positioning and handling of the ball, in particular when coming out to collect crosses, as well as his concentration, consistency, calm mindset, and composure under pressure; he also possessed good reactions and excellent shot-stopping abilities. Zoff was also noted for his attention to detail during matches, as well as his ability to read the game, anticipate his opponents, communicate with his defenders, and organise his back-line, which also enabled him to start attacking plays quickly from the back after claiming the ball. Despite his serious and reserved character, Zoff also drew praise for his leadership skills, correct behaviour, and competitive spirit, which led him to serve as captain of his national side, and enabled him to inspire a sense of calmness and confidence in his teammates. On occasion, however, Zoff was accused by certain pundits of occasionally struggling when facing long-range shots, and for not always being particularly adept at stopping penalties. Known for his work-rate in training, dedication, and discipline as a footballer, in addition to his goalkeeping skills, Zoff also stood out for his stamina, longevity, and determination, which enabled him to avoid injuries and have an extensive and highly successful career; due to his constant desire to improve himself, he was able to maintain a consistent level of performance throughout his entire career, even with his advancing age towards the end of his career, into his late 30s and early 40s.&lt;ref name=rai/&gt;&lt;ref name=figc/&gt;&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff: The quiet genius&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vecchietti&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff - biografia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tuttojuve.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zoff, 70 years of quiet success&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/news/y=2012/m=2/news=zoff-years-quiet-success-1590503.html|title=Zoff, 70 years of quiet success|publisher=FIFA.com|date=27 February 2012|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2015-01-13/ronaldo-pallone-d-oro-ma-io-avrei-premiato-neuer-083419.shtml?refresh_ce=1|title=Ronaldo Pallone d'Oro, ma io avrei premiato Neuer|newspaper=Il Sole 24 Ore|language=Italian|author1=Mattia Losi|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportmediaset.mediaset.it/calcio/calcio_la_nazionale/articoli/77811/zoff-elogio-del-silenzio.shtml|title=Zoff, elogio del silenzio|publisher=Mediaset|language=Italian|author1=Carlo Landoni|date=28 February 2012|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forzaitalianfootball&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2011/12/italys-best-ever-goalkeeper-dino-zoff-or-gianluigi-buffon/|title=Italy’s Best Ever Goalkeeper: Dino Zoff Or Gianluigi Buffon?|publisher=forzaitalianfootball.com|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/news/newsid=949435.html|title=Casillas names his top ten No1s|publisher=UEFA.org|author1=Guillem Balagué|date=5 February 2010|accessdate=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zoff or Buffon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/node/12901|title=Zoff or Buffon – who is No 1? – Football Italia|publisher=Football Italia|author=Giancarlo Rinaldi|date=16 November 2011|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pianetagenoa1893.net/la-storia-del-genoa/quella-maledizione-dei-rigori-con-la-juve-tutta-da-sfatare-per-il-genoa/|title=Quella maledizione dei rigori con la Juve, tutta da sfatare per il Genoa|publisher=www.pianetagenoa1893.net|language=Italian|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uno su tutti&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it//2005/settembre/03/Uno_tutti_sw_0_0509031892.shtml |title=Uno su tutti |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |author1=Iacopo Iandiorio |date=3 September 2005 |accessdate=30 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time,&lt;ref name=&quot;planetworldcup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/LEGENDS/zoff.html|title=Dino Zoff (Italy)|publisher=Planet World Cup|accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11945/9846554/is-bayern-munichs-manuel-neuer-the-best-goalkeeper-ever|title=Is Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer the best goalkeeper ever?|publisher=www.skysports.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 he was elected in a poll by the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics|IFFHS]] as the third best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] of the 20th Century – after [[Lev Yashin]] (1st) and [[Gordon Banks]] (2nd) – as well as Italy's best keeper of the century, and the second best European keeper of the century – behind only Yashin.&lt;ref name=rsssf.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;

==Coaching career==

After his retirement as a player, Zoff went into coaching, joining the technical staff at Juventus, initially as a goalkeeping coach, although this experience proved to be unsatisfactory for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt; He subsequently coached the Italian Olympic side, his first experience as a coach, helping the team to qualify for the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympic Games]] in Seoul, before returning to Juventus in a coaching role; the Italian Olympic side eventually managed a fourth-place finish in the final tournament. Zoff served as Juventus's head coach from 1988 to 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt; In 1990, he was sacked, however, despite winning the [[1989–90 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and the [[1989–90 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] during the [[1989–90 Serie A|1989–90 season]], while also helping the club to a third-place finish in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt; He then joined [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he became the coach in 1994, and later the club's sporting director, winning the [[Coppa Italia]] in [[1997–98 Coppa Italia|1998]], and helping the club to an [[1997–98 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] final the same season, and was defeated by compatriots [[Inter Milan|Inter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt;

In 1998, Zoff was appointed as the head coach of the Italian national team. Although Italy were still cautious and organised defensively, Zoff used a more open, fluid, and attacking style of play than that used by his more defensive Italian coaching predecessors [[Cesare Maldini]] and [[Arrigo Sacchi]]. Zoff helped the team to [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|qualify for Euro 2000]], and he introduced several younger players to the team, such as [[Francesco Totti]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Stefano Fiore]], [[Massimo Ambrosini]], [[Christian Abbiati]], [[Marco Delvecchio]], and [[Vincenzo Montella]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Juventus rallies around stricken legend Dino Zoff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani-nazionali&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/calcio-competizioni-per-nazionali_%28Enciclopedia-dello-Sport%29/ |title=CALCIO - COMPETIZIONI PER NAZIONALI |publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002) |language=Italian |last1=Bortolotti |first1=Adalberto |last2=D'Orsi |first2=Enzo |last3=Dotto |first3=Matteo |last4=Ricci |first4=Filippo Maria |accessdate=26 February 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/2015/09/12-3939595/zoff_berlusconi_bearzot_e_totti_vi_svelo_tutto/ |title=Zoff: «Berlusconi, Bearzot e Totti.

En route to the final, a ten-man Italy had eliminated co-hosts the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semi-finals in a penalty shoot-out, after a 0–0 draw, following extra-time, with a tightly contested defensive display against a more offensive minded Dutch side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/camp_europeo/itasemi/itasemi/itasemi.html|title=Italia, finale da leggenda Olanda spreca e va fuori|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=Giancarlo Mola|date=29 June 2000|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/pele-picks-france-in-euro-final-1.209184 s |title=Pele picks France in Euro final |work=CBC |last1=Casert |first1=Raf |date=30 June 2000 |accessdate=26 February 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final of the tournament, Italy had been 1–0 up for most of the second half, and were less than sixty seconds away from winning the tournament, before France forward [[Sylvain Wiltord]] scored in the fourth and final minute of stoppage time to equalise, and send the match into extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Sport/europei-nella-storia/europei-nella-storia-2000.shtml?uuid=9c1964f2-313d-11dd-9186-00000e251029&amp;DocRulesView=Libero|title=2000, Italia battuta in finale. L'Europeo alla Francia|newspaper=Il Sole 24 Ore|language=Italian|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite reaching the final, Zoff resigned a few days later, following strong criticism from [[A.C. Milan]] president and [[Forza Italia|politician]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/euro2000/news/20000704itazoff.html|title=Zoff resigned after attack from Berlusconi|publisher=espnfc.com|author=Ivan Speck|date=4 July 2000|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoff was voted the [[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]] Manager of the Year in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Soccer Awards&quot;/&gt;

Zoff returned to defending [[1999–2000 Serie A|Serie A]], [[1999–2000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], and [[2000 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]] champions Lazio as a manager for the next season, replacing [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] in 2001, and finishing third in [[2000–01 Serie A|Serie A]]. The following season, he resigned on 20 September, after only the third match, due to a poor start to the [[2001–02 Serie A|2001–02 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;treccani1&quot;/&gt; In [[2004–05 Serie A|2005]], he was named the coach of [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] as a replacement for [[Sergio Buso]]. Despite saving the team from [[relegation]] on the last day of the season, Zoff was let go.

==Style of management==
As a manager, Zoff was known for his use of tactics based upon the [[zona mista]] system (or &quot;Gioco all'Italiana&quot;), which was a cross between the ''[[catenaccio]]'' [Marking (association football)#Man-to-man marking|man-marking]] and [[Marking (association football)#Zonal marking|zonal marking]] systems. His teams often used a [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]], who, in addition to his defensive duties and organisational responsibilities, was also required to start plays from the back. He preferred not to base his team's play on set plays and formations, as he believed that cultivating a good relationship with his players and fostering a winning team mentality were the keys to getting the best out of them, and that this would also allow their natural creativity to come through in matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;libero&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1990/05/18/subito-libero-da-questa-juve.html|title='SUBITO LIBERO DA QUESTA JUVE'|newspaper=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=MARCO E.

==Personal life==
Zoff is married to Annamaria Passerini; they have a son, Marco, born in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy’s towering guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dino Zoff - biografia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinquantamila.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=ZOFF+Dino|title=Dino Zoff - biografia - cinquantamila.it|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|language=Italian|author1=Giorgio Dell’Arti|author2=Massimo Parrini|date=5 October 2008|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoff is [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lafedequotidiana.it/dino-zoff-la-fede-mi-aiutato-durante-la-mia-malattia/ lafedequotidiana]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2015, it was reported Zoff was hospitalized for three weeks with a viral neurological infection, which made it difficult for him to walk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/76375/zoff-reportedly-hospital|title=Zoff reportedly in hospital|publisher=Football Italia|date=28 November 2015|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/dino-zoff-hospitalized-with-viral-infection/|title=Dino Zoff hospitalized with viral infection|publisher=Sports Net|date=28 November 2015|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 December 2015, it was reported Zoff had been recovering well, however stating, &quot;For the first time in my life, I was actually afraid... When I say scared, I wasn't afraid for myself, but for those around me. My wife, my son, my grandchildren. My tribe, basically. I would've really hurt them by leaving.&quot; He also revealed, &quot;One night I saw two figures at the end of my bed. They had the faces of [[Gaetano Scirea]] [one of his former, deceased teammates] and [[Enzo Bearzot]] [one of his former, deceased coaches]. They were both smiling. I wasn't asleep, it wasn't a dream. I told them: 'Not yet, not now.' And I am still here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/77528/zoff-i-saw-bearzot|title=Zoff: 'I saw Bearzot'|publisher=Football Italia|date=23 December 2015|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
