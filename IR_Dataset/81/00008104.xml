==Definitions of words==
As recently as 2005, considerable controversy existed over the proper definition of the term &quot;desertification&quot;. Helmut Geist (2005) identified more than 100 formal definitions. The most widely accepted&lt;ref name=&quot;Geist-2005-p2&quot;&gt;Geist (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=acbWdynlU3cC&amp;pg=PA2 p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; of these was that of the [[Princeton University]] Dictionary which defined it as &quot;the process of fertile land ''transforming into desert'' typically as a result of [[deforestation]], drought or improper/inappropriate agriculture&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;However, this original understanding that desertification involved the physical expansion of deserts has been rejected as the concept has evolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB2&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desertification has been neatly defined in the text of the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) as &quot;land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unccd.int/en/about-the-convention/Pages/Text-Part-I.aspx|title=Part I|accessdate=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607231107/http://www.unccd.int/en/about-the-convention/Pages/Text-Part-I.aspx|archive-date=7 June 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major contribution to the controversy comes from the sub-grouping of types of desertification, spanning from the very vague yet shortsighted view as the &quot;man-made-desert&quot; to the broader yet less focused type as the &quot;non-pattern-desert&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut J. Geist, and Eric F. Lambin. &quot;Dynamic Causal Patterns of Desertification.&quot; BioScience 54.9 (2004): 817 . Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The world's most noted [[deserts]] have been formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time. During most of these times, deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities. Paleodeserts are large [[sand sea]]s now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation, some extending beyond the present margins of core deserts, such as the [[Sahara]], the largest hot desert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Desertification&quot;&gt;United States Geological Survey, [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/ &quot;Desertification&quot;], 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical evidence shows that the serious and extensive land deterioration occurring several centuries ago in arid regions had three epicenters: the Mediterranean, the Mesopotamian Valley, and the [[Loess Plateau]] of China, where population was dense.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOWDERMILK&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb1043789.pdf|title=CONQUEST OF THE LAND THROUGH SEVEN THOUSAND YEARS|last=LOWDERMILK|first=W C|work=Soil Conservation Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dregne|first=H.E.|title=Desertification of Arid Lands|url=http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/docs/002-193/002-193.html|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known discussion of the topic arose soon after the [[French colonization]] of [[West Africa]], when the Comité d'Etudes commissioned a study on ''desséchement progressif'' to explore the prehistoric expansion of the Sahara Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mortimore, Michael|title=Adapting to drought: farmers, famines, and desertification in West Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-521-32312-3|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dx89AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drylands]] occupy approximately 40–41% of Earth’s land area&lt;ref&gt;Bauer (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=mR3E4xJFNw0C&amp;pg=PA78 p. 78]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson-1&quot;&gt;Johnson et al (2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=da6vhzHEpf0C&amp;pg=PA1 p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; and are home to more than 2 billion people.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson-1&quot; /&gt; It has been estimated that some 10–20% of drylands are already degraded, the total area affected by desertification being between 6 and 12 million square kilometres, that about 1–6% of the inhabitants of drylands live in desertified areas, and that a billion people are under threat from further desertification.&lt;ref name=&quot;holtz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unccd.int/un-decade-deserts-and-fight-against-desertification-impact-and-role-drylands|title=UNCCD: Impact and role of drylands|last=|first=|date=10 October 2017|website=UNCCD|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=7 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=World Bank|title=Gender in agriculture sourcebook|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8213-7587-7|page=454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxBrq6hTs_UC&amp;pg=PA454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1998, the then-current degree of southward expansion of the [[Sahara]] was not well known, due to a lack of recent, measurable expansion of the desert into the Sahel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://portal.iri.columbia.edu/~alesall/ouagaCILSS/articles/sen_bams1998.pdf | title=IRI – International Research Institute for Climate and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of global warming and human activities are presented in the Sahel. In this area the level of desertification is very high compared to other areas in the world. All areas situated in the eastern part of Africa (i.e. in the Sahel region) are characterized by a dry climate, hot temperatures, and low rainfall (300–750&amp;nbsp;mm rainfall per year). So, droughts are the rule in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Desertification/desertification2.php|title=Defining Desertification : Feature Articles|last=Riebeek|first=Holli|date=2007-01-03|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that Africa has lost approximately 650,000&amp;nbsp;km² of its productive agricultural land over the past 50 years. The propagation of desertification in this area is considerable.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.savezvousque.fr/monde/progression-desert-sahara-augmente-annee.html|title=La progression du désert du Sahara augmente chaque année ?|website=Savezvousque.fr|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Village Telly in Mali.jpg|thumb|[[Sahel]] region of Mali]]
Some statistics have shown that since 1900 the Sahara has expanded by 250&amp;nbsp;km to the south over a stretch of land from west to east 6,000&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hecke|first=Geoffrey Van|title=Humanum 3, le secret d'Épidaure: suivi de Amazone City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89u9DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192|year=2012|publisher=Mon Petit Éditeur|isbn=978-2-7483-9214-2|page=192|quote=D'après Monique Mainguet, depuis 1900, le Sahara a progressé vers le sud de 250 kilomètres et ce sur un front qui en fait plus de 6000 km.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Bouquet|title=Le Sahara entre ses deux rives.

Is it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Research_Institute_for_Social_Development    ? --&gt;, had demonstrated that this means dryness is spreading fast in the Sahelian countries. 70% of the arid area has deteriorated and water resources have disappeared, leading to [[soil degradation]]. The loss of [[topsoil]] means that plants cannot take root firmly and can be uprooted by torrential water or strong winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/04/30/united-nations-convention-to-combat-desertification-issues-and-challenges/|title=United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification: Issues and Challenges|website=E-International Relations|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Convention (UNC) says that about six million Sahelian citizens would have to give up the desertified zones of sub-Saharan Africa for North Africa and Europe between 1997 and 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Lake Chad, located in the Sahel region, has been hit particularly hard by this phenomenon. The cause of the lake drying up is due to irrigation withdrawal and the annual rainfall dropping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dougill|first=Andrew|date=November 2016|title=Lake drying and livelihood dynamics in Lake Chad: Unravelling the mechanisms, contexts and responses|url=|journal=Ambio|volume=45|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The lake has shrunk by over 90% since the 1987, displacing millions of inhabitants. Recent efforts have managed to make some progress toward its restoration, but it is still considered to be at risk of disappearing entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=Dounia Ben|date=December 2015|title=New Urgency in Battle to Halt Spread of Desertification|url=|journal=New African|volume=556|pages=|via=Gale Academic OneFile Select}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Onamuti |first1=Olapeju Y. |last2=Okogbue |first2=Emmanuel C. |last3=Orimoloye |first3=Israel R. |title=Remote sensing appraisal of Lake Chad shrinkage connotes severe impacts on green economics and socio-economics of the catchment area |journal=Royal Society Open Science |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=171120 |doi=10.1098/rsos.171120 |pmid=29291097 |pmc=5717671 |date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major area that is being impacted by desertification is the [[Gobi Desert]]. Currently, the Gobi desert is the fastest moving desert on Earth; according to some researchers, the Gobi Desert swallows up over 1,300 square miles (3,370&amp;nbsp;km²) of land annually. This has destroyed many villages in its path. Currently, photos show that the Gobi Desert has expanded to the point the entire nation of Croatia (about 4 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/croatia-population/|title=Croatia Population (2020) - Worldometer|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2020-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) could fit inside its area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/24/world/asia/living-in-chinas-expanding-deserts.html?_r=0 | title=Living in China's Expanding Deserts| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is causing a major problem for the people of China. They will soon have to deal with the desert as it creeps closer. Although the Gobi Desert itself is still a distance away from Beijing, reports from field studies state there are large sand dunes forming only 70&amp;nbsp;km (43.5&amp;nbsp;mi) outside the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geo.utexas.edu/courses/371c/project/2009/Welker_Desertification.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South America]] is another area affected by desertification, as 25% of the land is classified as drylands. In Argentina specifically, drylands represent more than half of the total land area, and desertification has the potential to disrupt the nation's food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torres |first1=Laura |last2=Abraham |first2=Elena M. |last3=Rubio |first3=Clara |last4=Barbero‐Sierra |first4=Celia |last5=Ruiz-Pérez |first5=Manuel |title=Desertification Research in Argentina |journal=Land Degradation &amp; Development |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=433–440 |doi=10.1002/ldr.2392 |date=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mongolia]] is an area affected by desertification due to [[overgrazing]]. In the 1990's after the fall of communism in the country, the people were motivated to become herders. This resulted in the doubling of the number of herders and overgrazing of the Mongolian [[grasslands]]. Now 90% of the Mongolian grasslands is fragile dry land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A way of life in crisis: on the sparsely inhabited steppes of Mongolia, the lifestyle of the nomadic herder has always been a hard one.

== Effects ==

=== Sand and dust storms ===
There has been a 25% increase in global annual dust emissions between the late nineteenth century to present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanelle|first=Tanja|last2=Bey|first2=Isabelle|last3=Raddatz|first3=Thomas|last4=Reick|first4=Christian|last5=Tegen|first5=Ina|date=2014-12-16|title=Anthropogenically induced changes in twentieth century mineral dust burden and the associated impact on radiative forcing|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|language=en|volume=119|issue=23|pages=13,526–13,546|doi=10.1002/2014JD022062}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase of desertification has also increased the amount of loose sand and dust that the wind can pick up ultimately resulting in a storm. For example, dust storms in the Middle East “are becoming more frequent and intense in recent years” because “long-term reductions in rainfall promot[ing] lower [[soil moisture]] and [[vegetative cover]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namdari|first=Soodabeh|last2=Karimi|first2=Neamat|last3=Sorooshian|first3=Armin|last4=Mohammadi|first4=GholamHasan|last5=Sehatkashani|first5=Saviz|date=2018-01-01|title=Impacts of climate and synoptic fluctuations on dust storm activity over the Middle East|journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=173|pages=265–276|doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.11.016|issn=1352-2310|pmc=6192056|pmid=30344444}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dust storms can contribute to certain respiratory disorders such as pneumonia, skin irritations, asthma and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goudie|first=Andrew S.|date=2014-02-01|title=Desert dust and human health disorders|journal=Environment International|volume=63|pages=101–113|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2013.10.011|issn=0160-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can pollute open water, reduce the effectiveness of clean energy efforts, and halt most forms of transportation. 

Dust and sand storms can have a negative effect on the climate which can make desertification worse. Dust particles in the air scatter incoming radiation from the sun. The dust can provide momentary coverage for the ground temperature but the atmospheric temperature will increase. This can disform and shorten the life time of clouds which can result in less rainfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-desertification-and-the-role-of-climate-change|title=Explainer: Desertification and the role of climate change|date=2019-08-06|website=Carbon Brief|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food security ===
Global food security is being threatened by desertification and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. The more the population grows, the more food that has to be grown. The agricultural business is being displaced from one country to another. For example, Europe on average imports over 50% of its food. Meanwhile, 44% of agricultural land is located in dry lands and it supplies 60% of the world’s food production. Desertification is decreasing the amount of sustainable land for agricultural uses but demands are continuously growing. In the near future, the demands will overcome the supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu/globalagriculture|title=WAD {{!}} World Atlas of Desertification|website=wad.jrc.ec.europa.eu|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vegetation patterning ===
As the desertification takes place, the landscape may progress through different stages and continuously transform in appearance. On gradually sloped terrain, desertification can create increasingly larger empty spaces over a large strip of land, a phenomenon known as &quot;[[Tiger bush|brousse tigrée]]&quot;. A mathematical model of this phenomenon proposed by C. Klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klausmeier|first=Christopher|title=Regular and irregular patterns in semiarid vegetation|journal=Science|year=1999|volume=284|issue=5421|pages=1826–1828|doi=10.1126/science.284.5421.1826|pmid=10364553}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One outcome of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15182754,00.html|title=Grid of straw squares turns Chinese sand to soil – Environment – DW.COM – 23.06.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate cause is the loss of most vegetation. This is driven by a number of factors, alone or in combination, such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the [[soil biology|biological composition of the soil]]. Studies have shown that, in many environments, the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geeson, Nichola|title=Mediterranean desertification: a mosaic of processes and responses|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2002|isbn=978-0-470-84448-9|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_0qg0f49GQC&amp;pg=PA58|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan.

Many scientists think that one of the most common causes is [[overgrazing]], too much consumption of vegetation by cattle or other livestock.
[[File:Morroco-arid-climate.jpg|thumb|A shepherd guiding his sheep through the high desert outside [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]]]

Scientists agree that the existence of a desert in the place where the [[Sahara|Sahara desert]] is now located is due to a natural climate cycle; this cycle often causes a lack of water in the area from time to time. There is a suggestion that the last time that the Sahara was converted from savanna to desert it was partially due to overgrazing by the cattle of the local population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=K.

Overpopulation is one of the most dangerous factors contributing to desertification. Human populations are increasing at exponential rates, which leads to overgrazing, over-farming and deforestation, as previously acceptable techniques are becoming less sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epule|first=Terence Epule|last2=Peng|first2=Changhui|last3=Lepage|first3=Laurent|date=February 2015|title=Environmental refugees in sub-Saharan Africa: a review of perspectives on the trends, causes, challenges and way forward|journal=GeoJournal|volume=80|issue=1|pages=79–92|doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9528-z|issn=0343-2521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Global warming|Climate change]] is likely a major contributing factor in the desertification process, as simulations suggest the greenhouse effect may increase the spread of deserts by as much as 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeng L17401&quot;/&gt;

There are multiple reasons farmers use [[intensive farming]] as opposed to [[extensive farming]] but the main reason is to maximize yields.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; By increasing productivity, they require a lot more fertilizer, pesticides, and labor to upkeep machinery. This continuous use of the land rapidly depletes the nutrients of the soil causing desertification to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/desertificationday/desertification.shtml|title=World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, 17 June|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/intensive-agriculture|title=Intensive agriculture|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poverty==
At least 90% of the inhabitants of drylands live in [[Developing country|developing countries]], where they also suffer from poor economic and social conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;holtz&quot; /&gt; This situation is exacerbated by land degradation because of the reduction in productivity, the precariousness of living conditions and the difficulty of access to resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;

A downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries by [[overgrazing]], [[land exhaustion]] and [[overdrafting]] of groundwater in many of the marginally productive world regions due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] pressures to exploit marginal drylands for farming. Decision-makers are understandably averse to invest in arid zones with low potential. This absence of investment contributes to the marginalisation of these zones. When unfavourable agro-climatic conditions are combined with an absence of infrastructure and access to markets, as well as poorly adapted production techniques and an underfed and undereducated population, most such zones are excluded from development.&lt;ref name=&quot;csf-desertification.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.csf-desertification.org/index.php/bibliotheque/doc_details/119-cornet-antoine-2002-desertification-and-its-relationship-to-the-environment-and-development Cornet A., 2002.

Desertification often causes rural lands to become unable to support the same sized populations that previously lived there. This results in mass [[human migration|migrations]] out of rural areas and into urban areas ([[Urbanization|urbanisation]]), particularly in Africa. These migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people, who end up living in [[slums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pasternak, Dov |author2=Schlissel, Arnold|title=Combating desertification with plants|publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-46632-8|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B-i8-DPf6xgC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mongolia the land is 90% fragile dry land, which causes many herders to migrate to the city for work. With very limited resources the herders that stay in the dry land graze very carefully in order to preserve the land. With the increasing population of Mongolia it is very difficult to stay a herder for long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A way of life in crisis: on the sparsely inhabited steppes of Mongolia, the lifestyle of the nomadic herder has always been a hard one.

The number of these [[Environmental migrant|environmental refugees]] grows every year, with projections for sub-Saharan Africa showing a probable increase from 14 million in 2010 to nearly 200 million by 2050. This presents a future crisis for the region, as neighboring nations do not always have the ability to support large populations of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |title=Environmental refugees: a growing phenomenon of the 21st century |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Agriculture is a main source of income for many desert communities. The increase in desertification in these regions has degraded the land to such an extent where people can no longer productively farm and make a profit. This has negatively impacted the economy and increased poverty rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stringer|first=Lindsay C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Jen C.|last3=Reed|first3=Mark S.|last4=Dougill|first4=Andrew J.|last5=Twyman|first5=Chasca|last6=Mkwambisi|first6=David|title=Adaptations to climate change, drought and desertification: local insights to enhance policy in southern Africa|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=12|issue=7|pages=748–765|doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2009.04.002|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures==
[[File:North Sahara. Anti-sand shields.jpg|thumb|Anti-sand shields in north [[Sahara]], [[Tunisia]]]]
[[File:GreeningdesertTharIndia.jpg|thumb|[[Jojoba]] plantations, such as those shown, have played a role in combating edge effects of desertification in the [[Thar Desert]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pasternak|first1=D.|last2=Schlissel|first2=Arnold|title=Combating Desertification with Plants|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781461513278|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XfgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|date=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Techniques and countermeasures exist for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification, and some possess varying levels of difficulty. For some, there are numerous barriers to their implementation. Yet for others, the solution simply requires the exercise of human reason.

One proposed barrier is that the costs of adopting sustainable agricultural practices sometimes exceed the benefits for individual farmers, even while they are socially and environmentally beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drost|first1=Daniel|last2=Long|first2=Gilbert|last3=Wilson|first3=David|last4=Miller|first4=Bruce|last5=Campbell|first5=William|title=Barriers to Adopting Sustainable Agricultural Practices|issue=6|url=https://www.joe.org/joe/1996december/a1.php|journal=Journal of Extension|volume=34|date=1 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is a lack of political will, and lack of funding to support [[land reclamation]] and anti-desertification programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Briassoulis, Helen|title=Policy integration for complex environmental problems: the example of Mediterranean desertification|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7546-4243-5|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpYnV45hVRsC&amp;pg=PA237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desertification is recognized as a major threat to [[biodiversity]]. Some countries have developed [[biodiversity action plan]]s to counter its effects, particularly in relation to the protection of endangered [[flora]] and [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;Techniques for Desert Reclamation by Andrew S. Goudie&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html Desert reclamation projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103172821/http://www.gsafweb.org/TrusteeNews/desertdevelopmen.html |date=2009-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reforestation]] gets at one of the root causes of desertification and is not just a treatment of the symptoms. Environmental organizations&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://edenprojects.org/ Eden Reforestation Projects website], [https://vimeo.com/edenprojects on Vimeo], on {{YouTube|id=edenreforest|title=''Eden Reforestation Projects''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; work in places where deforestation and desertification are contributing to extreme [[poverty]]. There they focus primarily on educating the local population about the dangers of deforestation and sometimes employ them to grow seedlings, which they transfer to severely deforested areas during the rainy season.&lt;ref&gt;{{USGovernment|sourceURL=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/desertification/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] launched the FAO Drylands Restoration Initiative in 2012 to draw together knowledge and experience on dryland restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drylands Restoration Initiative|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/aridzone/restoration/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, FAO published global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands, in collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs and the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands|date=June 2015|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|isbn=978-92-5-108912-5|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5036e.pdf&lt;!-- |accessdate=June 2015 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Green Wall of China]]&quot; is a high-profile example of one method that has been finding success in this battle with desertification.{{According to whom|date=April 2018}}. This wall is a much larger-scale version of what American farmers did in the 1930s to stop the great Midwest dust bowl. This plan was proposed in the late 1970s, and has become a major ecological engineering project that is not predicted to end until the year 2055. According to Chinese reports, there have been nearly 66&amp;nbsp;billion trees planted in China's great green wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/china-great-green-wall-gobi-tengger-desertification/ | title=China's 'Great Green Wall' Fights Expanding Desert| date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The green wall of China has decreased desert land in China by an annual average of 1,980 square km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-05/26/c_137207841.htm |title=Across China: A guardian of the great green wall against China's second largest desert |last=Hui |first=Lu |date=May 26, 2018 |work=Xinghua News Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of sandstorms nationwide have fallen 20% due to the green wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beiser|first=Vince|date=September 1, 2017|title=A tree grows in China: can a &quot;Green Great Wall&quot; stop sand from devouring the countryside?|url=|journal=Mother Jones|volume=83|issue=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Due to the success that China has been finding in stopping the spread of desertification, plans are currently be made in Africa to start a &quot;wall&quot; along the borders of the Sahara desert as well to be financed by the United Nations Global Environment Facility trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadzama|first=Njidda Mamadu|date=2017|title=Attenuation of the effects of desertification through sustainable development of Great Green Wall in the Sahel of Africa|url=|journal=World Journal of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development|volume=14|issue=4|pages=279–289|doi=10.1108/WJSTSD-02-2016-0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2007 the African Union started the great green wall of Africa project in order to combat desertification in 20 countries. the wall is 8000 km wide stretching across the entire width of the continent and has 8 billion dollars in support of the project. The great green wall of Africa has restored 36 million hectares of land to the countries and has created many job opportunities for those who dwell near it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadzama|first=Njidda|date=2017|title=Attenuation of the Effects of Desertification through Sustainable Development of Great Green Wall in the Sahel of Africa|url=|journal=World Journal of Science, Technology and Sustainable Development|volume=14|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great green wall has created over 20,000 jobs in Nigeria alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unccd.int/actions/great-green-wall-initiative|title=The Great Green Wall Initiative|last=United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|date=2019|website=uncdd.int|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12/3/19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques focus on two aspects: provisioning of water, and [[soil fixation|fixation]] and hyper-fertilizing soil. Fixating the soil is often done through the use of [[windbreak|shelter belts]], [[woodlot]]s and [[windbreak]]s. Windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[evapotranspiration]]. They were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the [[Sahel]] area of [[Africa]].

Some soils (for example, [[clay]]), due to lack of water can become [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] rather than porous (as in the case of [[sandy soil]]s). Some techniques as [[zaï]] or [[tillage]] are then used to still allow the planting of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/mann-text.html|title=Our Good Earth – National Geographic Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waffle gardens can also help as they can provide protection of the plants against wind/sandblasting, and increase the hours of shade falling on the plant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lifehacker.com/grow-vegetables-in-the-desert-with-a-waffle-garden-1784769118 Grow Vegetables in the Desert With a 'Waffle Garden']&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique that is useful is [[contour trenching]]. This involves the digging of 150&amp;nbsp;m long, 1&amp;nbsp;m deep trenches in the soil. The trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape, preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion. Stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again. The method was invented by Peter Westerveld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nagafoundation.org/|title=Home – Justdiggit|accessdate=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402205707/https://nagafoundation.org/|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often achieved by plants. Of these, [[legume|leguminous plants]] which extract [[nitrogen]] from the air and fix it in the soil, [[succulents]] (such as [[Opuntia]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265346914_Cactus_as_a_tool_to_mitigate_drought_and_to_combat_Desertification Cactus as a tool to mitigate drought and to combat Desertification]&lt;/ref&gt;, and food crops/trees as [[grain]]s, [[barley]], [[beans]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s are the most important. [[Sand fence]]s can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ List of plants to halt desertification; some of which may be soil-fixating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201080944/http://desertification.wordpress.com/3-interesting-plant-species/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to restore soil fertility is through the use of nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Due to the higher cost of this fertilizer, many [[smallholding|smallholder]] farmers are reluctant to use it, especially in areas where [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]] is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krah |first1=Kwabena |last2=Michelson |first2=Hope |last3=Perge |first3=Emilie |last4=Jindal |first4=Rohit |title=Constraints to adopting soil fertility management practices in Malawi: A choice experiment approach |journal=World Development |volume=124 |pages=104651 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104651 |date=1 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nations, including India, Zambia, and Malawi have responded to this by implementing [[subsidization|subsidies]] to help encourage adoption of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duflo |first1=Esther |last2=Kremer |first2=Michael |last3=Robinson |first3=Jonathan |title=Nudging Farmers to Use Fertilizer: Theory and Experimental Evidence from Kenya |journal=American Economic Review |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=2350–2390 |doi=10.1257/aer.101.6.2350 |date=October 2011|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w15131.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research centres (such as Bel-Air Research Center IRD/ISRA/UCAD) are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with [[mycorrhiza]] in arid zones. The mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants. They hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees, increasing the surface area of the tree's roots greatly (allowing the tree to gather much more nutrient from the soil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://196.1.95.4/fst/biologie-vegetale/labo_commun.htm|title=Département Biologie Végétale – Laboratoire Commun de Microbiologie IRD-ISRA-UCAD|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are many different types of deserts, there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies. An example for this is the salt flats in the  [[Rub' al Khali]] desert in [[Saudi Arabia]]. These salt flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prototype-creation.de/rethinking_landscapes.pdf Rethinking landscapes, Nicol-André Berdellé July 2011] H2O magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farmer-managed natural regeneration]] (FMNR) is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation. Since 1980, this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in Niger. This simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in Niger. The process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots. The residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing [[soil water]] [[water retention|retention]] and reducing evaporation. Additionally, properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields. The Humbo Assisted Regeneration Project which uses FMNR techniques in Ethiopia has received money from The World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund, which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/10/18/sprouting-trees-from-the-underground-forest-a-simple-way-to-fight-desertification-and-climate-change/ |title=Sprouting Trees From the Underground Forest — A Simple Way to Fight Desertification and Climate Change – Water Matters – State of the Planet |publisher=Blogs.ei.columbia.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managed grazing===
Restoring grasslands store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the air as plant material. Grazing livestock, usually not left to wander, would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth while grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds, preventing them from photosynthesizing and killing the plant.&lt;ref name=Tlovell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2011/01/lovell-carbon-ward-climate|title=How fences could save the planet|publisher=newstatesman.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day or two in order to mimic natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|title=Restoring soil carbon can reverse global warming, desertification and biodiversity|publisher=mongabay.com|accessdate=May 5, 2013|date=February 21, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130625040133/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0221-soil_carbon_lovell_interview.html|archivedate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1953692,00.html|title=How eating grass-fed beef could help fight climate change|publisher=time.com|accessdate=May 11, 2013|date=January 25, 2010|first=Lisa|last=Abend}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world’s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland would offset nearly 12 years of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=Tlovell/&gt;
