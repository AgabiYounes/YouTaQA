'''Dartmoor''' is an [[highland (geography)|upland]] area in southern [[Devon]], [[England]]. The [[moorland]] and surrounding land has been protected by [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] status since 1951. '''Dartmoor National Park''' covers {{convert|954|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DF&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The [[granite]] which forms the uplands dates from the [[Carboniferous]] Period of geological history. The landscape consists of moorland capped with many exposed granite hilltops known as [[tor (rock formation)|tor]]s, providing habitats for [[Dartmoor wildlife]]. The highest point is [[High Willhays]], {{convert|621|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The entire area is rich in antiquities and [[archaeology]].

Dartmoor National Park is managed by the [[Dartmoor National Park Authority]], whose 22 members are drawn from [[Devon County Council]], local [[Districts of England|district councils]] and Government.

[[Dartmoor Training Area|Parts of Dartmoor]] have been used as military [[firing range]]s for over 200 years. The public is granted extensive land access rights on Dartmoor (including restricted access to the firing ranges) and it is a popular tourist destination.

==Physical geography==
===Geology===
[[File:Cornubian batholith.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Map showing the main granite outcrops of the [[Cornubian batholith]] in southwest England and the gravity anomaly associated with it]]

:''main article: [[Geology of Dartmoor National Park]]''
Dartmoor includes the largest area of [[granite]] in Britain, with about {{convert|625|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} at the surface, though most of it is under superficial [[peat]] deposits. The granite (or more specifically [[adamellite]]) was intruded at depth as a [[pluton]] into the surrounding sedimentary rocks during the [[Carboniferous]] period, probably about 309 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Durrance &amp; Laming 1982, pp.86, 101&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted that the present surface is not far below the original top of the pluton; evidence for this includes partly digested [[shale]] [[xenolith]]s, contamination of the granite and the existence of two patches of altered [[sedimentary rock]] on top of the granite.&lt;ref&gt;Durrance &amp; Laming 1982, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;
A considerable [[gravity anomaly]] is associated with the Dartmoor pluton as with [[gravity anomalies of Britain and Ireland|other such plutons]].&lt;ref&gt;British Geological Survey 1997, ''Gravity Anomaly Map of Britain, Ireland and Adjacent Areas'', Smith &amp; Edwards 1:500k&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement of the anomaly has helped to determine the likely shape and extent of the rock mass at depth.

===Tors===
[[File:Saddle tor to Hey tor pano.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama of some better known Dartmoor [[Tor (rock formation)|tors]] in snow]]
[[File:High Willhays.jpg|thumb|left|[[High Willhays]] with Yes Tor behind]]

Dartmoor is known for its [[Tor (rock formation)|tor]]s – hills topped with outcrops of bedrock, which in [[granite]] country such as this are usually rounded boulder-like formations. More than 160 of the hills of Dartmoor have the word ''tor'' in their name but quite a number do not.&lt;ref name=&quot;DF&quot;/&gt; However, this does not appear to relate to whether or not there is an outcrop of rock on their summit. The tors are the focus of an annual event known as the [[Ten Tors Challenge]], when around 2400 people aged between 14 and 19 walk for distances of 56, 72 or 88&amp;nbsp;km (35, 45 or 55&amp;nbsp;mi) between ten tors on many differing routes.

The highest points on Dartmoor are on the northern moor: [[High Willhays]], {{convert|621|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX 580892}}) and [[Yes Tor]], {{convert|619|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX 581901}}) The highest points on the southern moor are [[Ryder's Hill]], {{convert|515|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX 660690}}), Snowdon {{convert|495|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX 668684}}), and an unnamed point, {{convert|493|m|ft|abbr=on}} at ({{gbmapping|SX 603645}}), between Langcombe Hill and Shell Top. The best-known tor on Dartmoor is [[Haytor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradt|first1=Hilary|last2=Booth|first2=Janice|title=South Devon &amp; Dartmoor|date=2014|publisher=Bradt|location=Chalfont St Peter|isbn=9781841625522|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; (called Hey Tor by William Crossing), {{convert|457|m|ft|abbr=on}}, ({{gbmapping|SX 757771}}). For a more complete list see [[List of Dartmoor tors and hills]].

===Rivers===
[[File:ErmeIvybridge.jpg|thumb|[[River Erme]] at [[Ivybridge]]]]

The high ground of Dartmoor forms the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] for many of Devon's rivers. As well as shaping the landscape, these have traditionally provided a source of power for moor industries such as [[Dartmoor tin-mining|tin mining]] and quarrying.

The moor takes its name from the [[River Dart]], which starts as the [[East Dart River|East Dart]] and [[West Dart River|West Dart]] and then becomes a single river at [[Dartmeet]]. It leaves the moor at [[Buckfastleigh]], flowing through [[Totnes]] below where it opens up into a long [[ria]], reaching the sea at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]].

For a full list, expand the ''Rivers of Dartmoor'' navigational box at the bottom of this page.

===Bogs===
Much more rain falls on Dartmoor than in the surrounding lowlands. As much of the national park is covered in thick layers of [[peat]] (decaying vegetation), the rain is usually absorbed quickly and distributed slowly, so the moor is rarely dry. In areas where water accumulates, dangerous [[bog]]s or mires can result. Some of these, topped with bright green moss, are known to locals as &quot;feather beds&quot; or &quot;quakers&quot;, because they can shift (or 'quake') beneath a person's feet. Quakers result from sphagnum moss growing over the water that accumulates in the hollows in the granite.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Mercer: ''Bogs and Mires of Dartmoor'', in Hunt, P. J.; Wills, G. L. (eds) (1977), ''Devon Wetlands'', Exeter: Devon County Council, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-903849-19-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Aune head mire3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aune Mire]], the source of the [[River Avon, Devon|River Avon]]]]
The vegetation of the bogs depends on the type and location. [[Blanket bog]], which forms on the highest land where the rainfall exceeds {{convert|2000|mm|in}} a year, consists mainly of cotton-grass (''[[Eriophorum]]'' species), sedges (''[[Carex]]'' and ''[[Rhynchospora]]''), ''[[Narthecium ossifragum|Bog Asphodel]]'' and ''[[Common Tormentil]]'', with ''[[Sphagnum]]'' thriving in the wettest patches. The valley bogs have lush growth of [[Juncaceae|rushes]], with sphagnum, [[Erica tetralix|cross-leaved heath]], [[Drosera|sundews]] and several other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some of the bogs on Dartmoor have achieved notoriety. [[Fox Tor|Fox Tor Mires]] was supposedly the inspiration for Great Grimpen Mire in Conan Doyle's novel ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|first=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is a waymarked footpath across it. [[Sabine Baring-Gould]], in his ''Book of Dartmoor'' (1900) related the story of a man who was making his way through Aune Mire at the head of the [[River Avon, Devon|River Avon]] when he came upon a top-hat brim down on the surface of the mire. He kicked it, whereupon a voice called out: &quot;What be you a-doin' to my 'at?&quot; The man replied, &quot;Be there now a chap under'n?&quot; &quot;Ees, I reckon,&quot; was the reply, &quot;and a hoss under me likewise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milton 2006, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- mention &quot;Dartmoor Stables&quot; --&gt;

==Climate==
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Dartmoor has a [[temperate|temperate climate]] which is generally wetter and milder than locations at similar height in the rest of England. At [[Princetown]], near the centre of the moor at a height of {{convert|453|m|ft}}, January and February are the coldest months with mean minimum temperatures around {{convert|1|C|F|0}}. July and August are the warmest months with mean daily maxima not reaching {{convert|18|C}}. Compared with [[Teignmouth]], which is on the coast about {{convert|22|mi|km}} to the east, the average maximum and minimum temperatures are {{convert|3.0|C-change}} and {{convert|2.6|C-change}} lower respectively, and [[frost (temperature)|frost]] is at least five times as frequent.&lt;ref name=&quot;W30&quot;&gt;Webb 2006, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; On the highest ground, in the north of the moor, the [[growing season]] is less than 175 days – this contrasts with some 300 days along most of the south coast of the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;W30&quot; /&gt;

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Rainfall]] tends to be associated with Atlantic [[low-pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of rainfall falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. The wettest months are November and December and on the highest parts of the moor the average annual total rainfall is over {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. This compares with less than {{convert|800|mm|in}} in the lower land to the east around the [[Exe Estuary]], which is in the [[rain shadow]] of the moor. Due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] snowfall is not common, though due to its high altitude it is more vulnerable to snowfall than surrounding regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;W31&quot;&gt;Webb 2006, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1961 and 1990 [[Met Office]] data shows that there was an average of 20 days when snow fell on the moor, and over 40 days a year with hail, which is as high as anywhere else in the country. This results when cold [[air stream|polar maritime air]] that has travelled over a large expanse of warmer ocean is forced to rise over high country.&lt;ref name=&quot;W31&quot; /&gt;

When average temperatures at Princetown between 1961 and 2000 are compared, the average annual temperature in the decade 1990–2000 was up by {{convert|0.2|C-change|1}} and the late winter temperature increased by {{convert|0.5|C-change|1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;W32&quot;&gt;Webb 2006, pp.32–33&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- give examples of some extreme conditions: ammil, long freeze in the 60s, etc.--&gt;

== Wildlife ==
Because of Dartmoor's height and granite geology, it experiences strong winds and has acidic soils. In consequence it has been subject to very little [[intensive farming]], and all these factors combine to form the basis of the important ecosystems found here. The landscape is one of granite with [[peat bog]]s overlying it. While the [[Moorland|moors]] topped with granite tors are the most iconic part of Dartmoor's landscape, only about half of Dartmoor is actually moorland. Equally important for wildlife are the [[blanket bog]]s, upland heaths and the oak woodlands which are all of global importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;plantlife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/nature-reserves-important-plant-areas/important-plant-areas/dartmoor|title=Dartmoor IPA| website=Plantlife| accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dartmoor is a [[Special Area of Conservation]] (SAC) with four habitats (''Northern Atlantic wet heaths with Erica tetralix''; ''European dry heaths''; ''Blanket bog''s and ''Old sessile oak woods with Ilex and Blechnum in the British Isles'') being listed as primary reasons for the selection of Dartmoor as a SAC. In addition the area has a population of the [[Southern damselfly]] which is also a primary reason for its selection along with populations of [[Salmo salar|Atlantic salmon]] and [[Lutra lutra|Otter]] being qualifying reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/protectedsites/sacselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929| title= Dartmoor - Special Area of Conservation | website = Joint Nature Conservation Committee|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Wisht.jpg|thumb|Inside Wistman's Wood in summer]]
[[Wistman's Wood]] is one of the old sessile oak woods which contribute to the listing of Dartmoor as a SAC and is possibly a surviving fragment from the earliest [[Neolithic]] woodland clearances. It is home to exceptional epiphytic mosses, liverworts and lichens. Nearly 50 species of moss and liverwort are found in the wood along with 120 types of [[lichen]], including Smith's horsehair lichen, speckled sea-storm lichen and pendulous wing-moss. Over 60 species of lichens grow on the exposed surfaces of the granite tors, including granite-speck rim-lichen, purple rock lichen, [[Acarospora fuscata|brown cobblestone lichen]] and goldspot lichen and many rare lichen grow on rocks exposed by mining which are rich in [[heavy metals]]. On the upland heaths heather ([[Calluna|ling]]) and [[bell heather]] are common along with [[western gorse]]. In dry grassy areas [[tormentil]], [[heath bedstraw]] and [[heath milkwort]] are all common. [[Cross-leaved heath]] and [[purple moor grass]] grow in wetter spots and in the boggy areas many different species of [[sphagnum]] and other mosses can be found along with [[liverwort]]s, [[Hare's-tail Cotton-grass]], [[round-leaved sundew]] and [[bog asphodel]] and in the valley bottoms, many different [[sedge]]s, [[bogbean]] and [[pale butterwort]] all grow.&lt;ref name=&quot;plantlife&quot; /&gt;

A large variety of bird species can be found on Dartmoor including ones that have declined elsewhere in the UK, such as [[skylark]] and [[snipe]], or are even rare nationally, such as the [[ring ouzel]] and the [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]]. There are internationally important populations of [[meadow pipit]] and [[stonechat]].  Woodland birds include a number of migrant species, like the [[European pied flycatcher|pied flycatcher]], the [[wood warbler]] or the [[common redstart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/birds| title=Birds| website = Dartmoor National Park| accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammals found here include otters, hazel dormice and nearly all of the UK's 16 bat species. Three rare species, the [[barbastelle]], and the [[greater horseshoe bat|greater]] and [[lesser horseshoe bat]]s are of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/mammals| title=Mammals| website = Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper reaches of the rivers, are spawning grounds for Salmon and [[trout]] and [[Palmate newt]]s, frogs and toads breed in the numerous small pools. Two shrimp species can be found on Dartmoor: [[fairy shrimp]] that can be found in temporary pools and in underground streams very rare cave shrimp. The world's largest land slug, the [[Limax cinereoniger|Ash black]], is also found. Reptiles include [[common lizard]]s and [[Vipera berus|adders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/other-animals| title=Other animals| website = Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farmland in the wet valleys around the edge of the moors is the most important habitat for insects
including the [[marsh fritillary]] butterfly, southern damselfly, [[Hemaris tityus|narrow-bordered bee hawkmoth]] and [[Eristalis cryptarum|bog hoverfly]]. Areas of [[bracken]] are home to the [[high brown fritillary]] and [[pearl-bordered fritillary]]. Insects found in the heathlands include the [[emperor moth]], [[green hairstreak]] and the [[bilberry bumblebee]]. The old oak woodlands have a distinctive group of insects including the [[blue ground beetle]] and Heckford's pygmy moth, a species found nowhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/wildlife-and-heritage/wildlife/insects| title=Insects| website = Dartmoor National Park|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-history===
The majority of the [[prehistoric]] remains on Dartmoor date back to the late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]. Indeed, Dartmoor contains the largest concentration of Bronze Age remains in the United Kingdom, which suggests that this was when a larger population moved onto the hills of Dartmoor. The large systems of Bronze Age fields, divided by [[reave]]s, cover an area of over {{convert|10000|ha|mi2}} of the lower moors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|df=dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate at the time was warmer than today, and much of today's moorland was covered with trees. The prehistoric settlers began clearing the forest, and established the first farming communities. Fire was the main method of clearing land, creating [[pasture]] and [[swidden]] types of fire-fallow farmland. Areas less suited for farming tended to be burned for livestock grazing. Over the centuries these Neolithic practices greatly expanded the upland moors, and contributed to the acidification of the soil and the accumulation of [[peat]] and [[bog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Role of anthropogenic fire and in creating moors, and moor-burning in sustaining them, described in Pyne, Stephen J. (1997) ''Vestal Fire: an Environmental History, Told through Fire, of Europe and Europe's Encounter with the World''. University of Washington Press, Seattle, pp. 348−369. {{ISBN|0-295-97596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few thousand years the mild climate deteriorated leaving these areas uninhabited and consequently relatively undisturbed to the present day. The highly acidic soil has ensured that no organic remains have survived, but the durability of the granite has meant that the remains of buildings, enclosures and monuments have survived well, as have flint tools. A number of remains were &quot;restored&quot; by enthusiastic [[Victorians]] and that, in some cases, they have placed their own interpretation on how an area may have looked.

===Standing stones===
[[File:Beardown man dartmoor.jpg|thumb|upright|Beardown Man, Dartmoor]]

Numerous prehistoric [[menhir]]s (more usually referred to locally as [[standing stone]]s or longstones), [[stone circle]]s, [[Dartmoor kistvaens|kistvaen]]s, [[cairn]]s and [[stone row]]s are to be found on the moor. The most significant sites include:

*Upper Erme stone row is the longest on Dartmoor and in fact in the world at {{convert|3300|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*Beardown Man, near Devil's Tor – isolated standing stone {{convert|3.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high, said to have another {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} below ground. {{gbmapping|SX596796}}
*Challacombe, near the prehistoric settlement of [[Grimspound]] — triple stone row. {{gbmapping|SX689807}}
*[[Drizzlecombe]], east of [[Sheepstor]] village – stone rows, standing stones, kistvaens and cairns. {{gbmapping|SX591669}}
*[[Grey Wethers]], near [[Postbridge, Devon|Postbridge]] — double circle, aligned almost exactly north south. {{gbmapping|SX638831}}
*Laughter Tor, near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]] — standing stone {{convert|2.4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high and two double stone rows, one {{convert|164|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. {{gbmapping|SX652753}}
*[[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]], between [[Princetown]] and [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] — includes a double stone row {{convert|182|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} wide, aligned almost exactly east-west, stone circles and a kistvaen. {{gbmapping|SX554747}}
*[[Scorhill]] (pronounced 'Scorill'), west of [[Chagford]] — circle, {{convert|26.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in circumference, and stone rows. {{gbmapping|SX654873}}
*[[Shovel Down]], north of [[Dartmoor reservoirs|Fernworthy reservoir]] — double stone row approximately {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. {{gbmapping|SX660859}}
*[[Yellowmead Down]], a quadruple concentric stone circle and stone rows.

===Hut circles and kistvaens===
There are also an estimated 5,000 [[hut circle]]s still surviving although many have been raided over the centuries by the builders of the traditional dry stone walls. These are the remnants of [[Bronze Age]] houses. The smallest are around {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the largest may be up to five times this size.

Some have L-shaped porches to protect against wind and rain; some particularly good examples are to be found at [[Grimspound]]. It is believed that they would have had a conical roof, supported by timbers and covered in turf or thatch.

There are also numerous [[Dartmoor kistvaens|kistvaens]], Neolithic stone box-like tombs.

===The historical period===
[[File:Crazywell cross 1.JPG|thumb|Ancient cross close to [[Crazywell Pool]]]]

The climate became wetter and cooler{{clarify|date=July 2013}} over the course of a thousand years from around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, resulting in much of high Dartmoor being largely abandoned by its early inhabitants.

It was not until the [[early Mediaeval]] period that the weather again became warmer, and settlers moved back onto the moors. Like their ancient forebears, they also used the natural granite to build their homes, preferring a style known as the [[Dartmoor longhouse|longhouse]] — some of which are still inhabited today, although they have been clearly adapted over the centuries. Many are now being used as farm buildings, while others were abandoned and fell into ruin.

The earliest surviving farms, still in operation today, are known as the [[Ancient Tenements]]. Most of these date back to the 14th century and sometimes earlier.

Some way into the moor stands the town of [[Princetown, England|Princetown]], the site of [[Dartmoor (HM Prison)|Dartmoor Prison]], which was originally built by Isbell Rowe &amp; Company, Plymouth, for [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]]. The prison has an incorrect reputation for being escape-proof, due to both the buildings themselves and its physical location.

The Dartmoor landscape is scattered with the marks left by the many generations who have lived and worked there over the centuries – such as the remains of the [[Dartmoor tin-mining]] industry, and farmhouses long since abandoned. Indeed, the [[industrial archaeology of Dartmoor]] is a subject in its own right.

==Myths and literature==
[[File:Jay's Grave, geograph.jpg|thumb|[[Jay's Grave]]]]

Dartmoor is known for its myths and legends. It is reputedly the haunt of [[pixie]]s, a [[headless horseman]], a mysterious pack of &quot;[[Hellhound|spectral hounds]]&quot;, and a large [[black dog (ghost)|black dog]], among others. During [[The Great Thunderstorm, Widecombe|the Great Thunderstorm]] of 1638, the moorland village of [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]] was even said to have been visited by the [[Devil]].

Many landmarks have ancient legends and [[Ghosts in European culture|ghost]] stories associated with them, such as the allegedly haunted [[Jay's Grave]], the ancient burial site of [[Childe's Tomb]], the rock pile called [[Bowerman's Nose]], and the [[Dartmoor crosses|stone crosses]] that mark former mediaeval routes across the moor.

A few stories have emerged in recent decades, such as the &quot;[[hairy hands]]&quot;, that are said to attack motorists on the B3212 near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dartmoor has inspired a number of artists and writers, such as [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] in ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' and ''[[The Adventure of Silver Blaze]]'', [[R. D. Blackmore]], [[Eden Phillpotts]], [[Beatrice Chase]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Rosamunde Pilcher]], and the Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]]. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', the fictional 1994 Quidditch World Cup final between Ireland and Bulgaria was hosted on the moor.
In 1820, the newly formed Royal Society of Literature offered a prize for a poem on the subject of Dartmoor, this being won by [[Felicia Hemans]].

==Ownership and access==
Over half of Dartmoor National Park (57.3%) is private land; the [[Forest of Dartmoor]] being the major part of this, owned by the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] owns 14% (see below), 3.8% is owned by water companies (see [[Dartmoor reservoirs]]), 3.7% by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], 1.8% by the [[Forestry Commission]] and 1.4% by Dartmoor's [[national park authority]]. About 37% of Dartmoor is [[common land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/lab-comm.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dartmoor Commons |publisher=Dartmoor National Park Authority |accessdate=19 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227004835/http://www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/print/lab-comm.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dartmoor differs from some other [[National parks of England and Wales|National Parks in England and Wales]], in that since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website&lt;/ref&gt; much of it has been designated as 'Access Land', which, although it remains privately owned, has no restrictions on where walkers can roam. In addition to this Access Land, there are about {{convert|730|km|-1|abbr=on}} of [[Rights of way in England and Wales|public rights of way]] on Dartmoor, and many kilometres of permitted footpaths and bridleways where the owner allows access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=11 September 2009 
 |df=dmy 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.

=== Use by the Ministry of Defence ===
{{See also|Dartmoor Training Area}}

There is a tradition of military usage of Dartmoor dating back to the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  Today, a large British Army training camp remains at [[Okehampton]] — also the site of an airbase during the Second World War.

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) uses three areas of the northern moor for manoeuvres and live-firing exercises, totalling {{convert|108.71|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;DF&quot; /&gt; or just over 11% of the National Park. Red and white posts mark the boundaries of these military areas (shown on [[Ordnance Survey]] 1:25,000 scale maps). Flagpoles on many tors in and around the ranges fly red flags when firing is taking place. At other times, members of the public are allowed access. Blank rounds may also be used, but the MoD does not notify the public of this in advance.

Some &quot;challenge&quot; and charitable events take place with assistance of the military on Dartmoor including the long established [[Ten Tors]] event and the more recent [[Dartmoor Beast]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tentors.org.uk/challenge/about&lt;/ref&gt;

Dartmoor's fictional use as an MoD centre for animal testing called Baskerville was referenced in the BBC drama ''Sherlock'' episode &quot;[[The Hounds of Baskerville]]&quot;.

The disused [[Rippon Tor Rifle Range]] was built to train soldiers during the Second World War, and remained in use until its closure in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDV55113&amp;resourceID=104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
[[File:Dartmoor Clapper Bridge mod.jpg|thumb|The clapper bridge at [[Postbridge]]]]
[[File:Dartmoor pony 1.jpg|thumb|Dartmoor Hill pony on Dartmoor]]

Throughout human history, the landscape has been exploited for industrial purposes. In recent years, controversy has surrounded the work of industrial conglomerates [[Imerys]] and Sibelco (formerly Watts Blake Bearne), who have used parts of the moor for [[china clay]] mining. Licences were granted by the [[British Government]] but were recently renounced after sustained public pressure from bodies such as the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dartmoorsociety.com/files/debates/chinaclay.html|title=The 7th Dartmoor Society Debate: How Important is China Clay to Dartmoor?|last=Hedges|first=Mike|date=2004|website=The Dartmoor Society|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government has made promises to protect the integrity of the moor; however, the cost of compensating companies for these licences, which may not have been granted in today's political climate, could prove prohibitive.

The military use of the moor has been another source of controversy, such as when training was extended in January 2003. The [[national park authority]] received 1,700 objections before making the decision. Objectors claimed that Dartmoor should be an area for recreation, and that the training disturbs the peace.

Those who objected included the [[Open Spaces Society]] and the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]]. During her lifetime, [[Sylvia Sayer|Lady Sayer]] was another outspoken critic of the damage which she perceived that the army was doing to the moor.

==Towns and villages==
[[File:Saddle tor evening.jpg|thumb|A typical Dartmoor tor close to [[Haytor]]]]

Dartmoor has a resident population of about 33,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;DF&quot; /&gt; which swells considerably during holiday periods with incoming tourists. The largest settlements within the National Park are [[Ashburton, Devon|Ashburton]] (the largest with a population of about 3,500), [[Buckfastleigh]], [[Moretonhampstead]], [[Princetown]], [[Yelverton, Devon|Yelverton]], [[Horrabridge]], [[South Brent]], [[Christow]], and [[Chagford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DF&quot; /&gt;

==Leisure activities==
Until the early 19th century Dartmoor was not considered to be a place worth visiting: in the 1540s [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] wrote in his ''Itinerary'' that &quot;Dartmore is muche a wilde Morish and forest Ground&quot;, and even by 1789 [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]]'s opinion was that it is a &quot;dreary mountainous tract&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Milton 2006, pp.19–20&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 19th century John Swete was one of the first people to visit Dartmoor for pleasure and his journals and watercolour paintings now provide a valuable historical resource.&lt;ref&gt;Milton 2006, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest leisure pursuit on the moor is [[hill walking]]. [[William Crossing]]'s definitive ''Guide to Dartmoor'' was published in 1909, and in 1938 a plaque and letterbox in his memory were placed at [[Duck's Pool, Dartmoor|Duck's Pool]] on the southern moor. Parts of the [[Abbots Way]], [[Two Moors Way]] and the [[Haytor Granite Tramway#The Templer Way|Templer Way]] are on Dartmoor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Letterboxing (hobby)|Letterboxing]] originated on Dartmoor in the 19th century and has become increasingly popular in recent decades. Watertight containers, or 'letterboxes', are hidden throughout the moor, each containing a visitor's book and a rubber stamp. Visitors take an impression of the letterbox's rubber stamp as proof of finding the box and record their visit by stamping their own personal stamp in the letterbox's logbook. A recent related development is [[geocaching]]. Geocache clues make use of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] coordinates, whereas letterboxing clues tend to consist of grid references and compass bearings.

[[Whitewater kayaking]] and [[canoeing]] are popular on the rivers due to the high rainfall and their high quality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukriversguidebook.co.uk/swengland/swengland.htm |title=South West England |publisher=UK Rivers Guidebook |accessdate=18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though for environmental reasons access is restricted to the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
