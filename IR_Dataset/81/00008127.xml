'''''Dilbert''''' is an American [[comic strip]] written and illustrated by [[Scott Adams]], first published on April 16, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to Dilbert |url=https://dilbert.com/search_results?month=4&amp;year=1989 |website=Dilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strip is known for its [[satire|satirical]] [[office humor]] about a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]], [[micromanagement|micromanage]]d office featuring engineer [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] as the [[title role|title character]]. The strip has spawned dozens of books, an [[Dilbert (TV series)|animated television series]], a [[Dilbert's Desktop Games|video game]], and hundreds of Dilbert-themed [[merchandising|merchandise]] items. ''Dilbert Future'' and ''The Joy of Work'' are among the most read books in the series. Adams received the [[National Cartoonists Society]] [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] in 1997 and the Newspaper Comic Strip Award in the same year for his work on the strip. ''Dilbert'' appears online and in 2,000 newspapers worldwide in 65 countries and 25 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedfeatures.com/?title=Bio:Dilbert%20Dailies |title=Dilbert presentation at Kings Features Syndicate |publisher=Unitedfeatures.com |date= |access-date=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
''Dilbert'' was picked up for syndication by [[United Feature Syndicate]] (a division of [[United Media]]) in 1989.

On June 3, 2010, United Media sold their licensing arm, along with the rights to ''Dilbert'', to [[Iconix Brand Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iconix-brand-group-closes-acquisition-of-peanuts-95534994.html|title=Iconix Brand Group Closes Acquisition of Peanuts|first=Iconix Brand Group|last=Inc.|date=|website=prnewswire.com|accessdate=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to ''Dilbert'' leaving United Media: in late December 2010, it was announced that Dilbert would move to [[Universal Uclick]] (a division of [[Andrews McMeel Universal]]) beginning in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Alan. [http://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2010/12/28/dilbert-leaves-united-media-for-universal-uclick/ &quot;DILBERT LEAVES UNITED MEDIA FOR UNIVERSAL UCLICK (UPDATED),&quot;] ''The Daily Cartoonist'' (December 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dilbert'' has been with Universal Uclick — now known as [[Andrews McMeel Syndication]] — ever since.

==Themes==
The comic strip originally revolved around [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]] and his &quot;pet&quot; dog [[Dogbert]] in their home. Many early plots revolved around Dilbert's engineer nature or his bizarre inventions. Also prominent were plots based on Dogbert's [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniacal]] ambitions. Later, the location of most of the action moved to Dilbert's workplace and the strip started to satirize technology, workplace, and company issues. The comic strip's popular success is attributable to its workplace setting and themes, which are familiar to a large and appreciative audience;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/10/how-dilbert-practically-wrote-itself/ |title=How &quot;Dilbert&quot; Practically Wrote Itself |last1=Ennes |first1=Meghan |date=2013-10-18 |website=hbr.org |publisher=Harvard Business Review |access-date=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams has said that switching the setting from Dilbert's home to his office was &quot;when the strip really started to take off&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Adams, Scott|title=The Loser Decision|publisher=The Dilbert blog|date=2007-07-23|url=http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/the-loser-decis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workplace location is [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| Cartoonist = [[Scott Adams|Adams, Scott]]|story=Sunday, September 09, 2012|title = Dilbert|Date = 2012-09-09|publisher = Universal UClick|url = http://dilbert.com/strip/2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dilbert'' portrays corporate culture as a [[Franz Kafka#.22Kafkaesque.22|Kafkaesque]] world of [[bureaucracy]] for its own sake and office politics that stand in the way of productivity, where employees' skills and efforts are not rewarded, and [[busy work]] is praised. Much of the humor emerges as the audience sees the characters making obviously ridiculous decisions that are natural reactions to [[management|mismanagement]].

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Dilbert characters}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2020}}

=== Dilbert ===
{{Main|Dilbert (character)}}
The main character in the strip, Dilbert is a technically-minded single white male. Until October 2014, he was usually depicted wearing a white dress shirt, black trousers and a red-and-black striped tie that inexplicably curves upward; after October 13, 2014, his standard apparel changed to a red polo shirt with a name badge on a lanyard around his neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://dilbert.com/strip/2014-10-13 |title = Dilbert Comic Strip on 2014-10-13 &amp;#124; Dilbert by Scott Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilbert is a skilled engineer but has a poor social and romantic life.

=== Pointy-haired Boss ===
{{Main|Pointy-haired Boss}}
The unnamed, oblivious manager of the engineering division of Dilbert's company. Scott Adams states that he never named him so that people can imagine him to be their boss. In earlier strips he was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager with jowls; it was not until later that he developed his signature &quot;pointy hair&quot; and the jowls disappeared. He is hopelessly incompetent at management, and often tries to compensate for his lack of skills with countless group therapy sessions and business strategies that rarely bear fruit. He does not understand technical issues, but always tries to disguise this, usually by using buzzwords he also does not understand. The Boss treats his employees alternately with enthusiasm or neglect; he often uses them to his own ends regardless of the consequences to them. Adams himself wrote that &quot;He's not sadistic, just uncaring&quot;. His level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs. His utter lack of consistent business ethics, however, is perfectly consistent. His brother is a demon named &quot;Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light&quot;, and according to Adams, the pointy hair is intended to remind one of devils' horns.

=== Wally ===
{{Main|Wally (Dilbert)}}
One of the longest serving engineers, Wally was originally a worker trying to get fired to get a severance package. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He often carries a cup of coffee, calmly sipping from it even in the midst of chaos or office-shaking revelations. Wally is extremely cynical. He is even more socially inept than Dilbert (though far less self-aware of the fact), and references to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon. Like the Pointy-haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work. Until the change to &quot;business dorky&quot; wear of a polo shirt, Wally was invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie. Adams has stated that Wally was based on a Pacific Bell coworker of his who was interested in a generous employee buy-out program—for the company's worst employees. This had the effect of causing this man—whom Adams describes as &quot;one of the more brilliant people I've met&quot;—to work hard at being incompetent, rude, and generally poor at his job to qualify for the buy-out program. Adams has said that this inspired the basic laziness and amorality of Wally's character. Despite these personality traits Wally is accepted as part of Dilbert, Ted, Alice, and Asok's clique. Although his relationship with Alice is often antagonistic and Dilbert occasionally denies being his friend, their actions show at least a certain acceptance of him.

=== Alice ===
{{Main|Alice (Dilbert)}}
One of the more competent and highest paid engineers. She is often frustrated at her work, because she does not get proper recognition, which she believes is because she is female, though in reality it is likely because she has a quick, often violent temper, sometimes putting her &quot;Fist of Death&quot; to use, even with the Pointy-haired Boss. Alice is based on a woman that Scott Adams worked with named Anita, who is described as sharing Alice's &quot;pink suit, fluffy hair, technical proficiency, coffee obsession, and take-no-crap attitude.&quot;

=== Dogbert ===
{{Main|Dogbert}}
Dilbert's anthropomorphic pet dog is the smartest dog on Earth. Dogbert is a megalomaniac intellectual dog, planning to one day conquer the world. He once succeeded, but became bored with the ensuing peace, and quit. Often seen in high-ranking consultant or technical support jobs, he constantly abuses his power and fools the management of Dilbert's company, though considering the intelligence of the company's management in general and Dilbert's boss in particular, this is not very hard to do. He also enjoys pulling scams on unsuspecting and usually dull customers to steal their money. However, despite Dogbert's cynical exterior, he has been known to pull his master out of some tight jams. Dogbert's nature as a pet was more emphasized during the earlier years of the strip; as the strip progressed, references to his acting like a dog became less common, although he still wags his tail when he perpetrates his scams. When an older Dilbert arrives while time-traveling from the future, he refers to Dogbert as &quot;majesty&quot;, indicating that Dogbert will one day indeed rule the world ... again, and make worshipping him retroactive so he could boss around time travelers.

=== Catbert ===
{{Main|Catbert}}
'''Catbert''' is the &quot;evil director of [[human resources]]&quot; in the ''Dilbert'' comic strip. He was supposed to be a one-time character but resonated with readers so well that Adams brought him back as the HR director. Catbert's origins with the company are that he was hired by Dogbert. Dogbert hired him because he wanted an H.R. Director that appeared cute while secretly downsizing employees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dilbert.com/strip/1995-03-20 Dilbert.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asok ===
{{Main|Asok (Dilbert)}}
A young intern, he works very hard but does not always get proper recognition. Asok is intensely intelligent but naive about corporate life; the shattering of his optimistic illusions becomes frequent comic fodder. He is Indian, and has graduated from the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]] (IIT). The other workers, especially the boss, often unwittingly trample on his cultural beliefs. On the occasions when Asok mentions this, he is normally ignored. His test scores (a perfect 1600 on the old SAT) and his IQ of 240 show that he is the smartest member of the engineering team. Nonetheless he is often called upon by the Boss to do odd jobs, and in meetings his ideas are usually left hanging. He is also seen regularly at the lunch table with Wally and Dilbert, experiencing jarring realizations of the nature of corporate life. There are a few jokes about his psychic powers, which he learned at the IIT. Yet despite his intelligence, ethics and mystical powers, Asok sometimes takes advice from Wally in the arts of laziness, and from Dilbert in surviving the office. As of February 7, 2014, Asok is officially gay, which never affects any storylines, but merely commemorates a decision by the Indian Supreme Court to uphold an anti-gay law.,&lt;ref name=&quot;SHYAMANTHA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Shyamantha|first=Asokan|title=India's Supreme Court turns the clock back with gay sex ban|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/us-india-rights-gay-idUSBRE9BA05620131211|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2014-02-07/ |title = Dilbert Comic Strip on 2014-02-07 &amp;#124; Dilbert by Scott Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision which was overturned on September 6, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2018/09/indias-supreme-court-overturns-sodomy-ban-landmark-ruling/ |title = India's Supreme Court overturns sodomy ban in a landmark ruling|date = September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ted ===
An engineer who is often seen hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, but he is still seen occasionally. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed down a flight of stairs and becoming possessed), in which case a new Ted is apparently hired. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and children who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Adams refers to him as ''Ted the Generic White Guy'', because whenever he needs to fire or kill someone he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character.

===Elbonia===
Elbonia is a non-specific under-developed country used when Adams wants &quot;to involve a foreign country without hurting overseas sales&quot;. He says &quot;People think I have some specific country in mind when I write about Elbonia, but I don't. It represents the view that Americans have of any country that doesn't have cable television&amp;nbsp;— we think they all wear fur hats and wallow around waist-deep in mud&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Seven years of Defective People&quot;&amp;nbsp;— page 184, &quot;Elbonians&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The entire country wears the same clothing and hats, and all men have full beards. They are occasionally bitter towards their wealthier western neighbors, but are quite happy to trade with them. The whole country is covered in mud, and has limited technology.

Elbonia is located somewhere in the former [[Soviet bloc]]: A strip dated April 2, 1990, refers to the &quot;Tiny [[East European]] country of Elbonia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1990-04-02/ Dilbert.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extremely poor, [[Least Developed Countries|fourth-world]] country that has abandoned [[Communism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilbert.com/fast/1990-04-02/ Dilbert.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The national [[bird]] of Elbonia is the [[Frisbee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1991-10-14/ Dilbert.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a storyline from November 21-26, 2016, Dilbert visits Elbonia and it seems to be more advanced; no waist deep mud, more advanced technology, and the rental car scene looks almost like it's in America or a more advanced European country.

===Phil===
The Pointy-Haired Boss's brother Phil.  His full title is Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light &amp; Supreme Ruler of Heck. His job, one step down from Satan, is to punish those who commit minor sins.  His 'Pitch-Spoon' is feared by those who do. He is known to 'Darn to Heck' people who do things like using cell phones in the bathroom, steal office supplies, or those who simply do something annoying. In one strip, it was mentioned that being in Heck is not as bad as being in a cubicle.

==Legacy==
The popularity of the comic strip within the corporate sector has led to the Dilbert character being used in many business magazines and publications, including several appearances on the cover of ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]''. Many newspapers run the comic in their business section rather than in the regular comics section (similar to the way that ''[[Doonesbury]]'' is often featured in the editorial section, due to its pointed commentary).{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Criticism and parody===
Media analyst [[Norman Solomon]] and cartoonist [[Tom Tomorrow]] claim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://free.freespeech.org/normansolomon/dilbert/book/ |title=The Trouble With Dilbert: The Book |access-date=2009-09-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040218235653/http://free.freespeech.org/normansolomon/dilbert/book/ |archivedate = 2004-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Adams's caricatures of corporate culture seem to project empathy for white-collar workers, but the satire ultimately plays into the hands of upper corporate management itself. Solomon describes the characters of ''Dilbert'' as dysfunctional time-wasters, none of whom occupies a position higher than middle management, and whose inefficiencies detract from corporate values such as 'productivity' and 'growth'&lt;!-- -the following clause removed for lack of sense:, a very favorable outlook for managers- --&gt;. Dilbert and his office-mates often find themselves baffled or victimized by the whims of managerial behavior, but they never seem to question it openly. Solomon cites the [[Xerox]] corporation's use of ''Dilbert'' strips and characters in internally distributed 'inspirational' pamphlets:

{{quote|style=font-size: 100%;|text=Xerox management had recognized what more gullible ''Dilbert'' readers did not: ''Dilbert'' is an offbeat sugary substance that helps the corporate medicine go down. The ''Dilbert'' phenomenon accepts — and perversely eggs on — many negative aspects of corporate existence as unchangeable facets of human nature... As Xerox managers grasped, ''Dilbert'' speaks to some very real work experiences while simultaneously eroding inclinations to fight for better working conditions.}}

Adams responded in the February 2, 1998 strip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-02-02/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for February 2, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |access-date=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book ''The Joy of Work'', by simply restating Solomon's argument, apparently suggesting that it was absurd and required no rebuttal.

In 1997, [[Tom Vanderbilt]] wrote in a similar vein in ''[[The Baffler]]'' magazine:

{{quote|style=font-size: 100%;|text=Labor unions haven't adopted ''Dilbert'' characters as insignia. But corporations in droves have rushed to link themselves with ''Dilbert''. Why? ''Dilbert'' mirrors the mass media's crocodile tears for working people&amp;nbsp;— and echoes the ambient noises from Wall Street.}}

In 1998, [[Bill Griffith]], creator of ''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'', chided Dilbert for crude drawings and simplistic humor. He wrote, 
{{blockquote|Long since psychically kidnapped by the gaudy, mindlessly hyperactive world of television, (readers) no longer demand or expect comic strips to be compelling, challenging, or even interesting. Enter '[[Cathy]]'. And 'Dilbert.' Sure, comics are still funny. It's just that the humor has almost no 'nutritional' value. In the tiny space allotted to them, daily strips have all too successfully adapted to their new environment. In this Darwinian set-up, what thrives are simply drawn panels , minimal dialogue, and a lot of head-and-shoulder shots. Anything more complicated is deemed 'too hard to read.' A full, rich drawing style is a drawback. Simplicity, even crudity, rules.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Bill (November 10, 1996) [http://www.zippythepinhead.com/pages/aaarticles.html &quot;Comics at 100.&quot;] Articles by Bill Griffith. (Retrieved 9-12-2016.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adams responded by creating two comic strips called ''Pippy the Ziphead'', in which Dogbert creates a comic by &quot;cramming as much artwork in as possible so no one will notice there's only one joke ... [and it's] on the reader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-05-18/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for May 18, 1998 |publisher=Dilbert.com |date= |access-date=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dilbert says that the strip is &quot;nothing but a clown with a small head who says random things&quot;, and Dogbert responds that he is &quot;maintaining his artistic integrity by creating a comic that no one will enjoy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1998-05-19/ |title=Dilbert comic strip for 19 May 1998 from the official Dilbert comic strips archive |publisher=Dilbert.com |access-date=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the same year, Griffith mocked Adams' ''Pippy the Ziphead'' with a strip of the same name drawn in a simplistic, stiff, ''Dilbert''-like style set in an office setting and featuring the characters Zippy and Griffy retorting, &quot;I sense a joke was delivered. [...] Yes. It was. My one joke. Ha.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, an amateur cartoonist named Karl Hörnell began submitting a comic strip to ''[[Savage Dragon]]'' creator [[Erik Larsen]] that parodied both ''Dilbert''&lt;ref name=&quot;dragon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javaonthebrain.com/artwork/dragonbert.html |title=Savage Dragonbert |publisher=Javaonthebrain.com |date= |access-date=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Image Comics]] series ''The Savage Dragon''. This soon became a regular feature in the ''Savage Dragon'' comic book, titled ''The Savage Dragonbert and Hitler's Brainbert'' (&quot;Hitler's Brainbert&quot; being a loose parody of both Dogbert and the ''Savage Dragon'' villain identified as [[Adolf Hitler]]'s disembodied, superpowered brain). The strip began as a specific parody of the comic book itself, set loosely within the office structure of ''Dilbert'', with Hörnell doing an emulation of Adams's cartooning style.&lt;ref name=&quot;dragon&quot; /&gt;

=== {{Visible anchor|Language}} ===&lt;!-- Other articles link here --&gt;
Adams has invited readers to invent words that have become popular among fans in describing their own office environments, such as &quot;''Induhvidual''&quot;. This term is based on the [[American English]] slang expression &quot;[[wikt:duh|duh]]!&quot; The conscious misspelling of ''individual'' as ''induhvidual'' is a pejorative term for people who are not in [[Dogbert's New Ruling Class]] (DNRC). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aden |first=Roger C. |date=2007 |title=Popular Stories and Promised Lands: Fan Cultures and Symbolic Pilgrimages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vxvm5oxF1aYC&amp;pg=PA136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=1st |publisher=University Alabama Press | page=135-137 | isbn=978-0817354725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its coining is explained in ''Dilbert Newsletter'' #6. The strip has also popularized the usage of the terms &quot;cow-orker&quot; and [[Pointy-haired Boss|PHB]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Management===
In 1997, Scott Adams masqueraded as a management consultant to [[Logitech]] executives (as Ray Mebert), with the cooperation of the company's vice-chairman. He acted in much the way that he portrays management consultants in the comic strip, with an arrogant manner and bizarre suggestions, such as comparing [[Strategic planning#Mission statements and vision statements|mission statement]]s to broccoli soup. He convinced the executives to change their existing mission statement for their New Ventures Group from &quot;provide Logitech with profitable growth and related new business areas&quot; to &quot;scout profitable growth opportunities in relationships, both internally and externally, in emerging, mission-inclusive markets, and explore new paradigms and then filter and communicate and evangelize the findings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19971116&amp;slug=2572663 ''Dilbert Creator Fools Execs With Soap Story'', [[Associated Press]], from the Web page of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', November 16, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000914093255/http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/humor/scott-adams-mgmt-consultant ''Dilbert Creator Fools Executives'', AP story, in full, preserved on [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] humor bulletin board, November 15, 1997.

To demonstrate what can be achieved with the most mundane objects if planned correctly and imaginatively, Adams has worked with companies to develop &quot;dream&quot; products for Dilbert and company. In 2001, he collaborated with design company [[IDEO]] to come up with the &quot;perfect cubicle&quot;, a fitting creation since many of the ''Dilbert'' strips make fun of the standard [[Cubicle|cubicle desk]] and the environment that it creates. The result was both whimsical and practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Porter Anderson |title=Fred Dust: Designing for Dilbert |publisher=CNN Career |date=2001-08-28 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.fred.dust.focus/index.html |access-date=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429114333/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.fred.dust.focus/index.html |archivedate=April 29, 2007 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Porter Anderson|title=Scott Adams: Dilbert's Ultimate Cubicle|publisher=CNN Career|date=2001-08-28|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/jobenvy/08/28/dilbert.scott.adams/index.html|access-date=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project was followed in 2004 with designs for [https://web.archive.org/web/20041001095014/http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/duh/index.html Dilbert's Ultimate House] (abbreviated as DUH). An energy-efficient building was the result, designed to prevent many of the little problems that seem to creep into a normal building. For instance, to save time spent buying and decorating a [[Christmas tree]] every year, the house has a large (yet unapparent) closet adjacent to the living room where the tree can be stored from year to year.

In 1995, ''Dilbert'' was the [[List of early webcomics|first]] syndicated comic strip to be published for free on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2013/10/23/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-reveals-the-simple-formula-that-will-double-your-odds-of-success/#54f98fbd1a3e|magazine=[[Forbes]]|title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Reveals The Simple Formula That Will Double Your Odds Of Success|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|date=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putting his [[email]] address in each ''Dilbert'' strip, Adams created a &quot;direct channel to [his] customers&quot;, allowing him to modify the strip based on their feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2013/10/23/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-reveals-the-simple-formula-that-will-double-your-odds-of-success/#54f98fbd1a3e|magazine=[[Forbes]]|title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Reveals The Simple Formula That Will Double Your Odds Of Success|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|date=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Zabel]] stated that ''Dilbert'' had a large influence on many of the [[webcomic]]s that followed it, establishing the &quot;[[nerd]]core&quot; genre as it found its audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html | publisher=The Webcomics Examiner | title=The Artistic History of Webcomics&amp;nbsp;— A Webcomics Examiner Roundtable|author=Various|year=2005|archive-date=2005-11-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124120515/http://webcomicsreview.com/examiner/issue050912/history1.html|ref=Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Scott Adams announced that [[United Media]] would be instituting an interactive feature on Dilbert.com, allowing fans to write speech bubbles and, in the near future, interact with Adams about the content of the strips. Adams has spoken positively about the change, saying, &quot;This makes cartooning a competitive sport.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Brad Stone|title=Scott Adams Hands &quot;Dilbert&quot; Pen to Fans|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/scott-adams-hands-dilbert-pen-to-fans/|work=The New York Times|date=2008-04-18|access-date=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|inaccurate=yes|date=December 2016}}

==Awards==
In addition to the National Cartoonists Society [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Awards]] won by Adams, the ''Dilbert'' strip has received a variety of other awards. Adams was named best international comic strip artist of 1995 in the [[Adamson Awards]] given by the Swedish Academy of Comic Art.

''Dilbert'' was named the best syndicated strip of 1997 in the [[Harvey Award]]s and won the [[Max &amp; Moritz Prize]] as best international comic strip for 1998.

===Animated series===
{{Main|Dilbert (TV series)}}
''Dilbert'' was adapted into a [[UPN]] animated television series starring [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as [[Dilbert (character)|Dilbert]], [[Chris Elliott]] as [[Dogbert]], and [[Kathy Griffin]] as Alice. The series ran for two seasons from January 25, 1999 to July 25, 2000. The first season centered around the creation of a new product called the &quot;Gruntmaster 6000&quot;. It was critically acclaimed and won a Golden Globe award, leading to its renewal for a second season. The second season did away with the serial format and was composed entirely of standalone episodes, many of which shifted focus away from the workplace and involved absurdist plots such as Wally being mistaken for a religious leader (&quot;[[Dilbert (TV series)#Episodes|The Shroud of Wally]]&quot;) and Dilbert being accused of mass murder (&quot;[[Dilbert (TV series)#Episodes|The Trial]]&quot;). Critical and fan reception was resoundingly negative to the change in format and storytelling, and the series was not renewed for a third season. The second season two-episode finale included Dilbert getting pregnant with the child of a cow, a [[hillbilly]], [[robot]] DNA, &quot;several dozen engineers&quot;, an elderly billionaire, and an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], eventually ending up in a custody battle with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] as the Judge.

===New animation===
On April 7, 2008, dilbert.com presented its first Dilbert animation. The new Dilbert animations are animated versions of original comic strips produced by [[RingTales]] and animated by [[Powerhouse Animation Studios]]. The animation videos run for around 30 seconds each and are added every weekday. On December 10, 2009 the RingTales produced animations were made available as a calendar application for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dilbert Animated Calendar |url=http://www.metranome.net/calendars.php |date=2009-12-10 |access-date=2009-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723205352/http://www.metranome.net/calendars.php |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Drunken lemurs&quot; case==
In October 2007, the Catfish Bend Casino in [[Burlington, Iowa]] notified its staff that the casino was closing and they were going to be [[layoff|laid off]]. David Steward, an employee of seven years, then posted on an office bulletin board the ''Dilbert'' strip&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Scott Adams|title=Dilbert|url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2007-10-26/|date=2007-10-26|access-date=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of October 26, 2007 that compared management decisions to those of &quot;drunken [[lemur]]s&quot;. The casino called this &quot;very offensive&quot;; they identified him from a surveillance tape, fired him, and tried to prevent him from receiving [[unemployment benefits]]. However, an administrative law judge ruled in December 2007 that he would receive benefits, as his action was not intentional misbehavior. Scott Adams said that it might be the first confirmed case of an employee being fired for posting a ''Dilbert'' cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Clark Kauffman |title=Bosses fire worker who put up 'Dilbert' comic |url=http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071219/NEWS/712190360/-1/politics |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707110155/http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071219/NEWS/712190360/-1/politics |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-07 |work=Des Moines Register |date=2007-12-19 |access-date=2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 2008, the first of a series of ''Dilbert'' strips showed Wally being caught posting a comic strip that &quot;compares managers to drunken lemurs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Scott Adams|title=Dilbert|url=http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2008-02-20/|date=2008-02-20|access-date=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams later said that fans should stick to posting ''[[Garfield]]'' strips, as no one gets fired for that.

==Guest artists==
On February 29, 2016, Adams posted on his blog&lt;ref name=&quot;GuestArtists2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Scott|title=Dilbert's Changed Look Explained|url=http://blog.dilbert.com/post/140211504101/dilberts-changed-look-explained|access-date=2016-03-26|date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he would be taking a six-week vacation. During that time, strips would be written by him but drawn by guest artists who work for [[Universal Uclick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/ask_sam/ask-sam-what-has-happened-to-dilbert/article_39e84332-13d4-58db-84d8-0e5b5beb1e46.html|title=SAM|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jake Tapper]] drew the strip on the week on May 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journalnow.com/news/ask_sam/ask-sam-why-is-there-another-primary/article_5e156c40-32d3-5290-ad69-269c3338f597.html|title=SAM|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other guest artists were John Glynn, Eric Scott, Josh Shipley, Joel Friday, Donna Oatney and Brenna Thummler.  Jake Tapper also drew the cartoon strip the weeks of May 23, 2016 and September 23-28, 2019.
