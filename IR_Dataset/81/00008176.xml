'''David Warren Brubeck''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|uː|b|ɛ|k}}; December 6, 1920&amp;nbsp;– December 5, 2012) was an American jazz pianist and composer, considered one of the foremost exponents of [[cool jazz]]. Many of his compositions have become [[jazz standard]]s including &quot;[[In Your Own Sweet Way]]&quot; and &quot;The Duke&quot;. Brubeck's style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting both his mother's classical training and his own improvisational skills. His music is known for employing unusual [[time signature]]s as well as superimposing contrasting rhythms, [[meter (music)|meters]], and [[tonality|tonalities]].

Brubeck experimented with time signatures throughout his career, recording &quot;Pick Up Sticks&quot; in {{music|time|6|4}}, &quot;[[Unsquare Dance]]&quot; in {{music|time|7|4}}, &quot;World's Fair&quot; in {{music|time|13|4}}, and &quot;[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]&quot; in {{music|time|9|8}}. He was also a composer of orchestral and sacred music and wrote soundtracks for television, such as ''[[Mr. Broadway]]'' and the animated miniseries ''[[This Is America, Charlie Brown]]''.

Often incorrectly attributed to Brubeck, the song &quot;[[Take Five]]&quot;, which has become a [[jazz standard]], was composed by Brubeck's long-time musical partner, alto saxophonist [[Paul Desmond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;City of Concord news release&quot; /&gt; Appearing on one of the top-selling jazz albums, ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'', and written in {{music|time|5|4}} time, &quot;Take Five&quot; has endured as a jazz classic associated with Brubeck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jazz.com/gallery/sony-collectibles |title=Jazz Music – Jazz Artists – Jazz News |publisher=Jazz.com |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830230251/http://www.jazz.com/gallery/sony-collectibles |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Dave Brubeck was born in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] city of [[Concord, California]],&lt;ref name=&quot;City of Concord news release&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/about/citynews/releases/2006/05-04-06-brubeck.htm |title=Reception honors Concord native son, jazz great Dave Brubeck |accessdate=2007-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000204/http://www.ci.concord.ca.us/about/citynews/releases/2006/05-04-06-brubeck.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}, ci.concord.ca.us. Retrieved September 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in a city located in the Mother Lode called [[Ione, California]]. His father, Peter Howard &quot;Pete&quot; Brubeck, was a [[cattle rancher]], and his mother, Elizabeth (née Ivey), who had studied piano in England under [[Myra Hess]] and intended to become a [[concert pianist]], taught piano for extra money.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Storb|first=Ilse|title=Jazz meets the world – the world meets Jazz, Volume 4 of Populäre Musik und Jazz in der Forschung|publisher=LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2000|page=129|url=|isbn=3-8258-3748-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father had Swiss ancestry (the family surname was originally Brodbeck) and possibly Native American [[Modoc people|Modoc]] lineage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/the-second-oldest-profession-pt-4/ &quot;The Second Oldest Profession? (Part 4)&quot;] by Ratzo B. Harris, NewMusicBox, December 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; while his maternal grandparents were English and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/brubeck.html |title=Ancestry of Dave Brubeck |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;and possibly Native American Modoc Tribe – see: paragraph one, of the second page of the Dave Brubeck interview by Martin Totusek in ''[[Cadence Magazine]]'' – The Review of Jazz &amp; Blues, December 1994, Vol. 20 No. 12, pp. 5–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianjazz.org/oral_histories/pdf/Brubeck.pdf|title=Dave Brubeck NEA Jazz Master (1999)|publisher=Smithsonianjazz.org|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brubeck originally did not intend to become a musician (his two older brothers, Henry and [[Howard Brubeck|Howard]], were already on that track), but took lessons from his mother. He could not [[musical notation|read music]] during these early lessons, attributing this difficulty to poor eyesight, but &quot;faked&quot; his way through well enough that this deficiency went mostly unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fishko|first=Sara|url=http://www.wnyc.org/music/articles/32460|title=An Hour With Dave Brubeck |publisher=[[WNYC]]|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intending to work with his father on their ranch, Brubeck entered the College of the Pacific in [[Stockton, California]] (now the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]]), studying [[veterinary science]]. He changed to music on the urging of the head of [[zoology]], Dr. Arnold, who told him &quot;Brubeck, your mind's not here. It's across the lawn in the [[Music school|conservatory]]. Please go there. Stop wasting my time and yours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''It's About Time: The Dave Brubeck Story'', by Fred M. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Brubeck was nearly expelled when one of his professors discovered that he could not [[sight-reading|read music on sight]]. Several of his professors came forward, arguing that his ability to write [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]] more than compensated, and demonstrated his familiarity with music notation. The college was still afraid that it would cause a scandal, and agreed to let Brubeck graduate only after he had promised never to teach piano.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowboy to Jazzman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/brubeck/theMan/cowboyToJazzman.htm |title=Rediscovering Dave Brubeck &amp;#124; The Man &amp;#124; With Hedrick Smith |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in 1942, Brubeck was drafted into the [[U.S. Army]]. He served in Europe in the [[Third United States Army|Third Army]]. He volunteered to play piano at a [[Red Cross]] show and was such a hit that he was spared from combat service and ordered to form a band. He created one of the U.S. armed forces' first [[racial integration|racially integrated]] bands, &quot;The Wolfpack&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowboy to Jazzman&quot;/&gt; While serving in the military, Brubeck met [[Paul Desmond]] in early 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to the album ''25th Anniversary Reunion'', Dave Brubeck Quartet&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to college after serving nearly four years in the army, this time attending [[Mills College]] in Oakland. He studied under [[Darius Milhaud]], who encouraged him to study [[fugue]] and [[orchestration]], but not classical piano. While on active duty, he received two lessons from [[Arnold Schoenberg]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in an attempt to connect with [[High modernism|high modernist]] theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Kevin. 2009. ''Golden dreams: California in an age of abundance, 1950–1963''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the encounter did not end on good terms since Schoenberg believed that every note should be accounted for, an approach which Brubeck could not accept, although according to his son Chris Brubeck, there is a twelve-tone row in ''The Light in the Wilderness'', Dave Brubeck's first oratorio. In it, Jesus's twelve [[Apostle (Christian)|disciples]] are introduced each singing their own individual notes; it is described as “quite dramatic, especially when Judas starts singing 'Repent' on a high and straining dissonant note.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/my-mentor-my-collaborator-my-father-dave-brubeck/|title=My Mentor, My Collaborator, My Father: Dave Brubeck|author=Chris Brubeck|publisher=Newmusicbox.org|accessdate=July 13, 2013|date=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Sheedy owned San Francisco-based Coronet Records, which had previously recorded area [[Dixieland]] bands. (This Coronet Records should not be confused with either the late 1950s New York-based budget label, nor with Australia-based [[Coronet Records]].) In 1949, Sheedy was talked into making the first recording of Brubeck's octet and later his trio. But Sheedy was unable to pay his bills and in 1949 turned his masters over to his record stamping company, the Circle Record Company, owned by Max and Sol Weiss. The Weiss brothers soon changed the name of their business to [[Fantasy Records]].

These initial Brubeck records sold well, and he recorded and issued new records for Fantasy. Soon the company was shipping 40,000 to 50,000 copies of Brubeck records each quarter, making enormous profits.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Ted. &quot;Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco&quot; in ''West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945–1960'', University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 (reprint of 1962 edition), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Brubeck damaged several neck vertebrae and his spinal cord while diving into the surf in [[Hawaii]]. He would later remark that the rescue workers who responded had described him as a &quot;DOA&quot; (dead on arrival). Brubeck recovered after a few months, but suffered with residual nerve pain in his hands for years after.&lt;ref name=washpost /&gt; The injury also influenced his playing style towards complex, blocky chords rather than speedy, high-dexterity, single-note runs.

Brubeck organized the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951, with [[Paul Desmond]] on alto saxophone. They took up a long residency at San Francisco's [[Black Hawk (nightclub)|Black Hawk nightclub]] and gained great popularity touring college campuses, recording a series of albums with such titles as ''[[Jazz at Oberlin]]'' (1953), ''[[Jazz at the College of the Pacific]]'' (1953), and Brubeck's debut on [[Columbia Records]], ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]'' (1954).

When Brubeck signed with [[Fantasy Records]], he thought he had a half interest in the company and he worked as a sort of [[Artists and repertoire|A &amp; R]] man for the label, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign other contemporary jazz performers, including [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Chet Baker]] and [[Red Norvo]]. When he discovered that all he owned was a half interest in his own recording, he quit to sign with another label, [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The San Francisco Scene in the 1950s,&quot; West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California 1945–1960, Ted Gioia, University of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1998 (reprint of 1962 edition), pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the second jazz musician to be so honored (the first was [[Louis Armstrong]] on February 21, 1949).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19490221,00.html ''Time'' magazine cover: Louis Armstrong] – February 21, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; Brubeck personally found this accolade embarrassing, since he considered [[Duke Ellington]] more deserving of it and was convinced that he had been favored for being Caucasian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Fred|title=1959: The Year that Changed Everything|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Songs|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellington himself knocked on the door of Brubeck's hotel room to show him the cover and the only reaction Brubeck could give was, “It should have been you.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample Liner Notes by Darius Brubeck|year=2007|accessdate=December 23, 2012|work=Dave Brubeck Live IN '64 &amp; '66|url=http://www.jazzicons.com/ji2_brubeck.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bassists for the group included Ron Crotty, [[Bob Bates (musician)|Bob Bates]] and his brother [[Norman Bates (musician)|Norman Bates]]; Lloyd Davis and Joe Dodge held the drum chair. In 1956 Brubeck hired drummer [[Joe Morello]], who had been working with [[Marian McPartland]]; Morello's presence made possible the rhythmic experiments that were to come. In 1958 African-American bassist [[Eugene Wright]] joined for the group's [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] tour of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/03/AR2008040303366.html |title=Ambassador of Cool |last=Schudel |first=Matt |date=2008-04-06 |website=washingtonpost.com |access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group visited Poland, Turkey, India, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), Pakistan, Iran and Iraq on behalf of the U.S. Government. They spent two weeks in Poland, giving thirteen concerts and spending time visiting with Polish musicians and citizens as part of the People-to-People program. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hatschek|first=Keith|date=2010-12-01|title=The Impact of American Jazz Diplomacy in Poland During the Cold War Era|journal=Jazz Perspectives|volume=4|issue=3|pages=253–300|doi=10.1080/17494060.2010.561088|issn=1749-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright became a permanent member in 1959, making the &quot;classic&quot; Quartet's personnel complete. During the late 1950s and early 1960s Brubeck canceled several concerts because the club owners or hall managers continued to resist the idea of an integrated band on their stages. He also canceled a television appearance when he found out that the producers intended to keep Wright off-camera.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web| title=How Dave Brubeck Used His Talents to Fight for Integration| last=Grabar| first=Henry| date=December 5, 2012| accessdate=December 8, 2012| work=[[The Atlantic Cities]]| url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/12/dave-brubecks-real-legacy-integration/4080/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, the Dave Brubeck Quartet recorded ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'', an album about which the record label was enthusiastic but which they were nonetheless hesitant to release. Featuring the cover art of [[S. Neil Fujita]], the album contained all original compositions, almost none of which were in [[common time]]: {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|5|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, and {{music|time|6|4}} were used, inspired by Eurasian folk music they experienced during their 1958 Department of State sponsored tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kaplan | title=1959 | url=https://archive.org/details/1959yearthatchan00kapl | url-access=registration | year=2009 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/1959yearthatchan00kapl/page/131 131–132]| publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time signatures (the album included &quot;[[Take Five]]&quot;, &quot;[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]&quot;, and &quot;Three To Get Ready&quot;), it quickly went [[Platinum album|Platinum]]. It was the first jazz album to sell more than a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9724992/Dave-Brubeck-Take-Five-jazz-star-dies-91.html| title = Dave Brubeck, Take Five jazz star, dies 91| accessdate = December 5, 2012| work = The Daily Telegraph| date = December 5, 2012| last1 = Chilton| first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time Out'' was followed by several albums with a similar approach, including ''[[Time Further Out|Time Further Out: Miro Reflections]]'' (1961), using more {{music|time|5|4}}, {{music|time|6|4}}, and {{music|time|9|8}}, plus the first attempt at {{music|time|7|4}}; ''[[Countdown—Time in Outer Space]]'' (dedicated to [[John Glenn]], 1962), featuring {{music|time|11|4}} and more {{music|time|7|4}}; ''[[Time Changes]]'' (1963), with much {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|10|4}} (which was really {{serif|'''5+5'''}}), and {{music|time|13|4}}; and ''[[Time In (album)|Time In]]'' (1966).

These albums (except the last) were also known for using contemporary paintings as cover art, featuring the work of [[Joan Miró]] on ''Time Further Out'', [[Franz Kline]] on ''Time in Outer Space'', and [[Sam Francis]] on ''Time Changes''.

On a handful of albums in the early 1960s, clarinetist [[Bill Smith (jazz musician)|Bill Smith]] replaced Desmond. These albums were devoted to Smith's compositions and thus had a somewhat different aesthetic than other Brubeck Quartet albums. Nonetheless, according to critic Ken Dryden, &quot;[Smith] proves himself very much in Desmond's league with his witty solos.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/near-myth-mw0000263459|title=Near-Myth – The Dave Brubeck Quartet &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &amp;#124; AllMusic|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was an old friend of Brubeck's; they would record together, intermittently, from the 1940s until the final years of Brubeck's career.

In the early 1960s, Brubeck and his wife Iola developed a jazz musical, ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'', based in part on experiences they and their colleagues had during foreign tours on behalf of the Department of State. The soundtrack album, which featured [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross]], and [[Carmen McRae]] was recorded in 1961; the musical was performed at the 1962 [[Monterey Jazz Festival]].

At its peak in the early 1960s, the Brubeck Quartet was releasing as many as four albums a year. Apart from the &quot;College&quot; and the &quot;Time&quot; series, Brubeck recorded four [[LP album|LPs]] featuring his compositions based on the group's travels, and the local music they encountered. ''[[Jazz Impressions of the U.S.A.]]'' (1956, Morello's debut with the group), ''Jazz Impressions of Eurasia'' (1958), ''[[Jazz Impressions of Japan]]'' (1964), and ''[[Jazz Impressions of New York]]'' (1964) are less well-known albums, but all are brilliant examples of the quartet's studio work, and they produced Brubeck standards such as &quot;Summer Song&quot;, &quot;Brandenburg Gate&quot;, &quot;Koto Song&quot;, and &quot;Theme From Mr. Broadway&quot;. (Brubeck wrote, and the Quartet performed, the theme song for this [[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]] CBS drama series; the music from the series became material for the ''New York'' album.) In 1961, Brubeck appeared in a few scenes of the British jazz/beat film ''[[All Night Long (1962 film)|All Night Long]]'', which starred [[Patrick McGoohan]] and [[Richard Attenborough]]. Brubeck merely plays himself, with the film featuring [[close-up]]s of his piano fingerings. Brubeck performs &quot;It's a Raggy Waltz&quot; from the ''Time Further Out'' album and duets briefly with bassist [[Charles Mingus]] in &quot;Non-Sectarian Blues&quot;.

In the early 1960s Dave Brubeck was the program director of WJZZ-FM radio (now [[WEZN-FM]]). He achieved his vision of an all-jazz format radio station along with his friend and neighbor John E. Metts, one of the first African Americans in senior radio management. The final studio album for Columbia by the Desmond/Wright/Morello quartet was ''Anything Goes'' (1966) featuring the songs of [[Cole Porter]]. A few concert recordings followed, and ''The Last Time We Saw Paris'' (1967) was the &quot;Classic&quot; Quartet's swan-song.

Brubeck produced ''The Gates of Justice'' in 1968, a [[cantata]] mixing [[Biblical scripture]] with the words of Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  The new senior management at Columbia Records decided not to renew Brubeck's contract in 1971, as they wished to focus on rock music. He moved to Atlantic Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Fred M. |date=1996 |title=It's About Time |location=Fayetteville, Arkansas |publisher=University of Arkansas Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/itsabouttimedave00hall/page/147 147–148] |isbn=1-55728-404-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/itsabouttimedave00hall/page/147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His music was used in the 1985 film ''[[Ordeal by Innocence (film)|Ordeal by Innocence]]''.

Brubeck became a Catholic in 1980, shortly after completing the Mass ''To Hope'' which had been commissioned by Ed Murray, editor of the national Catholic weekly ''[[Our Sunday Visitor]]''. Although he had spiritual interests before that time, he said, &quot;I didn't convert to Catholicism, because I wasn't anything to convert from. I just joined the Catholic Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/brubeck/theMusic/brubeckRediscovers.htm Rediscovering Dave Brubeck], PBS&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

Brubeck founded the Brubeck Institute with his wife, Iola, at their alma mater, the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] in 2000. What began as a special archive, consisting of the personal document collection of the Brubecks, has since expanded to provide fellowships and educational opportunities in jazz for students, also leading to having one of the main streets on which the school resides named in his honor, Dave Brubeck Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.pacific.edu/x19743.xml |title=Brubeck Summer Jazz Colony|publisher=Web.pacific.edu|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that he &quot;was one of Jazz's first pop stars,&quot; even though he was not always happy with his fame. He felt uncomfortable, for example, that ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' had featured him on the cover&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857657,00.html &quot;Music: The Man on Cloud No. 7&quot; (cover story)], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', November 8, 1954. {{Subscription required}} [http://drewgurian.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/as01.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt; before it did so for [[Duke Ellington]], saying, &quot;It just bothered me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=August|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-dave-brubeck-dies-at-91-20121205,0,5395417.story|title=Jazz great Dave Brubeck dies at 91|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 6, 2012|date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted he had continued to play well into his old age, performing in 2011 and in 2010 only a month after getting a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]], with ''Times'' music writer Nate Chinen commenting that Brubeck had replaced &quot;the old hammer-and-anvil attack with something almost airy&quot; and that his playing at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club]] in New York City was &quot;the picture of judicious clarity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/arts/music/dave-brubeck-jazz-musician-dies-at-91.html|title=Dave Brubeck, Jazz Musician, Dies at 91|work=The New York Times|date=December 6, 1920|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Daily Telegraph'', music journalist Ivan Hewett wrote: &quot;Brubeck didn't have the réclame of some jazz musicians who lead tragic lives. He didn't do drugs or drink. What he had was endless curiosity combined with stubbornness,&quot; adding, &quot;His work list is astonishing, including oratorios, musicals and concertos, as well as hundreds of jazz compositions. This quiet man of jazz was truly a marvel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hewett&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewett |first=Ivan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/9726449/Dave-Brubeck-Endless-curiosity-combined-with-stubbornness.html|title=Dave Brubeck: Endless curiosity combined with stubbornness|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=December 6, 2012|date=December 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Guardian'', John Fordham said &quot;Brubeck's real achievement was to blend European compositional ideas, very demanding rhythmic structures, jazz song-forms and improvisation in expressive and accessible ways. His son Chris told ''The Guardian'' &quot;when I hear Chorale, it reminds me of the very best [[Aaron Copland]], something like Appalachian Spring. There's a sort of American honesty to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fordham&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fordham |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/05/dave-brubeck|title=Dave Brubeck obituary|work=The Guardian|date=December 5, 2012|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Christgau]] dubbed Brubeck the &quot;jazz hero of the rock and roll generation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=December 7, 2012|url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=073321a4-a3cb-465e-bcca-a623a23e023b|title=Dave Brubeck|publisher=[[MSN Music]].

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote: &quot;Above all they found it hard to believe that the most successful jazz in America was being played by a family man, a laid-back Californian, modest, gentle and open, who would happily have been a rancher all his days—except that he couldn't live without performing, because the rhythm of jazz, under all his extrapolation and exploration, was, he had discovered, the rhythm of his heart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=December 15, 2012|url=https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21568337-dave-brubeck-pianist-and-composer-died-december-5th-aged-91-dave-brubeck|title=Dave Brubeck|work=[[The Economist]]|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Concord Boulevard Park in his hometown of Concord, California, was renamed to &quot;Dave Brubeck Memorial Park&quot; in his honor.

In the [[Date format by country|format]] most commonly used in the U.S., May 4 is written &quot;5/4,&quot; recalling the time signature of &quot;Take Five&quot;, Brubeck's best known recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.saxontheweb.net/showthread.php?237690-5-4-is-Dave-Brubeck-Day!|title=5/4 is Dave Brubeck Day!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2019, musicologist Stephen A.
