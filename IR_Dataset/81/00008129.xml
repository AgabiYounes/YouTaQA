'''''Digitalis''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɪ|dʒ|ᵻ|ˈ|t|eɪ|l|ᵻ|s}}&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]:'' &quot;Digitalis&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɪ|dʒ|ᵻ|ˈ|t|æ|l|ᵻ|s}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/digitalis Digitalis] at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[genus]] of about 20 [[species]] of [[herb]]aceous [[Perennial plant|perennials]], [[shrub]]s, and [[Biennial plant|biennials]] commonly called '''foxgloves'''.

This genus was traditionally placed in the figwort [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scrophulariaceae]], but recent [[phylogenetic]] research has placed it in the much enlarged family [[Plantaginaceae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;olmstead&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Olmstead, R.

The flowers are produced on a tall spike, are tubular, and vary in colour with species, from purple to pink, white, and yellow. The scientific name means &quot;finger-like&quot; and refers to the ease with which a [[flower]] can be fitted over a human fingertip. 

The best-known species is the common foxglove, ''[[Digitalis purpurea]]''. This [[biennial plant]] is often grown as an [[ornamental plant]] due to its vivid flowers which range in colour from various purple tints through pink, and purely white. The flowers can also possess various marks and spottings. Other garden-worthy species include ''D. ferruginea'', ''D. grandiflora'', ''D. lutea'' and ''D. parviflora''.&lt;ref name=AZEGP&gt;{{cite book

The term ''digitalis'' is also used for drug preparations that contain [[cardiac glycoside]]s, particularly one called [[digoxin]], extracted from various plants of this genus. Foxglove has medicinal uses but can also be toxic to humans and other animals.

==Etymology==
[[File:Hendrik Goltzius, A Foxglove in Bloom, 1592, NGA 94900.jpg|alt=Brown pen and ink of a foxglove in bloom|thumb|Hendrik Goltzius, A Foxglove in Bloom, 1592, [[National Gallery of Art]], NGA 94900]]
The name &quot;foxglove&quot; was first recorded in the year 1542 by [[Leonhard Fuchs]], whose family name, Fuchs, is the German word for &quot;fox&quot; (the plant genus ''[[Fuchsia]]'' is also named for him). The genus ''digitalis'' is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''digitus'' (finger), perhaps referencing the shape of the flowers, which accommodate a finger when fully formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hollman |first1=A |date=September 1985 |title=Plants and cardiac glycosides|journal=Br. Heart J.  |volume= 54|issue=3 |pages=258–261 |pmc=481893 |doi=10.1136/hrt.54.3.258 |pmid=4041297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the name is recorded in Old English as ''foxes glofe/glofa'' or ''fox's glove.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Etymologists at War with a Flower: Foxglove {{!}} OUPblog|url = http://blog.oup.com/2010/11/foxglove/|accessdate = 2015-08-10|date = 2010-11-10|last = Liberman|authorlink = Anatoly Liberman|first = Anatoly|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130508161659/http://blog.oup.com/2010/11/foxglove/|archivedate = 2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, folk myths obscured the literal origins of the name, insinuating that foxes wore the flowers on their paws to silence their movements as they stealthily hunted their prey. The woody hillsides where the foxes made their dens were often covered with the toxic flowers. Some of the more menacing names, such as &quot;witch's glove,&quot; reference the toxicity of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaex.edu/yard-garden/resource-library/plant-week/foxglove.aspx|title=Foxglove|website=Foxglove|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Fox Talbot]] (1847) proposed ''folks' glove'', where ''folk'' means fairy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Similarly, R. C. A. Prior (1863) suggested an etymology of ''foxes-glew'', meaning 'fairy music'.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; However, neither of these suggestions accounts for the Old English form ''foxes glofa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Etymologists at War with a Flower: Foxglove {{!}} OUPblog|url = http://blog.oup.com/2010/11/foxglove/|accessdate = 2015-08-10|date = 2010-11-10|last = Liberman|authorlink = Anatoly Liberman|first = Anatoly|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130508161659/http://blog.oup.com/2010/11/foxglove/|archivedate = 2013-05-08}}

==Habitat==
[[File:Digitalis purpurea patch in Seattle.jpg|thumb|A patch of [[Digitalis purpurea]] and [[Digitalis lutea]] in Seattle, WA.]]
''Digitalis'' species thrive in acidic [[soil]]s, in partial sunlight to deep shade, in a range of habitats, including open woods, woodland clearings, moorland and heath margins, sea-cliffs, rocky mountain slopes and hedge banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arkive&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/27/27.4.html |title=Foxglove: Digitalis purpurea (Scrophulariaceae) |last=Anon |work=Wildflowers in Bloom |publisher=Wildseed farms |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly found on sites where the ground has been disturbed, such as recently cleared woodland, or where the vegetation has been burnt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/howtogrow/3300521/How-to-grow-Foxgloves.html|title=How to grow: Foxgloves|last=Klein|first=Carol|date=18 May 2002|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=6 May 2010|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larva]]e of the [[foxglove pug]], a moth, consume the flowers of the common foxglove for food. Other species of [[Lepidoptera]] eat the leaves, including the [[lesser yellow underwing]].

==Medicinal uses==

===Cardiac===
A group of medicines extracted from foxglove plants are called [[digitalin]]. The use of ''[[Digitalis purpurea|D. purpurea]]'' extract containing [[cardiac glycoside]]s for the treatment of [[heart]] conditions was first described in the English-speaking medical literature by [[William Withering]], in 1785,&lt;ref&gt;William Withering, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VgIta49rzT4C&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses''] (Birmingham, England: M. Swinney, 1785).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Goldthorp WO|title=Medical Classics: An Account of the Foxglove and Some of its Medicinal Uses by William Withering, published 1785|journal=Br Med J|year=2009|volume=338|pages=b2189|doi=10.1136/bmj.b2189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simpson|first1=Beryl Brintnall|last2=Ogorzaly|first2=Molly Coner|title=Economic Botany|date=2001|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|location=Boston|isbn=9780072909388|page=529|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered the beginning of modern therapeutics.&lt;ref name=Silverman&gt;In contemporary [[medicine]], a purer form of digitalis (usually [[digoxin]]) is obtained from ''D. lanata.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollman&quot;&gt;Digoxin comes from Digitalis lanata. Hollman A. ''BMJ'' 1996;312:912. online version accessed 18 October 2006 [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/312/7035/912]&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to increase cardiac contractility (it is a positive [[inotrope]]) and as an [[antiarrhythmic agent]] to control the heart rate, particularly in the irregular (and often fast) [[atrial fibrillation]]. Digitalis is hence often prescribed for patients in atrial fibrillation, especially if they have been diagnosed with [[congestive heart failure]]. Digoxin was approved for heart failure in 1998 under current regulations by the Food and Drug Administration on the basis of prospective, randomized study and clinical trials. It was also approved for the control of ventricular response rate for patients with atrial fibrillation. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend digoxin for symptomatic chronic heart failure for patients with reduced systolic function, preservation of systolic function, and/or rate control for atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. [[Heart Failure Society of America]] guidelines for heart failure provide similar recommendations. Despite its relatively recent approval by the Food and Drug Administration and the guideline recommendations, the therapeutic use of digoxin is declining in patients with heart failure—likely the result of several factors. Safety concerns regarding a proposed link between digoxin therapy and increased mortality in women may be contributing to the decline in therapeutic use of digoxin.

===Variations===
[[File:Foxglove - Digitalis purpurea.jpg|thumb|Digitalis purpurea -- light purple]]
A group of pharmacologically active compounds are extracted mostly from the leaves of the second year's growth, and in pure form are referred to by common chemical names, such as [[digitoxin]] or [[digoxin]], or by brand names such as Crystodigin and Lanoxin, respectively. The two drugs differ in that digoxin has an additional [[hydroxyl]] group at the C-3 position on the B-ring (adjacent to the pentane). Both molecules include a [[lactone]] and a triple-repeating [[sugar]] called a [[glycoside]].

===Mechanism of action===
Digitalis works by inhibiting [[sodium-potassium ATPase]]. This results in an increased intracellular concentration of [[sodium]] ions and thus a decreased concentration gradient across the cell membrane. This increase in intracellular sodium causes the Na/CA exchanger to reverse potential, i.e., transition from pumping sodium into the cell in exchange for pumping calcium out of the cell, to pumping sodium out of the cell in exchange for pumping calcium into the cell. This leads to an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which improves cardiac contractility. Under normal physiological conditions, the cytoplasmic calcium used in cardiac contractions originates from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an intracellular organelle that specializes in the storage of calcium. Human newborns, some animals, and patients with chronic heart failure lack well developed and fully functioning sarcoplasmic reticula and must rely on the Na/Ca exchanger to provide all or a majority of the cytoplasmic calcium required for cardiac contraction. For this to occur, cytoplasmic sodium must exceed its typical concentration to favor a reversal in potential, which naturally occurs in human newborns and some animals primarily through an elevated heart rate; in patients with chronic heart failure it occurs through the administration of digitalis. As a result of increased contractility, [[stroke volume]] is increased. Ultimately, digitalis increases cardiac output (Cardiac Output=Stroke Volume x Heart Rate). This is the mechanism that makes this drug a popular treatment for congestive heart failure, which is characterized by low cardiac output.
Digitalis also has a vagal effect on the [[parasympathetic nervous system]], and as such is used in re-entrant [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s and to slow the ventricular rate during [[atrial fibrillation]]. The dependence on the vagal effect means digitalis is not effective when a patient has a high [[sympathetic nervous system]] drive, which is the case with acutely ill persons, and also during exercise.{{citation needed |date=July 2019}}

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Digoxin poisoning}}
[[Image:Digitalis purpurea Koehler drawing.jpg|thumb|right|''Digitalis purpurea'' drawings by [[Köhler's Medicinal Plants|Franz Köhler]]]]

Digitalis toxicity (also known as digitalis intoxication and digitalism) results from an overdose of digitalis and causes [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], as well as sometimes resulting in [[xanthopsia]] (jaundiced or yellow vision) and the appearance of blurred outlines (halos), drooling, abnormal heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, weakness, collapse, dilated pupils, tremors, seizures, and even death. [[Bradycardia]] also occurs. Because a frequent side effect of digitalis is reduction of appetite, some individuals have used the drug as a weight-loss aid.

Digitalis is an example of a drug derived from a plant that was formerly used by [[folklorist]]s and [[herbalist]]s; herbalists have largely abandoned its use because of its narrow [[therapeutic index]] and the difficulty of determining the amount of active drug in herbal preparations. Once the usefulness of digitalis in regulating the human [[pulse]] was understood, it was employed for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of [[epilepsy]] and other seizure disorders, which are now considered to be inappropriate treatments.

Depending on the species, the digitalis plant may contain several deadly physiological and chemically related cardiac and steroidal glycosides. Thus, the digitalis plants have earned several, more sinister, names: dead man's bells and witch's gloves.

The entire plant is toxic (including the roots and seeds). Mortality is rare, but case reports do exist. Most plant exposures occur in children younger than six years and are usually unintentional and without associated significant toxicity. More serious toxicity occurs with intentional ingestions by adolescents and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/816781-overview#a0199 |title=Cardiac Glycoside Plant Poisoning: Medscape reference|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early symptoms of ingestion include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, wild hallucinations, [[delirium]], and severe headache. Depending on the severity of the toxicosis, the victim may later suffer irregular and slow pulse, [[tremor]]s, various cerebral disturbances, especially of a visual nature (unusual colour visions (see [[xanthopsia]]) with objects appearing yellowish to green, and blue halos around lights), [[convulsions]], and deadly disturbances of the heart. For a case description, see the paper by Lacassie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lacassie&quot;&gt;A non-fatal case of intoxication with foxglove, documented by means of liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry. Lacassie E et al., ''J Forensic Sci.'' 2000 Sep;45(5):1154–8. Abstract accessed online 19 September 2006. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=11005196&amp;query_hl=13&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s &quot;Yellow Period&quot; may have been influenced by digitalis therapy which, at the time, was thought to control seizures. As noted above, other oculotoxic effects of digitalis include generalized blurry vision, as well as seeing a &quot;halo&quot; around each point of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Goldfrank LW | title = Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies | edition = 8th | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, people have confused digitalis with the relatively harmless comfrey (''[[Symphytum]]'') plant, which is often brewed into a tea, with fatal consequences. Other fatal accidents involve children drinking the water in a vase containing digitalis plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=57&amp;p_type=all&amp;p_sci=sci|title=Notes on poisoning:Digitalis purpura|last=Anon|work=Canadian poisonous plants information system|publisher=Canadian Biodiversity Information Facility|accessdate=9 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013203513/http://www.cbif.gc.ca/pls/pp/ppack.info?p_psn=57&amp;p_type=all&amp;p_sci=sci|archivedate=13 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drying does not reduce the toxicity of the plant. The plant is toxic to animals, including all classes of livestock and poultry, as well as felines and canines.

Digitalis poisoning can cause [[heart block]] and either [[bradycardia]] (decreased heart rate) or [[tachycardia]] (increased heart rate), depending on the dose and the condition of one's heart. Notably, the electric cardioversion (to &quot;shock&quot; the heart) is generally not indicated in ventricular fibrillation in digitalis toxicity, as it can increase the dysrhythmia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mammalian Toxicology|last=Abou-Donia|first=Mohamed|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118683316|location=|pages=631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Alan Lewis]], ''Lewis' Dictionary of Toxicology'', 1998, page 387, 1566702232.  &quot;See also digitalis. digitalis poisoning. digitalism; acute or cumulative chronic poisoning by digitalis. Symptoms may include gastrointestinal disturbances and pain, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irregular pulse, and yellow vision ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the classic drug of choice for ventricular fibrillation in emergency setting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erc.edu |title=European Resuscitation Council}}{{Verify source|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[amiodarone]], can worsen the dysrhythmia caused by digitalis, therefore, the second-choice drug [[lidocaine]] is more commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Back to Basics: Critical Care Transport Certification Review|last=Lee Lopez|first=Orchid|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=2011|isbn=9781456862749|location=|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digoxigenin==
[[Digoxigenin]] (DIG) is a steroid found exclusively in the flowers and leaves of the plants ''D. purpurea'' and ''D. lanata''. It is used as a molecular probe to detect DNA or RNA. It can easily be attached to nucleotides by chemical modifications. DIG molecules are often linked to [[uridine]] [[nucleotides]]; DIG-labelled [[uridine]] (DIG-U) can then be incorporated into [[RNA]] probes via ''in vitro'' [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Once [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridisation]] occurs ''in situ'', [[RNA]] probes with the incorporated DIG-U can be detected with anti-DIG [[antibodies]] that are conjugated to [[alkaline phosphatase]]. To reveal the hybridised transcripts, alkaline phosphatase can be reacted with a chromogen to produce a coloured precipitate.
