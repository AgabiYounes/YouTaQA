'''Devon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|v|ən}}), also known as '''Devonshire''', is a [[Counties of England|county]] of [[England]], reaching from the [[Bristol Channel]] in the north to the [[English Channel]] in the south. It is part of [[South West England]], bounded by [[Cornwall]] to the west, [[Somerset]] to the north east, and [[Dorset]] to the east. The city of [[Exeter]] is the [[county town]]. The county includes the districts of [[East Devon]], [[Mid Devon]], [[North Devon]], [[South Hams]], [[Teignbridge]], [[Torridge District|Torridge]], and [[West Devon]]. [[Plymouth]] and [[Torbay]] are each geographically part of Devon, but are administered as [[unitary authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Devon|title=Devon {{!}} county, England, United Kingdom|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=4 July 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823215019/https://www.britannica.com/place/Devon|archive-date=23 August 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined as a [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], Devon's area is {{convert|6707|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/improving_our_services/facts_figures_and_statistics/factsandfigures/thecounty/geographicareas/geogareasdevondis.htm |title=Devon County Council Geographic areas |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=Devon County Council |accessdate=12 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822032144/http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/councildemocracy/improving_our_services/facts_figures_and_statistics/factsandfigures/thecounty/geographicareas/geogareasdevondis.htm |archivedate=22 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its population is about 1.1 million.

Devon derives its name from [[Dumnonia]]. During the [[British Iron Age]], [[Roman Britain]], and the [[Sub-Roman Britain|early Middle Ages]], this was the homeland of the [[Dumnonii]] [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celts. (The shift from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;V&quot; is a typical Celtic [[lenition|consonant shift]].) The [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] resulted in the partial assimilation of Dumnonia into the Kingdom of [[Wessex]] during the eighth and ninth centuries. The western boundary with Cornwall was set at the [[River Tamar]] by [[Æthelstan|King Æthelstan]] in 936. Devon was later constituted as a [[shire]] of the [[Kingdom of England]].

The north and south coasts of Devon each have both cliffs and sandy shores, and the county's [[bay]]s contain [[seaside resort]]s, [[Fishing town|fishing towns]], and [[Port|ports]]. The inland terrain is rural and generally hilly, and has a lower population density than many other parts of England. [[Dartmoor]] is the largest open space in southern England, at {{convert|954|km2|sqmi|abbr=in}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/dartmoor.aspx |title=Welcome to the Dartmoor National Park Authority |website=Naturalengland.org.uk |accessdate=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906185804/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/dartmoor.aspx |archive-date=6 September 2011 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; its [[moorland]] extends across a large expanse of [[granite]] bedrock. To the north of Dartmoor are the [[Culm Measures]] and [[Exmoor]]. In the valleys and lowlands of south and east Devon the soil is more fertile, drained by rivers including the [[River Exe|Exe]], the [[River Culm|Culm]], the [[River Teign|Teign]], the [[River Dart|Dart]], and the [[River Otter, Devon|Otter]].

As well as agriculture, much of the [[economy of Devon]] is based on [[tourism]]. The comparatively mild climate, coastline and landscape make Devon a destination for [[tourism in England|recreation and leisure in England]], with visitors particularly attracted to the Dartmoor and Exmoor [[National Parks in England and Wales|national parks]]; its coasts, including the resort towns along the south coast known collectively as the [[English Riviera]]; the [[Jurassic Coast]], and [[North Devon's Biosphere Reserve|North Devon's UNESCO Biosphere Reserve]]; and the countryside including the [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Devon}}

===Toponymy===
The name ''Devon'' derives from the name of the [[Britons]] who inhabited the southwestern peninsula of Britain at the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] known as the [[Dumnonii]], thought to mean &quot;deep valley dwellers&quot; from [[Proto-Celtic language|proto Celtic]] ''*dubnos'' 'deep'. In the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], Devon is known as {{lang-cy|Dyfnaint}}, {{lang-br|Devnent}} and {{lang-kw|Dewnens}}, each meaning &quot;deep valleys.&quot; (For an account of Celtic ''[[Dumnonia]]'', see the separate article.) Among the most common Devon placenames is ''-combe'' which derives from Brittonic ''cwm'' meaning 'valley' usually prefixed by the name of the possessor.

[[William Camden]], in his 1607 edition of ''Britannia'', described Devon as being one part of an older, wider country that once included Cornwall:
{{quote|THAT region which, according to the Geographers, is the first of all Britaine, and, growing straiter still and narrower, shooteth out farthest into the West, [...] was in antient time inhabited by those Britans whom Solinus called Dumnonii, Ptolomee Damnonii [...] For their habitation all over this Countrey is somewhat low and in valleys, which manner of dwelling is called in the British tongue Dan-munith, in which sense also the Province next adjoyning in like respect is at this day named by the Britans Duffneit, that is to say, Low valleys. [...] But the Country of this nation is at this day divided into two parts, knowen by later names of Cornwall and Denshire, [...]|William Camden, ''Britannia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The term &quot;Devon&quot; is normally used for everyday purposes e.g. &quot;Devon County Council&quot; but &quot;Devonshire&quot; continues to be used in the names of the &quot;[[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]]&quot; (until 2007) and &quot;[[The Devonshire Association]]&quot;. One erroneous theory is that the &quot;shire&quot; suffix is due to a mistake in the making of the original letters patent for the [[Duke of Devonshire#Earls of Devon|Duke of Devonshire]], resident in [[Derbyshire]]. However, there are references to &quot;Defenascire&quot; in [[Anglo-Saxon]] texts from before 1000 AD (this would mean &quot;Shire of the Devonians&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/a/a-L.html|title=Manuscript A: The Parker Chronicle|accessdate=17 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726221228/http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/a/a-L.html|archive-date=26 July 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to modern English as &quot;Devonshire&quot;. The term Devonshire may have originated around the 8th century, when it changed from ''Dumnonia'' ([[Latin]]) to ''Defenascir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=The Isles: A History|page=207|year=2000|isbn=0-333-69283-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human occupation===
[[File:Drizzlecombe stones 6.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Menhir]] at [[Drizzlecombe]]]]
[[Kents Cavern]] in Torquay had produced human remains from 30–40,000 years ago. [[Dartmoor]] is thought to have been occupied by [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples from about 6000 BC. The Romans held the area under military occupation for around 350 years. Later, the area began to experience Saxon incursions from the east around 600 AD, firstly as small bands of settlers along the coasts of [[Lyme Bay]] and southern estuaries and later as more organised bands pushing in from the east. Devon became a frontier between [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic]]  and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Wessex]], and it was largely absorbed into Wessex by the mid 9th century. A genetic study carried out by the [[University of Oxford]] &amp; [[University College London]] discovered separate genetic groups in Cornwall and Devon, not only were there differences on either side of the Tamar, with a division almost exactly along the modern county boundary dating back to the 6th Century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-03-19-who-do-you-think-you-really-are-genetic-map-british-isles|title=Who do you think you really are?

This suggests the Anglo-Saxon migration into Devon was limited rather than a mass movement of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The border with Cornwall was set by King [[Æthelstan]] on the east bank of the [[River Tamar]] in 936 AD. Danish raids also occurred sporadically along many coastal parts of Devon between around 800AD and just before the time of the Norman conquest, including the silver mint at ''Hlidaforda'' [[Lydford]] in 997 and Taintona (a settlement on the [[River Teign|Teign]] estuary) in 1001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lydford.co.uk/stockholm-museum.htm |title=Lydford Silver Pennies In The Stockholm Coin Museum |website=Lydford.co.uk |accessdate=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305063037/http://www.lydford.co.uk/stockholm-museum.htm |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devon was the home of a number of [[anticlericalism|anticlerical]] movements in the [[Later Middle Ages]]. For example, the [[Order of Brothelyngham]]—a fake [[monastic order]] of 1348—regularly rode through Exeter, kidnapping both religious and laymen, and extorting money from them as ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Abbots and Priors of Late Medieval and Reformation England|last=Heale|first=M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-19870-253-5|location=Oxford|ref=harv|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devon has also featured in most of the civil conflicts in England since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], including the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Perkin Warbeck]]'s rising in 1497, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] of 1549, and the [[English Civil War]]. The arrival of [[William III of England|William of Orange]] to launch the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 took place at [[Brixham]].

Devon has produced [[tin]], copper and other metals from ancient times. Devon's tin miners enjoyed a substantial degree of independence through [[Stannary Convocation of Devon|Devon's Stannary Convocation]], which dates back to the 12th century. The last recorded sitting was in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Economy and industry==
{{Main|Economy of Devon}}
Like neighbouring [[Cornwall]] to the west, historically Devon has been disadvantaged economically compared to other parts of [[Southern England]], owing to the decline of a number of core industries, notably fishing, mining and farming. Agriculture has been an important industry in Devon since the 19th century. The [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 UK foot and mouth crisis]] harmed the farming community severely.&lt;ref&gt;''In Devon, the county council estimated that 1,200 jobs would be lost in agriculture and ancillary rural industries'' – [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010425/debtext/10425-17.htm#column_357 ''Hansard'', 25 April 2001] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404043956/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmhansrd/vo010425/debtext/10425-17.htm#column_357 |date=4 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then some parts of the agricultural industry have begun to diversify and recover, with a strong local food sector and many artisan producers. Nonetheless in 2015 the dairy industry was still suffering from the low prices offered for wholesale milk by major dairies and especially large supermarket chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Devon dairy farmer laments 'grim' state of industry as milk price crisis worsens|url=http://www.middevongazette.co.uk/devon-dairy-farmer-laments-grim-state-industry/story-25854239-detail/story.html|accessdate=18 July 2016|work=The Mid Devon Gazette|date=14 January 2015}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Met Office]], the UK's national and international weather service, moved to Exeter in 2003. Plymouth hosts the head office and first ever store of [[The Range (retailer)|The Range]], the only major national retail chain headquartered in Devon.

Since the rise of seaside resorts with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Devon's economy has been heavily reliant on tourism. The county's economy followed the declining trend of British seaside resorts since the mid-20th century, but with some recent revival and regeneration of its resorts, particularly focused around camping; sports such as surfing, cycling, sailing and heritage. This revival has been aided by the designation of much of Devon's countryside and coastline as the Dartmoor and [[Exmoor]] national parks, and the [[Jurassic Coast]] and [[Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape]] World Heritage Sites. In 2004 the county's tourist revenue was £1.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;!-- Should try to put this in context of total Devon economy – the GVA is around 9&amp;nbsp;billion, but I don't know enough about economic statistics to know if it's valid to compare the two? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326065518/http://www.devon.gov.uk/tourism_trends_2005.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; More successful visitor attractions are particularly concentrated on food and drink, including sea-view restaurants in North-West Devon (such as one example belonging to [[Damien Hurst]]), walking the [[South West Coast Path]], cycling on the [[Devon Coast to Coast Cycle Route|Devon Coast to Coast cycle route]] and other cycle routes such as the [[Tarka Trail]] and the Stover Trail; watersports; surfing; indoor and outdoor folk music festivals across the county and sailing in the {{convert|5|mi|adj=on}} hill-surrounded inlet ([[ria]]) at Salcombe.

Incomes vary significantly and the average is bolstered by a high proportion of affluent retired people from across Europe's major cities, particularly from the rest of England. Incomes in much of the South Hams and in villages surrounding Exeter and Plymouth are above the national average.  The claimant count of the unemployed and people receiving very low incomes is close to the national average of 4.5% in Torbay, Plymouth and Exeter. Their exurbs and rural villages contribute to low unemployment in the administrative county as shown below.

The table also shows the population change in the ten years to the 2011 census by subdivision.  It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published.  It can be seen that the most populous district of Devon is [[East Devon]] but only if excluding [[Torbay]] which has marginally more residents and [[Plymouth]] which has approximately double the number of residents of either of these.  [[West Devon]] has the fewest residents, having 63,839 at the time of the census.

==Transport==

===Rail===
The key train operator for Devon is [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], which operates numerous regional, local and suburban services, as well as intercity services north to [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] and south to [[Plymouth railway station|Plymouth]] and [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]]. Other intercity services are operated by [[CrossCountry]] north to [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh Waverley]], [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]], [[Dundee railway station|Dundee]], [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]] and south to Plymouth and Penzance, and [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]],operating services between [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] and [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]] via the [[West of England Main Line]]. All Devon services are diesel-hauled, since there are no electrified lines in the county.

There are proposals to reopen the line from [[Tavistock railway station|Tavistock]] to [[Bere Alston railway station|Bere Alston]] for a through service to Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Harris| first = Nigel| title = Taking trains back to Tavistock| journal = Rail| issue = 590| pages = 40–45| publisher = Bauer| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the [[South Devon Railway sea wall|sea wall]] at [[Dawlish]] was breached washing away around {{convert|40|m}} of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind. The line was closed.

====Devon Metro====
Devon County Council has proposed a &quot;Devon Metro&quot; scheme to improve rail services in the county and offer a realistic alternative to car travel. This includes the delivery of [[Cranbrook railway station (Devon)|Cranbrook station]], plus four new stations (including [[Edginswell railway station|Edginswell]]) as a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/devon_metro_briefing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214602/http://www.devon.gov.uk/devon_metro_briefing.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
[[Exeter Airport]] is a base for [[Flybe]]. Destinations include various locations within the [[United Kingdom|UK]] ([[London City Airport|London City]], [[Manchester]], [[Belfast]], [[Edinburgh]], etc), as well as locations in [[Cyprus]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Malta]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.exeter-airport.co.uk/flights-holidays/|title=Flights &amp; Holidays|website=Exeter Airport|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and geology==
[[File:Heath.jpg|thumb|[[Heath (habitat)|Heathland]] at [[Woodbury Common, Devon|Woodbury Common]] in south east Devon.]]
[[File:Devon Cliffs.jpg|thumb|Cliffs in Devon.]]
[[File:Ilfracombe.jpg|thumb|[[Ilfracombe]], on the coast of [[North Devon]].]]
Devon straddles [[South West Peninsula|a peninsula]] and so has two separate coastlines, on the [[Bristol Channel]] and [[Celtic Sea]] in the north, and on the [[English Channel]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Henry (1948) ''British Regional Geology: South West England'', 2nd ed. London: H.M.S.O.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South West Coast Path]] runs along the entire length of both, around 65% of which is named as [[Heritage Coast]]. Before the changes to English counties in 1974, Devon was the [[Historic counties of England#List of counties|third largest county]] by area and the largest of the counties not divided into county-like divisions (only Yorkshire and Lincolnshire were larger and both were sub-divided into ridings or parts, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;''Whitaker's Almanack'', 1972; p. 631&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1974 the county is ranked fourth by area (due to the creation of Cumbria) [[List of ceremonial counties of England|amongst ceremonial counties]] and is the [[List of two-tier counties of England|third largest non-metropolitan county]]. The island of [[Lundy]] and the reef of [[Eddystone Rocks|Eddystone]] are also in Devon. The county has more mileage of road than any other county in England.

Inland, the [[Dartmoor]] [[National park|National Park]] lies wholly in Devon, and the [[Exmoor]] National Park lies in both Devon and [[Somerset]]. Apart from these areas of high moorland the county has attractive rolling rural scenery and villages with [[thatch]]ed [[Cob (building)|cob]] cottages. All these features make Devon a popular [[tourism|holiday]] destination.

In [[South Devon]] the landscape consists of rolling hills dotted with small towns, such as [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]], [[Ivybridge]], [[Kingsbridge]], [[Salcombe]], and [[Totnes]]. The towns of [[Torquay]] and [[Paignton]] are the principal [[seaside resort]]s on the south coast. East Devon has the first seaside resort to be developed in the county, [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and the more upmarket Georgian town of [[Sidmouth]], headquarters of the East Devon District Council. Exmouth marks the western end of the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Another notable feature is the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line|coastal railway line]] between Newton Abbot and the Exe Estuary: the red sandstone cliffs and sea views are very dramatic and in the resorts railway line and beaches are very near.
[[File:Torquay Palm Trees.jpg|thumb|Torquay sea front during Storm Emma - March 2018]]
[[North Devon]] is very rural with few major towns except [[Barnstaple]], [[Great Torrington]], [[Bideford]] and [[Ilfracombe]]. Devon's Exmoor coast has the highest cliffs in southern Britain, culminating in the [[Hangman cliffs|Great Hangman]], a {{convert|318|m|ft|abbr=on}} &quot;hog's-back&quot; hill with an {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} cliff-face, located near Combe Martin Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/index/learning_about/moor_facts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724224326/http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/index/learning_about/moor_facts.htm |archivedate=24 July 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sister cliff is the {{convert|218|m|ft|abbr=on}} Little Hangman, which marks the western edge of coastal Exmoor. One of the features of the North Devon coast is that [[Bideford Bay]] and the [[Hartland Point]] peninsula are both west-facing, Atlantic facing coastlines; so that a combination of an off-shore (east) wind and an Atlantic swell produce excellent surfing conditions. The beaches of Bideford Bay ([[Woolacombe]], [[Saunton]], [[Westward Ho!]] and [[Croyde]]), along with parts of North Cornwall and South Wales, are the main centres of surfing in Britain.

===Geology===
[[File:Geologic map Wales &amp; SW England EN.svg|thumb|Geological map of Wales &amp; Southwest England.]]
A geological dividing line cuts across Devon roughly along the line of the [[Bristol to Exeter Line]] and the M5 motorway east of Tiverton and Exeter. It is a part of the [[Tees-Exe line]] broadly dividing Britain into a southeastern lowland zone typified by gently dipping [[sedimentary rock]]s and a northwestern upland zone typified by [[igneous rock]]s and folded sedimentary and [[metamorphic rock]]s.

The principal geological components of Devon are the [[Devonian]] (in north Devon, south west Devon and extending into Cornwall); the [[Culm Measures]] (north western Devon also extending into north Cornwall); and the [[granite]] [[intrusion]] of [[Dartmoor]] in central Devon, part of the [[Cornubian batholith]] forming the 'spine' of the southwestern peninsula. There are small remains of pre-Devonian rocks on the south Devon coast.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, E. A., et al. (1975) ''South-West England''; based on previous editions by H. Dewey ([[British Geological Survey]] UK Regional Geology Guide series no. 17, 4th ed.) London: HMSO {{ISBN|0-11-880713-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest rocks which can be dated are those of the Devonian period which are approximately 395–345 million years old. Sandstones and shales were deposited in North and South Devon beneath tropical seas. In shallower waters, limestone beds were laid down in the area now near Torquay and Plymouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devon's Geology: An Introduction |last=Hesketh |first=Robert|publisher=Bossiney Books|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-899-383-89-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This geological period was named after Devon by [[Roderick Murchison]] and [[Adam Sedgwick]] in the 1840s and is the only British county whose name is used worldwide as a geological time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Devon Geology Guide – Devonian Slates, Sandstones and Volcanics |last=Laming |first=Deryck |author2=Roche, David |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/geo-devonianslatessandstonesandvolcanics.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110021248/http://www.devon.gov.uk/geo-devonianslatessandstonesandvolcanics.pdf |archivedate=10 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measures are so called either from the occasional presence of a soft, sooty coal, which is known in Devon as ''culm'', or from the contortions commonly found in the beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonds|first=E. A.|author2=McKeown, M. C. |author3=Williams, M. |others=Dewey, H.|title=South-West England|publisher=HMSO/British Geological Survey|location=London|year=1975|edition=4th|series=British Geology|page=34|chapter=Carboniferous Rocks|isbn=0-11-880713-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formation stretches from [[Bideford]] to [[Bude]] in Cornwall, and contributes to a gentler, greener, more rounded landscape. It is also found on the western, north and eastern borders of Dartmoor.

The sedimentary rocks in more eastern parts of the county include [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]] sandstones (giving rise to east Devon's well known fertile red soils); [[Bunter (geology)|Bunter pebble beds]] around Budleigh Salterton and Woodbury Common and [[Jurassic]] rocks in the easternmost parts of Devon. Smaller outcrops of younger rocks also exist, such as Cretaceous [[chalk]] cliffs at Beer Head and gravels on Haldon, plus [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] [[ball clay]] and [[lignite]] deposits in the Bovey Basin, formed around 50 million years ago under tropical forest conditions.

===Climate===
{{See also|Dartmoor#Climate|climate of south-west England}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Devon generally has a cool oceanic climate, heavily influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]]. In winter snow is relatively uncommon away from high land, although there are exceptions. The county has mild summers with occasional warm spells and cool rainy periods. Winters are generally cool and the county often experiences some of the mildest winters in the world for its high latitude, with average daily maximum temperatures in January at {{convert|8|C}}. Rainfall varies significantly across the county, ranging from over {{convert|2000|mm|in|abbr=on}} on parts of Dartmoor, to around {{convert|750|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the [[rain shadow]] along the coast in southeastern Devon and around Exeter. Sunshine amounts also vary widely: the moors are generally cloudy, but the SE coast from Salcombe to Exmouth is one of the sunniest parts of the UK (a generally cloudy region). With westerly or southwesterly winds and high pressure the area around Torbay and Teignmouth will often be warm, with long sunny spells due to shelter by high ground ([[Foehn wind]]).

===Ecology===
[[File:Pnies5.jpg|thumb|Ponies grazing on Exmoor near [[Brendon]], [[North Devon]].]]
The variety of habitats means that there is a wide range of wildlife (see [[Dartmoor wildlife]], for example). A popular challenge among [[bird-watching|birders]] is to find over 100 species in the county in a day.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The county's wildlife is protected by several wildlife charities such as the [[Devon Wildlife Trust]], which looks after 40 nature reserves. The Devon Bird Watching and Preservation Society (founded in 1928 and known since 2005 as &quot;Devon Birds&quot;) is a county bird society dedicated to the study and conservation of wild birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.devonbirds.org/about/the_society/introduction |title=The Society – Introduction |work=Devon Birds |accessdate=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221213314/http://www.devonbirds.org/about/the_society/introduction |archive-date=21 December 2016 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[RSPB]] has reserves in the county, and [[Natural England]] is responsible for over 200 Devon [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] and [[National nature reserves in England|National Nature Reserves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteList.aspx?countyCode=11|title=Designated sites view (Devon)|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220135603/https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/SiteList.aspx?countyCode=11|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Slapton Ley]]. The [[Devon Bat Group]] was founded in 1984 to help conserve bats.  Wildlife found in this area extend to a plethora of different kinds of insects, butterflies and moths; an interesting butterfly to take look at is the [[Chequered skipper]].

The botany of the county is very diverse and includes some rare species not found elsewhere in the British Isles other than Cornwall. Devon is divided into two [[Watsonian vice-counties]]: north and south, the boundary being an irregular line approximately across the higher part of Dartmoor and then along the canal eastwards. Botanical reports begin in the 17th century and there is a ''Flora Devoniensis'' by Jones and Kingston in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, John Pike &amp; Kingston, J. F. (1829) ''Flora Devoniensis''. 2 pts, in 1 vol. London: Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green&lt;/ref&gt; A general account appeared in ''[[Victoria County History#Dormant counties|The Victoria History of the County of Devon]]'' (1906), and a ''Flora of Devon'' was published in 1939 by [[William Keble Martin|Keble Martin]] and Fraser.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin, W. Keble]] &amp; Fraser, G. T. (eds.) (1939) Flora of Devon. Arbroath&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Atlas of the Devon Flora'' by Ivimey-Cook appeared in 1984, and ''A New Flora of Devon'', based on field work undertaken between 2005 and 2014, was published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=R.|last2=Hodgson|first2=B.|last3=Ison|first3=J.|title=A New Flora of Devon|year=2016|publisher=The Devonshire Association|location=Exeter|page=1|isbn=978 1 5272 0525 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clock tower, County Hall, Exeter.jpg|thumb|County Hall, Exeter. Headquarters for Devon County Council.]]
The administrative centre and capital of Devon is the city of [[Exeter]]. The largest city in Devon, [[Plymouth]], and the conurbation of [[Torbay]] (which includes the largest town in Devon and capital of Torbay, [[Torquay]], as well as [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]]) have been [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authorities]] since 1998, separate from the remainder of Devon which is administered by [[Devon County Council]] for the purposes of local government.

Devon County Council is controlled by the Conservatives, and the political representation of its 62 councillors are: 38 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], 9 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], seven [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], four [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]], three [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]s and one [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8084708.stm|title=Tories take over county council|date=5 June 2009|publisher=The [[BBC]]|accessdate=6 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608140652/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8084708.stm|archive-date=8 June 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main settlements in Devon are the cities of [[Plymouth]], a historic port now administratively independent, [[Exeter]], the [[county town]], and [[Torbay]], the county's tourist centre. Devon's coast is lined with tourist resorts, many of which grew rapidly with the arrival of the railways in the 19th century. Examples include [[Dawlish]], [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] and [[Sidmouth]] on the south coast, and [[Ilfracombe]] and [[Lynmouth]] on the north. The Torbay conurbation of [[Torquay]], [[Paignton]] and [[Brixham]] on the south coast is now administratively independent of the county. Rural [[market town]]s in the county include [[Barnstaple]], [[Bideford]], [[Honiton]], [[Newton Abbot]], [[Okehampton]], [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], [[Totnes]] and [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]].

The boundary with Cornwall has not always been on the River Tamar as at present: until the late 19th century a few parishes in the Torpoint area were in Devon and five parishes now in north-east Cornwall were in Devon until 1974. (However, for ecclesiastical purposes these were nevertheless in the [[List of Archdeacons of Cornwall|Archdeaconry of Cornwall]] and in 1876 became part of the [[Diocese of Truro]].)

==Religion==

===Ancient and medieval history===
The region of Devon was the dominion of the Dumnonii [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]] they were also called &quot;Deep Valley Dwellers&quot;. The region was less Romanised than the rest of [[Roman Britain]] since it was considered a remote province. The Romans left the region around AD 410, this is when one of the leading Dumnonii families attempted to create a dynasty and rule over Devon as the Kings of Dumnonii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/devon/devon.html|title=Britannia History: Overview of Devon|website=www.britannia.com|access-date=4 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203034354/http://www.britannia.com/history/devon/devon.html|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[list of Cornish saints|Cornish saints]] are commemorated also in Devon in legends, churches and place-names. [[Western Christianity]] came to Devon when it was over a long period incorporated into the [[Wessex|kingdom of Wessex]] and the jurisdiction of the bishop of Wessex. [[Saint Petroc]] is said to have passed through Devon, where ancient dedications to him are even more numerous than in Cornwall: a probable seventeen (plus [[Timberscombe]] just over the border in Somerset), compared to Cornwall's five. The position of churches bearing his name, including one within the old Roman walls of [[Exeter]], are nearly always near the coast, reminding us that in those days travelling was done mainly by sea. The Devonian villages of [[Petrockstowe]] and [[Newton St Petroc]] are also named after [[Saint Petroc]] and the [[flag of Devon]] is dedicated to him.

The history of Christianity in the South West of England remains to some degree obscure. Parts of the historic county of Devon formed part of the diocese of Wessex, while nothing is known of the church organisation of the Celtic areas. About 703 Devon and Cornwall were included in the separate diocese of Sherborne and in 900 this was again divided into two, the Devon bishop having from 905 his seat at Tawton (now [[Bishop's Tawton]]) and from 912 at [[Crediton]], birthplace of St Boniface. [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]] became [[Bishop of Crediton]] in 1027 and shortly afterwards became [[Bishop of Cornwall]].

The two dioceses of Crediton and Cornwall, covering Devon and Cornwall, were permanently united under [[Edward the Confessor]] by [[Lyfing, Abbot of Tavistock|Lyfing]]'s successor [[Leofric, Bishop of Exeter|Bishop Leofric]], hitherto Bishop of Crediton, who became first Bishop of Exeter under [[Edward the Confessor]], which was established as his cathedral city in 1050. At first, the abbey church of St Mary and St Peter, founded by Athelstan in 932 and rebuilt in 1019, served as the cathedral.

===Later history===
In 1549, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] caused the deaths of thousands of people from Devon and Cornwall. During the [[English Reformation]], churches in Devon officially became affiliated with the [[Church of England]]. From the late sixteenth century onwards, zealous Protestantism – or 'puritanism' – became increasingly well-entrenched in some parts of Devon, while other districts of the county remained much more conservative. These divisions would become starkly apparent during the English Civil War of 1642–46, when the county split apart along religious and cultural lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoyle|first1=Mark|title=Loyalty and Locality: Popular Allegiance in Devon during the English Civil War|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85989-428-2|page=passim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Methodism]] of [[John Wesley]] proved to be very popular with the working classes in Devon in the 19th century. Methodist chapels became important social centres, with male voice choirs and other church-affiliated groups playing a central role in the social lives of working class Devonians. Methodism still plays a large part in the religious life of Devon today, although the county has shared in the post-World War II decline in British religious feeling.

The [[Diocese of Exeter]] remains the Anglican diocese including the whole of Devon. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth]] was established in the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plymouth-diocese.org.uk/ |title=Home |website=Plymouth-diocese.org.uk |date=15 February 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130930/http://www.plymouth-diocese.org.uk/ |archive-date=21 October 2016 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Despite its small Jewish population, Devon is also noted for containing two of Britain's oldest synagogues, located in [[Plymouth Synagogue|Plymouth]] and [[Exeter Synagogue|Exeter]], built in 1762 and 1763 respectively.

==Symbols==

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Devon arms.png|thumb|The [[coat of arms]] of Devon County Council.]]
There was no established [[coat of arms]] for the county until 1926: the arms of the City of [[Exeter]] were often used to represent Devon, for instance in the badge of the [[Devonshire Regiment]]. During the forming of a county council by the [[Local Government Act 1888]] adoption of a common seal was required. The seal contained three shields depicting the arms of Exeter along with those of the first chairman and vice-chairman of the council ([[Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 20th Baron Clinton|Lord Clinton]] and the [[Earl of Morley]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, A. C. (1915) ''The Book of Public Arms'', 2nd edition, London&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1926, the county council received a grant of arms from the [[College of Arms]]. The main part of the shield displays a red crowned lion on a silver field, the arms of [[Richard, Earl of Cornwall|Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cornwall]]. The ''chief'' or upper portion of the shield depicts an ancient ship on wavers, for Devon's seafaring traditions. The [[Latin]] motto adopted was ''Auxilio Divino'' (by Divine aid), that of Sir [[Francis Drake]]. The 1926 grant was of arms alone. On 6 March 1962 a further grant of crest and supporters was obtained. The crest is the head of a [[Dartmoor Pony]] rising from a &quot;Naval Crown&quot;. This distinctive form of crown is formed from the sails and sterns of ships, and is associated with the [[Royal Navy]]. The supporters are a [[North Devon cattle|Devon bull]] and a sea lion.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Scott-Giles, ''Civic Heraldry of England and Wales'', 2nd edition, London, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/democracycommunities/county_councillors/historic/brief_history.htm |title=A brief history of Devon's coat of arms (Devon County Council) |publisher=Devon.gov.uk |accessdate=14 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511234359/http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/democracycommunities/county_councillors/historic/brief_history.htm |archivedate=11 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Devon County Council]] adopted a &quot;ship silhouette&quot; logo after the 1974 reorganisation, adapted from the ship emblem on the coat of arms, but following the loss in 1998 of Plymouth and Torbay re-adopted the coat of arms. In April 2006 the council unveiled a new logo which was to be used in most everyday applications, though the coat of arms will continue to be used for &quot;various civic purposes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/4851278.stm |title=Council's designs cause logo row |work=BBC News |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512153333/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/devon/4851278.stm |archive-date=12 May 2011 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/democracycommunities/decision_making/cma/cma_document.htm?cmadoc=minutes_spr_20060403.html |title=Policy and Resources Overview Scrutiny Committee Minutes, 3 April 2006 |publisher=Devon.gov.uk |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511234349/http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/democracycommunities/decision_making/cma/cma_document.htm?cmadoc=minutes_spr_20060403.html |archive-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flag===
{{Main|Flag of Devon}}
Devon also has its own flag which has been dedicated to [[Saint Petroc]], a local [[saint]] with dedications throughout Devon and neighbouring counties. The flag was adopted in 2003 after a competition run by [[BBC Radio Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/community_life/features/devon_flag.shtml |title=Flag celebrates Devon's heritage |publisher=BBC |date=18 July 2003 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425161755/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/community_life/features/devon_flag.shtml |archive-date=25 April 2010 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning design was created by website contributor Ryan Sealey, and won 49% of the votes cast. The colours of the flag are those popularly identified with Devon, for example, the colours of [[Exeter University]], the [[rugby union]] team, and the Green and White flag flown by the first [[Viscount Exmouth]] at the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] (now on view at the Teign Valley Museum), as well as one of the county's [[Association football|football]] teams, [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]. On 17 October 2006, the flag was hoisted for the first time outside County Hall in Exeter to mark Local Democracy Week, receiving official recognition from the county council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devon.gov.uk/press_devonflagpr Devon County Council Press Release, 16 October 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014214602/http://www.devon.gov.uk/press_devonflagpr |date=14 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019 [[Devon County Council]] with the support of both the Anglican and Catholic churches in Exeter and Plymouth, officially recognised Saint Boniface as the Patron Saint of Devon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creditoncourier.co.uk/article.cfm?id=138406&amp;headline=St%20Boniface%20of%20Crediton%20to%20become%20Patron%20Saint%20of%20Devon&amp;sectionIs=news&amp;searchyear=2019 |date=24 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devon's toponyms include many with the endings &quot;coombe/combe&quot; and &quot;tor&quot;.  Both 'coombe' (valley or hollow, cf. Welsh ''cwm'', Cornish ''komm'') and 'tor' (Old Welsh ''twrr'' and Scots Gaelic ''tòrr'' from Latin ''turris''; 'tower' used for granite formations) are rare  [[List of English words of Welsh origin|Celtic loanwords in English]] and their frequency is greatest in Devon which shares a boundary with [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] speaking Cornwall.  Ruined medieval settlements of [[Dartmoor longhouse]]s indicate that dispersed rural settlement (OE ''tun'', now often -ton) was very similar to that found in Cornish 'tre-' settlements, however these are generally described with the local placename -(a)cott, from the Old English for homestead, cf. [[cottage]]. Saxon endings in -worthy (from Anglo-Saxon ''worthig'') indicate larger settlements.  Several 'Bere's indicate Anglo-Saxon wood groves, as 'leighs' indicate clearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/DevonMisc/Nomenclature.html |title=Origins of Devon Place-Names |website=Genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk |date=2 November 2014 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114083054/http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/DevonMisc/Nomenclature.html |archive-date=14 November 2016 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devon has a variety of festivals and traditional practices, including the traditional orchard-visiting [[Wassail]] in [[Whimple]] every 17 January, and the carrying of flaming tar barrels in [[Ottery St. Mary]], where people who have lived in Ottery for long enough are called upon to celebrate [[Guy Fawkes Night|Bonfire Night]] by running through the village (and the gathered crowds) with flaming barrels on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/discovering/legends/ottery_tar_barrels.shtml|title=Ottery Tar Barrels|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519081002/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/discovering/legends/ottery_tar_barrels.shtml|archive-date=19 May 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berry Pomeroy]] still celebrates &quot;Queen's Day&quot; for [[Elizabeth I]].

==Education==
{{Main|List of schools in Devon}}
Devon has a mostly [[comprehensive education]] system. There are 37 state and 23 independent secondary schools. There are three tertiary ([[Further education|FE]]) colleges and an [[agricultural college]] ([[Bicton College]], near [[Budleigh Salterton]]). Torbay has 8 state (with 3 [[grammar school]]s) and 3 independent secondary schools, and Plymouth has 17 state (with 3 grammar schools – two female and one male) and one independent school, [[Plymouth College]]. East Devon and Teignbridge have the largest school populations, with West Devon the smallest (with only two schools). Only one school in Exeter, Mid Devon, Torridge and North Devon have a [[sixth form]] – the schools in other districts mostly have sixth forms, with all schools in West Devon and East Devon having a sixth form.

Two universities are located in Devon, the [[University of Exeter]] (split between the [[Streatham Campus]] and [[St Luke's Campus]], both in Exeter, and a campus in [[Cornwall]]); in Plymouth the [[University of Plymouth]] in Britain is present, along with the [[University of St Mark &amp; St John]] to the city's north. The universities of Exeter and Plymouth have together formed the [[Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry]] which has bases in Exeter and Plymouth. There is also [[Schumacher College]].

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Cuisine of Devon}}
The county has given its name to a number of culinary specialities. The Devonshire [[cream tea]], involving [[Scone (bread)|scones]], [[jam]] and [[clotted cream]], is thought to have originated in Devon (though claims have also been made for neighbouring counties); in other countries, such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], it is known as a &quot;Devonshire tea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith.

==Sport==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}
Devon has been home to a number of customs, such as its own form of [[Devon wrestling]], similar in some ways to [[Cornish wrestling]]. As recently as the 19th century, a crowd of 17,000 at Devonport, near [[Plymouth]], attended a match between the champions of Devon and Cornwall. Another Devon sport was [[Cornish hurling|outhurling]] which was played in some regions until the 20th century (e.g. 1922, at [[Great Torrington]]). Other ancient customs which survive include [[Dartmoor]] step dancing, and &quot;[[Crying The Neck]]&quot;.

Devon has three professional football teams, based in each of its most populous towns and cities. As of the [[2018–19 in English football|2018–2019 football season]], both [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]] and [[Exeter City F.C.]] compete in [[Football League Two|English Football League Two]] (the fourth tier), whilst [[Torquay United F.C.]] compete in the [[Conference Premier|National League]] (the fifth tier). Plymouth's highest Football League finish was fourth in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], which was achieved twice, in 1932 and 1953. Torquay and Exeter have never progressed beyond the third tier of the league; Torquay finished second on [[goal average]] in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]] behind Sir [[Alf Ramsey]]'s [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1957. Exeter's highest position has been eighth in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division (S)]]. The county's biggest non-league clubs are [[Bideford F.C.]] which competes in the [[Southern Football League Premier Division]], and [[Tiverton Town F.C.]] which is in the [[Southern Football League Division One South and West]].
