'''Cyprinodontiformes''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|aɪ|p|r|ᵻ|n|oʊ-|ˌ|d|ɒ|n|t|ᵻ|ˈ|f|ɔːr|m|iː|z}} is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], comprising mostly small, freshwater fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase order | order = Cyprinodontiformes | month = August | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many popular aquarium fish, such as [[killifish]] and [[Poeciliidae|live-bearers]], are included.  They are closely related to the [[Atheriniformes]] and are occasionally included with them.  A colloquial term for the order as a whole is '''toothcarps''', though they are not actually close relatives of the true [[carp]]s &amp;ndash; the latter belong to the [[superorder]] [[Ostariophysi]], while the toothcarps are [[Acanthopterygii]].

The families of Cyprinodontiformes can be informally divided into three groups based on reproductive strategy: [[Viviparity|viviparous]] and [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] (all species give live birth), and [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (all species are egg-laying). The live-bearing groups differ in whether the young are carried to term within (ovoviviparous) or without (viviparous) an enclosing eggshell. [[Phylogeny|Phylogenetically]] however, one of the two [[suborders]] &amp;ndash; the [[Aplocheiloidei]] &amp;ndash; contains oviparous species exclusively, as do two of the four [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamilies]] of the other suborder (the [[Cyprinodontoidea]] and [[Valencioidea]] of the [[Cyprinodontoidei]]). Vivipary and ovovivipary have [[Evolution|evolved]] independently from oviparous ancestors, the latter possibly twice.

==Description==
[[Image:Fundulopanchax scheeli.png|thumb|left|''[[Fundulopanchax scheeli]]'', a killifish of the family [[Nothobranchiidae]].]]
Some members of this order are notable for inhabiting extreme environments, such as [[saline water|saline]] or very warm waters, heavily polluted waters, rain water pools devoid of minerals and made acidic by decaying vegetation, or isolated situations where no other types of fish occur.

They are typically [[carnivore]]s, and often live near the surface, where the oxygen-rich water compensates for environmental disadvantages. Scheel (1968) observed the gut contents were invariably ants, others have reported insects, worms and aquatic crustaceans. Aquarium specimens are invariably seen eating protozoans from the water column and the surfaces of leaves, however these are not apparent as stomach contents. Many members of the family Cyprinodontidae (the pupfishes) eat plant material as well and some have adapted to a diet very high in algae to the point where one, the American Flag Fish, is a renowned algae eater in the aquarium, in spite of belonging to an order of fishes that do not generally consume any plant material. In addition, killifish derive some of the carotenoids and other chemicals required to make their body pigments from pollen grains on the surface of and in the gut of insects they eat from the surface of the water; this can be simulated in culture by the use of special color enhancing foods that contain these compounds.

Although the Cyprinodontiformes are a diverse group, most species contained within are small to medium-sized fish, with small mouths, large eyes, a single [[dorsal fin]], and a rounded [[caudal fin]]. The largest species is the ''cuatro ojos'' (''[[Anableps dowei]]''), which measures {{convert|34|cm|in|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Anableps+dowi&amp;flags=col3:&amp;res=320&lt;/ref&gt; in length, while the smallest, the least killifish (''[[Heterandria formosa]]''), is just {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} long as an adult.&lt;ref name=EoF&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= Parenti, Lynne R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 148–151|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family Aplocheilidae has been expanded by some authorities to include all the killifishes with three subfamilies, Aplocheilinae, Cynolebiinae and Nothobranchiinae,&lt;ref name=Costa2016&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costa, W.J.E.M. | year = 2016 | url = http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/publikationen/vertebratezoology/vz66-2/03_vertebrate_zoology_66-2_costa_125-140.pdf | title = Comparative morphology and classification of South American cynopoeciline killifishes (Cyprinodontiformes: Aplocheilidae), with notes on family-group names used for aplocheiloids.  | journal =Vertebrate Zoology | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 125-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not the classification adopted in the 5th Edition of ''[[Fishes of the World]]''.&lt;ref name = Nelson5&gt;{{cite book  |title=Fishes of the World |edition=5th |author1=J.
