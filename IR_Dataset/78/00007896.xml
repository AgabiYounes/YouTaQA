{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of games based on ''Dune''}}
A number of games have been published based on the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]].

==Card games==
* ''[[Dune (card game)|Dune]]'' (1997): [[Collectible card game]] produced by [[Five Rings Publishing Group]]/[[Last Unicorn Games]] and later [[Wizards of the Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrye&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/sherlockazulu/dune_scrye.htm |title=''Dune'': Classic CCG|last=Baumrucker, MD|first=Steven|date=May 2003|work=[[Scrye]]|publisher=[[Internet Archive]]|accessdate=May 3, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040503002210/http://www.geocities.com/sherlockazulu/dune_scrye.htm |archivedate = May 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player leads a planetary house, &quot;battling, conniving, and bribing its way to greatness ... players bid for powerful characters, search for the life-prolonging spice [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], avoid [[sandworm (Dune)|sandworm]]s, engage in interstellar commerce, and, naturally, try to kill each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrye&quot;/&gt;

==Role-playing games==
{{Main|Dune: Chronicles of the Imperium}}

==Video games==&lt;!-- This section is the redirect destination of [[Dune computer and video games]] --&gt;
To date, there have been five licensed ''Dune''-related video games released. There have also been many ''Dune''-based [[MUD]]s (Multi-User Dimension) and [[Web browser|browser]]-based online games, all created and run by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dune.servint.com/general/about_dunemud.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103021505/http://dune.servint.com/general/about_dunemud.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 3, 2007 |title=DuneMUD |publisher=Dune.servint.com |accessdate=March 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dune II'' (1992)===
{{Main|Dune II}}
''Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty'', later retitled ''Dune II: Battle for Arrakis'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port, was released in December 1992 from [[Westwood Studios]]/Virgin Interactive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune II&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dune-ii-the-building-of-a-dynasty|title=Game Overview: ''Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty'' (1992)|publisher=Mobygames.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Abandonia Dune II&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonia.com/games/36/download/Dune2.htm|title=Review: ''Dune II - The Building of a Dynasty'' (1992) - Game download available|publisher=Abandonia.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often considered to be the first &quot;mainstream modern [[real-time strategy]] game&quot;, ''Dune II'' established many conventions of the genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune II&quot;/&gt; Only loosely connected to the plot of the novels or films, the game pits three interplanetary houses &amp;mdash; the [[House Atreides|Atreides]], the [[House Harkonnen|Harkonnen]]s, and the [[House Ordos|Ordos]] &amp;mdash; against each other for control of the planet [[Arrakis]] and its valuable spice, all while fending off the destructive natural forces of the harsh [[desert planet]] itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Dune II&quot;/&gt;

===''Dune Generations'' (2001, cancelled)===
[[Image:Dune generations logo.png|right|175px|''Dune Generations'' logo]]
In 2001, [[Cryonetworks]] disclosed information about ''Dune Generations'', an online, 3D real-time strategy game set in the ''Dune'' universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/ |title=''DUNE Generations'': Main Page|publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=November 27, 2001 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011127215041/http://www.dunegenerations.com/ |archivedate = November 27, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Q&amp;A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/dunegenerations/news.html?sid=2766761 |title=''DUNE Generations'' Q&amp;A |date=May 30, 2001 |publisher=Gamespot.com |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An official website for the upcoming game featured concept images, a brief background story and description of the persistent gameworld, and a list of frequently asked questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/faq.htm|title=''DUNE Generations'':FAQ |publisher=DuneGenerations.com|accessdate=October 21, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011021081521/http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/faq.htm |archivedate=October 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would be constructed using Cryo's own online multimedia development framework [[SCOL]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Dev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/develop01.htm# |title=''DUNE Generations'': Development |publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive) |accessdate=January 5, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020105205044/http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/develop01.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2002 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within &quot;the infrastructure of a permanent and massive multiplayer world that exists online,&quot; ''Dune Generations'' would let players assume control of a dynasty in the ''Dune'' universe, with the goal of first mastering the natural resources of their own homeworlds and ultimately rising in power and influence through conflicts and alliances with other player dynasties.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Concept&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/lejeu.htm |title=''DUNE Generations'': Concept|publisher=DuneGenerations.com (Internet Archive)|accessdate=October 19, 2001 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20011019220154/http://www.dunegenerations.com/uk/html/lejeu.htm |archivedate = October 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the three available dynasty types &amp;mdash; traders, soldiers, or mercenaries &amp;mdash; would provide a different playing experience, all with the long-term goal of gaining control of Arrakis and its valuable spice.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Q&amp;A&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Concept&quot;/&gt;

A preview video [[trailer (film)|trailer]] was released in November 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;DG trailer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedune.ru/cgi-bin/ccc/counter.pl?dunegen/video/dunegenerations.avi |title=Preview Video Trailer: ''DUNE Generations'' (6 MB) |publisher=Thedune.ru |accessdate=March 17, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was still in the [[alpha testing]] stage in February 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;DG Test&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dune-generations.com/index_uk.htm|title=''DUNE Generations'': Information Previewing|publisher=Dune-Generations.com|accessdate=February 25, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021211010037/http://www.dune-generations.com/index_uk.htm |archivedate=December 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the project was ultimately halted after Cryo filed for bankruptcy in July 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moby Cryo&quot;/&gt;
