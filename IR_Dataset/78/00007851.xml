The '''Comprehensive Nuclear-Test–Ban Treaty''' ('''CTBT''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] that bans all [[nuclear explosion]]s, for both civilian and military purposes, in all environments. It was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 September 1996 but has not entered into force, as eight specific nations have not ratified the treaty.

==History==
The movement for international control of [[nuclear weapon]]s began in 1945, with a call from [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for a conference on the subject.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=56}} In June 1946, [[Bernard Baruch]], an emissary of President [[Harry S. Truman]], proposed the [[Baruch Plan]] before the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, which called for an international system of controls on the production of atomic energy. The plan, which would serve as the basis for [[United States]] nuclear policy into the 1950s, was rejected by the [[Soviet Union]] as a US ploy to cement its nuclear dominance.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=7}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|pp=57–58}}

Between the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] of 16 July 1945 and the signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (PTBT) on 5 August 1963, 499 nuclear tests were conducted.&lt;ref name=delcoigne&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |page=18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |access-date=11 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827190927/https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the PTBT, the precursor to the CTBT, was rising public concern surrounding the size and resulting [[nuclear fallout]] from underwater and atmospheric nuclear tests, particularly tests of powerful [[thermonuclear weapons]] (hydrogen bombs). The [[Castle Bravo]] test of 1 March 1954, in particular, attracted significant attention as the detonation resulted in fallout that spread over inhabited areas and sickened a group of Japanese fishermen.&lt;ref name=atomicheritage&gt;{{cite web |title=Limited or Partial Test Ban Treaty (LTBT/PTBT) |publisher=[[Atomic Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/limited-or-partial-test-ban-treaty-ltbtptbt |access-date=1 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729082217/https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/limited-or-partial-test-ban-treaty-ltbtptbt |archive-date=29 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsarchive&gt;{{cite web |title=The Making of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1958–1963 |last1=Burr |first1=William |last2=Montford |first2=Hector L. |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=3 August 2003 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |access-date=7 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819131217/http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |archive-date=19 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-banning-nuclear-test-atmosphere-outer-space-and-under-water-partial-test-ban-treaty-ptbt/|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water (Partial Test Ban Treaty) (PTBT)|date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|access-date=31 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726123750/http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-banning-nuclear-test-atmosphere-outer-space-and-under-water-partial-test-ban-treaty-ptbt/|archive-date=26 July 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|2005|p=542}}{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=31}} Between 1945 and 1963, the US conducted 215 atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union conducted 219, the UK conducted 21, and [[France]] conducted three.&lt;ref name=nrdc&gt;{{cite web |title=Archive of Nuclear Data |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010072829/http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |archive-date=10 October 2007 |access-date=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, following the Castle Bravo test, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] of [[India]] issued the first appeal for a &quot;standstill agreement&quot; on testing, which was soon echoed by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=247}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=58}}&lt;ref name=bravo&gt;{{cite web |title=1 March 1954 – Castle Bravo |publisher=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/1-march-1954-castle-bravo/ |access-date=31 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728055901/http://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/1-march-1954-castle-bravo/ |archive-date=28 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations on a comprehensive test ban, primarily involved the US, UK, and the Soviet Union, began in 1955 following a proposal by Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}}{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=121}} Of primary concern throughout the negotiations, which would stretch with some interruptions to July 1963, was the system of verifying compliance with the test ban and detecting illicit tests. On the Western side, there were concerns that the Soviet Union would be able to circumvent any test ban and secretly leap ahead in the [[nuclear arms race]].{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=305}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=457–458}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=8–9}} These fears were amplified following the US [[Operation Plumbbob|''Rainier'']] shot of 19 September 1957, which was the first contained underground test of a nuclear weapon. Though the US held a significant advantage in underground testing capabilities, there was worry that the Soviet Union would be able to covertly conduct underground tests during a test ban, as underground detonations were more challenging to detect than above-ground tests.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}}{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=85–86}} On the Soviet side, conversely, the on-site compliance inspections demanded by the US and UK were seen as amounting to espionage.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=79}} Disagreement over verification would lead to the Anglo-American and Soviet negotiators abandoning a comprehensive test ban (i.e., a ban on all tests, including those underground) in favor of a partial ban, which would be finalized on 25 July 1963. The PTBT, joined by 123 states following the original three parties, banned detonations for military and civilian purposes underwater, in the atmosphere, and outer space.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=905–906, 910}}&lt;ref name=siglist&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty &amp; Partial Test Ban Treaty Membership |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/apmctbt_10.pdf |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=11 August 2016 |date=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916163532/http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/apmctbt_10.pdf |archive-date=16 September 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unoda&gt;{{cite web |title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water |publisher=[[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]] |access-date=11 August 2016 |url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/test_ban/text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTBT had mixed results. On the one hand, enactment of the treaty was followed by a substantial drop in the atmospheric concentration of radioactive particles.&lt;ref name=radiocarbon&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiocarbon Dating |publisher=[[Utrecht University]] |url=http://web.science.uu.nl/AMS/Radiocarbon.htm |access-date=31 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820213848/http://web.science.uu.nl/AMS/Radiocarbon.htm |archive-date=20 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Technical Details: The Bomb Spike |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/bombspike.html |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808120347/http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/bombspike.html |archive-date=8 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[nuclear proliferation]] was not halted entirely (though it may have been slowed) and nuclear testing continued at a rapid clip. Compared to the 499 tests from 1945 to the signing of the PTBT, 436 tests were conducted over the ten years following the PTBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |page=18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |access-date=11 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827190927/https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}} Furthermore, US and Soviet underground testing continued &quot;venting&quot; radioactive gas into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=nsa2&gt;{{cite web |title=The Limited Test Ban Treaty – 50 Years Later: New Documents Throw Light on Accord Banning Atmospheric Nuclear Testing |last=Burr |first=William |publisher=National Security Archive |date=2 August 2013 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb433/ |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730024645/http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb433/ |archive-date=30 July 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, though underground testing was generally safer than above-ground testing, underground tests continued to risk the leaking of [[radionuclide]]s, including [[plutonium]], into the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General Overview of the Effects of Nuclear Testing |publisher=CTBTO Preparatory Commission |url=https://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/the-effects-of-nuclear-testing/general-overview-of-theeffects-of-nuclear-testing/ |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805084943/http://www.ctbto.org/nuclear-testing/the-effects-of-nuclear-testing/general-overview-of-theeffects-of-nuclear-testing/ |archive-date=5 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on the Health Consequences to the American Population from Nuclear Weapons Tests Conducted by the United States and Other Nations |chapter=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |date=May 2005 |pages=20–21 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/ |access-date=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204164348/http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/ |archivedate=4 December 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003_10/LTBT|work=Arms Control Association|author=Daryl Kimball and Wade Boese|date=June 2009|access-date=21 May 2012|title=Limited Test Ban Treaty Turns 40|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105091513/http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2003_10/LTBT|archive-date=5 January 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 through 1996, the year of the CTBT's adoption, an estimated 1,377 underground nuclear tests were conducted.

The PTBT has been seen as a step towards the [[Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) of 1968, which directly referenced the PTBT.&lt;ref name=faschron&gt;{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Chronology |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |url=http://fas.org/nuke/control/ctbt/chron1.htm |access-date=7 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813223746/https://fas.org/nuke/control/ctbt/chron1.htm |archive-date=13 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the NPT, non-nuclear weapon states were prohibited from possessing, manufacturing, and acquiring nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. All signatories, including nuclear weapon states, were committed to the goal of total [[nuclear disarmament]]. However, India, [[Pakistan]], and [[Israel]] have declined to sign the NPT on the grounds that such a treaty is fundamentally discriminatory as it places limitations on states that do not have nuclear weapons while making no efforts to curb weapons development by declared nuclear weapons states.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In 1974, a step towards a comprehensive test ban was made with the [[Threshold Test Ban Treaty]] (TTBT), ratified by the US and Soviet Union, which banned underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.&lt;ref name=nsa2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Flawed Test Ban Treaty |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |date=27 March 1984 |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1984/03/the-flawed-test-ban-treaty |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920213407/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1984/03/the-flawed-test-ban-treaty |archive-date=20 September 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1976, the two states reached agreement on the [[Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty]] (PNET), which concerns nuclear detonations outside the weapons sites discussed in the TTBT. As in the TTBT, the US and Soviet Union agreed to bar [[peaceful nuclear explosions]] (PNEs) at these other locations with yields above 150 kilotons, as well as group explosions with total yields over 1,500 kilotons. To verify compliance, the PNET requires that states rely on [[national technical means of verification]], share information on explosions, and grant on-site access to counterparties. The TTBT and PNET did not enter into force for the US and Soviet Union until 11 December 1990.&lt;ref name=pnetreaty&gt;{{cite web |title=Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty (PNET) |url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/www/global/arms/treaties/pne1.html#1 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |access-date=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gorbachev and Reagan 1987-9.jpg|thumb|250px|Reagan and Gorbachev, December 1987]]

In October 1977, the US, UK, and Soviet Union returned to negotiations over a test ban. These three nuclear powers made notable progress in the late 1970s, agreeing to terms on a ban on all testing, including a temporary prohibition on PNEs, but continued disagreements over the compliance mechanisms led to an end to negotiations ahead of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration as President in 1981.&lt;ref name=faschron /&gt; In 1985, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced a unilateral testing moratorium, and in December 1986, Reagan reaffirmed US commitment to pursue the long-term goal of a comprehensive test ban. In November 1987, negotiations on a test ban restarted, followed by a joint US-Soviet program to research underground-test detection in December 1987.&lt;ref name=faschron /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Remotest Nevada, a Joint U.S. and Soviet Test |last=Blakeslee |first=Sandra |date=18 August 1988 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/18/world/in-remotest-nevada-a-joint-us-and-soviet-test.html |access-date=11 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822101507/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/18/world/in-remotest-nevada-a-joint-us-and-soviet-test.html |archive-date=22 August 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations==
Given the political situation prevailing in the subsequent decades, little progress was made in nuclear disarmament until the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991. Parties to the PTBT held an amendment conference that year to discuss a proposal to convert the Treaty into an instrument banning all nuclear-weapon tests. With strong support from the UN General Assembly, negotiations for a comprehensive test-ban treaty began in 1993.

===Adoption===
Extensive efforts were made over the next three years to draft the Treaty text and its two annexes. However, the [[Conference on Disarmament]], in which negotiations were being held, did not succeed in reaching consensus on the adoption of the text. Under the direction of Prime Minister [[John Howard]] and Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]], [[Australia]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} then sent the text to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in [[New York City|New York]], where it was submitted as a draft resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty: draft resolution|url=http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=X204697124L65.19785&amp;profile=bibga&amp;uri=full=3100001~!396802~!33&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon#focus|access-date=3 December 2011|date=6 September 1996|work=[[United Nations]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926213645/http://unbisnet.un.org:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=X204697124L65.19785&amp;profile=bibga&amp;uri=full=3100001~!396802~!33&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=power&amp;menu=search&amp;source=~!horizon#focus|archive-date=26 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1996, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was adopted by a large majority, exceeding two-thirds of the General Assembly's Membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;un.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/ares50-245.htm|title=Resolution adopted by the general assembly:50/245.

==Monitoring==
[[Geophysics|Geophysical]] and other technologies are used to monitor for compliance with the Treaty: [[forensic seismology]], hydroacoustics, [[infrasound]], and [[radionuclide]] monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/avc/rls/212176.htm|title=CTBT: International Monitoring System|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three forms of monitoring are known as [[Waveform|wave-form]] measurements. Seismic monitoring is performed with a system of 50 primary stations located throughout the world, with 120 auxiliary stations in signatory states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~richards/SeismoandCTBTVerif.html|title=Seismology and CTBT Verification|last=Richards|first=Paul|date=|website=www.ldeo.columbia.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroacoustic monitoring is performed with a system of 11 stations that consist of [[hydrophone]] triads to monitor for underwater explosions. Hydroacoustic stations can of seismometers to measure T-waves from possible underwater explosions instead of hydrophones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acoustics.org/pressroom/httpdocs/144th/Lawrence.htm|title=A Global Network of Hydroacoustic Stations for Monitoring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|last=Lawrence|first=Martin|date=|website=acoustics.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best measurement of hydroacoustic waves has been found to be at a depth of 1000 m. Infrasound monitoring relies on changes in atmospheric pressure caused by a possible nuclear explosion, with 41 stations certified as of August 2019. One of the biggest concerns with infrasound measurements is noise due to exposure from wind, which can effect the sensor's ability to measure if an event occurred. Together, these technologies are used to monitor the ground, water, and atmosphere for any sign of a nuclear explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009-09/building-up-regime-verifying-ctbt|title=Building Up the Regime for Verifying the CTBT {{!}} Arms Control Association|last=Tóth|first=Tibor|date=2019-08-01|website=www.armscontrol.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Radionuclide monitoring takes the form of either monitoring for radioactive particulates or [[Noble gas|noble gases]] as a product of a nuclear explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2008-10/features/comprehensive-test-ban-treaty-effectively-verifiable|title=The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty: Effectively Verifiable {{!}} Arms Control Association|last=Hafemeister|first=David|date=2019-08-01|website=www.armscontrol.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive particles emit radiation that can be measured by any of the 80 stations located throughout the world. They are created from nuclear explosions that can collect onto the dust that is moved from the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctbto.org/verification-regime/monitoring-technologies-how-they-work/radionuclide-monitoring/|title=Radionuclide monitoring: CTBTO Preparatory Commission|website=www.ctbto.org|access-date=2019-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a nuclear explosion took place underground, noble gas monitoring can be used to verify whether or not a possible nuclear explosion took place. Noble gas monitoring relies on measuring increases in radioactive [[xenon]] gas. Different isotopes of xenon include &lt;sup&gt;131m&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;133m&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, and &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe. All four monitoring methods make up the International Monitoring System (IMS). Statistical theories and methods are integral to CTBT monitoring providing confidence in verification analysis. Once the Treaty enters into force, on-site inspections will be conducted where concerns about compliance arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringbom|first=Anders|last2=Miley|first2=Harry|date=2009-07-25|title=Radionuclide Monitoring|url=https://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/ISS_Publication/Radionuclide_23-28.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=23-28|via=CTBTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission|Preparatory Commission]] for the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization]] (CTBTO), an international organization headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], was created to build the verification framework, including establishment and provisional operation of the network of monitoring stations, the creation of an international data centre (IDC), and development of the on-site Inspection capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/ctbto-preparatory-commission/|title=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO Preparatory Commission) {{!}} Treaties &amp; Regimes {{!}} NTI|website=www.nti.org|access-date=2019-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTBTO is responsible for collecting information from the IMS and distribute the analyzed and raw data to member states to judge whether or not a nuclear explosion occurred through the IDC. Parameters such as determining the location where a nuclear explosion or test took place is one of the things that the IDC can accomplish.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences. 2002. ''Technical Issues Related to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty''. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/10471.&lt;/ref&gt; If a member state chooses to assert that another state had violated the CTBT, they can request an on-site inspection to take place to verify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikitin|first=Mary|date=2016-09-01|title=Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: Background and Current Developments|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL33548.pdf|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monitoring network consists of 337 facilities located all over the globe. As of May 2012, more than 260 facilities have been certified. The monitoring stations register data that is transmitted to the international data centre in Vienna for processing and analysis. The data are sent to states that have signed the Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2009/us-nuclear-security-administrator-dagostinovisits-the-ctbto/|title=US nuclear security administrator dagostino visits the CTBTO|access-date=4 December 2011|date=15 September 2009|work=[[CTBTO Preparatory Commission]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125015918/http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/press-releases/2009/us-nuclear-security-administrator-dagostinovisits-the-ctbto/|archive-date=25 January 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent nuclear testing===
Three countries have tested nuclear weapons since the CTBT opened for signature in 1996. India and Pakistan both carried out two sets of tests in 1998. North Korea carried out six announced tests, one each in 2006, 2009, 2013, two in 2016 and one in 2017. All six North Korean tests were picked up by the International Monitoring System set up by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission. A North Korean test is believed to have taken place in January 2016, evidenced by an &quot;artificial earthquake&quot; measured as a magnitude 5.1 by the U.S. Geological Survey. The first successful North Korean hydrogen bomb test supposedly took place in September 2017. It was estimated to have an explosive yield of 120 kilotons.&lt;ref name=highlight&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2007/the-ctbt-verification-regime-put-to-the-test-the-event-in-the-dprk-on-9-october-2006/page-1/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1|title=Highlight 2007: The CTBT Verification Regime Put to the Test – The Event in the DPRK on 9 October 2006|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528092448/http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2007/the-ctbt-verification-regime-put-to-the-test-the-event-in-the-dprk-on-9-october-2006/page-1/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1|archive-date=28 May 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]|year=2012|url=http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2009/experts-sure-about-nature-of-the-dprk-event/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1|title=Press Release June 2009: Experts Sure About Nature of the DPRK Event|access-date=21 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502184605/http://www.ctbto.org/press-centre/highlights/2009/experts-sure-about-nature-of-the-dprk-event/?Fsize=atextonly%3D1|archive-date=2 May 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Korea announces it conducted nuclear test |publisher=CNN |last=McKirdy |first=Euan |date=6 January 2016 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/asia/north-korea-seismic-event/ |access-date=15 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107193043/http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/asia/north-korea-seismic-event/ |archive-date=7 January 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=North Korea claims successful hydrogen bomb test |publisher=CNBC |date=3 September 2017 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/03/north-korea-claims-successful-hydrogen-bomb-test.html |access-date=3 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903091743/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/03/north-korea-claims-successful-hydrogen-bomb-test.html |archive-date=3 September 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
