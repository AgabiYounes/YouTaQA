'''Ralph Dale Earnhardt Sr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɜr|n|h|ɑr|t|}}; April 29, 1951 – February 18, 2001) was an American professional [[auto racing]] driver and team owner, best known for his involvement in [[stock car racing]] for [[NASCAR]].&lt;ref name=EarnhardtCrash&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kPMwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XN0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2760,1972698&amp;dq=dale+earnhardt+crash |agency=Associated Press |title=Dale Earnhardt dies in crash on final lap of Daytona 500 |first=Dick |last=Brinster |date=February 19, 2001 |access-date=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third child of racing driver [[Ralph Earnhardt]] and Martha Earnhardt, he began his career in 1975 in the [[1975 World 600|World 600]] as part of the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]].

He also earned seven NASCAR Winston Cup championships, tying for the most all-time with [[Richard Petty]] and [[Jimmie Johnson]]. His aggressive driving style earned him the nicknames &quot;'''Ironhead&quot;''', &quot;'''The Intimidator'''&quot;, and &quot;'''The Man in Black&quot;'''. Also, his success at the [[restrictor plate]] tracks of Daytona and Talladega earned him the nickname, '''&quot;Mr. Restrictor Plate&quot;'''.

==Biography==

===Early and personal life===
Of [[German Americans|German ancestry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/earnhardt.html|title=Ancestry of Dale Earnhardt Jr.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale Earnhardt was born on April 29, 1951, in the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] suburb of [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], as the third child of Martha (''née'' Coleman) and [[Ralph Earnhardt]]. Earnhardt's father was one of the best short-track drivers in North Carolina at the time and won his first and only NASCAR Sportsman Championship in 1956 at [[Greenville Pickens Speedway]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. Although Ralph did not want his son to pursue a career as a race car driver, Dale dropped out of school to pursue his dreams. Ralph was a hard teacher for Dale, and after Ralph died of a [[heart attack]] at his home in 1973 at age 45, it took many years before Dale felt as though he had finally &quot;proven&quot; himself to his father. Earnhardt had four siblings: two brothers, Danny and Randy (died 2013);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/07/28/dale-earnhardt-junior-sees-struggles-on-off-track-at-indy.html|title=Earnhardt meets struggles on, off track at Indy|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two sisters, Cathy and Kaye (died 2015)

In 1968, at the age of 17, Earnhardt married his first wife, Latane Brown. With her, Earnhardt fathered his first son, [[Kerry Earnhardt|Kerry]], a year later. Earnhardt and Latane divorced in 1970. In 1971, Earnhardt married his second wife, Brenda Gee, the daughter of NASCAR car builder Robert Gee. In his marriage with Gee, Earnhardt had two more children: a daughter, [[Kelley Earnhardt Miller|Kelley King Earnhardt]], in 1972, and a son, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], in 1974. Not long after Dale Jr. was born, Earnhardt and Gee divorced. Earnhardt then married his third and final wife, [[Teresa Earnhardt|Teresa Houston]] ([[Tommy Houston]]'s niece), in 1982. She gave birth to their daughter, Taylor Nicole Earnhardt, in 1988. Taylor and her husband, Brandon Putnam, are professional [[rodeo]] performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Sam|url=http://www.oleantimesherald.com/sports/article_76cd428c-21e9-11e5-9931-ffa4325f22b0.html|title=A familiar name at Ellicottville rodeo|work=Olean Times Herald|date=July 4, 2015|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASCAR career==

===Early Winston Cup career (1975–1978)===
Earnhardt began his professional career in the NASCAR [[Winston Cup]] Series in 1975, making his debut at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in North Carolina in the longest race on the Cup circuit—the [[1975 World 600]]. He drove the No. 8 [[Ed Negre]] [[Dodge Charger]] and finished 22nd in that race, just one spot ahead of his future car owner, [[Richard Childress]]. Earnhardt competed in eight more races until 1979.

===Rod Osterlund Racing (1979–1980)===
When he joined car owner [[Rod Osterlund|Rod Osterlund Racing]] in a season that included a rookie class of future stars including Earnhardt, [[Harry Gant]], and [[Terry Labonte]] in his rookie season, Earnhardt won one race at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], captured four poles, scored eleven Top 5s and seventeen Top 10s, and finished seventh in the points standings despite missing four races due to a broken collarbone, winning [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/20/top-10-nascar-rookies-tony-stewart-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt.html|title=TOP 10 ROOKIE CAMPAIGNS AT NASCAR'S HIGHEST LEVEL|last=Caraviello|first=David|date=January 20, 2014|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122082015/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/20/top-10-nascar-rookies-tony-stewart-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt.html|archive-date=2014-01-22|url-status=|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his sophomore season, Earnhardt, now with 20-year-old [[Doug Richert]] as his crew chief, began the season winning the [[Budweiser Shootout|Busch Clash]]. With wins at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]], Bristol, [[Music City Motorplex|Nashville]], [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]], and Charlotte, Earnhardt won his first [[Winston Cup]] points championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR Winston Cup history to follow a Rookie of the Year title with a NASCAR Winston Cup Championship the next season. He was also the third driver in NASCAR history to win both the Rookie of the Year and Winston Cup Series championship, following [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]] (1960, 1966) and Richard Petty (1959, 1964). Only eight drivers have joined this exclusive club since: [[Rusty Wallace]] (1984, 1989), [[Alan Kulwicki]] (1986, 1992), [[Jeff Gordon]] (1993, 1995), [[Tony Stewart]] (1999, 2002), [[Matt Kenseth]] (2000, 2003), [[Kevin Harvick]] (2001, 2014), [[Kyle Busch]] (2005, 2015 and 2019) and [[Joey Logano]] (2009, 2018).

===Rod Osterlund Racing, Stacy Racing, and Richard Childress Racing (1981)===
1981 would prove to be tumultuous for the defending Winston Cup champion. Sixteen races into the season, [[Rod Osterlund]] suddenly sold his team to [[Jim Stacy]], an entrepreneur from Kentucky who entered [[NASCAR]] in 1977. After just four races, Earnhardt fell out with Stacy and left the team. Earnhardt finished out the year driving [[Pontiac|Pontiacs]] for [[Richard Childress Racing]] and managed to place seventh in the final points standings. Earnhardt departed RCR at the end of the season, citing a lack of chemistry.

===Bud Moore Engineering (1982–1983)===
[[File:DaleEarnhardt15racecar1983.jpg|right|thumb|Earnhardt's 1983 Ford Thunderbird]] 
The following year, at [[Richard Childress|Childress's]] suggestion, Earnhardt joined car owner [[Bud Moore (NASCAR owner)|Bud Moore]] for the 1982 and 1983 seasons driving the No. 15 [[Wrangler Jeans]]-sponsored [[Ford Thunderbird]] (the only full-time Ford ride in his career). During the 1982 season, Earnhardt struggled. Although he won at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], he failed to finish 15 races and completed the season 12th in points, the worst of his career. He also suffered a broken kneecap at [[Pocono Raceway]] when he flipped after contact with [[Tim Richmond]]. In 1983, Earnhardt rebounded and won his first of 12 [[Daytona 500#Qualifying procedure|Twin 125]] [[Daytona 500]] qualifying races. He won at Nashville and at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], finishing eighth in the points standings.

===Return to Richard Childress Racing (1984–2001)===

====1984–1985====
After the 1983 season, Earnhardt returned to [[Richard Childress Racing]], replacing [[Ricky Rudd]] in the No. 3. Rudd went to Bud Moore's No. 15, replacing Earnhardt. Wrangler sponsored both drivers at their respective teams. During the 1984 and 1985 seasons, Earnhardt went to victory lane six times, at Talladega, Atlanta, [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]], Bristol (twice), and Martinsville, where he finished fourth and eighth in the season standings respectively.

====1986–1987====
The 1986 season saw Earnhardt win his second career Winston Cup Championship and the first owner's championship for Richard Childress Racing. He won five races and had 10 top-fives and 16 top-10s. Earnhardt successfully defended his championship the following year, going to victory lane 11 times and winning the championship by 489 points over [[Bill Elliott]]. In the process, Earnhardt set a NASCAR modern era record of four consecutive wins and won five of the first seven races. In the 1987 season, he earned the nickname &quot;The Intimidator&quot;, due in part to the [[1987 The Winston|1987 Winston All-Star Race]]. During this race, Earnhardt was briefly forced into the infield grass but kept control of his car and returned to the track without giving up his lead. The maneuver is now referred to as the &quot;'''Pass in the Grass'''&quot;, even though Earnhardt did not pass anyone while he was off the track. After [[The Winston]], an angry fan sent [[Bill France Jr.]] a letter threatening to kill Earnhardt at [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]], [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], or [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]], prompting the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to provide security for Earnhardt on the three tracks. The investigation was closed after the races at the three tracks finished without incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deadspin.com/5936579/when-i-get-a-clear-shot-25-years-ago-dale-earnhardt-received-this-death-threat-for-his-pass-in-the-grass |title=&quot;When I Get A Clear Shot...&quot;: 25 Years Ago, Dale Earnhardt Received This Death Threat For His Ornery Driving |first=Barry |last=Petchesky |website=Deadspin |publisher=[[Gizmodo Media Group]] |date=August 21, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988–1989====
The 1988 season saw Earnhardt racing with a new sponsor, [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]], after [[Wrangler Jeans]] dropped its sponsorship in 1987. During this season, he changed the color of his paint scheme from [[blue]] and [[yellow]] to the signature [[black]] in which the No. 3 car was painted for the rest of his life. He won three races in 1988, finishing third in the points standings behind Bill Elliott in first and Rusty Wallace in second. The following year, Earnhardt won five races, but a late spin out at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]] arguably cost him the 1989 championship, as Rusty Wallace edged him out for it. It was his first season for the [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]].

====1990–1995====
The 1990 season started for Earnhardt with victories in the [[Budweiser Shootout|Busch Clash]] and his heat of the [[Gatorade Duel|Gatorade Twin 125's]]. Near the end of the [[Daytona 500]], he had a dominant forty-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading [[Derrike Cope]]. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal, which was later revealed as a [[bell housing]], in turn 4, cutting down a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth after leading 155 of the 200 laps. The No. 3 Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win and hung it on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they had come to winning the Daytona 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/3/6/top-10-bad-luck-moments-las-vegas.html|title=TOP 10 BAD LUCK MOMENTS IN NASCAR|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=March 6, 2014|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earnhardt won nine races that season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating [[Mark Martin]] by 26 points. He also became the first multiple winner of the annual all-star race, [[1990 The Winston|The Winston]]. The 1991 season saw Earnhardt win his fifth Winston Cup championship. This season, he scored four wins and won the championship by 195 points over [[Ricky Rudd]]. One of his wins came at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]], in a race where [[Harry Gant]] had a chance to set a single-season record by winning his fifth consecutive race, breaking a record held by Earnhardt. Late in the race, Gant lost his brakes, which gave Earnhardt the chance he needed to make the pass for the win and maintain his record.

Earnhardt's only win of the 1992 season came at Charlotte, in the [[Coca-Cola 600]], ending a 13-race win streak by Ford teams. Earnhardt finished a career-low 12th in the points for the second time in his career, and the only time he had finished that low since joining Richard Childress Racing. He still made the trip to the annual Awards Banquet with Rusty Wallace but did not have the best seat in the house. Wallace stated he and Earnhardt had to sit on the backs of their chairs to see, and Earnhardt said, &quot;This sucks, I should have gone hunting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=mcgee_ryan&amp;id=3736700 |title=Ryan McGee: Best and worst of NASCAR Sprint Cup banquet nights past&amp;nbsp;— ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the year, longtime crew chief [[Kirk Shelmerdine]] left to become a driver. [[Andy Petree]] took over as crew chief. Hiring Petree turned out to be beneficial, as Earnhardt returned to the front in 1993. He once again came close to a win at the Daytona 500 and dominated [[Speedweeks]] before finishing second to [[Dale Jarrett]] on a last-lap pass. Earnhardt scored six wins en route to his sixth Winston Cup title, including wins in the first prime-time Coca-Cola 600 and The Winston, both at Charlotte, and the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at Daytona. He beat Rusty Wallace for the championship by 80 points. On November 14, 1993, after the season ending Hooters 500 at Atlanta, the race winner Wallace and 1993 series champion Earnhardt ran a dual [[Polish Victory Lap]] together while carrying #28 and #7 flags commemorating [[1992 Daytona 500]] winner [[Davey Allison]] and [[1992 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] champion [[Alan Kulwicki]] respectively, who both had died in separate plane accidents during the season. 

[[File:Dale Sr 1994.jpg|thumb|Earnhardt's [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]] racecar]]
In 1994, Earnhardt achieved a feat that he himself had believed to be impossible—he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying [[Richard Petty]]. He was very consistent, scoring four wins, and after [[Ernie Irvan]] was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck at the top of the points up until the crash), won the title by over 400 points over Mark Martin. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over [[Rick Mast]]. It was his final NASCAR championship and his final season for the [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] [[Chevrolet Lumina]]. Earnhardt started off the 1995 season by finishing second in the Daytona 500 to [[Sterling Marlin]]. He won five races in 1995, including his first [[road course]] victory at [[Infineon Raceway|Sears Point]]. He also won the [[Allstate 400 at The Brickyard|Brickyard 400]] at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a win he called the biggest of his career. But in the end, Earnhardt lost the championship to [[Jeff Gordon]] by 34 points. The [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] racing team changed to [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]s.

====1996–1999====
[[File:Dale Earnhardt - NASCAR Photography By Darryl Moran.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt at [[Phoenix International Raceway]].]]
1996 for Earnhardt started just like it had done in 1993—he dominated Speedweeks, only to finish second in the [[1996 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] to [[Dale Jarrett]] for the second time. He won early in the year, scoring consecutive victories at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] and Atlanta. On July 28 in the [[AMP Energy 500|DieHard 500]] at Talladega, he was in the points lead and looking for his eighth season title, despite the departure of crew chief Andy Petree. Late in the race, [[Ernie Irvan]] lost control of his No. 28 [[Havoline]]-sponsored Ford Thunderbird, made contact with the No. 4 Kodak-sponsored Chevy Monte Carlo of [[Sterling Marlin]], and ignited a crash that saw Earnhardt's No. 3 Chevrolet hit the tri-oval wall nearly head-on at almost 200&amp;nbsp;mph. After hitting the wall, Earnhardt's car flipped and slid across the track, in front of race-traffic. His car was hit in the roof and windshield. This accident, as well as a similar accident that led to the death of [[Russell Phillips]] at Charlotte, led NASCAR to mandate the &quot;Earnhardt Bar&quot;, a metal brace located in the center of the windshield that reinforces the roof in case of a similar crash. This bar is also required in NASCAR-owned [[United SportsCar Racing]] and its predecessors for road racing.

Rain delays had canceled the live telecast of the race, and most fans first learned of the accident during the night's sports newscasts. Video of the crash showed what appeared to be a fatal incident, but once medical workers arrived at the car, Earnhardt climbed out and waved to the crowd, refusing to be loaded onto a stretcher despite a broken collarbone, sternum, and shoulder blade. Although the incident looked like it would end his season early, Earnhardt refused to stay out of the car. The next week at Indianapolis, he started the race but exited the car on the first pit stop, allowing [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]] to take the wheel. When asked, Earnhardt said that vacating the No. 3 car was the hardest thing he had ever done. The following weekend at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], he drove the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet to the fastest time in qualifying, earning the &quot;True Grit&quot; pole. T-shirts emblazoned with Earnhardt's face were quickly printed up, brandishing the caption, &quot;It Hurt So Good&quot;. Earnhardt led for most of the race and looked to have victory in hand, but fatigue took its toll and he ended up sixth behind race winner [[Geoff Bodine]]. Earnhardt did not win again in 1996 but still finished fourth in the standings behind [[Terry Labonte]], Jeff Gordon, and Dale Jarrett. David Smith departed as crew chief of the No. 3 team and RCR at the end of the year for personal reasons, and he was replaced by [[Larry McReynolds]].

In 1997, Earnhardt went winless for only the second time in his career. The only (non-points) win came during Speedweeks at Daytona in the Twin 125-mile qualifying race, his record eighth-straight win in the event. Once again in the hunt for the Daytona 500 with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was taken out of contention by a late crash which sent his car upside down on the backstretch. He hit the low point of his year when he blacked out early in the [[1997 Mountain Dew Southern 500|Mountain Dew Southern 500]] at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] in September, causing him to hit the wall. Afterward, he was disoriented, and it took several laps before he could find his pit stall. When asked, Earnhardt complained of double vision which made it difficult to pit. [[Mike Dillon (racing driver)|Mike Dillon]] (Richard Childress's son-in-law) was brought in to relieve Earnhardt for the remainder of the race. Earnhardt was evaluated at a local hospital and cleared to race the next week, but the cause of the blackout and double vision was never determined. Despite no wins, the Richard Childress Racing team finished the season fifth in the final standings. 

On February 15, 1998, Earnhardt finally won the [[1998 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] in his 20th attempt after failing to win in his previous 19 attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Persinger, p. 12 &amp; 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before was the first to drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 laps. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that [[Jeff Gordon]] had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead and thanks to a push by teammate [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]], he maintained it. Earnhardt made it to the caution-checkered flag before [[Bobby Labonte]]. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined [[pit road]] to shake his hand as he made his way to [[List of motorsport terminology#V|victory lane]]. Earnhardt then drove his No. 3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving tire tracks in the shape of a No. 3 in the grass. He then spoke about the victory, saying, &quot;I have had a lot of great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can't thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it, we won it, we won it!&quot; The rest of the season did not go as well, and the 500 was his only victory that year. Despite that, he did almost pull off a Daytona sweep, where he was one of the contenders for the win in the first nighttime Pepsi 400, but a pit stop late in the race in which a rogue tire cost him the race win. He slipped to 12th in the point standings halfway through the season, and Richard Childress decided to make a crew chief change, taking [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]]'s crew chief [[Kevin Hamlin]] and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner [[Larry McReynolds]] (Earnhardt's crew chief). Earnhardt finished eighth in the final standings.

Before the 1999 season, fans began discussing Earnhardt's age and speculating that with his son, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr|Dale Jr.]], making his Winston Cup debut, Earnhardt might be contemplating retirement. Earnhardt swept both races for the year at Talladega, leading some to conclude that his talent had become limited to the restrictor plate tracks, which require a unique skill set and an exceptionally powerful racecar to win. But halfway through the year, Earnhardt began to show some of the old spark. In the August race at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]], he led laps late in the race and nearly pulled off his first win on a non-restrictor-plate track since 1996. One week later, he provided NASCAR with one of its most controversial moments. At the [[1999 Goody's Headache Powder 500|Bristol night race]], Earnhardt found himself in contention to win his first short track race since Martinsville in 1995. When a caution came out with 15 laps to go, leader Terry Labonte got hit from behind by the lapped car of [[Darrell Waltrip]]. His spin put Earnhardt in the lead with five cars between him and Labonte with 5 laps to go. Labonte had four fresh tires, and Earnhardt was driving on old tires, which made Earnhardt's car considerably slower. Labonte caught Earnhardt and passed him coming to the [[white flag]], but Earnhardt drove hard into turn two, bumping Labonte and spinning him around. Earnhardt collected the win while spectators booed and made obscene gestures. &quot;I didn't mean to turn him around, I just wanted to rattle his cage,&quot; Earnhardt said of the incident. He finished seventh in the standings that year.

Coincidentally, this position on a load crew is known unofficially as &quot;Jammer Driver&quot; or officially as Number ''3'' man.]]
In the 2000 season, Earnhardt had a resurgence, which was commonly attributed to neck surgery he underwent to correct a lingering injury from his 1996 Talladega crash. He scored what were considered the two most exciting wins of the year—winning by 0.010 seconds over [[Bobby Labonte]] at Atlanta, then gaining seventeen positions in the final four laps to win at Talladega, claiming his only [[Winston Million|No Bull]] million-dollar bonus along with his record 10th win at the track. Earnhardt also had second-place runs at Richmond and Martinsville, tracks where he had struggled through the late 1990s. On the strength of those performances, Earnhardt got to second in the standings. However, poor performances at the road course of Watkins Glen, where he wrecked coming out of the [[chicane]], a wreck with [[Kenny Irwin Jr.]] while leading the spring race at Bristol, and mid-pack runs at intermediate tracks like Charlotte and Dover in a season dominated by the [[Ford Taurus]] in those tracks from [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush]], [[Yates Racing|Yates]], and [[Team Penske|Penske]], coupled with Bobby Labonte's extreme consistency, denied Earnhardt an eighth championship title.

[[File:2001DaleSrCrash.jpg|thumb|right|The final-lap crash that took Earnhardt's life. He and [[Ken Schrader]] (No. 36) have just made contact with each other.]]
During the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] at [[Daytona International Speedway]] on February 18, 2001, Earnhardt was killed in a three-car crash on the final lap of the race. He collided with [[Ken Schrader]] after making small contact with [[Sterling Marlin]] and hit the outside wall head-on. He’d been blocking Schrader on the outside and Marlin on the inside at the time of the crash. Earnhardt's and Schrader's cars both slid off the track's asphalt banking into the infield grass just inside of turn 4. Seconds later, his driver [[Michael Waltrip]] won the race, with his teammate and son [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] finishing second.&lt;ref name=&quot;rpm&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://static.espn.go.com/rpm/wc/2001/0218/1093772.html|title=Earnhardt dies instantly of head injuries|work=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|agency=Associated Press|date=February 18, 2001|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021901/spr_5436772.html|title=Earnhardt killed|date=February 19, 2001|work=Jacksonville.com|publisher=The Florida Times Union|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010320143221/https://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/021901/spr_5436772.html|archive-date=2001-03-20|url-status=|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earnhardt's death was officially pronounced at the [[Halifax Health|Halifax Medical Center]] at 5:16 PM [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] (22:16 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]); he was 49 years old.

====Aftermath====
After Earnhardt's death, both a police investigation and a NASCAR-sanctioned investigation commenced; nearly every detail of the crash was made public. The allegations of seatbelt failure resulted in [[Bill Simpson]]'s resignation from the company bearing his name, which manufactured the seatbelts used in Earnhardt's car and nearly every other NASCAR driver's car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinton&quot;&gt;''Daytona: From the Birth of Speed to the Death of the Man in Black''. Hinton, Ed. Warner Books, 2001. {{ISBN|0-446-52677-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; NASCAR implemented rigorous safety improvements, such as mandating the [[HANS device]], which Earnhardt refused to wear after finding it restrictive and uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aumann|first1=Mark|title=HANS device acceptance slow until fateful crash|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/09/11/ups-hans-device.html|website=nascar.com|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several press conferences were held in the days following Earnhardt's death. After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received hate mail and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility. Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship. Childress, who holds the rights from NASCAR to the No. 3, placed a moratorium on using it; the number returned for the [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014 season]], this time not sponsored by GM Goodwrench, driven by Childress's grandson [[Austin Dillon]].

{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=&quot;No fire could burn his character. No stone could break it.&quot;|source=—[[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] on February 18, 2001.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcend – The Intimidator |work=Bleacher Report Media Lab |quote=He was a living legend by 2001, when he raced in the Daytona 500 and shared the track with his son, Dale Jr. |url=http://thelab.bleacherreport.com/transcend/#the-intimidator |accessdate=27 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At this time, his team was re-christened as the No. 29 team. Childress' second-year Busch Series driver [[Kevin Harvick]] was named as Earnhardt's replacement, beginning with the [[2001 Dura Lube 400]] at [[North Carolina Speedway]]. Special pennants bearing the No. 3 were distributed to everyone at the track to honor Earnhardt, and the Childress team wore blank uniforms out of respect, something which disappeared quickly and was soon replaced by the previous GM Goodwrench Service Plus uniforms. Harvick's car always displayed the Earnhardt stylized number 3 on the &quot;B&quot; posts (metal portion on each side of the car to the rear of the front windows) above the number 29 until the end of 2013, when he departed for [[Stewart-Haas Racing]].

Fans began honoring Earnhardt by holding three fingers aloft on the third lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the beginning of ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2002]]'' before the [[EA Sports]] logo, and the television coverage of ''[[NASCAR on Fox]]'' and ''[[NASCAR on NBC]]'' went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year's race there in honor of Earnhardt, unless on-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the [[2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500]], he beat [[Jeff Gordon]] by .006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over [[Bobby Labonte]] at the same race a year ago) in an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man [[Danny &quot;Chocolate&quot; Myers]] crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window; and the Fox television call by [[Mike Joy]], [[Larry McReynolds]], and [[Darrell Waltrip]] concluding with &quot;Just like a year ago [with Earnhardt and Bobby Labonte], but he [Harvick] is gonna get him though...Gordon got loose... it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!&quot; are memorable to many NASCAR fans. The win was also considered [[catharsis|cathartic]] for a sport whose epicenter had been ripped away. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points, and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.

[[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] won five races in the 2001 season, beginning with [[Steve Park]]'s victory in the race at Rockingham just one week after Earnhardt's death. Earnhardt Jr. and Waltrip finished first and second in the series' return to Daytona in July for the [[2001 Pepsi 400|Pepsi 400]], a reverse of the finish in the Daytona 500. Earnhardt Jr. also won the fall races at Dover (first post 9/11 race) and Talladega and came to an eighth-place points finish.

Earnhardt's remains were interred at his estate in Mooresville, North Carolina after a private funeral service on February 21, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSFuneral&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimesFuneral&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=20861|title=Dale Earnhardt|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==No. 3 car==
[[File:DaleEarnhardtInCar.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt in the No. 3 car]]
[[File:Dale_Sr_1994.jpg|thumb|right|The No. 3 car]]
Earnhardt drove the No. 3 car for the majority of his career, spanning the latter half of the 1981 season, and then again from 1984 until his death in 2001. Although he had other sponsors during his career, his No. 3 is associated in fans' minds with his last sponsor [[GM Certified Service|GM Goodwrench]] and his last color scheme&amp;nbsp;— a predominantly black car with bold red and silver trim. The black and red No. 3 continues to be one of the most famous logos in North American motor racing.&lt;!-- citation needed
 --&gt;
 
A common misconception was that Richard Childress Racing &quot;owned the rights&quot; to the No. 3 in NASCAR competition (fueled by the fact that Kevin Harvick's car had a little No. 3 as an homage to Earnhardt from 2001-2013 and the usage of the No. 3 on the [[Camping World Truck Series]] truck of [[Ty Dillon]] when he ran in that series), but in fact NASCAR, and no specific team, owns the rights to this or any other number. According to established NASCAR procedures, Richard Childress Racing had priority over other teams if they chose to reuse the number, which they did when [[Austin Dillon]] was promoted to the Cup series in 2014. While Richard Childress Racing owns the stylized No. 3 logos used during Earnhardt's lifetime (and used presently with Dillon), those rights would hypothetically not prevent a future racing team from using a different No. 3 design (also, a new No. 3 team would most likely, in any case, need to create logos which fit with their sponsor's logos).

In 2004, [[ESPN]] released a made-for-TV movie entitled ''[[3: The Dale Earnhardt Story]]'', which used a new (but similarly colored) No. 3 logo. The movie was a sympathetic portrayal of Earnhardt's life, but the producers were sued for using the No. 3 logo. In December 2006, the ESPN lawsuit was settled, but details were not released to the public.

[[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] made two special appearances in 2002 in a No. 3 [[Busch Series]] car: these appearances were at the track where his father died ([[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]) and the track where he made his first Winston Cup start ([[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]). Earnhardt Jr. won the first of those two races, which was the season-opening event at Daytona. He also raced a No. 3 sponsored by Wrangler on July 2, 2010, for Richard Childress Racing at Daytona. In a green-white-checker finish he outran [[Joey Logano]] to win his second race in the No. 3.

Otherwise, the No. 3 was missing from the national touring series until September 5, 2009, when [[Austin Dillon]], the 19-year-old grandson of Richard Childress, debuted an RCR-owned No. 3 truck in the [[Camping World Truck Series]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin-Dillon-3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=David Caraviello |url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/headlines/truck/09/03/rcr.adillon.3/index.html |title=Childress grandson brings No. 3 back to national level&amp;nbsp;— Sep 3, 2009 |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon and his younger brother [[Ty Dillon]] drove the No. 3 in various lower level competitions for several years, including the [[Camping World East Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Caraviello |url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/03/20/adillon.driving.3.car/index.html |title=– Childress' grandson driving No. 3 car back to NASCAR&amp;nbsp;– March 20, 2008 |publisher=Nascar.com |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Austin Dillon began driving in the Nationwide Series full-time, using the No. 3; he had previously used the No. 33 while driving in that series part-time.

Richard Childress Racing entered a No. 3 in the Daytona truck race on February 13, 2010, painted identically to when Earnhardt drove it, but with a sponsorship from Bass Pro Shops. It was driven by Austin Dillon. It was involved in a wreck almost identical to that which took the life of Earnhardt: being spun out, colliding with another vehicle, and being turned into the outside wall in turn number four. He walked away unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://youtu.be/pjuk1UlzsqY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon again returned to a No. 3 marked racecar when he started fifth in the 2012 Daytona Nationwide Series opener in an Advocare sponsored black [[Chevrolet Impala]]. On December 11, 2013, RCR announced that Austin Dillon would drive the No. 3 car in the upcoming 2014 Sprint Cup season, bringing the number back to the series for the first time in 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;On May 28, 2016 the #3 returned to victory lane in the Cup Series for the first time since 2000 when Austin Dillon won the Coca-Cola 600 on a fuel mileage gamble. {{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/12/11/austin-dillon-driving-number-3-car-dale-earnhardt-sprint-cup-series.html|title=DILLON TO DRIVE NO. 3 SPRINT CUP CAR FOR RCR|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the former [[International Race of Champions]] actually retired the No. 3, which they did in a rule change effective in 2004. Until the series folded in 2007, anyone wishing to use the No. 3 again had to use No. 03 instead.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[Formula One]] driver [[Daniel Ricciardo]] chose the number ''3'' as his permanent racing number when F1's rules changed to allow drivers to choose their own numbers for [[2014 Formula 1 season|2014]] and stated on Twitter that part of the reason for his choice was that he was a fan of Earnhardt's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/danielricciardo/status/421830907171840000|title=Daniel Ricciardo on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his helmet design features the number stylized in the same way.

==Legacy==
&quot;Earnhardt Tower&quot;, a seating section at Daytona International Speedway was opened and named in his honor a month before his death at the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20100809/name-dedication-at-speedway-truly-an-honor |title=Name dedication at Speedway truly an honor

Earnhardt has several roads named after him, including a street in his hometown Kannapolis. Dale Earnhardt Boulevard (originally Earnhardt Road) is marked as Exit 60 off [[Interstate 85]], northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. Dale Earnhardt Drive is also the start of The Dale Journey Trail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daletrail.com/ |title=Welcome to &quot;The Dale Trail&quot; |publisher=Daletrail.com |date=January 1, 1999 |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128204325/http://www.daletrail.com/ |archive-date=November 28, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; a self-guided driving tour of landmarks in the lives of Earnhardt and his family. The [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] switched the designation of a road between Kannapolis and [[Mooresville, North Carolina|Mooresville]] near the headquarters of DEI (that used to be called NC 136) with [[North Carolina Highway 3|NC 3]], which was in [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck County]]. In addition, Exit 72 off [[Interstate 35W (Texas)|Interstate 35W]], one of the entrances to [[Texas Motor Speedway]], is named &quot;Dale Earnhardt Way&quot;.

Between the 2004 and 2005 JGTC (renamed [[Super GT]] from 2005) season, [[Masahiro Hasemi|Hasemi Sport]] competed in the series with a sole black G'Zox sponsored [[Nissan 350Z]] with the same number and letterset as Earnhardt on the roof.

During the NASCAR weekend races at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] on April 29, 2006&amp;nbsp;– May 1, 2006, the DEI cars competed in identical special black paint schemes on Dale Earnhardt Day, which is held annually on his birthday—April 29. [[Martin Truex Jr.]], won the [[Aaron's 312]] in the black car, painted to reflect Earnhardt's Intimidating Black No. 3 NASCAR Busch Grand National series car. In the Nextel Cup race on May 1, No. 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr.; No. 1 Martin Truex Jr.; and No. 15 [[Paul Menard]] competed in cars with the same type of paint scheme.

On June 18, 2006, at Michigan for the [[3M Performance 400]], Earnhardt Jr. ran a special vintage [[Budweiser]] car to honor his father and his grandfather [[Ralph Earnhardt]]. He finished third after rain caused the race to be cut short. The car was painted to resemble Ralph's 1956 dirt cars, and carried 1956-era Budweiser logos to complete the throwback look.

In the summer of 2007, [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] (DEI) with the Dale Earnhardt Foundation, announced it will fund an annual [[undergraduate]] scholarship at [[Clemson University]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] for students interested in [[motorsports]] and [[automotive]] engineering.

In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of the first Daytona 500 race, [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]] and [[Richard Childress Racing|RCR]] teamed up to make a special [[Car of Tomorrow|COT]] sporting Earnhardt's [[1998 Daytona 500]] paint scheme to honor the tenth anniversary of his Daytona 500 victory. In a tribute to all previous Daytona 500 winners, the winning drivers appeared in a lineup on stage, in chronological order. The throwback No. 3 car stood in the infield, in the approximate position Earnhardt would have taken in the processional. The throwback car featured the authentic 1998-era design on a current-era car, a concept similar to modern throwback jerseys in other sports. The car was later sold in 1:64 and 1:24 scale models.

The [[Intimidator 305]] roller coaster has been open since April 2, 2010 at [[Kings Dominion]] in [[Doswell, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rcdb.com/4520.htm|title=Intimidator 305 - Kings Dominion (Doswell, Virginia, USA)|website=rcdb.com|access-date=2019-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named after Earnhardt, the ride's trains are modeled after his black-and-red Chevrolet.

[[Atlanta Braves]] assistant coach [[Ned Yost]] was a friend of Earnhardt, and Richard Childress. When Yost was named [[Milwaukee Brewers]] manager, he changed jersey numbers, from No. 5 to No. 3 in Earnhardt's honor. (No. 3 is retired by the Braves in honor of outfielder [[Dale Murphy]], so Yost could not make the change while in Atlanta.) When Yost was named [[Kansas City Royals]] assistant coach, he wore No. 2 for the 2010 season, even when he was named manager in May 2010, but for the 2011 season, he switched back to No. 3.

During the third lap of the 2011 Daytona 500 (a decade since Earnhardt's death), the commentators on FOX fell silent while fans raised three fingers in a similar fashion to the tributes throughout 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-20/rookie-trevor-bayne-wins-nascar-s-daytona-500-from-carl-edwards.html |title=Bayne Becomes Youngest Daytona 500 Winner as Nascar's Past, Future Unite |publisher=Bloomberg |date= February 21, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2011 |first=Dex |last=McLuskey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The north entrance to New Avondale City Center in Arizona will bear the name Dale Earnhardt Drive. Avondale is where Earnhardt won a Cup race in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixraceway.com/Articles/2011/02/Dale-Earnhardt-Road.aspx|title=AVONDALE NAMES STREET AFTER DALE EARNHARDT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weedeater (band)|Weedeater]], a [[sludge metal]] band from North Carolina, paid tribute to Earnhardt on their 2003 album ''Sixteen Tons'', with the song &quot;No. 3&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNJGB-z6Xbw|title=Weedeater - #3|date=February 7, 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is played with audio clips from television broadcasts about Earnhardt mixed in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiemerch.com/weedeater/item/27798|title=Weedeater &quot;Sixteen Tons Collector's Bundle&quot; Bundle - Weedeater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also mentioned in a 2001 song composed by [[John Hiatt]] entitled ''The Tiki Bar Is Open,'' along with his legendary race number. 

On February 28, 2016, after winning the [[2016 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500|Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500]] at Atlanta Motor Speedway, during his victory lap, driver [[Jimmie Johnson]] held his hand out of his window, with three fingers extended in tribute to Earnhardt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxmw1efUwtg|title=Winner's Weekend: Jimmie Johnson- Atlanta 2016|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt-jr-ties-dale-earnhardt-atlanta-motor-speedway-sprint-cup-022816|title=Jimmie Johnson ties late Dale Earnhardt's record with 76th victory|first=Tom|last=Jensen|publisher=Fox Sports|date=February 28, 2016|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was following Johnson's 76th Cup Series win, which tied the career mark of Earnhardt's.
