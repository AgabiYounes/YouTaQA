Within the church proper are the last four (or, by some definitions, five) [[Stations of the Cross|stations]] of the [[Via Dolorosa]], representing the final episodes of the [[Passion of Jesus]]. The church has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] destination since its creation in the fourth century, as the traditional site of the resurrection of Christ, thus its original Greek name, Church of the Anastasis ('Resurrection').

Today, the wider complex around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre also serves as the headquarters of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], while control of the church itself is [[Simultaneum|shared]] among several [[Christian denominations]] and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for over 160 years, and some for much longer. The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and to a lesser degree the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]].

==History==
Following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege of 70 AD]] during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], Jerusalem had been reduced to ruins. In 130&amp;nbsp;AD, the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] began the building of a Roman colony, the new city of ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]'', on the site. Circa 135&amp;nbsp;AD he ordered that a cave containing a [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tomb]] be filled in to create a flat foundation for a temple dedicated to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] or [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt;&lt;ref name=paul&gt;{{cite book| last=Stephenson| first=Paul| title=Constantine: Roman Emperor, Christian Victor| publisher=The Overlook Press| year=2010| isbn=978-1-46830-300-1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTsjCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT206|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Connection to Roman Temple|The temple]]&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

This building was destroyed by a fire in May of 614 A.D when the [[Sassanid Empire]], under [[Khosrau II]],&lt;ref name=bible/&gt; invaded Jerusalem and captured the [[True Cross]]. In 630, the Emperor [[Heraclius]] rebuilt the church after recapturing the city. After [[History of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages|Jerusalem came under Arab rule]], it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites, prohibiting their destruction or use as living quarters. A story reports that the [[Umar|Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab]] visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony, but at the time of prayer, turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius added that Umar wrote a decree prohibiting Muslims from praying at this location. The building suffered severe damage from an earthquake in 746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Sepulchrum Domini Through the Ages: Its Form and Function| last=Kroesen| first=Justin| publisher=Leuven| year=2000|isbn=978-9042909526| page=11| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5O9PqvBjn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Sepulchrum+Domini+Through+the+Ages:+Its+Form+and+Function&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjej9S26srmAhXNGc0KHeHmAFIQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=earthquake&amp;f=false| url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. The damage was repaired in 810 by [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch]] [[Thomas I of Jerusalem|Thomas]]. In 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent to the Church. In 938, a new fire damaged the inside of the basilica and came close to the rotunda. In 966, due to a defeat of Muslim armies in the region of Syria, a riot broke out, which was followed by reprisals. The basilica was burned again. The doors and roof were burnt, and the Patriarch [[John VII of Jerusalem|John VII]] was murdered.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On 18 October 1009, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] ordered the [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre|complete destruction of the church]] as part of a more general campaign against Christian places of worship in Palestine and Egypt.{{efn|[[Adémar de Chabannes]] recorded that the church of Saint George at [[Lod|Lydda]] 'with many other churches of the saints' had been attacked, and the 'basilica of the Lord's Sepulchre destroyed down to the ground'. ...The Christian writer [[Yahya ibn Sa'id]] reported that everything was razed 'except those parts which were impossible to destroy or would have been too difficult to carry away'.&quot; {{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}}} The damage was extensive, with few parts of the early church remaining, and the roof of the rock-cut tomb damaged; the original shrine was destroyed.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=99}} Some partial repairs followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Morris|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Europe reacted with shock and expulsions of [[Jews]], serving as an impetus to later [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Concise History of the Catholic Church |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DISK1e7JXA8C&amp;q=crusades#v=snippet&amp;q=crusades&amp;f=false |last=Bokenkotter |first=Thomas |year=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |page= 155| isbn=0-385-50584-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years| last=MacCulloch| first=Diarmaid| date=24 September 2009| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7x4m20TRYzQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+christianity:+the+first+three+thousand+years&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiV5-TD6crmAhUFHM0KHcUECg8Q6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=sepulchre&amp;f=false| publisher=Penguin Books Limited| isbn=978-0141957951| language=en| page=1339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction (11th century)===
In wide-ranging negotiations between the Fatimids and the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1027–28, an agreement was reached whereby the new Caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] (Al-Hakim's son) agreed to allow the rebuilding and redecoration of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Lev| first=Yaacov| title=State and Society in Fatimid Egypt| page=40 |publisher=E.J.

In addition, the Byzantines, while releasing 5,000 Muslim prisoners, made demands for the restoration of other churches destroyed by Al-Hakim and the reestablishment of a [[patriarch]] in Jerusalem. Contemporary sources credit the emperor with spending vast sums in an effort to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre after this agreement was made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lev 1991&quot;/&gt; Still, &quot;a total replacement was far beyond available resources. The new construction was concentrated on the rotunda and its surrounding buildings: the great basilica remained in ruins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;/&gt;

The rebuilt church site consisted of &quot;a court open to the sky, with five small chapels attached to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Fergusson&gt;{{cite book| title=A History of Architecture in All Countries| first=James| last=Fergusson| authorlink=James Fergusson (architect)| year=1865| publisher=J.

They commemorated scenes from the passion, such as the location of the prison of Christ and his flagellation, and presumably were so placed because of the difficulties of free movement among shrines in the city streets. The dedication of these chapels indicates the importance of the pilgrims' devotion to the suffering of Christ. They have been described as 'a sort of [[Via Dolorosa]] in miniature'...&amp;nbsp;since little or no rebuilding took place on the site of the great basilica.

===Crusader period (1099–1244)===
{{Further|Order of the Holy Sepulchre}}
Many historians maintain that the main concern of [[Pope Urban II]], when calling for the [[First Crusade]], was the threat to Constantinople from the Turkish invasion of [[Asia Minor]] in response to the appeal of Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. Historians agree that the fate of Jerusalem and thereby the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was of concern to if not the immediate goal of papal policy in 1095. The idea of taking Jerusalem gained more focus as the Crusade was underway. The rebuilt church site was taken from the Fatimids (who had recently taken it from the Abassids) by the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] on 15 July 1099.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris 2005&quot;/&gt;

The First Crusade was envisioned as an armed [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]], and no crusader could consider his journey complete unless he had prayed as a pilgrim at the Holy Sepulchre. Crusader Prince [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who became the first [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader monarch of Jerusalem]], decided not to use [[List of kings of Jerusalem|the title &quot;king&quot;]] during his lifetime, and declared himself &quot;Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri&quot; (&quot;Protector [or Defender] of the Holy Sepulchre&quot;). By the crusader period, a [[cistern]] under the former basilica was rumoured to have been where Helena found the True Cross, and began to be venerated as such; the cistern later became the &quot;Chapel of the Invention of the Cross&quot;, but there is no evidence of the rumour before the 11th century, and modern archaeological investigation has now dated the cistern to 11th-century repairs by Monomachos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbo&quot;/&gt;

According to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, the keys of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in hands of the &quot;ancient [[Georgians]]&quot; and the food, alms, candles and oil for lamps were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.&lt;ref&gt;''Venetian Adventurer: The Life and Times of Marco Polo,'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William of Tyre]], chronicler of the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], reports on the renovation of the Church in the mid-12th century. The crusaders investigated the eastern ruins on the site, occasionally excavating through the rubble, and while attempting to reach the cistern, they discovered part of the original ground level of Hadrian's temple enclosure; they transformed this space into a chapel dedicated to Helena (the [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]]), widening their original excavation tunnel into a proper staircase. The crusaders began to refurnish the church in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style and added a bell tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage37&quot;&gt;''Pilgrimages and Pilgrim shrines in Palestine and Syria after 1095'', Henry L. Savage, ''A History of the Crusades: The Art and Architecture of the Crusader States'', Volume IV, ed. Kenneth M. Setton and Harry W. Hazard, (University of Wisconsin Press, 1977), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; These renovations unified the small chapels on the site and were completed during the reign of [[Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] in 1149, placing all the Holy places under one roof for the first time. The church became the seat of the first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Latin Patriarchs]] and the site of the kingdom's [[scriptorium]]. It was lost to [[Saladin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage37&quot; /&gt; along with the rest of the city, in 1187, although the treaty established after the [[Third Crusade]] allowed Christian pilgrims to visit the site. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] (r. 1220–50) regained the city and the church by treaty in the 13th century while under a ban of excommunication, with the curious consequence that the holiest church in Christianity was laid under [[interdict]]. The church seems to have been largely in Greek Orthodox Patriarch [[Athanasius II of Jerusalem]]'s hands, c.&amp;nbsp;1231–47, during the Latin control of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pringle| first=Denys| title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 3, The City of Jerusalem: A Corpus| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0jH6VPi4-gC&amp;pg=PA31| year=1993| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-39038-5| pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both city and church were captured by the [[Khwarezm]]ians in 1244.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage37&quot; /&gt;

===Ottoman and later periods===
In 1545, the upper level of the church's [[#Bell tower|bell tower]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=custodia/&gt; 
The [[Franciscan]] friars renovated the church in 1555, as it had been neglected despite increased numbers of pilgrims. The Franciscans rebuilt the ''[[Aedicule]]'' ('small building'), extending the structure to create an antechamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy56&quot;/&gt; A marble shrine commissioned by Friar [[Boniface of Ragusa]] was placed to envelop the remains of Christ's tomb,{{sfn|DK|2016|p=99}} probably to prevent pilgrims from touching the original rock or taking small pieces as souvenirs.&lt;ref name=natburial/&gt; A marble slab was placed over the limestone burial bed where Jesus's body is believed to have lain.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=99}}

After the renovation of 1555, control of the church oscillated between the Franciscans and the Orthodox, depending on which community could obtain a favorable ''[[firman (decree)|firman]]'' from the &quot;[[Sublime Porte]]&quot; at a particular time, often through outright bribery. Violent clashes were not uncommon. There was no agreement about this question, although it was discussed at the negotiations to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mailáth&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Geschichte der europäischen Staaten, Geschichte des östreichischen Kaiserstaates| url=https://books.google.com/?id=_0MJAAAAQAAJ| first=János Nepomuk Jozsef| last=Mailáth| volume=4| page=262| publisher=F. Perthes| location=Hamburg| year=1848|trans-title=History of the European states, history of Austrian Imperial State}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1767, weary of the squabbling, the &quot;Porte&quot; issued a firman that divided the church among the claimants.

A fire severely damaged the structure again in 1808,{{sfn|DK|2016|p=99}} causing the dome of the Rotunda to collapse and smashing the Aedicule's exterior decoration. The Rotunda and the Aedicule's exterior were [[:File:Floorplan of the CotHS.JPG|rebuilt in 1809–10]] by architect Nikolaos Ch. Komnenos of [[Mytilene]] in the contemporary [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Baroque]] style; the [[:File:Shrine of the Holy Sepulchre April 10th 1839.jpg|shrine around the tomb]] was also replaced.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The interior of the antechamber, now known as the Chapel of the Angel,{{efn|One of the two chapels within the shrine, a pilaster incorporates a piece of the stone said to have been rolled away from the tomb; it functions as a Greek Orthodox altar.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=99}}}} was partly rebuilt to a square ground plan in place of the previously semicircular western end.

[[File:The Dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.jpg|thumb|The dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, c.&amp;nbsp;1905]]
The cladding of red marble applied to the Aedicule by Komnenos has deteriorated badly and is detaching from the underlying structure; since 1947 it has been held in place with an exterior scaffolding of iron girders installed by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British authorities]]. A careful renovation is undergoing, funded by $4 million from [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] of [[Jordan]] and a $1.3 million from Mica Ertegun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=National Geographic| title=Exclusive: Christ's Burial Place Exposed for First Time in Centuries| url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-tomb-opened-church-holy-sepulchre/|  first=Kristin| last=Romey| accessdate=30 October 2016| date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parvis (courtyard)===
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Easter time. matpc.06563.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the Parvis during Easter in 1898 (with the [[immovable ladder]] visible in the top center and the Chapel of the Franks on the right)]]
[[File:Church of the Holy Sepulchre by Félix Bonfils.jpg|thumb|Tourists and pilgrims at one of the two access gates to the Holy Sepulchre courtyard, photo by [[Bonfils]], 1870s]]
The courtyard facing the entrance to the church is known as the [[parvis]]. Located around the parvis are a few smaller structures.

South of the parvis, opposite the church:
* Broken columns—once forming part of an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]—stand opposite the church, at the top of a short descending staircase stretching over the entire breadth of the parvis. In the 13th century, the tops of the columns were removed and sent to Mecca by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmids]].
* The Gethsemane [[Metochion]], a small Greek Orthodox monastery.

On the eastern side of the parvis, south to north:
* The Monastery of St Abraham (Greek Orthodox)
* The Chapel of St John (Armenian Orthodox)
* The Chapel of St Michael (Coptic/[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]]), giving access to the roof of the Chapel of St Helena and the Ethiopian monastery there.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=97}}
North of the parvis, in front of the church façade or against it:
* Chapel of the Franks—a blue-domed [[Roman Catholic]] Crusader chapel dedicated to [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], which once provided exclusive access to Calvary. The chapel marks the 10th Station of the Cross (the stripping of Jesus' garments).
* A [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] and chapel, directly beneath the Chapel of the Franks, dedicated to St. [[Mary of Egypt]].
* The tomb of [[Philip d'Aubigny]] (Phillipe Daubeney, d. 1236)—a knight, tutor, and royal councilor to [[King Henry III of England]] and signer of the [[Magna Carta]]—is placed in front of, and between, the church's two original entrance doors, of which the eastern one is walled up. It is one of the few tombs of crusaders and other Europeans not removed from the Church after the Muslim recapture of Jerusalem in the 12th century. A stone marker was placed on his tomb in 1925, sheltered by a wooden trapdoor that hides it from view.

A group of three chapels borders the parvis on its west side. They originally formed the [[baptistery]] complex of the Constantinian church. The southernmost chapel was the vestibule, the middle chapel the baptistery, and the north chapel the chamber in which the patriarch [[chrism]]ated the newly baptized before leading them into the rotunda north of this complex. Now they are dedicated as (from south to north)
* The Chapel of [[St. James the Just]] (Greek Orthodox),
* The Chapel of [[St. John the Baptist]] (Greek Orthodox),
* The Chapel of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]] (Greek Orthodox; at the base of the bell tower).

===Bell tower===
The 12th-century Crusader [[bell tower]] is just south of the Rotunda, to the left of the entrance.{{sfn|DK|2016|pp=94–97}} Its upper level was lost in a 1545 collapse.&lt;ref name=custodia&gt;{{cite web| title=Parvis and Entry| url=http://www.sepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4100| publisher=Gerusalemme San Salvatore Convento Francescano St. Saviour's Monastery| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701173025/http://www.sepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4100|archivedate=1 July 2012|accessdate=8 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1719, another two storeys were lost.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=97}}

===Calvary (Golgotha)===
{{main|Calvary}}
[[File:Golgota, chrám Božího hrobu, Jeruzalém.jpg|thumb|The Altar of the Crucifixion, where the rock of Calvary is encased in protective glass]]
Just inside the church entrance is a stairway leading up to [[Calvary]] (Golgotha), traditionally regarded as the site of Jesus' crucifixion{{sfn|DK|2016|p=98}} and the most lavishly decorated part of the church. The exit is via another stairway opposite the first, leading down to the [[ambulatory]]. Golgotha and its chapels are just south of the main altar of the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]].

Calvary is split into two chapels, one Greek Orthodox and one Catholic, each with its own altar. On the left (north) side, the Greek Orthodox chapel's altar is placed over the rock of Calvary (the 12th Station of the Cross), which can be touched through a hole in the floor beneath the altar.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=98}} The rock can be seen under protective glass on both sides of the altar. The softer surrounding stone was removed when the church was built.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=98}} The Roman Catholic ([[Franciscan]]) Chapel of the Nailing of the Cross (11th Station of the Cross) stretches to the south. Between the Catholic and the Orthodox altar, a statue of Mary with an 18th-century bust marks the 13th Station of the Cross.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=98}}

On the ground floor, just underneath the Golgotha chapel, is the Chapel of Adam.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=98}} According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=98}} According to some, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill Adam's skull.&lt;ref&gt;William R.

Behind the Chapel of Adam is the Museum of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which holds many relics, including a 12th-century crystal [[mitre]] alleged to have once held a fragment of the Holy Cross.{{sfn|DK|2016|p=104}}

Just inside the entrance to the church is the Stone of Anointing (also Stone of the Anointing or Stone of Unction), which tradition believes to be where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by [[Joseph of Arimathea]], though this tradition is only attested since the crusader era (notably by the Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] pilgrim [[Riccoldo da Monte di Croce]] in 1288), and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy56&quot;/&gt;

The wall behind the stone is defined by its striking blue balconies and [[tau cross]]-bearing red banners (depicting the insignia of the [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]]), and is decorated with lamps. The modern three-part mosaic along the wall depicts the anointing of Jesus' body, preceded on the right by the [[Descent from the Cross]], and succeeded on the left by the [[Burial of Jesus]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The wall was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; it blocks the view of the rotunda, separates the entrance from the Catholicon, sits on top of the now empty and desecrated graves of four 12th-century crusader kings—including [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]]—and is no longer structurally necessary. Opinions differ as to whether it is to be seen as [[Stations of the Cross|the 13th Station of the Cross]], which others identify as the [[Descent from the Cross|lowering of Jesus from the cross]] and located between the 11th and 12th stations on Calvary.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, [[Copts]], Greeks and [[Western Christianity|Latins]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Immediately to the left of the entrance is a bench that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring. To the right of the entrance is a wall along the ambulatory containing the staircase leading to Golgotha. Further along the same wall is the entrance to the Chapel of Adam.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Rotunda and Aedicule===
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] is the building of the larger dome located on the far west side.{{sfn|DK|2016|pp=94–97}} In the centre of the rotunda is a small chapel called the ''Kouvouklion'' in Greek{{efn|Kουβούκλιον; Modern Greek for small compartment}} or the ''[[Aedicula]]'' in Latin,{{efn|name=edicule|English ''aedicule'' or ''edicule'', the Latin diminutive of ''aedes'', &quot;house&quot;, meaning &quot;small house&quot; or &quot;shrine&quot;}} which encloses the Holy Sepulchre. The Aedicule has two rooms, the first holding the Angel's Stone, which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second is the tomb of Jesus. Possibly due to the fact that pilgrims laid their hands on the tomb or to prevent eager pilgrims from removing bits of the original rock as souvenirs, a marble plaque was placed in the fourteenth century on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb.&lt;ref name=natburial&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/jesus-christ-tomb-burial-church-holy-sepulchre/|title=Jesus' Burial Tomb Uncovered: Here's What Scientists Saw Inside|date=31 October 2016|last=Romey|first=Kristin|work=National Geographic|access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[#Status Quo|Status Quo]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] Churches all have rights to the interior of the tomb, and all three communities celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] or [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]] there daily. It is also used for other ceremonies on special occasions, such as the [[Holy Saturday]] ceremony of the [[Holy Fire]] led by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch (with the participation of the Coptic and Armenian patriarchs).&lt;ref name=holyfire&gt;{{cite web| title=Miracle of Holy Fire which happens every year| url=http://www.holyfire.org/eng/index.htm| work=Holyfire.org| accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To its rear, in a chapel constructed of iron [[latticework]], lies the altar used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.churchoftheholysepulchre.com/single-post/2017/01/31/Coptic-Chapel| title=Coptic Chapel| date=15 December 2016| website=Church of the Holy Sepulchre| accessdate=24 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the [[Georgian Orthodox|Georgians]] also retained the key to the Aedicule.&lt;ref name=Janin&gt;{{cite book| last=Janin| first=Raymond| year=1913| page=35| url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mu4MAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=35| title=Échos d'Orient| volume=16| publisher=Institut français d'études byzantines|trans-title=Echos of the Orient}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Desandoli&gt;{{cite book| last=DeSandoli| first=Sabino| title=The Church of Holy Sepulchre: Keys, Doors, Doorkeepers| year=1986| publisher=Franciscian Press| page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Brief Description of the Holy Sepulchre Jerusalem and Other Christian Churches in the Holy City: With Some Account of the Medieval Copies of the Holy Sepulchre Surviving in Europe| url=https://www.amazon.com/description-Sepulchre-Jerusalem-Christian-mediaeval-ebook/dp/B00KVNHI6A| first=George| last=Jeffery| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1919| page=69| accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2016 to March 2017, the Aedicule underwent restoration and repairs after the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] declared the structure unsafe. Much of the $4 million project was funded by the [[World Monuments Fund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2017restoration&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last1=Goldman| first1=Russell| title=Tomb of Jesus Reopens to Public After $3 Million Restoration| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/world/middleeast/tomb-of-jesus-reopens-jerusalem.html| newspaper=The New York Times| date=22 March 2017| accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Abdullah II of Jordan]] also contributed a substantial sum to make the restoration possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo&quot;/&gt;

West of the Aedicule, to the rear of the Rotunda, is the [[#Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea|Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea]], located in a Constantinian apse and containing an opening to an ancient Jewish rock-cut tomb. This chapel is where the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] celebrate their Liturgy on Sundays.

===Catholicon===
In the central nave of the Crusader-era church, just east of the larger rotunda,{{sfn|DK|2016|pp=94–97}} is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox ''[[Katholikon|catholicon]]''. Its dome is {{convert|19.8|m|ft}} in diameter,&lt;ref name=cruise/&gt; and sits directly over the centre of the [[crossing (architecture)|transept crossing]] of the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] where the ''compas'', an [[omphalos]] once thought to be the center of the world (associated with the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros&amp;nbsp;I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.&lt;ref name=hammers&gt;{{cite web| title=The Cross of Golgotha| url=http://www.michaelhammers.com/en/projects/golgotha-cross-holy-sepulcher-jerusalem| publisher=Michael Hammers| date=24 June 2014| accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East of this is a large [[iconostasis]] demarcating the Orthodox sanctuary before which is set the throne of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] on the south side facing the throne of the Greek Orthodox [[Patriarch of Antioch]] on the north side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Bedlam.

===Ambulatory===
The chapels in the ambulatory are, from north to south: the Prison of Christ, the Greek Chapel of [[Saint Longinus]], the Armenian Chapel of Division of Robes, the entrance to the [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]], and the Greek Chapel of the Derision.

====Prison of Christ====
In the northeast side of the complex there is the Prison of Christ, alleged by the Franciscans to be where Jesus was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusholyland.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:chapel-of-saint-helena&amp;catid=17:churches-of-jerusalem|title=Chapel of Saint Helena|website=Holyland|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315032324/http://www.jesusholyland.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=56:chapel-of-saint-helena&amp;catid=17:churches-of-jerusalem|archivedate=15 March 2012|accessdate=3 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek Orthodox]] allege that the real place that Jesus was held was the similarly named Prison of Christ in their Monastery of the Praetorium, located near the [[Convent of the Sisters of Zion|Church of Ecce Homo]] between the Second and Third Stations of the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The Armenians regard a recess in the Monastery of the Flagellation at the Second Station of the Via Dolorosa as the Prison of Christ. A cistern among the ruins beneath the [[Church of St. Peter in Gallicantu]] on Mount Zion is also alleged to have been the Prison of Christ. To reconcile the traditions, some allege that Jesus was held in the Mount Zion cell in connection with his trial by the Jewish [[High Priest]], at the Praetorium in connection with his trial by the Roman governor Pilate, and near the Golgotha before crucifixion.

===Chapel of Saint Helena===
* [[Chapel of Saint Helena, Jerusalem|Chapel of Saint Helena]] – between the Chapel of Division of Robes and the Greek Chapel of the Derision are stairs descending to the Chapel of Saint Helena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldhill|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Goldhill|title=Jerusalem, City of Longing|year=2009|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoLEULaZHzAC&amp;pg=PA35|isbn=9780674034686}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapel of Vartan (or Vardan) Mamikonian – on the north side of the Chapel of Saint Helena is an ornate [[wrought iron]] door, beyond which a raised artificial platform affords views of the [[quarry]], and which leads to the Chapel of [[St. Vartan|Saint Vartan]]. The latter chapel contains archaeological remains from Hadrian's temple and Constantine's basilica. These areas are open only on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.holysepulchre.custodia.org/default.asp?id=4119|title=Chapel of St. Helena|website=www.holysepulchre.custodia.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapel of the [[Invention of the Holy Cross]] – another set of 22 stairs from the Chapel of Saint Helena leads down to the Roman Catholic Chapel of the Invention of the Holy Cross, believed to be the place where the [[True Cross]] was found.

===Franciscan area north of the Aedicule===
* The Franciscan Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene – The chapel indicates the place where [[Mary Magdalene]] met Jesus after his resurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;fran&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Franciscans at the Holy Sepulchre|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspfran.html|publisher=The Franciscans of the Holy Land|accessdate=2 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303061849/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/jhs/TSspfran.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Franciscan Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament (or Chapel of the Apparition) – in memory of Jesus' meeting with his mother after the Resurrection.&lt;ref name=&quot;fran&quot;/&gt;

===Syriac Chapel with Tomb of Joseph of Arimathea===
The [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] Chapel of [[Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Saint Nicodemus]]. On Sundays and feast days it is furnished for the celebration of Mass.
It is accessed from the Rotunda, by a door west of the Aedicule. On the far side of the chapel is the low entrance to an almost complete 1st-century Jewish tomb, initially holding six ''[[Rock-cut tomb#Kokh|kokh]]''-type funeral shafts radiating from a central chamber, two of which are still exposed. Although this space was discovered relatively recently and contains no identifying marks, some believe that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were buried here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapel of Joseph of Arimateaitled |url=https://www.churchoftheholysepulchre.com/single-post/2017/01/31/Chapel-of-Joseph-of-Arimateaitled |website=Church of the Holy Sepulchre-Hours,History,Facts,Pictures |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since Jews always buried their dead outside the city, the presence of this tomb proves that the Holy Sepulchre site was outside the city walls at the time of the crucifixion.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cohen |first1=Raymond |title=Saving the Holy Sepulchre: How Rival Christians Came Together to Rescue their Holiest Shrine |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199719907 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=T7KmnQ65XooC&amp;pg=PA170|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Armenian monastery south of the Aedicule===
South of the Aedicule is the &quot;Place of the Three Marys&quot;, marked by a stone canopy and a large modern wall mosaic. From here one can enter the Armenian monastery which stretches over the ground and first upper floor of the church's southeastern part.

==Status Quo==
{{main|Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)}}

An Ottoman ''status quo'' decided upon in 1757 upholds the state of affairs for certain Holy Land sites, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
The ''status quo'' was upheld in Sultan [[Abdülmecid&amp;nbsp;I]]'s ''firman'' (decree) of 1852/3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ḏḥwty |title=The Immovable Ladder: Bizarre Feud Prevents Ordinary Ladder Being Moved for 3 Centuries |url=https://www.ancient-origins.net/history/immovable-ladder-bizarre-feud-prevents-ordinary-ladder-being-moved-3-centuries-009506 |website=Ancient Origins |accessdate=8 May 2019 |language=en |date=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which pinned down the now-permanent statutes of property and the regulations concerning the roles of the different denominations and other custodians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa : a historical encyclopedia|last=Michael.|first=Dumper|last2=E.|first2=Stanley, Bruce|date=1 January 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079195|oclc=80014324}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Illustration from Views in the Ottoman Dominions by Luigi Mayer, digitally enhanced by rawpixel-com 64.jpg|thumb| Church of the Holy Sepulchre, painted by [[Luigi Mayer]]]]
The primary custodians are the [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Churches, with the Greek Orthodox Church having the [[lion's share]]. In the 19th century, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] acquired lesser responsibilities, which include shrines and other structures in and around the building. Greek Orthodox act through the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]] as well as through the [[Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre]]. Roman Catholics act through the [[Franciscan]] [[Custody of the Holy Land]].

Despite occasional disagreements, religious services take place in the Church with regularity and coexistence is generally peaceful. An example of concord between the Church custodians is the full restoration of the Aedicule from 2016 to 2017.

The establishment of the modern Status Quo in 1853 did not halt controversy and occasional violence. On a hot summer day in 2002, a [[Coptic monasticism|Coptic monk]] moved his chair from its agreed spot into the shade. This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Chris|title=Christian History Corner: Divvying up the Most Sacred Place|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/julyweb-only/7-29-52.0.html|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=[[Christianity Today]]|date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident in 2004, during Orthodox celebrations of the [[Feast of the Cross|Exaltation of the Holy Cross]], a door to the Franciscan chapel was left open. This was taken as a sign of disrespect by the Orthodox and a fistfight broke out.

On [[Palm Sunday]], in April 2008, a brawl broke out when a Greek monk was ejected from the building by a rival faction.

=== 2018 Tax/Land affair ===

In February 2018, the church was closed following a tax dispute over 152 million euros of uncollected taxes on church properties. The city hall stressed that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and all other churches are exempt from the taxes, with the changes only affecting establishments like &quot;hotels, halls and businesses&quot; owned by the churches.&lt;ref name=i24&gt;{{cite news| title=Church at Jesus's burial site closed for second day after tax dispute| url=https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel/168589-180226-church-at-jesus-s-burial-site-closed-for-second-day-after-tax-dispute| date=26 February 2018| work=i24NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]] had reported that the Greek Orthodox Church calls itself the second-largest landowner in Israel, after the Israeli government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Greek Orthodox Church Sells Land in Israel, Worrying Both Israelis And Palestinians| last=Estrin| first=Daniel| url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/12/02/565464499/greek-orthodox-church-sells-land-in-israel-worrying-both-israelis-and-palestinia| date=2 December 2017| work=[[Weekend Edition]]| network=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a lock-in protest against an Israeli legislative proposal which would expropriate church lands that had been sold to private companies since 2010, a measure which church leaders assert constitutes a serious violation of their property rights and the Status Quo. In a joint official statement the church authorities protested what they considered to be the peak of a systematic campaign in:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a discriminatory and racist bill that targets solely the properties of the Christian community in the Holy Land ... This reminds us all of laws of a similar nature which were enacted against the Jews during dark periods in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lis and Nir Hasson,  [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/jerusalem-s-church-of-holy-sepulchre-closed-indefinitely-in-protest-of-israeli-bill-city-tax-policy-1.5847184 Jerusalem churches warn of Israel's 'systematic' erosion of Christian presence in Holy Land]  [[Haaretz]] 25 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stated aim of the bill is to protect homeowners against the possibility that private companies will not extend their leases of land on which their houses or apartments stand.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June 2019, a number of Christian denominations in Jerusalem raised their voice against the Supreme Court's decision to uphold the sale of three properties by the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Greek Orthodox Patriarchate]] to [[Ateret Cohanim]] – an organization that seeks to increase Jews in Jerusalem. The church leaders warned that if the organization gets the access to control the sites, Christians will lose access to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-christian-leaders-blast-decision-to-sell-jerusalem-properties-to-settler-group-1.7366340|title=Jerusalem's Christian Leaders Blast Decision to Sell Old City Properties to Settler Group|accessdate=13 June 2019|newspaper=Haaretz|date=13 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to Roman Temple==
[[File:Roman Jerusalem.PNG|thumb|Jerusalem after being rebuilt by Hadrian. Two main east-west roads were built rather than the typical one, due to the awkward location of the Temple Mount, blocking the central east-west route.]]
The site of the church [[#History|had been a temple to Jupiter or Venus]] built by Hadrian before Constantine's edifice was built. Hadrian's temple had been located there because it was the junction of the [[Cardo|main north-south road]] with one of the two [[Decumanus Maximus|main east-west roads]] and directly adjacent to the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] (now the location of the [[Muristan]], which is smaller than the former forum). The forum itself had been placed, as is traditional in Roman towns, at the junction of the main north-south road with the other main east-west road (which is now El-Bazar/David Street). The temple and forum together took up the entire space between the two main east-west roads (a few above-ground remains of the east end of the temple precinct still survive in the Alexander Nevsky Church complex of the ''Russian Mission in Exile'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.generationword.com/jerusalem101/52-holy-sepulcher.html | title= Church of the Holy Sepulcher |website= Generation Word | access-date= 31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the archaeological excavations in the 1970s, it is clear that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the ''Triportico'' and ''Rotunda'' roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least as far back as the Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbo&quot;/&gt;

Other archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. [[Dan Bahat]], the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of [[Aphrodite]] (Venus) matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;BahatBAR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first=Dan| last=Bahat| title=Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?| url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&amp;Volume=12&amp;Issue=3&amp;ArticleID=1| journal=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]| date=May–June 1986| accessdate=19 September 2014}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Holy Sepulchre by Louis Haghe.jpg|thumb|1842 lithograph based on artwork by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in ''[[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]'']]
The New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall,&lt;ref&gt;for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Jocelyn M.

An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the site of the Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It has been well documented by archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the east of the current site of the Church.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since [[Herod Agrippa]] (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The area immediately to the south and east of the sepulchre was a quarry and outside the city during the early first century as excavations under the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer across the street demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trainor|first1=Terry|title=Bedlam.

The church is a part of the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].

The Christian Quarter and the (also Christian) Armenian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem are both located in the northwestern and western part of the Old City, due to the fact that the Holy Sepulchre is located close to the northwestern corner of the walled city. The adjacent neighbourhood within the Christian Quarter is called the [[Muristan]], a term derived from the Persian word for hospital—Christian pilgrim hospices have been maintained in this area near the Holy Sepulchre since at least the time of [[Charlemagne]].

Several churches and monasteries in Europe, for instance, in Germany and Russia, and at least one church in the United States have been modeled on the Church of the Resurrection, some even reproducing other [[holy places]] for the benefit of pilgrims who could not travel to the Holy Land. They include the [[:de:Heiliges Grab (Görlitz)|Heiliges Grab]] of [[Görlitz]], constructed between 1481 and 1504, the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] in [[Moscow Oblast]], constructed by [[Patriarch Nikon]] between 1656 and 1666, and [[Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery]] built by the [[Franciscans]] in Washington, DC in 1898.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}
