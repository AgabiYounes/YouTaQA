'''David Wark Griffith''' (January 22, 1875 – July 23, 1948) was an American film director. Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation, he pioneered the feature-length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques, such as the [[close-up]].

His film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) broke box-office records but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted [[African Americans]] in a negative light and glorified the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffith's later films were also successful, including ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920), and ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature, ''[[The Struggle (1931 film)|The Struggle]]'' (1931).

Together with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], he founded [[United Artists]], enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. Griffith was a founder member of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].

== Early life ==
[[File:GriffithDW.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Griffith, {{circa|1907}}]]

Griffith was born on a farm in [[Oldham County, Kentucky]], the son of Jacob Wark &quot;Roaring Jake&quot; Griffith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gildasattic.com/dwgriffith.html |title=D.W. Griffith (1875–1948) |publisher= |accessdate=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] colonel in the [[American Civil War]] who was elected as a Kentucky state legislator and Mary Perkins (''née'' Oglesby). Griffith was raised a [[Methodist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blizek |first1=William L. |title=The Continuum Companion to Religion and Film |date=2009 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-0-8264-9991-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he attended a one-room schoolhouse where he was taught by his older sister Mattie. His father died when he was ten, and the family struggled with poverty.

When Griffith was 14, his mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; there she opened a boarding house, which failed shortly afterward. Griffith then left high school to help support the family, taking a job in a dry goods store and later in a bookstore. He began his creative career as an actor in touring companies. Meanwhile, he was learning how to become a playwright, but had little success—only one of his plays was accepted for a performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWPlay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAgriffith.htm |title=D.W.

== Film career ==
[[File:Walthall with DW Griiffith2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Griffith on the set of ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) with actor [[Henry B. Walthall]] and others]]

In 1908, Griffith accepted a role as a stage extra in ''Professional Jealousy'' for the American Mutoscope and [[Biograph Company]], where he met cameraman [[Billy Bitzer]], and his career in the film industry changed forever.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Griffith,_D.W./Biography/ |title=D.W. Griffith Biography |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=July 23, 1948 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Biograph's main director [[Wallace McCutcheon, Sr.]] grew ill, and his son Wallace McCutcheon, Jr. took his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/mccutcheon.htm |title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=Victorian-cinema.net |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCutcheon, Jr. did not bring the studio success;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Biograph co-founder Harry Marvin gave Griffith the position,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; and he made the short ''[[The Adventures of Dollie]]''. He directed a total of 48 shorts for the company that year.

His short ''[[In Old California (1910 film)|In Old California]]'' (1910) was the first film shot in [[Hollywood, California]]. Four years later, he produced and directed his first feature film ''[[Judith of Bethulia]]'' (1914), one of the earliest to be produced in the US. Biograph believed that longer features were not viable at that point. According to [[Lillian Gish]], the company thought that &quot;a movie that long would hurt [the audience's] eyes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirsner |first1=Scott |title=Inventing the movies : Hollywood's epic battle between innovation and the status quo, from Thomas Edison to Steve Jobs |date=2008 |publisher=CinemaTech Books |location=[s.l.] |isbn=978-1-4382-0999-9 |page=13 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith left Biograph because of company resistance to his goals and his cost overruns on the film. He took his company of actors with him and joined the [[Mutual Film Corporation]]. There, he co-produced [[The Life of General Villa]], a [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Action (genre)|action]]–[[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] starring [[Pancho Villa]] as himself, shot on location in México during a civil war. He formed a studio with Majestic Studio manager Harry Aitken&lt;ref name=&quot;Aitken&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cobbles.com/simpp_archive/dwgriffith.htm |title=D.W.

The Triangle Film Corporation was headed by Aitken, who was released from the Mutual Film Corporation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aitken&quot; /&gt; and his brother Roy.

[[File:Birth of a Nation (1915).webm|thumb|upright=1|''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), perhaps the most famous silent movie directed by Griffith and considered a landmark by film historians; adapted for the screen by Griffith and [[Frank E. Woods]], based on the novel and play ''[[The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan]]'' by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]]]]

Griffith directed and produced ''The Clansman'' through Reliance-Majestic Studios in 1915, which became known as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and is considered one of the first [[feature length]] American films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&amp;db_id=4&amp;item_id=27 MJ Movie Reviews – Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707194449/http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&amp;db_id=4&amp;item_id=27 |date=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a success, but it aroused much controversy due to its depiction of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and [[race relations]] in the [[American Civil War]] and the [[reconstruction era of the United States]]. It was based on [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]]'s 1905 novel ''[[The Clansman]]''; it depicts Southern slavery as benign, the enfranchisement of [[freedmen]] as a corrupt plot by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and the Ku Klux Klan as a band of heroes restoring the rightful order. This view of the era was popular at the time and was endorsed for decades by historians of the [[Dunning School]], although it met with strong criticism from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-birth-of-a-nation-when-hollywood-glorified-the-kkk.htm |title='The Birth of a Nation': When Hollywood Glorified the KKK {{!}} HistoryNet |website=HistoryNet |language=en-US |access-date=February 27, 2016 |date=June 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jul/29/birth-of-a-nation-dw-griffith-masterpiece |title=The Birth of a Nation: a gripping masterpiece … and a stain on history |last=Brooks |first=Xan |date=July 29, 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAACP attempted to stop showings of the film. This was successful in some cities, but nonetheless it was shown widely and became the most successful box office attraction of its time. It is considered among the first &quot;blockbuster&quot; motion pictures, and broke all box office records that had been established until then. &quot;They lost track of the money it made&quot;, Lillian Gish remarked in a [[Kevin Brownlow]] interview.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Audiences in some major northern cities rioted over the film's racial content, which was filled with action and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/jimcrow/stories_events_birth.html |title=The Rise and Fall of Jim Crow .

''Intolerance'' was not a financial success, although it had good box office turn-outs; it did not bring in enough profits to cover the lavish road show that accompanied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/7_dwg_2.htm |title=&quot;Griffith's 20 Year Record&quot;, ''Variety'' (September 25, 1928), as edited by David Pierce for ''The Silent Film Bookshelf,'' on line |publisher=Cinemaweb.com |date=September 5, 1928 |accessdate=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712184505/http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/7_dwg_2.htm |archivedate=July 12, 2011 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith put a huge budget into the film's production which could not be recovered in its box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/film.nsf/reviews/intolerance |title= Intolerance Movie Review |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=May 29, 2011 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He mostly financed ''Intolerance'' himself, contributing to his financial ruin for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sadoul&quot;&gt;Georges Sadoul (1972 [1965]).

Griffith's production partnership was dissolved in 1917 and he went to Artcraft, part of [[Paramount Pictures]], and then to [[First National Pictures]] (1919–1920). At the same time, he founded [[United Artists]] together with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]]; the studio was premised on allowing actors to control their own interests, rather than being dependent upon commercial studios.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |title=David W.

He continued to make films, but he never achieved box office grosses as high as either ''The Birth of a Nation'' or ''Intolerance.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/database/griffith_d.html |title=American Masters . D.W. Griffith |publisher=PBS |date=December 29, 1998 |accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later film career ==
Though [[United Artists]] survived as a company, Griffith's association with it was short-lived. While some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him. Griffith features from this period include ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920), ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921), ''[[Dream Street (film)|Dream Street]]'' (1921), ''[[One Exciting Night]]'' (1922) and ''[[America (1924 film)|America]]'' (1924). Of these, the first three were successes at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Last Dissolve|date=August 2, 1948|work=Time Magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888442,00.html|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith was forced to leave United Artists after ''[[Isn't Life Wonderful]]'' (1924) failed at the box office.

[[File:United Artists contract signature 1919.jpg|thumb|let|upright=1.2|[[United Artists]] founders, Griffith, [[Mary Pickford|Pickford]], [[Charles Chaplin|Chaplin]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks|Fairbanks]] sign their contract for the cameras, 1919.]]

He made a part-talkie, ''[[Lady of the Pavements]]'' (1929), and only two full-sound films, ''[[Abraham Lincoln (1930 film)|Abraham Lincoln]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Struggle (1931 film)|The Struggle]]'' (1931). Neither was successful, and after ''The Struggle'' he never made another film.

In 1936, director [[Woody Van Dyke]], who had worked as Griffith's apprentice on ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', asked Griffith to help him shoot the famous earthquake sequence for ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', but did not give him any film credit. Starring [[Clark Gable]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] and [[Spencer Tracy]], it was the top-grossing film of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biggest Box Office Hits of 1936|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/biggest-box-office-hits-of-1936/|website=Ultimate movie rankings|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the producer [[Hal Roach]] hired Griffith to produce ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939) and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940). He wrote to Griffith: &quot;I need help from the production side to select the proper writers, cast, etc. and to help me generally in the supervision of these pictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Lewis Ward, ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'', p. 109-110. Southern Illinois University, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8093-2637-X}}. In his [[Biograph Company|Biograph]] days, Griffith had directed two films with prehistoric settings: ''Man's Genesis'' (1912) and ''[[Brute Force (1914 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1914).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Griffith eventually disagreed with Roach over the production and parted, Roach later insisted that some of the scenes in the completed film were directed by Griffith. This would make the film the final production in which Griffith was actively involved. However, cast members' accounts recall Griffith directing only the [[screen test]]s and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, Griffith asked that his name be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mostly forgotten by movie-goers of the time, Griffith was held in awe by many in the film industry. In the mid-1930s, he was given a special Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1946, he made an impromptu visit to the film location of [[David O. Selznick]]'s epic western ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', where some of his veteran actors, [[Lillian Gish]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], were cast members. Gish and Barrymore found their old mentor's presence distracting and became self-conscious. While the two were filming their scenes, Griffith hid behind set scenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Paul|title=Jennifer Jones: The Life and Films|date=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8583-3|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
On the morning of July 23, 1948, Griffith was discovered unconscious in the lobby at the [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, where he had been living alone. He died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] at 3:42 PM on the way to a Hollywood hospital.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; A public memorial service was held in his honor at the [[Hollywood Masonic Temple]], but few stars came to pay their last respects. He is buried at Mount Tabor Methodist Church Graveyard in [[Centerfield, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schickel|first1=Richard|title=D.W.

Griffith seems to have been the first to understand how certain film techniques could be used to create an expressive language; it gained popular recognition with the release of his ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). His early shorts—such as Biograph's ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' (1912), the first &quot;gangster film&quot;—show that Griffith's attention to camera placement and lighting heightened mood and tension. In making ''Intolerance'', the director opened up new possibilities for the medium, creating a form that seems to owe more to music than to traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
