Barrymore's first name, Drew, was the [[maiden name]] of her paternal great-grandmother Georgie Drew, and her middle name, Blythe, was the [[surname]] of the family first used by her great-grandfather Maurice Barrymore.&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot;/&gt; In her 1991 autobiography ''Little Girl Lost'', Barrymore recounted early memories of her abusive father, who left the family when Barrymore was 6 months old. She and her father never had anything resembling a significant relationship and seldom spoke to each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Newsmakers, The People Behind Today's Headlines|last=Collins|first=Louise Mooney|last2=Speace|first2=Geri J.|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|year=1995|isbn=0-8103-5745-3|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Barrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] until the age of 7, when she moved to [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles|Sherman Oaks]]. In her 2015 memoir, ''Wildflower'', she says she talks &quot;like a [[valley girl]]&quot; because she grew up in Sherman Oaks. She moved back to [[West Hollywood]] upon becoming [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated]] at 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrymore|2015|pages=2; 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrymore attended elementary school at Fountain Day School in West Hollywood and [[Country School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barrymore|2015|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was a regular at the racy [[Studio 54]] as a young girl, and her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was placed in [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] at the age of 13,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot;/&gt; and spent 18 months in an institution for the mentally ill.&lt;ref name=GuardianBoohoo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/oct/25/drew-barrymore-mother-locked-up-in-institution-interview|title=Drew Barrymore: 'My mother locked me up in an institution at 13. Boo hoo! I needed it'|first=Simon|last= Hattenstone|work=theguardian.com|date=25 October 2015|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A suicide attempt at 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer [[David Crosby]] and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she &quot;needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety.&quot; Barrymore later described this period of her life in her autobiography, ''Little Girl Lost.'' After a successful [[juvenile court]] petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment at the age of 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;People-Bio&quot;/&gt;

==Career==

===1980s===

Barrymore's professional career began at 11 months, when she auditioned for a dog food commercial. She was nipped by her canine co-star, to which she merely laughed and was hired for the job. After her film debut with a small role in ''[[Altered States]]'' (1980),&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot;/&gt; she played Gertie in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. He felt that she had the right imagination for her role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial: The 20th Anniversary Celebration|medium=DVD|publisher=Universal, directed by Laurent Bouzereau|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''E.T.'' is the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] of the 1980s and made her one of the most famous child actors of the time. For her work, she won a [[Young Artist Award]] for [[4th Youth in Film Awards#Best Young Performer in a Feature Film|Best Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ActorsStudio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Young Artist Awards 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms4.htm |title=4th Annual Youth in Film Awards |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |work=YoungArtistAwards.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310011550/http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms4.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1984 horror film adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s [[Firestarter (novel)|1980 novel]] ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]],'' Barrymore played a girl with [[pyrokinesis]] who becomes the target of a secret government agency known as [[The Shop (Stephen King)|The Shop]].

Barrymore endured a troubled youth and continued to act intermittently during the decade. She starred in the 1985 anthology horror film ''[[Cat's Eye (1985 film)|Cat's Eye]],'' also written by Stephen King. The film received positive reviews and Barrymore was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cats_eye/|title= Cat's Eye|website= Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She starred alongside [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[Alice Krige]] in the 1989 romantic comedy ''[[See You in the Morning (film)|See You in the Morning]].'' [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the &quot;fashionable phoniness&quot; of the film, but positively singled out Barrymore for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE4DA173EF932A15757C0A96F948260|date=21 April 1989|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=&quot;Review/Film; The Jumbling of Households in 'See You'&quot;|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her twelve-day rehab treatment at ASAP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-the-secret-drew-barrymore-vol-31-no-2/|title=The Secret Drew Barrymore|magazine=People|last=Gold|first=Todd|date=16 January 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrymore starred in ''[[Far from Home (1989 film)|Far from Home]]'' (1989) as a teenager who gets stranded with her father in the small town in a remote part of the desert. The film went largely unnoticed by audiences and received negative reviews from critics, who dismissed the sexual portrayal of her role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scoopy.com/farfromhome.htm|publisher=Scoopy.net|last1=Scoopy|first1=Uncle|last2=Wroblewski|first2=Greg|title=Far From Home (1989) from Tuna and Johnny Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Barrymore's rebelliousness played itself out on screen and in print. She forged an image as a manipulative teenage seductress, beginning with ''[[Poison Ivy (1992 film)|Poison Ivy]]'' (1992), which was a box office failure, but was popular on video and [[Cable television|cable]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hello-Profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310405,00.html|title=Poison Ivy Review|accessdate=July 25, 2008|date=May 8, 1992|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her character &quot;Ivy&quot; was ranked at #6 on the list of the top 26 &quot;bad girls&quot; of all time by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/gallery/lethal-ladies-26-best-big-screen-bad-girls/#5|title=Lethal Ladies: 26 Best Big-Screen Bad Girls|publisher=ew.com|date=22 April 2008|last=Bernardin|first=Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Barrymore was 17 when she posed nude with her then-fiancé, actor [[Jamie Walters (American entertainer)|Jamie Walters]], for the cover of the July issue of ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine; she also appeared nude in pictures inside the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Bronwen|last=Hruska|title=Summer Sneaks Drew, We Hardly Knew Ye The littlest Barrymore finally seems back on track in solid film roles.

In the 1992 crime thriller ''[[Guncrazy]]'', Barrymore starred as a teenager who kills her sexually abusive stepfather after he teaches her how to use a gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;gg&quot;/&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' remarked that she &quot;pulls off impressively&quot; her character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/reviews/guncrazy-2-1200429667/|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=19 May 1992|magazine=Variety|title=Review: 'Guncrazy'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Barrymore was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for her performance. In 1993, she took on the role of the younger sister of a murdered ballerina in ''[[No Place to Hide (1993 film)|No Place to Hide]]'' and starred as a writer followed by what is apparently her evil twin in ''[[Doppelganger (1993 film)|Doppelganger]]''. Both thrillers were panned by critics and failed to find an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/noplacetohiderharrington_a0ab68.htm|title=
