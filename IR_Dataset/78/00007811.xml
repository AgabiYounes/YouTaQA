'''Cernunnos''' is the conventional name given in [[Celtic studies]] to depictions of the &quot;[[Horned God|horned god]]&quot; of [[Celtic polytheism]]. Over 50 examples of his imagery have been found from the [[Gallo-Roman]] period, mostly in north-eastern [[Gaul]] as well as among the [[Celtiberians]]. Cernunnos is depicted with antlers, seated cross-legged, and is associated with [[stag]]s, [[horned serpent]]s, [[dog]]s, [[bull]]s, and [[rat]]s.  He is usually holding or wearing a [[torc]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda, ''Celtic Art, Reading the Messages'', p. 147, 1996, The Everyman Art Library, {{ISBN|0-297-83365-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of surviving literature, details about his name, his followers, or his significance in Celtic religion are unknown. Interpretations of his role vary from seeing him as a god of animals, nature and fertility to a god of travel, commerce and bi-directionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Miranda |title=Animals in Celtic Life and Myth |pages=227–8 |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge}} https://ceisiwrserith.com/therest/Cernunnos/cernunnospaper.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and etymology==
[[File:Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|Cernunnos on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], from the [[Musée national du Moyen Âge]] (Museum of the Middle Ages), in [[Paris]], [[France]].]]
The name ''[C]ernunnos'' only appears on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]] (''Pilier des nautes''), a [[Gallo-Roman]] monument dating to the early 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''Celtic Culture'', p. 396 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=Cernunnos+inauthor:Koch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cj7ETMaaO8yRnwfE6dz1CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cernunnos%20inauthor%3AKoch&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Proto-Celtic]] form of the theonym is reconstructed as either *''Cerno-on-os''{{dubious|date=October 2010}} or *''Carno-on-os''. The [[augmentative]] ''-on-'' is characteristic of theonyms, as in [[Maponos]], [[Epona]], [[Matronae]], and [[Sirona]].&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, citing M. Lejeune, ''Lepontica'' (Paris 1971), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;
Maier (2010) states that the etymology of ''Cernunnos'' is unclear, but seems to be rooted in the Celtic word for &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;antler&quot; (as in ''Carnonos'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Maier&quot;&gt;Bernard Maier, ''Dictionary of Celtic Religion and Culture'' (Alfred Kröner, 1994; Boydell, 2000), p. 69 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7AvdTqwucfwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22the+etymology+of+whose+name+is+unclear%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2E3ETPjlFcWOnwfrmpHZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20etymology%20of%20whose%20name%20is%20unclear%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gaulish word ''karnon'' &quot;horn&quot; is cognate with Latin ''cornu'' and Germanic ''*hurnaz'', English ''[[:wikt:horn|horn]]'', ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''{{PIE|[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ḱerh₂-|*k̑r̥no-]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pokorny (1959)]] &quot;k̑er-, k̑erə-; k̑rā-, k̑erei-, k̑ereu&quot;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/ielex/X/P0929.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymon ''karn-'' &quot;horn&quot; appears in both [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Galatian language|Galatian]] branches of [[Continental Celtic]]. [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] glosses the Galatian word ''karnon'' (κάρνον) as &quot;Gallic trumpet&quot;, that is, the Celtic military horn listed as the [[carnyx]] (κάρνυξ) by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], who notes the instrument's animal-shaped bell.&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre; Greek text and English translation of the passage from Eustathius' [[Homeric epics|Homeric]] [[commentary (philology)|commentaries]] given by Edward Wigan, &quot;Account of a Collection of Roman Gold Coins,&quot; ''Numismatic Chronicle'' 5 (1865), p. 11 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VwUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=carnyx+Eustathius&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yEPDTMPmA4SfnAf__a3UCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=carnyx%20Eustathius&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The root also appears in the names of [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic polities]], most prominent among them the [[Carnutes]], meaning something like &quot;the Horned Ones,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Also ''[[Carni]]'' and ''[[Carnonacae]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in several [[personal name]]s found in inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Such as ''Carnarus, Carnatus, Carneolus, Carnius'' and ''Carnicus''; Altay Coşkun with Jürgen Zeidler, &quot;'Cover Names' and Nomenclature in Late Roman Gaul: The Evidence of the Bordelaise Poet Ausonius&quot; (2003), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name has also been compared to a divine epithet ''Carnonos'' in a Celtic inscription written in [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]] at [[Montagnac, Hérault|Montagnac]], [[Hérault]] (as καρνονου, ''karnonou'', in the [[dative case]]).&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Vulgar Latin|Gallo-Latin]] [[adjective]] ''carnuātus'', &quot;horned,&quot; is also found.&lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to Latin ''cornutus'', &quot;horned&quot;; Delamarre, citing J. Vendryes, ''Revue Celtique'' 42 (1925) 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraphic evidence==
The [[Pillar of the Boatmen]] (''Pilier des nautes'') monument was probably constructed by Gaulish sailors in 14 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the inscription (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' XIII. 03026), on the accession of the [[Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Tiberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in 1710 within the foundations of the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris]], site of ancient [[Lutetia]], the ''[[civitas]]'' [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]]. It is now displayed in the [[Musée National du Moyen Age]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A. Kingsley Porter 1934 p. 227&quot;&gt;A. Kingsley Porter, &quot;A Sculpture at Tandragee,&quot; ''Burlington Magazine'' 65 (1934), p. 227, pointing out the relative maturation of the antlers.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The distinctive stone pillar is an important monument of [[Gallo-Roman religion]]. Its [[low relief]]s depict and label by name several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman deities]] such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], and [[Castor (mythology)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (mythology)|Pollux]], along with Gallic deities such as [[Esus]], [[Smertrios]], and [[Tarvos Trigaranus]]. The name ''Cernunnos'' can be read clearly on 18th century drawings of the inscriptions, but the initial letter has been obscured since, so that today only a reading ''[_]ernunnos'' can be verified.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Fray Bober, ''Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity'',
American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 55, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 13-51
https://www.jstor.org/stable/501179&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional evidence is given by one inscription on a metal plaque from [[Steinsel-Rëlent]] in [[Luxembourg]], in the territory of the Celtic [[Treveri]]. This inscription&lt;ref&gt;AE 1987, 0772 = AE 1989, 00542.&lt;/ref&gt; read ''Deo Ceruninco'', &quot;to the God Cerunincos&quot;, assumed to be the same deity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The Gaulish inscription from Montagnac&lt;ref&gt;RIG 1, number G-224.&lt;/ref&gt; reads αλλετ[ει]νος καρνονου αλ[ι]σο[ντ]εας (''Alletinos [dedicated this] to Carnonos of Alisontea''), with the last word possibly a place name based on ''Alisia'', &quot;[[sorbus|service-tree]]&quot; or &quot;rock&quot; (compare [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]], Gaulish ''Alisiia'').&lt;ref&gt;Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire'' pp. 38–39. See also Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise'' (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 53 and 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:God of Etang sur Arroux possible depiction of Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|God of [[Etang-sur-Arroux]], a possible depiction of Cernunnos. He wears a [[torc]] at the neck and on the chest. Two [[snakes]] with ram heads encircle him at the waist. Two cavities at the top of his head are probably designed to receive [[deer]] antlers. Two small human faces at the back of his head indicate that he is [[polycephaly|tricephalic]]. [[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]] (National Archaeological Museum), in [[France]].]]

The god labelled ''[C]ernunnos'' on the [[Pillar of the Boatmen]] is depicted with stag's antlers, both having [[torc]]s hanging from them. The lower part of the relief is lost, but the dimensions suggest that the god was sitting cross-legged, providing a direct parallel to the antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m8-IAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconography%20of%20cernunnos%20Gundestrup%20cauldron&amp;f=false|title=Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art|last=Green|first=Miranda|date=2003-10-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134893942|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the name ''Cernunnos'' being attested nowhere else, it is commonly used in Celtological literature as describing all comparable depictions of horned/antlered deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconography%20of%20cernunnos&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vol. 1-|last=Koch|first=John T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094400|language=en|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This &quot;Cernunnos&quot; type in Celtic iconography is often portrayed with a [[stag]] and the [[ram-horned serpent]]. Less frequently, there are [[bull]]s (at [[Rheims]]), [[dog]]s and [[rat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VZkTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos#v=onepage&amp;q=Iconography%20of%20cernunnos&amp;f=false|title=Gods of the Celts|last=Green|first=Miranda|date=2011-09-30|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780752468112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the image of him on the Gundestrup Cauldron, some scholars describe Cernunnos as the &quot;[[Lord of the Animals]]&quot; or the &quot;Lord of Wild Things&quot;, and Miranda Green describes him as a &quot;peaceful god of nature and fruitfulness&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Green, Miranda (1992) ''Animals in Celtic Life and Myth'', p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; who seems to be seated in a manner that suggests traditional shamans who were often depicted surrounded by animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Caesar's Druids: story of an ancient priesthood|last=Aldhouse-Green|first=Miranda J.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780300165883|location=New Haven|pages=86|oclc=808346501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other academics such as Ceisiwr Serith describes Cernunnos as a god of bi-directionality and mediator between opposites, seeing the animal symbolism in the artwork reflecting this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fickett-Wilbar|first=David|date=2003|title=Cernunnos: Looking a Different Way|journal=Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium|volume=23|pages=80–111|issn=1545-0155|jstor=25660728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pilier des nautes'' links him with sailors and with commerce, suggesting that he was also associated with material wealth as does the coin pouch from the Cernunnos of Rheims (Marne, Champagne, France)—in antiquity, Durocortorum, the ''civitas'' capital of the [[Remi]] tribe—and the stag vomiting coins from Niedercorn-Turbelslach (Luxembourg) in the lands of the [[Treveri]]. The god may have symbolized the fecundity of the [[Red Deer#Distribution and habitat|stag-inhabited forest]].

Other examples of &quot;Cernunnos&quot; images include a [[petroglyph]] in [[Val Camonica]] in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. The antlered human figure has been dated as early as the 7th century BCE or as late as the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, &quot;Creolizing the Roman Provinces,&quot; p. 221, especially note 103.&lt;/ref&gt; An antlered child appears on a relief from [[Vendeuvres]], flanked by serpents and holding a purse and a torc.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ross, &quot;Chain Symbolism in Pagan Celtic Religion,&quot; ''Speculum'' 34 (1959), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known image appears on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] found on [[Jutland]], dating to the 1st century BCE, thought to depict Celtic subject matter though usually regarded as of Thracian workmanship.

Among the [[Celtiberians]], horned or antlered figures of the Cernunnos type include a &quot;[[Janus]]-like&quot; god from [[Candelario]] ([[Salamanca]]) with two faces and two small horns; a horned god from the hills of [[Ríotinto]] ([[Huelva]]); and a possible representation of the deity Vestius Aloniecus near his altars in [[Lourizán]] ([[Pontevedra]]). The horns are taken to represent &quot;aggressive power, genetic vigor and fecundity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Marco Simón, &quot;Religion and Religious Practices of the Ancient Celts of the Iberian Peninsula,&quot; ''e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies'' 6 (2005), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Divine representations of the Cernunnos type are exceptions to the often-expressed view that the Celts only began to picture their gods in human form after the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest of Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, &quot;Creolizing the Roman Provinces,&quot; p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Celtic &quot;horned god&quot;, while well attested in iconography, cannot be identified in description of Celtic religion in [[Roman ethnography]] and does not appear to have been given any ''[[interpretatio romana]]'', perhaps due to being too distinctive to be translatable into the Roman pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Webster, &quot;Creolizing the Roman Provinces,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 105 (2001), p. 222; distinctiveness of Cernunnos also in William Van Andringa, &quot;Religions and the Integration of Cities in the Empire in the Second Century AD: The Creation of a Common Religious Language,&quot; in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;
While Cernunnos was never assimilated, scholars have sometimes compared him functionally to Greek and Roman divine figures such as [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]],&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robinson and Elizabeth Pierce Belgen, &quot;Archaeological Notes and Discussions,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 41 (1937), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Actaeon]], specialized forms of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and [[Dis Pater]], the latter of whom [[Julius Caesar]] said was considered the ancestor of the Gauls.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Fray Bober, &quot;Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity,&quot; ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 55 (1951), p. 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible reflexes in Insular Celtic==
There have been attempts to find the ''cern'' root in the name of [[Conall Cernach]], the foster brother of the Irish hero [[Cuchulainn]]&lt;ref&gt;Porter, ''A Sculpture at Tandragee'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Ulster Cycle]]. In this line of interpretation, ''Cernach'' is taken as an epithet with a wide semantic field—&quot;angular; victorious; bearing a prominent growth&quot;—and Conall is seen as &quot;the same figure&quot; as the ancient Cernunnos.&lt;ref&gt;John Koch. (2006) Cernunnos [in] ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', p. 396. ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is even greater evidence available to connect Conall Cernach to Cernunnos than the similarity in the names. A brief passage involving Conall in an eighth-century story entitled ''Táin Bó Fraích'' (&quot;The Cattle Raid on Fraech&quot;) has been questioned before for its anti-climactic conclusion to an epic Celtic tale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anne Ross 1967&quot;&gt;Anne Ross. (1967, 1996). ''Pagan Celtic Britain: Studies in Iconography and Tradition''. Academy Chicago Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage Conall Cernach is portrayed as a hero and mighty warrior who assists the protagonist Fraech in rescuing his wife and son, and in reclaiming for Fraech his cattle. The fort that Conall must penetrate is guarded by a mighty serpent. The supposed anti-climax of this tale is when the fearsome serpent, instead of attacking Conall, darts to Conall's waist and girdles him as a belt. Rather than killing the serpent, Conall allows it to live, and then proceeds to attack and rob the fort of its great treasures the serpent previously protected.

Cernunnos, as the conjectured Gaulish manifestation of the Roman [[Dis Pater]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Anne Ross 1967&quot;/&gt; is considered to share the latter's attributes of ruling over the hidden treasures of the underworld. Subterranean treasures were commonly linked in Medieval Bestiaries to the serpent,&lt;ref&gt;Charbonneau-Lassay, Louis. (1940). ''The Bestiary of Christ''. France: Desclée, De Brouwer, &amp; Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; the occupant of the underground, or otherworld, and the keeper of its treasures and mysteries. This aspect of Cernunnos is depicted on a stone statue from a well in Sommerécourt, Haute-Marne, France, and on a bronze figurine from Autun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anne Ross 1967&quot;/&gt; Both statue and figurine portray Cernunnos with the two ram-headed serpents encircling his waist. This is more than just a small similarity to the instance of the serpent that guarded the treasure of the fort in ''Táin Bó Fraích'' surrendering to Conall Cernach and becoming his belt. Cernunno's connections to the deity Mars&lt;ref name=&quot;Anne Ross 1967&quot;/&gt; serve to underline Conall's role as hero-warrior in the tale.

The anti-climactic nature of the eighth-century Irish tale then gains significant clarity in the light of the relationship between a horned or antler-bearing deity, warrior, or progenitor, and the [[chthonic]] dwelling, treasure-guarding serpent that encircled the waist of the one it chose to protect. This universal Celtic concept comes down to us as a mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the [[Christianization of Ireland]]. The Gaelic Cernunnos may now possibly only be found in the slight similarity of a name and the peculiarity of a single passage from a Middle Ages Irish epic.

==Possible connection to Saint Ciarán==
Some see the qualities of Cernunnos subsumed into the ''life'' of [[Ciarán of Saigir|Saint Ciarán of Saighir]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. When he was building his first tiny cell, as his [[Hagiography|hagiograph]] goes, his first disciple and monk was a boar that had been rendered gentle by God. This was followed by a fox, a badger, a wolf and a stag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mac Cana| first = Proinsias| title = Celtic Mythology| origyear = 1970| year = 1973| publisher = The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited| location = London| isbn = 0-600-00647-6| pages = [https://archive.org/details/celticmythology00macc/page/47 47–8]| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/celticmythology00macc/page/47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism and Wicca==
In [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[Neopaganism]] a [[Horned God]] is revered; this divinity syncretises a number of horned or antlered gods from various cultures, including Cernunnos. The Horned God reflects the seasons of the year in an annual cycle of life, death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Stewart &amp; Janet, ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tradition of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], the Horned God is sometimes specifically referred to as Cernunnos, or sometimes also as Kernunno.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;
