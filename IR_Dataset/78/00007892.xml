'''David Paul Cronenberg''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|OOnt|FRSC}} (born March 15, 1943) is a Canadian filmmaker.{{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=1}} He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the [[body horror]] genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infection, technology and the intertwining of the psychological with the physical. In the first third of his career he explored these themes mostly through [[horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]] films such as ''[[Scanners]]'' (1981) and ''[[Videodrome]]'' (1983), although his work has since expanded beyond these genres.

Cronenberg's films have polarized critics and audiences alike; he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/cronenberg-defends-movie-s-naked-bathhouse-scene-1.256007|title=Cronenberg defends movie's naked bathhouse scene|date=September 11, 2007|work=CTVNews|access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/21/david.cronenberg/|title=Director David Cronenberg: Responsible violence? |publisher=CNN|access-date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called him &quot;the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=J.

==Early life==
Born in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Cronenberg is the son of Esther (''née'' Sumberg), a musician, and Milton Cronenberg, a writer and editor.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/David-Cronenberg.html |title=David Cronenberg Biography (1943–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a &quot;middle-class progressive [[Jewish]] family&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/david-cronenberg/biography/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817024054/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/david-cronenberg/biography |archivedate=August 17, 2012  }}.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/heraldmagazine/99409-canadian-icon-david-cronenberg|title=Canadian Icon: David Cronenberg|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and his mother was born in Toronto; all of his grandparents were from Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viggo-works.com/index.php?page=1392|title=Film-Related 2007|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began writing as a child and wrote constantly. He attended high school at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]] and [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]]. A keen interest in science, especially [[botany]] and [[lepidopterology]], led him to enter the Honours Science program at the [[University of Toronto]] in 1963, but he switched to Honours English Language and Literature later in his first year.

Cronenberg's fascination with the film ''[[Winter Kept Us Warm]]'' (1966), by classmate [[David Secter]], sparked his interest in film. He began frequenting film camera rental houses, learning the art of filmmaking, and made two [[16 mm film|16mm]] films (''Transfer'' and ''From the Drain''). Inspired by the New York underground film scene, he founded the Toronto Film Co-op with Iain Ewing and [[Ivan Reitman]]. After taking a year off to travel in Europe, he returned to Canada in 1967 and graduated from [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]] at the top of his class.&lt;ref name=fullbio&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 8, 2012|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/86249/David-Cronenberg/biography|title=David Cronenberg: Full Biography|accessdate=April 16, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222043459/https://movies.nytimes.com/person/86249/David-Cronenberg/biography|archivedate=February 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After two short sketch films and two short [[art-house]] features (the [[Black and white|black-and-white]] ''[[Stereo (1969 film)|Stereo]]'' and the colour ''[[Crimes of the Future]]'') Cronenberg went into partnership with [[Ivan Reitman]]. The Canadian government provided financing for his films throughout the 1970s. He alternated his signature &quot;[[body horror]]&quot; films such as ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' with projects reflecting his interest in car racing and bike gangs (''[[Fast Company (1979 film)|Fast Company]]''). ''[[Rabid (1977 film)|Rabid]]'' provided pornographic actress [[Marilyn Chambers]] with work in a different genre. (Cronenberg's first choice for the role had been a then little-known [[Sissy Spacek]]). ''Rabid'' was a breakthrough with international distributors, and his next two horror features gained stronger support.

Cronenberg's films follow a definite progression: a movement from the social world to the inner life. In his early films, scientists modify human bodies, which results in the breakdown of social order (e.g. ''Shivers'', ''Rabid''). In his middle period, the chaos wrought by the scientist is more personal, (e.g. ''[[The Brood]]'', ''[[Scanners]]'', ''[[Videodrome]]''). In the later middle period, the scientist himself is altered by his experiment (e.g. his remake of ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]''). This trajectory culminates in ''[[Dead Ringers (film)|Dead Ringers]]'' in which a twin pair of [[gynecology|gynecologists]] spiral into [[codependency]] and [[drug addiction]]. His later films tend more to the psychological, often contrasting subjective and objective realities (''[[Existenz]]'', ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'', ''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'').{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}}

Cronenberg has cited [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] as influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Browning, Mark |date=2007|title=David Cronenberg: Author or Film-maker?|publisher= Intellect Books|isbn= 1-84150-173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best example of a film that straddles the line between his works of personal chaos and psychological confusion is Cronenberg's 1991 &quot;adaptation&quot; of ''[[Naked Lunch]]'' (1959), his literary hero [[William S. Burroughs]]' most controversial book. The novel was considered &quot;unfilmable&quot;, and Cronenberg acknowledged that a straight translation into film would &quot;cost 400 million dollars and be banned in every country in the world&quot;. Instead—much like in his earlier film, ''Videodrome''—he consistently blurred the lines between what appeared to be reality and what appeared to be [[hallucinations]] brought on by the main character's drug addiction. Some of the book's &quot;moments&quot; (as well as incidents loosely based upon Burroughs' life) are presented in this manner within the film. Cronenberg stated that while writing the screenplay for ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'' (1991), he felt a moment of [[synergy]] with Burroughs' writing style. He felt the connection between his screenwriting style and Burroughs' prose style was so strong, that he jokingly remarked that should Burroughs pass on, &quot;I'll just write his next book.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2012|reason=No source cited yet}}

Cronenberg has said that his films should be seen &quot;from the point of view of the disease&quot;, and that in ''Shivers'', for example, he identifies with the characters ''after'' they become infected with the anarchic parasites. Disease and disaster, in Cronenberg's work, are less problems to be overcome than agents of [[Morphological freedom|personal transformation]]. Of his characters' transformations, Cronenberg said, &quot;But because of our necessity to impose our own structure of perception on things we look on ourselves as being relatively stable. But, in fact, when I look at a person I see this maelstrom of organic, chemical and electron chaos; volatility and instability, shimmering; and the ability to change and transform and transmute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gordon, Bette|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/26/articles/1160 |title=David Cronenberg|work=[[BOMB Magazine]]|date= Winter 1989|accessdate= July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Crash (1996 film)|Crash]]'' (1996), people who have been injured in car crashes attempt to view their ordeal as &quot;a fertilizing rather than a destructive event&quot;. In 2005, Cronenberg publicly disagreed with [[Paul Haggis]]' choice of the same name for the latter's [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), arguing that it was &quot;very disrespectful&quot; to the &quot;important and seminal&quot; [[Crash (J. G. Ballard novel)|J.G. Ballard novel]] on which Cronenberg's film was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Double Trouble |work=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2118602/fr/nl/ |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986), Cronenberg has not generally worked within the world of big-budget, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking, although he has had occasional near misses. At one stage he was considered by [[George Lucas]] as a possible director for ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983) but was passed over. Cronenberg also worked for nearly a year on a version of ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), but experienced &quot;creative differences&quot; with producers [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Ronald Shusett]]; a different version of the film was eventually made by [[Paul Verhoeven]]. A fan of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s, author of &quot;We Can Remember it For You Wholesale&quot;, the short story upon which the film was based, Cronenberg related in the biography/overview of his work, [[''Cronenberg on Cronenberg'' (1992)]] that his dissatisfaction with what he envisioned the film to be and what it ended up being pained him so greatly that for a time, he suffered a [[migraine]] just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cronenberg, David|title=Cronenberg on Cronenberg|date=1992|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/901380.Cronenberg_On_Cronenberg|isbn=9780571144365|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, Cronenberg was announced as director of a sequel to another Verhoeven film, ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), but this also fell through. His thriller ''[[A History of Violence]]'' (2005) is one of his highest budgeted and most accessible to date. He has said that the decision to direct it was influenced by his having had to defer some of his salary on the low-budgeted ''[[Spider (2002 film)|Spider]]'' (2002), but it was one of his most critically acclaimed films to date, along with ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' (2007), a film about the struggle of one man to gain power in the Russian Mafia.

Cronenberg has collaborated with composer [[Howard Shore]] on all of his films since ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979), (see [[List of noted film director and composer collaborations]]) with the exception of ''The Dead Zone'' (1983), which was scored by [[Michael Kamen]]. Other regular collaborators include actor Robert Silverman, [[art director]] Carol Spier, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] Bryan Day, film editor Ronald Sanders, his sister, [[costume designer]] [[Denise Cronenberg]], and, from 1979 until 1988, [[cinematographer]] Mark Irwin. In 2008, Cronenberg directed Howard Shore's first opera, ''[[The Fly (opera)|The Fly]]''.

Since ''Dead Ringers'' (1988), Cronenberg has worked with cinematographer [[Peter Suschitzky]] on each of his films (see [[List of film director and cinematographer collaborations]]). Suschitzky was the director of photography for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), and Cronenberg remarked that Suschitzky's work in that film &quot;was the only one of those movies that actually looked good&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=David Cronenberg Re-Examines David Cronenberg |publisher=Film Freak Central |url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/dcronenbergretrointerview.htm |date=March 9, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030401142610/http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/dcronenbergretrointerview.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a motivating factor to work with him on ''Dead Ringers''.

Although Cronenberg has worked with a number of Hollywood stars, he remains a staunchly Canadian filmmaker, with nearly all of his films (including major studio vehicles ''The Dead Zone'' and ''The Fly'') having been filmed in his home province Ontario. Notable exceptions include ''[[M. Butterfly (film)|M. Butterfly]]'' (1993), most of which was shot in China, ''Spider'', and ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' (2007), which were both filmed primarily in England, and ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'' (2011), which was filmed in Germany and Austria. ''Rabid'' and ''Shivers'' were shot in and around [[Montreal]]. Most of his films have been at least partially financed by [[Telefilm Canada]], and Cronenberg, a vocal supporter of government-backed film projects, has said: &quot;Every country needs [a system of government [[Grant (money)|grants]]] to have a national cinema in the face of Hollywood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phipps |first=Keith |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22500 |title=David Cronenberg |work=[[The A.V. Club]] |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronenberg has also appeared as an actor in other directors' films. Most of his roles are [[cameo appearance]]s, as in the films ''[[Into the Night (film)|Into the Night]]'' (1985), ''[[Blood and Donuts]]'' (1995), ''[[To Die For]]'' (1995), and ''[[Jason X]]'' (2002) and the television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', but on occasion he has played major roles, as in ''[[Nightbreed]]'' (1990) and ''[[Last Night (1998 film)|Last Night]]'' (1998). He has not played major roles in any of his own films, but he did put in a brief appearance as a gynecologist in ''The Fly''; he can also be glimpsed among the sex-crazed hordes in ''Shivers''; he can be heard as an unseen car-pound attendant in ''Crash''; his hands can be glimpsed in ''[[eXistenZ]]'' (1999); and he appeared as a stand-in for [[James Woods]] in ''Videodrome'' for shots in which Woods' character wore a helmet that covered his head.

In 2008, Cronenberg realized two extra-cinematographic projects: the exhibition ''Chromosomes'' at the [[Rome Film Fest]], and the opera ''The Fly'' at the LaOpera in Los Angeles and Theatre Châtelet in Paris. In July 2010, Cronenberg completed production on ''[[A Dangerous Method]]'' (2011), an adaptation of [[Christopher Hampton]]'s play ''The Talking Cure'', starring [[Keira Knightley]], [[Michael Fassbender]], and frequent collaborator [[Viggo Mortensen]]. The film was produced by independent British producer [[Jeremy Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/03/viggo-mortensen-replaces-christoph.html |title=Viggo Mortensen Replaces Christoph Waltz As Sigmund Freud in David Cronenberg's 'The Talking Cure' |website=The Playlist |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Keira Knightley Takes The Talking Cure | url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=26588|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, his film ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Selection&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |website=Cannes Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |work=Time Out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 2011 edition of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'', Cronenberg stated that he has written a companion piece to his 1986 remake of ''The Fly'', which he would like to direct if given the chance. He has stated that it is not a traditional sequel, but rather a &quot;parallel story&quot;.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

For a time it appeared that, as ''[[Eastern Promises]]'' producer Paul Webster told [[Screen International]], a sequel is in the works that would reunite the key team of Cronenberg, [[Steven Knight]], and Viggo Mortensen. The film was to be made by Webster's new production company ''Shoebox Films'' in collaboration with [[Focus Features]], and shot in early 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

In a September 2013 interview, Cronenberg stated that he is not concerned about posthumous representations of his film work: &quot;It wouldn't disturb me to think that my work would just sink beneath the waves without trace and that would be it. So what? It doesn't bother me.&quot; In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that it depends on the &quot;time of day&quot; as to whether or not he is afraid of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry&quot; /&gt;

On June 26, 2014, Cronenberg's short film ''The Nest'' was published on YouTube.

The character Nola Carveth, mother of the brood, is based on Cassandra's mother. Cronenberg said that he found the shooting of the climactic scene, in which Nola was strangled by her husband, to be &quot;very satisfying&quot;.{{sfn|Cronenberg|1992|p=84}}

I'm interested in saying, 'Let us discuss the existential question. We are all going to die, that is the end of all consciousness. There is no afterlife. There is no God. Now what do we do.' That's the point where it starts getting interesting to me.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; His atheism was further explained in a September 2013 interview:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Anytime I've tried to imagine squeezing myself into the box of any particular religion, I find it claustrophobic and oppressive. I think atheism is an acceptance of what is real.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, Cronenberg revealed that film director [[Martin Scorsese]] admitted to him that he was intrigued by Cronenberg's early work but was subsequently &quot;terrified&quot; to meet him in person. Cronenberg responded to Scorsese: &quot;You're the guy who made ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and you're afraid to meet me?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Henry&quot; /&gt;
