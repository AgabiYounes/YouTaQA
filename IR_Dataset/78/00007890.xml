'''Dunes''' are large masses of wind-blown [[sand]], and are most common in deserted environments, such as the [[Sahara]], and also near beaches. An area with dunes is called a '''dune system'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/394.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biology-fieldwork.org/a-level/succession/sand-dunes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.michigan.gov/documents/deq/wrd-cda-dune-systems_558207_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.restoconlife.eu/en/habitat-to-be-protected/the-dune-system/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dropbearadventures.com.au/2018/08/10/the-great-sandy-coastal-dune-system/&lt;/ref&gt; In [[physical geography]], a '''dune''' is a [[hill]] of loose [[sand]] built by [[aeolian processes]] (wind) or the flow of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary |last=Fowler |first=H.W. |author-link=H.

The valley or trough between dunes is called a ''slack''.

An [[Erg (landform)|erg]] or ''sand sea'' is a large&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldlandforms.com/landforms/erg/ |title=Erg Landforms |access-date=13 October 2019 |work=WorldLandForms}}&lt;/ref&gt; broad, flat area covered with wind-swept sand and/or dunes with little or no vegetation. Smaller areas are called ''dune fields''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fastwindtoaim.blogspot.com/2013/01/aeolian-landform-08-erg.html |title=Aeolian Landform (08.

Dunes occur in some [[desert]]s, [[Inland dune|inland]] and along some [[coast]]s. Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the [[beach]]. In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the [[sea]]. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient [[lake]] or [[sea]] beds. Dunes can form under the action of water flow ([[fluvial]] processes), and on sand or [[gravel]] beds of [[river]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and the sea-bed.

The modern word &quot;dune&quot; came into English from French around 1790,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dune |title=Dune—Define Dune |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |access-date=1 May 2018 |publisher=[[Dictionary.com, LLC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn came from [[Middle Dutch]] ''dūne''.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;/&gt;{{TOC limit}}

==Formation==
[[File:Saltation on sand dune.png|thumb|left|Sand hitting sand is more likely to stick; sand hitting a more coherent surface is more likely to bounce ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]). This exacerbating [[feedback loop]] helps sand accumulate into dunes.]]
Dunes are made of sand-sized particles, and may consist of quartz, calcium carbonate, snow, gypsum, or other materials. The upwind/upstream/upcurrent side of the dune is called the stoss side; the downflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]) up the stoss side, and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip face (or slipface).

The [[Bagnold formula]] gives the speed at which particles can be transported.

==Aeolian dunes==

===Aeolian dune shapes===
Five basic dune types are recognized: crescentic, linear, star, dome, and parabolic. Dune areas may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;[https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ Types of dunes], a [[USGS]] publication&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barchan or crescentic====
{{main|barchan}}
[[File:Barchan in Noachis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Isolated barchan dunes on the surface of [[Mars]]. Dominant wind direction would be from left to right.]]
Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds which are generally wider than they are long. The lee-side slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction (unimodal winds). They form separate crescents when the sand supply is comparatively small. When the sand supply is greater, they may merge into barchanoid ridges, and then transverse dunes (see below).

Some types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over [[desert]] surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in [[China]]'s [[Ningxia Province]], and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]]. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China's [[Taklamakan Desert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USG Types of Dunes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Dunes|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|accessdate=8 March 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314161113/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See lunettes and parabolic dunes, below, for dunes similar to crescent-shaped ones.

=====Transverse dunes=====
Abundant barchan dunes may merge into barchanoid ridges, which then grade into linear (or slightly sinuous) transverse dunes, so called because they lie transverse, or across, the wind direction, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the ridge crest.&lt;ref name=Mangimeli/&gt;

====Seif or longitudinal dunes====
Seif dunes are linear (or slightly sinuous) dunes with two slip faces.&lt;ref name=Mangimeli/&gt; The two slip faces make them sharp-crested. They are called ''seif'' dunes after the Arabic word for &quot;sword&quot;. They may be more than 160 kilometres (100 miles) long, and thus easily visible in satellite images (see illustrations).

Seif dunes are associated with bidirectional winds. The long axes and ridges of these dunes extend along the resultant direction of sand movement (hence the name &quot;longitudinal&quot;).&lt;ref name=seif_terminology&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_460-2 |chapter=Longitudinal Dunes (or Linear Dunes) |title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms |pages=1–11 |year=2014 |last1=Radebaugh |first1=Jani |last2=Sharma |first2=Priyanka |last3=Korteniemi |first3=Jarmo |last4=Fitzsimmons |first4=Kathryn E. |isbn=978-1-4614-9213-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;USG Types of Dunes&quot;/&gt;

Formation is debated. Bagnold, in ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]'', suggested that some seif dunes form when a barchan dune moves into a bidirectional wind regime, and one arm or wing of the crescent elongates. Others suggest that seif dunes are formed by [[vortex|vortices]] in a unidirectional wind.&lt;ref name=Mangimeli/&gt; In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes, barchans may be formed, because the wind is constrained to be unidirectional by the dunes.

The dune thus moves, and a cross-section through it shown diagonal [[cross-bedding]]|Transverse dunes lie perpendicular to the wind, which moves them forwards, producing the [[cross-bedding]] shown here.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Seif dunes are common in the Sahara. They range up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast [[Erg (landform)|erg]], called the [[Rub' al Khali]] or Empty Quarter, contains seif dunes that stretch for almost 200&amp;nbsp;km and reach heights of over 300&amp;nbsp;m.

Linear [[loess]] hills known as [[paha (landform)|pahas]] are superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] under [[permafrost]] conditions dominated by sparse [[tundra]] vegetation.

====Star====
Radially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the [[sand sea]]s, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast [[Badain Jaran Desert]] of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.

====Dome====
Oval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface. Dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.

=====Lunettes=====
Fixed crescentic dunes that form on the leeward margins of [[Dry lake|playas]] and river valleys in arid and semiarid regions in response to the direction (s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5&amp;nbsp;km long, 1&amp;nbsp;km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Rowland Twidale|Twidale, C.R.]] &amp; Campbell, E.M. (2005, revised edition): Australian landforms: understanding a low, flat, arid and old landscape. Rosenberg Publishing. pp. 241–3. {{ISBN|1 877058 32 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parabolic====
[[File:Parabolic dune.jpg|thumb|Schematic of coastal parabolic dunes]]
U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms are parabolic dunes. These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12&amp;nbsp;km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, [[blowout (geology)|blowout]], or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.

In plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slipfaces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.

These dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them—grasses, shrubs, and trees—help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.

Most parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.

Simple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.

Parabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.

The grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.

A type of extensive parabolic dune that lacks discernible slipfaces and has mostly coarse grained sand is known as a ''zibar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85728-017-3|pages=395–396|edition=2. impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term zibar comes from the [[Arabic]] word to describe &quot;rolling transverse ridges ... with a hard surface&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85728-017-3|pages=395|edition=2. impr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dunes are small, have low relief, and can be found in many places across the planet from [[Wyoming]] (United States) to Saudi Arabia to Australia. Spacing between zibars ranges from 50 to 400 metres and they don't become more than 10 metres high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGS Landform Glossary|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NSSC/Soil_Survey_Handbook/629_glossary.pdf|work=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=3 October 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dunes form at about ninety degrees to the prevailing wind which blows away the small, fine-grained sand leaving behind the coarser grained sand to form the crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Ole|title=Zibar Dunes|url=http://my.opera.com/nielsol/blog/zibar-dunes|work=My Opera|accessdate=3 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103030606/http://my.opera.com/nielsol/blog/zibar-dunes|archivedate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reversing dunes====
[[File:Libya 4608 Idehan Ubari Dunes Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Reversing dune showing short minor slipface atop the major stoss (upwind) face]]
Occurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction, reversing dunes are varieties of any of the above shapes. These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions. The minor slipfaces are usually temporary, as they appear after a reverse wind and are generally destroyed when the wind next blows in the dominant direction.&lt;ref name=Mangimeli/&gt;

====Draas====
[[File:350m Düne Deadvlei Sossusvlei.JPG|thumb|Dune Nine in [[Sossusvlei]], [[Namibia]], is over 300m high.]]
Draas are very large-scale dune bedforms; they may be tens or a few hundreds of metres in height, kilometres wide, and hundreds of kilometres in length.&lt;ref name=Mangimeli&gt;{{Citation| publisher = U.S.A. National Park Service| last = Mangimeli| first = John| title = Geology of Sand Dunes| date = 10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a draa has reached a certain size, it generally develops superimposed dune forms.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite journal|title=The development of large aeolian bedforms|first=N.|last=Lancaster|date=1 March 1988|journal=Sedimentary Geology|volume=55|issue=1–2|pages=69–89|doi=10.1016/0037-0738(88)90090-5|bibcode=1988SedG...55...69L}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to be more ancient and slower-moving than smaller dunes,&lt;ref name=Mangimeli/&gt; and to form by vertical growth of existing dunes. Draas are widespread in sand seas and are [[Cross-bedding|well-represented in the geological record]].&lt;ref name=Lancaster/&gt;

===Dune complexity===
All these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (lager dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot; /&gt; Simple dunes are basic forms with the minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed. Complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.

===Dune movement===
The sand mass of dunes can move either windward or leeward, depending on if the wind is making contact with the dune from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward. If sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. The leeward flux of sand is greater than the windward flux. Further, when the wind carrying sand particles when it hits the dune, the dune's sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit the dune without carrying sand particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Hong|last2=Dun|first2=Hongchao|last3=Tong|first3=Ding|last4=Huang|first4=Ning|date=15 April 2017|title=Sand transportation and reverse patterns over leeward face of sand dune|journal=Geomorphology|volume=283|pages=41–47|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.12.030|bibcode=2017Geomo.283...41J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coastal dunes===

Coastal dunes&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/coastal-dunes-geomorphology-25822000/&lt;/ref&gt; form when wet sand is deposited along the coast and dries out and is blown along the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=ECF |title=Coasts: an introduction to systematic geomorphology |date=1976 |publisher=Australian National University Press |location=Canberra, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunes form where the beach is wide enough to allow for the accumulation of wind-blown sand, and where prevailing '''onshore winds''' tend to blow sand inland. The three key ingredients for coastal dune formation are a large sand supply, winds to move said sand supply, and a place for the sand supply to accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldsmith |first1=V |title=Coastal dunes. In Coastal sedimentary environments. |date=1978 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |pages=171–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstacles—for example, vegetation, pebbles and so on—tend to slow down the wind and lead to the deposition of sand grains.&lt;ref name=Hesp1989&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hesp | first = P.| year = 1989| title = A review of biological and geomorphological processes involved in the initiation and development of incipient foredunes| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

All these species find the coastal environment of the sand dune vital to their species' survival.

Over the course of time coastal dunes may be impacted by [[tropical cyclone]]s or other intense storm activity, dependent on their location. Recent work has suggested that coastal dunes tend to evolve toward a high or low morphology depending on the growth rate of dunes relative to storm frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Durán Vinent|first=Orencio|last2=Moore|first2=Laura|date=February 2015|title=Barrier island bistability induced by biophysical interactions|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=2|pages=158–162|doi=10.1038/nclimate2474|issn=1758-6798|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..158D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Evan B.|last2=Moore|first2=Laura J.|date=2016|title=Stability and bistability in a one-dimensional model of coastal foredune height|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|volume=121|issue=5|pages=964–977|doi=10.1002/2015JF003783|issn=2169-9011|bibcode=2016JGRF..121..964G}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a storm event, dunes play a significant role in minimizing wave energy as it moves onshore. As a result, coastal dunes, especially those in the foredune area affected by a [[storm surge]], will retreat or erode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morton |first1=RA |title=Effects of Hurricane Eloise on beach and coastal structures, Florida Panhandle |journal=Geology |date=1 May 1976 |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=277–80|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1976)4&lt;277:EOHEOB&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=1976Geo.....4..277M }}&lt;/ref&gt; To counteract the damage from tropical activity on coastal dunes, short term post-storm efforts such as fences can be made by individual agencies through fencing to help with sand accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Charbonneau |first1=B |last2=Wnek |first2=JP |title=Reactionary fence installation for post-Superstorm Sandy dune recovery |url=https://eartharxiv.org/ntjsc |website=EarthArXiv |accessdate=4 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How a much a dune erodes during any storm event is related to its location on the coastal shoreline and the profile of the beach during a particular season. During the summer, a beach tends to take on more of a convex appearance due to gentler waves, while the same beach in the winter may take on more of a concave appearance. As a result, coastal dunes can erode much more quickly in the winter than in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maine Sea Grant |title=Seasonal changes |url=https://www.seagrant.umaine.edu/coastal-hazards-guide/beaches-and-dunes/learn-more/seasonal-changes |website=Maine Sea Grant College Program |accessdate=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205003653/https://www.seagrant.umaine.edu/coastal-hazards-guide/beaches-and-dunes/learn-more/seasonal-changes |archive-date=5 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecological succession on coastal dunes====

As a dune forms, plant [[Ecological succession|succession]] occurs. The conditions on an ''embryo dune'' are harsh, with [[salt spray]] from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting [[seaweed]], brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow [[pioneer species]] to colonize the dune. These pioneer species are [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]], [[sea wort grass]] and other sea grasses in the [[United Kingdom]]. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune
typically having deep roots which reach the [[water table]], [[root nodules]] that produce [[nitrogen]] compounds, and protected [[stoma]], reducing [[transpiration]]. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a [[foredune]] as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add [[nitrogen]] to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are [[Calluna|heather]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s and [[gorse]]s. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds [[humus]] to the soil and is usually replaced by [[conifer]]ous trees, which can tolerate low soil [[pH]], caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching.&lt;ref name=Miles1985&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Miles | first = J.| year = 1985| title = The pedogenic effects of different species and vegetation types and the implications of succession| journal = European Journal of Soil Science| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 571–584| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2389.1985.tb00359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coniferous forests and [[heathland]] are common [[climax community|climax communities]] for sand dune systems.

Young dunes are called [[yellow dune]]s and dunes which have high humus content are called [[grey dune]]s. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. In Europe these plants include: creeping willow, cotton grass, [[yellow iris]], reeds, and rushes. As for vertebrates in European dunes, [[natterjack toad]]s sometimes breed here.

=== Coastal dune floral adaptations ===
Dune ecosystems are extremely difficult places for plants to survive. This is due to a number of pressures related to their proximity to the ocean and confinement to growth on sandy substrates.  These include:
* Little available soil moisture
* Little available [[soil organic matter]]/nutrients
* Harsh winds
* Salt spray
* Erosion/shifting and sometimes ephemeral substrate
* Tidal influences
There are many adaptations plants have evolved to cope with these pressures:
* Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)
* Shallow but extensive root systems
* Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (''Abronia spp''., Beach Primrose)
* Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)
* Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (''Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella'')
* Pale leaves to reduce insolation (''Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.'')
* Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept out to sea (''Ambrosia chamissonis'')

===Nabkha dunes===
A [[nabkha]], or coppice dune, is a small dune anchored by vegetation. They usually indicate desertification or soil erosion, and serve as nesting and burrow sites for animals.

==Sub-aqueous dunes==
{{main|Ripple marks}}
Sub-aqueous ([[underwater]]) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural [[Channel (geography)|channels]] such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered [[canal]]s and pipelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.powtec.2008.04.065 |title=Morphology and displacement of dunes in a closed-conduit flow |journal=Powder Technology |volume=190 |issue=1–2 |pages=247–251 |year=2009 |last1=Franklin |first1=E.M. |last2=Charru |first2=F. |arxiv=1608.07729 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0022112011000139 |title=Subaqueous barchan dunes in turbulent shear flow.

R. and Schwab, F., 1996, ''[[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]]'', pg. 45–49, {{ISBN|0-7167-2726-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sub-aqueous barchan dunes, sediment is lost by their extremities, known as horns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Carlos A.|last2=Franklin|first2=Erick M.|date=18 December 2017|title=Birth of a subaqueous barchan dune|journal=Physical Review E|volume=96|issue=6|pages=062906|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.96.062906|pmid=29347350|arxiv=1712.07162|bibcode=2017PhRvE..96f2906A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Carlos A.|last2=Franklin|first2=Erick M.|date=19 October 2018|title=Role of Transverse Displacements in the Formation of Subaqueous Barchan Dunes|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=121|issue=16|pages=164503|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.164503|pmid=30387641|arxiv=1810.11074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dunes most often form as a continuous 'train' of dunes, showing remarkable similarity in [[wavelength]] and height. The shape of a dune gives information about its formation environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www4.uwm.edu/course/geosci697/ripple-indices/Ripple%20Indices.html |title=Ripples |accessdate=11 January 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501201547/https://www4.uwm.edu/course/geosci697/ripple-indices/Ripple%20Indices.html |archivedate=1 May 2018  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, rivers produce asymmetrical ripples, with the steeper slip face facing downstream. Ripple marks preserved in sedimentary strata in the geological record can be used to determine the direction of current flow, and thus an indication of the source of the sediments.

Dunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river [[flooding]].

==Lithified dunes==
[[File:Cross-bedding Of Sandstone Near Mt Carmel Road Zion Canyon Utah.jpg|thumb|Cross-bedding in lithified aeolian sand dunes preserved as sandstone in Zion National Park, Utah]]
A [[Lithification|lithified]] (consolidated) sand dune is a type of [[sandstone]] that is formed when a marine or aeolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. [[Cross-bedding|Cross-bedded]] layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in the [[Zion National Park]] in the western United States.

A slang term, used in the [[Southwestern United States|southwest US]], for consolidated and hardened sand dunes is &quot;slickrock&quot;, a name that was introduced by pioneers of the [[Old West]] because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.

==Desertification==
{{Main|Desertification}}
Sand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by [[saltation (geology)|saltation]], where sand particles skip along the ground like a [[bouncing ball]]. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as [[creep (sand dunes)|creep]]. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing [[sheet flow]]s. In a major [[dust storm]], dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand [[avalanche]]s, falling down the [[slipface]] of the dunes—that face away from the winds—also move the dunes forward.

Sand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach is quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats and uses a valuable resource. [[Sand fence]]s might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.

==Conservation==
[[File:KelsoSand.JPG|thumb|Sand blowing off a crest in the [[Kelso Dunes]] of the [[Mojave Desert]], California, USA]]
Dune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous [[rare species]] and some [[endangered species]]. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sri Lanka have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of [[sand dune stabilization]]. In the U.K., a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.

{{See also|List of extraterrestrial dune fields}}
Dunes can likely be found in any environment where there is a substantial atmosphere, winds, and dust to be blown. Dunes are common on [[Mars]] and in the equatorial regions of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

Titan's dunes include large expanses with modal lengths of about 20–30&amp;nbsp;km. The regions are not topographically confined, resembling sand seas. These dunes are interpreted to be longitudinal dunes whose crests are oriented parallel to the dominant wind direction, which generally indicates west-to-east wind flow. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000733/ Peeking Through the Haze: Titan's Surface, part II—The Planetary Society Blog | The Planetary Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428143333/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000733/ |date=28 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
