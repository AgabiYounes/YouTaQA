A '''consumer''' is a person or organization that uses or consumes [[Service (economics)|economic services]] or [[Commodity|commodities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/consumer|title=Consumer - Define Consumer at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and marketing==
A consumer is one that buys good for consumption and not for resale or commercial purpose. The consumer is an individual who pays some amount of money for the thing required to consume goods and services. As such, consumers play a vital role in the [[economic system]] of a [[nation]]. Without consumer [[demand]], [[production (economics)|producers]] would lack one of the key motivations to produce: [[Sales|to sell]] to consumers. The consumer also forms part of the [[distribution (economics)|chain of distribution]].

Recently in [[marketing]] instead of marketers generating broad [[demographic profile|demographic profiles]] and Fisio-graphic profiles of [[market segmentation|market segments]], marketers have started to engage in [[personalized marketing|personalised marketing]], [[permission marketing]], and [[mass customization|mass customisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Robert G.|title=Revenue management: hard-core tactics for market domination|publisher=Broadway Books|year=1997|pages=66â€“71|ISBN=978-0-553-06734-7}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely due to the rise of the [[Internet]], consumers are shifting more and more towards becoming [[prosumer]], consumers who are also producers (often of information and media on the [[social web]]), influence the products created (e.g. by customisation, [[crowdfunding]] or publishing their preferences), actively participate in the production process, or use interactive products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gunelius|first1=Susan|title=The Shift from Consumers to PROsumers|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2010/07/03/the-shift-from-consumers-to-prosumers/|magazine=Forbes|accessdate=2 July 2016|date=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scammell|first1=Margaret|title=Citizen Consumers: towards a new marketing of politics?|url=https://depts.washington.edu/gcp/pdf/citizenconsumers.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2016|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prosumer Revisited|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=P5j_MTL7AZQC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and politics==
The law primarily uses a notion of the consumer in relation to [[consumer protection]] laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Krohn, Lauren |title=Consumer protection and the law: a dictionary |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-87436-749-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentlaw00patt }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/35-01/overby.htm|title=An Institutional Analysis of Consumer Law|accessdate=2007-01-29|publisher=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070302211417/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/journals/journal/35-01/overby.htm |archivedate = March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection has a clear political significance.

Concern over the interests of consumers has spawned [[consumer activism]], where organized activists do research, education and advocacy to improve the offer of products and services. Consumer education has been incorporated into some school curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=L. Gayle Royer |title=The Value of Consumer Education in Increasing Effective Consumer Performance: Theory and Research |journal=Advances in Consumer Research |date=1980 |volume=07 |page=203-206 |url=https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/9231/volumes/v07/NA-07 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} There are also various non-profit publications, such as ''[[Which?]]'', ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' and ''[[Choice (Australian magazine)|Choice magazine]]'', dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making.

In India, [[Consumer Protection Act, 1986|the Consumer Protection Act 1986]] differentiates the consummation of a commodity or service for personal use or to earn a livelihood. Only consumers are protected per this act and any person, entity or organization purchasing a commodity for commercial reasons are exempted from any benefits of this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote = The consumer protection act 1986 of India, is a little more generous with the word 'Consumer'. According to this law, a consumer is not only a person who uses the product for domestic personal use, but also one who uses the product to earn his daily livelihood.
