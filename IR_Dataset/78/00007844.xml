The '''chimpanzee''' (''Pan troglodytes''), also known as the '''common chimpanzee''', '''robust chimpanzee''', or simply &quot;'''chimp'''&quot;, is a species of [[Hominidae|great ape]] native to the forests and [[savanna|savannahs]] of [[tropical Africa]]. It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the &quot;pygmy chimpanzee&quot;) are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.

The chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|–|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|–|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|140|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.

The chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.

==Etymology==
The English name &quot;chimpanzee&quot; is first recorded in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of &quot;[[ape]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquialism &quot;chimp&quot; was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &amp;#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt;

==Taxonomy and genetics==
The first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the &quot;[[orangutan|orang-outang]]&quot; (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]]. In 1641, the Dutch anatomist [[Nicolaes Tulp]] applied the name to a chimpanzee or [[bonobo]] brought to the Netherlands from Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;van WyheKjærgaard2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Wyhe |first1=John |last2=Kjærgaard |first2=Peter C. |title=Going the whole orang: Darwin, Wallace and the natural history of orangutans |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |volume=51 |year=2015 |pages=53–63 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.02.006|pmid=25861859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Dutch anatomist, [[Peter Camper]], dissected specimens from Central Africa and Southeast Asia in the 1770s, noting the differences between the African and Asian apes. The German naturalist [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] classified the common chimpanzee as ''Simia troglodytes'' by 1775. Another German naturalist, [[Lorenz Oken]], coined the genus ''Pan'' in 1816. The bonobo was recognised as distinct from the common chimpanzee by 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Corbey, Raymond |year=2005 |title=The Metaphysics of Apes: Negotiating the Animal-Human Boundary |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=42–51 |isbn=9780521836838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Stanford, Craig |year=2018 |title=The New Chimpanzee, A Twenty-First-Century Portrait of Our Closest Kin |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=176 |isbn=978-0-674-97711-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mammalianspecies/&gt;

Despite a large number of ''[[Homo]]'' fossil finds, ''Pan'' fossils were not described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major [[human fossil]] sites in East Africa, but chimpanzee fossils have now been reported from Kenya. This indicates that both humans and members of the ''Pan'' [[clade]] were present in the [[East African Rift]] Valley during the [[Middle Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McBrearty2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBrearty |first1=Sally |last2=Jablonski |first2=Nina G. |date=1 September 2005 |title=First fossil chimpanzee |journal=Nature |pmid=16136135 |doi=10.1038/nature04008 |bibcode=2005Natur.437..105M |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=105–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA evidence suggests the bonobo and common chimpanzee species separated from each other less than one million years ago (similar in relation between ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and [[Neanderthal]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Won, Y.J. |author2=Hey, J. | title=Divergence population genetics of chimpanzees | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=22 | issue=2 | pages=297–307 | date=February 2005 | pmid=15483319 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msi017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fischer, A. |author2=Wiebe, V. |author3=Pääbo, S. |author4=Przeworski, M. | title=Evidence for a complex demographic history of chimpanzees | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=21 | issue=5 | pages=799–808 | date=May 2004 | pmid=14963091 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msh083}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 genetic study suggests ancient gene flow ([[introgression]]) between 200 and 550 thousand years ago from the bonobo into the ancestors of central and eastern chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=&quot;de Manuel 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Manuel, M. |display-authors=etal | title=Chimpanzee genomic diversity reveals ancient admixture with bonobos | journal=Science | volume=354 | issue=6311 | pages=477–481 | date=October 2016 | pmid=27789843 | pmc=5546212 | doi=10.1126/science.aag2602 | bibcode=2016Sci...354..477D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chimpanzee line [[human evolution|split]] from the last common ancestor of the [[human]] line around six million years ago. Because no species other than ''Homo sapiens'' has survived from the human line of that branching, both chimpanzee species are the closest living relatives of humans; the lineage of humans and chimpanzees diverged from [[gorilla]]s (genus ''Gorilla'') about seven million years ago. A 2003 study argues the common chimpanzee should be included in the human branch as ''Homo troglodytes'', and notes &quot;experts say many scientists are likely to resist the reclassification, especially in the emotionally-charged and often disputed field of anthropology&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pickrell |first1=John |title=Chimps Belong on Human Branch of Family Tree, Study Says |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0520_030520_chimpanzees.html |access-date=11 June 2016 |work=National Geographic News |agency=National Geographic |date=20 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human]] and chimpanzee [[DNA]] is very similar. A [[Chimpanzee Genome Project]] was initiated after the completion of the [[Human Genome Project]]. In December 2003, a preliminary analysis of 7600 genes shared between the two genomes confirmed that certain genes, such as the [[FOXP2|forkhead-box P2]] [[transcription factor]] which is involved in speech development, have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. A draft version of the chimpanzee genome was published on 1 September 2005 by the [[Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;genome&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium | title=Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal=Nature | volume=437 | issue=7055 | pages=69–87 | date=September 2005 | pmid=16136131 | doi=10.1038/nature04072 | bibcode=2005Natur.437...69.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sequence&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cheng, Z. |display-authors=etal | title=A genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications | journal=Nature | volume=437 | issue=7055 | pages=88–93 | date=September 2005 | pmid=16136132 | doi=10.1038/nature04000 | bibcode=2005Natur.437...88C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees consist of about 35 million [[Point mutation|single-nucleotide]] changes, five million [[Mutation#By effect on structure|insertion/deletion]] events, and various [[chromosome|chromosomal]] [[Chromosomal translocation|rearrangements]]. Typical human and chimp protein [[homology (biology)|homologs]] differ in an average of only two [[amino acid]]s. About 30% of all human proteins are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein. Duplications of small parts of [[chromosome]]s have been the major source of differences between human and chimp genetic material; about 2.7% of the corresponding modern genomes represent differences, produced by gene duplications or deletions, since humans and chimps diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor.&lt;ref name=&quot;genome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sequence&quot;/&gt;

The arms of a chimp are longer than its legs, and can reach below the knees. The hands have long fingers with short thumbs and flat fingernails. The feet are adapted for grasping, the big toe being [[Thumb#Opposition and apposition|opposable]]. A chimp's head is rounded with a prominent and [[prognathous]] face. It has forward-facing eyes, a small nose, rounded non-lobed ears, a long mobile upper lip and, in adult males, sharp canine teeth. Chimps lack the prominent [[sagittal crest]] and associated head and neck musculature of gorillas.&lt;ref name=Estes/&gt;&lt;ref name=mammalianspecies/&gt;

Chimpanzee bodies are covered by coarse hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. Chimps lose more hair as they age, and develop bald spots. The hair of a chimp is typically black but can be brown or ginger. As they get older, white or grey patches may appear, particularly on the chin and lower region. The skin may range from pale to dark, females develop swelling pink skin when in oestrus.&lt;ref name=Estes/&gt;&lt;ref name=mammalianspecies&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, Clyde |author2=Jones, Cheri A. |author3=Jones, Knox |author4=Wilson, Don E. |year=1996 |title=Pan troglodytes |journal=Mammalian Species |volume=529 |issue=529 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.2307/3504299|jstor=3504299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that common chimpanzees are known to hunt, and to collect insects and other invertebrates, such food actually makes up a tiny portion of their diet, from as little as 2% yearly to as much as 65 grams of animal flesh per day for each adult chimpanzee in peak hunting seasons.

==Behavior==
It is increasingly suspected that human observers influence chimpanzee behavior. One suggestion is that [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s, camera traps and remote microphones should be used rather than human observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hobaiter, Catherine |author2=Samuni, Liran |author3=Mullins, Caroline |author4=Akankwasa, Walter John |author5=Zuberbühler, Klaus |year=2017|title=Variation in hunting behaviour in neighbouring chimpanzee communities in the Budongo forest, Uganda|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=6|page=e0178065|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0178065|pmid=28636646 |pmc=5479531 |bibcode=2017PLoSO..1278065H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group structure===
[[File:Chimpanzees in Uganda (5984913059).jpg|thumb|left|Group in Uganda]]
Common chimpanzees live in communities that typically range from 20 to more than 150 members, but spend most of their time travelling in small, temporary groups consisting of a few individuals, which may consist of any combination of age and sex classes. Both males and females sometimes travel alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;behavior monographs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Van Lawick-Goodall, Jane |authorlink=Jane Goodall |year=1968 |title=The Behaviour of Free-Living Chimpanzees in the Gombe Stream Reserve |journal=Animal Behaviour Monographs (Rutgers University) |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[fission-fusion society]] may include groups of four types: all-male, adult females and offspring, both sexes, or one female and her offspring. These smaller groups emerge in a variety of types, for a variety of purposes. For example, an all-male troop may be organized to [[hunting|hunt]] for meat, while a group consisting of lactating females serves to act as a &quot;nursery group&quot; for the young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper&quot;/&gt;

At the core of social structures are males, which roam around, protect group members, and search for food. Males remain in their natal communities, while females generally emigrate at adolescence. As such, males in a community are more likely to be related to one another than females are to each other. Among males there is generally a dominance hierarchy, and males are dominant over females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldberg, T. L. |author2=Wrangham, R.

This is caused mainly by the large measure of individual autonomy that individuals have within their fission-fusion social groups.&lt;ref name=Estes/&gt; As a result, individual chimpanzees often forage for food alone, or in smaller groups as opposed to the much larger &quot;parent&quot; group, which encompasses all the chimpanzees which regularly come into contact and congregate into parties in a particular area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pepper, J.

With this, a dominant male is unsure if any &quot;political maneuvering&quot; has occurred and must re-establish his dominance. Thus, a large amount of aggression occurs 5–15 minutes after a reunion.

A community's dominant males sometimes restrict reproductive access to females. A male and female can form a consortship and mate outside their community. In addition, females sometimes leave their community and mate with males from neighboring communities.{{sfn|Goodall|1986|pp=450–451}}&lt;ref name=Gagneux1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gagneux, P. |author2=Boesch, C. |author3=Woodruff, D.

The [[gestation]] period is eight months.&lt;ref name=Estes/&gt; Care for the young is provided mostly by their mothers. The survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care.

When they reach five to six months, infants ride on their mothers' backs. They remain in continual contact for the rest of their first year. When they reach two years of age, they are able to move and sit independently, and start moving beyond the arms reach of their mothers. By four to six years, chimps are weaned and infancy ends. The juvenile period for chimps lasts from their sixth to ninth years. Juveniles remain close to their mothers, but interact an increasing amount with other members of their community. Adolescent females move between groups and are supported by their mothers in agonistic encounters. Adolescent males spend time with adult males in social activities like hunting and boundary patrolling.&lt;ref name=Bard1995/&gt;

Chimpanzees use facial expressions, postures, and sounds to communicate with each other. Chimps have expressive faces that are important in close-up communications. When frightened, a &quot;full closed grin&quot; causes nearby individuals to be fearful, as well. Playful chimps display an open-mouthed grin. Chimps may also express themselves with the &quot;pout&quot;, which is made in distress, the &quot;sneer&quot;, which is made when threatening or fearful, and &quot;compressed-lips face&quot;, which is a type of display. When submitting to a dominant individual, a chimp crunches, bobs, and extends a hand. When in an aggressive mode, a chimp swaggers bipedally, hunched over and arms waving, in an attempt to exaggerate its size.{{sfn|Goodall|1986|pp=119–122}} While travelling, chimps keep in contact by beating their hands and feet against the trunks of large trees, an act that is known as &quot;drumming&quot;.

Vocalizations are also important in chimp communication. The most common call in adults is the &quot;[[Pant-hoot (call)|pant-hoot]]&quot;, which may signal social rank and bond as well keep groups together. Pant-hoots are made of four parts, starting with soft &quot;hoos&quot;, the introduction; that gets louder and louder, the build-up; and climax into screams and sometimes barks; these die down back to soft &quot;hoos&quot; during the letdown phase as the call ends.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fedurek&quot;/&gt; Grunting is made in situations like feeding and greeting.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005/&gt; Submissive individuals make &quot;pant-grunts&quot; towards their superiors.{{sfn|Goodall|1986|p=129}}&lt;ref name=Pusey1997/&gt; Whimpering is made by young chimps as a form of begging or when lost from the group.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005/&gt; Chimps use distance calls to draw attention to danger, food sources, or other community members.{{sfn|Goodall|1986|pp=132–133}} &quot;Barks&quot; may be made as &quot;short barks&quot; when hunting and &quot;tonal barks&quot; when sighting large snakes.&lt;ref name=Crockford2005/&gt;

===Hunting===
When hunting small monkeys such as the red colobus, chimpanzees hunt where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular. This allows them to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team, so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy. During an [[arboreal]] hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. &quot;Drivers&quot; serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. &quot;Blockers&quot; are stationed at the bottom of the trees and climb up to block prey that takes off in a different direction. &quot;Chasers&quot; move quickly and try to make a catch. Finally, &quot;ambushers&quot; hide and rush out when a monkey nears.&lt;ref name=Leipzig2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boesch, C. | title=Cooperative hunting roles among Taï chimpanzees | journal=Human Nature | volume=13 | issue=1 | pages=27–46 | year=2002 | pmid=26192594 | doi=10.1007/s12110-002-1013-6 | citeseerx=10.1.1.556.2265}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both adults and infants are taken, adult male colobus monkeys will attack the hunting chimps.{{sfn|Goodall|1986|pp=273–274}} Male chimps hunt more than females.

A 30-year study at [[Kyoto University]]'s [[Primate Research Institute]] has shown that chimps are able to learn to recognize the numbers 1 to 9 and their values. The chimps further show an aptitude for [[photographic memory]], demonstrated in experiments in which the jumbled digits are flashed onto a computer screen for less than a quarter of a second. One chimp, [[Ayumu (chimpanzee)|Ayumu]], was able to correctly and quickly point to the positions where they appeared in ascending order. Ayumu performed better than human adults who were given the same test.&lt;ref name=symbol&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matsuzawa, Tetsuro |year=2009 |title=Symbolic representation of number in chimpanzees |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=92–98 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2009.04.007|pmid=19447029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great apes show [[Laughter in animals|laughter-like vocalizations]] in response to physical contact, such as wrestling, play chasing, or [[tickling]]. This is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees. Common chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognizable to humans as such, because it is generated by alternating inhalations and exhalations that sound more like breathing and panting. Instances in which nonhuman primates have expressed joy have been reported. Humans and chimpanzees share similar ticklish areas of the body, such as the armpits and belly. The enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzees does not diminish with age.&lt;ref name=Discover2003&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Johnson, Steven | date=1 April 2003 |title=Emotions and the Brain |journal=Discover Magazine |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/apr/featlaugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimpanzees have displayed different behaviors in response to a dying or dead group member. When witnessing a sudden death, the other group members act in frenzy, with vocalizations, aggressive displays, and touching of the corpse. In one case chimps cared for a dying elder, then attended and cleaned the corpse. Afterward, they avoided the spot where the elder died and behaved in a more subdued manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Anderson, James R. |author2=Gillies, Alasdair |author3=Lock, Louise C. |year=2010|title=''Pan'' thanatology|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=8|pages=R349–R351|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.02.010|pmid=21749950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers have been reported to carry around and groom their dead infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dora, Biro |author2=Humle, Tatyana |author3=Koops, Kathelijne |author4=Sousa, Claudia |author5=Hayashi, Misato |author6=Matsuzawa, Tetsuro |year=2010|title=Chimpanzee mothers at Bossou, Guinea carry the mummified remains of their dead infants|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=8|pages=R351–R352|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.02.031|pmid=21749951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimenters, however, now and then witness behavior that cannot be readily reconciled with chimpanzee intelligence or [[theory of mind]]. [[The Mentality of Apes|Wolfgang Köhler]], for instance, reported insightful behavior in chimpanzees, but he likewise often [[Animal cognition|observed]] that they experienced &quot;special difficulty&quot; in solving simple problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Köhler, Wolfgang (1925).

Scientists have attempted to teach human [[language]] to several species of great ape. One early attempt by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in the 1960s involved spending 51 months teaching [[American Sign Language]] to a chimpanzee named [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]]. The Gardners reported that Washoe learned 151 signs, and had spontaneously taught them to other chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Gardner, R. A. |author2=Gardner, B.

Debate is ongoing among scientists such as [[David Premack]] about chimpanzees' ability to learn language. Since the early reports on Washoe, numerous other studies have been conducted, with varying levels of success.&lt;ref name=&quot;GAT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/language/ |title=Language of Bonobos |publisher=Great Ape Trust |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815161414/http://www.greatapetrust.org/bonobo/language/ |archivedate=August 15, 2004 |accessdate=2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One involved a chimpanzee jokingly named [[Nim Chimpsky]] (in allusion to the theorist of language [[Noam Chomsky]]), trained by Herbert Terrace of [[Columbia University]]. Although his initial reports were quite positive, in November 1979, Terrace and his team, including psycholinguist [[Thomas Bever]], re-evaluated the videotapes of Nim with his trainers, analyzing them frame by frame for signs, as well as for exact context (what was happening both before and after Nim's signs). In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. &quot;Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill&quot;, he said. &quot;Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.&quot; In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human [[language acquisition]]. Nim never initiated conversations himself, rarely introduced new words, and simply imitated what the humans did. More importantly, Nim's word strings varied in their ordering, suggesting that he was incapable of [[syntax]]. Nim's sentences also did not grow in length, unlike human children whose vocabulary and sentence length show a strong positive correlation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynne 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wynne |first=Clive |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-10-31 |title=eSkeptic |publisher=Skeptic |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimpanzees are rarely represented in [[African culture]], as people regard them as too close to humans for comfort. The [[Gio people]] of Liberia and the [[Hemba people]] of the Congo have created masks of the animals. Gio masks are crude and blocky and the people wear when teaching young people how not to behave. The Hemba masks have a smile that suggests drunken anger, insanity or horror and are worn during rituals at funerals, representing the &quot;awful reality of death&quot;. The masks may also serve to guard households and protect both human and plant fertility. Stories have been told of chimps kidnapping and raping women.&lt;ref name=symbolism&gt;{{cite book | first=Hope, B. | last=Werness |year=2007 |title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |page=86 |isbn=978-0826419132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western [[popular culture]], chimpanzees have been stereotyped as childlike companions, [[sidekick]]s or [[clowns]]. They are especially suited for the latter role on account of their prominent facial features, long limbs and fast movements, which humans often find amusing. Accordingly, entertainment acts featuring chimpanzees dressed up as humans with [[lip-sync]]hronised human voices have been traditional staples of [[circus]]es, [[stage show]]s and TV shows like ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'' and ''[[The Chimp Channel]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 19&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Van Riper |first=A.

[[File:Aping Hollywood poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the 1931 film ''Aping Hollywood''. Media like this relied on the novelty of performing apes to carry their timeworn, [[low comedy]] gags.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 19&quot; /&gt;]]
Chimpanzees in media include Judy on the television series ''[[Daktari]]'' in the 1960s and Darwin on ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'' in the 1990s. In contrast to the fictional depictions of other animals, such as dogs (as in ''[[Lassie]]''), dolphins (''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]''), horses (''[[The Black Stallion]]'') or even other great apes (''[[King Kong]]''), chimpanzee characters and actions are rarely relevant to the plot. Depictions of chimpanzees as individuals rather than stock characters, and as central rather than incidental to the plot can be found in [[science fiction]]. [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s short story &quot;[[Jerry Was a Man]]&quot; (1947) concerns a [[biological uplift|genetically enhanced]] chimpanzee suing for better treatment. The 1972 film ''[[Conquest of the Planet of the Apes]]'', the third sequel of ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', portrays a futuristic revolt of enslaved apes led by the only talking chimpanzee, [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]], against their human masters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 19&quot;/&gt;

===As pets===
Chimpanzees have traditionally been kept as pets in a few African villages, especially in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. In [[Virunga National Park]] in the east of the country, the park authorities regularly confiscate chimpanzees from people keeping them as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7839819.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gorilla diary: August – December 2008 | date=20 January 2009 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside their range, chimpanzees are popular as [[exotic pet]]s despite their strength and aggression. Even where keeping non-human primates as pets is illegal, the exotic pet trade continues to prosper, leading to injuries from attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chimpanzees Don't Make Good Pets |url=http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp-central-pets |website=The Jane Goodall Institute |accessdate=1 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202195221/http://www.janegoodall.org/chimp-central-pets |archivedate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in research===

{{Legality of primate use in scientific research}}
Hundreds of chimpanzees have been kept in laboratories for research. Most such laboratories either conduct or make the animals available for invasive research,&lt;ref name=HSUSmap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/research/chimpanzee-lab-and-sanctuary-map.html |title=Chimpanzee lab and sanctuary map |publisher=The Humane Society of the United States |accessdate=2008-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307055400/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/research/chimpanzee-lab-and-sanctuary-map.html |archivedate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as &quot;inoculation with an infectious agent, surgery or biopsy conducted for the sake of research and not for the sake of the chimpanzee, and/or drug testing&quot;.&lt;ref name=HSUSresearch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/research/overview_of_research_uses_and.html | title=Chimpanzee Research: Overview of Research Uses and Costs | publisher=Humane Society of the United States | accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307055406/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/research/overview_of_research_uses_and.html |archivedate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research chimpanzees tend to be used repeatedly over decades for up to 40 years, unlike the pattern of use of most laboratory animals.&lt;ref name=HSUSbetter&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080215112131/http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/ Chimps Deserve Better], Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Two federally funded American laboratories use chimps: the [[Yerkes National Primate Research Center]] at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Southwest National Primate Center in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref name=Lovgren&gt;Lovgren, Stefan.

A five-year moratorium was imposed by the US National Institutes of Health in 1996, because too many chimps had been bred for HIV research, and it has been extended annually since 2001.&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt; With the publication of the [[chimpanzee genome]], plans to increase the use of chimps in America were reportedly increasing in 2006, some scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimps for research should be lifted.&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt;&lt;ref name=Langley15&gt;[[Gill Langley|Langley, Gill]] (June 2006).

Other researchers argue that chimps either should not be used in research, or should be treated differently, for instance with [[Great ape personhood|legal status as persons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Karcher, Karen |title=The Great Ape Project |editor=[[Marc Bekoff|Bekoff, Marc]] |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare |publisher=Greenwood |year=2009 |pages=185–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal Gagneux, an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the [[University of California, San Diego]], argues, given chimpanzees' sense of self, tool use, and genetic similarity to human beings, studies using chimps should follow the ethical guidelines used for human subjects unable to give consent.&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt; A recent study suggests chimpanzees which are retired from labs exhibit a form of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15299730802073619 |author1=Bradshaw, G.

He told ''National Geographic'': &quot;I don't think we should make a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any species, whether it's a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee. No matter how much we may wish it, chimps are not human.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt;

Only one European laboratory, the [[Biomedical Primate Research Centre]] in [[Rijswijk]], the Netherlands, used chimpanzees in research. It used to hold 108 chimpanzees among 1,300 non-human primates. The Dutch ministry of science decided to phase out research at the centre from 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Sally |title=Europe brings experiments on chimpanzees to an end |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=411 |date=10 May 2001 |issue=6834 |page=123 |doi=10.1038/35075735|pmid=11346754|bibcode=2001Natur.411..123G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trials already under way were however allowed to run their course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lab chimps face housing crisis: Experiments on apes end, but problems remain |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5761824 |agency=Associated Press |date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimpanzees including the female Ai have been studied at the [[Primate Research Institute]] of [[Kyoto University]], Japan, formerly directed by [[Tetsuro Matsuzawa]], since 1978.

A chimpanzee's strength and sharp teeth mean that attacks, even on adult humans, can cause severe injuries.

===Human immunodeficiency virus===
Two types of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the more virulent and easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world; HIV-2 is largely confined to west Africa.&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reeves, J.

===Status and conservation===
[[File:South Djoum Chimp.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cameroonian chimpanzee at a rescue centre after its mother was killed by poachers]]
The chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Chimpanzees are legally protected in most of their range, and can be found both in and outside [[national park]]s. Between 172,700 and 299,700 individuals are thought to be living in the wild,&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; a decrease from about a million chimpanzees in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=Fleur&gt;{{cite news |last1=St.Fleur |first1=Nicholas |title=U.S. Will Call All Chimps 'Endangered' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/science/chimpanzees-endangered-fish-and-wildlife-service.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=Moth-Hidden&amp;module=inside-nyt-region®ion=inside-nyt-region&amp;WT.nav=inside-nyt-region |access-date=13 June 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

Chimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1–3% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

Infectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar. As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;
