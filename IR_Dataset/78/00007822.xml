The '''Caribbean Sea''' ({{lang-es|Mar Caribe}}; {{lang-ht|lamè Karayib}}; {{lang-fr|Mer des Caraïbes}}; {{lang-jam|Kiaribiyan Sii}}; {{lang-pap|Laman Karibe}}; {{lang-nl|Caraïbische Zee}}) is an [[American Mediterranean Sea]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere. It is bounded by Mexico and Central America to the west and south west, to the north by the [[Greater Antilles]] starting with [[Cuba]], to the east by the [[Lesser Antilles]], and to the south by the north coast of [[South America]].

The entire area of the Caribbean Sea, the numerous islands of the [[West Indies]], and adjacent coasts, are collectively known as the [[Caribbean]]. The Caribbean Sea is one of the largest seas and has an area of about {{cvt|2754000|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allthesea.com/Caribbean-Sea.html The Caribbean Sea] All The Sea.

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|left|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] landing on [[Hispaniola]] in 1492.]]
The name &quot;Caribbean&quot; derives from the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], one of the region's dominant [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups at the time of [[Europe]]an contact during the late 15th century. After [[Christopher Columbus]] landed in [[the Bahamas]] in 1492, the Spanish term ''[[Antillas]]'' applied to the lands; stemming from this, &quot;Sea of the Antilles&quot; became a common alternative name for &quot;Caribbean Sea&quot; in various European languages. During the first century of development, Spanish dominance in the region remained undisputed.

From the 16th century, Europeans visiting the Caribbean region identified the [[Great South Sea|&quot;South Sea&quot;]] (the Pacific Ocean, to the south of the isthmus of Panama) as opposed to the &quot;North Sea&quot; (the Caribbean Sea, to the north of the same isthmus).&lt;ref&gt;

The Caribbean Sea had been unknown to the populations of Eurasia until 1492, when Christopher Columbus sailed into Caribbean waters on a quest to find a sea route to Asia. At that time the [[Western Hemisphere]] in general was unknown to most Europeans, although it had been discovered between the years 800 and 1000 by the [[vikings]]. Following the discovery of the islands by Columbus, the area was quickly colonized by several Western cultures (initially [[Spain#Imperial Spain|Spain]], then later [[England#Early Modern|England]], the [[History of the Netherlands#The Dutch in the Americas|Dutch Republic]], [[French colonial empire#The Americas|France]], [[Couronian colonization of the Americas|Courland]] and [[Danish colonization of the Americas#West Indies|Denmark]]). Following the colonization of the Caribbean islands, the Caribbean Sea became a busy area for European-based marine trading and transports, and this commerce eventually attracted [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]] such as [[Samuel Bellamy]] and [[Blackbeard]].

{{As of | 2015}} the area is home to 22 island [[territories]] and borders 12 continental [[countries]].

==Extent==
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Caribbean Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''On the North.'' In the [[Windward Passage|Windward Channel]] – a line joining Caleta Point (74°15′W) and Pearl Point (19°40′N) in [[Haiti|Haïti]]. In the [[Mona Passage]] – a line joining [[Cape Engaño (Dominican Republic)|Cape Engaño]] and the extreme of Agujereada ({{coord|18|31|N|67|08|W|display=inline}}) in [[Puerto Rico]].

[[File:Anegada Horseshoe Reef.jpg|thumb|Coral reefs in the [[British Virgin Islands]]]]
::''Eastern limits.'' From [[Point San Diego]] (Puerto Rico) Northward along the meridian thereof (65°39′W) to the 100-fathom line, thence Eastward and Southward, in such a manner that all islands, shoals and narrow waters of the [[Lesser Antilles]] are included in the Caribbean Sea as far as [[Galera Point]] (Northeast extremity of the island of [[Trinidad]]). From Galera Point through Trinidad to Galeota Point (Southeast extreme) and thence to Baja Point ({{coord|9|32|N|61|0|W|display=inline}}) in [[Venezuela]].

Note that, although [[Barbados]] is an island on the same continental shelf, it is considered to be in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Caribbean Sea.

==Geology==
The Caribbean Sea is an oceanic sea largely situated on the [[Caribbean Plate]]. The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several [[island arc]]s of various ages. The youngest stretches from the [[Lesser Antilles]] to the [[Virgin Islands]] to the north east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. This arc was formed by the collision of the [[South American Plate]] with the [[Caribbean Plate]] and includes active and extinct [[volcanoes]] such as [[Mount Pelee]], [[the Quill (volcano)]] on [[Sint Eustatius]] in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] and [[Morne Trois Pitons]] on [[Dominica]]. The larger islands in the northern part of the sea [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Puerto Rico]] lie on an older island arc.

The geological age of the Caribbean Sea is estimated to be between 160 and 180&amp;nbsp;million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangea]] in the [[Mesozoic Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Iturralde-Vinent, Manuel (2004), The first inhabitants of the Caribbean , Cuban Science Network . URL accessed on 28/07/2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the [[Devonian]] period. In the early [[Carboniferous]] movement of [[Gondwana]] to the north and its convergence with the [[Euramerica]] basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the [[Triassic]]. Powerful [[rifting]] led to the formation of narrow troughs, stretching from modern [[Newfoundland]] to the west coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] which formed [[siliciclastic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s. In the early [[Jurassic]] due to powerful [[marine transgression]], water broke into the present area of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the [[Middle Jurassic]] [[rifting]]. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and contributed to the destruction of [[Pangaea]] at the end of the late [[Jurassic]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early [[Paleogene]] due to [[Marine regression]] the Caribbean became separated from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by the land of [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The Caribbean remained like this for most of the [[Cenozoic]] until the [[Holocene]] when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.

The Caribbean's floor is composed of sub-oceanic [[sediments]] of [[deep red clay]] in the deep basins and troughs. On continental slopes and ridges [[calcareous]] [[silt]]s are found. [[Clay minerals]] likely having been deposited by the mainland river [[Orinoco]] and the [[Magdalena River]]. Deposits on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico have a thickness of about {{cvt|1|km}}. Upper sedimentary layers relate to the period from the [[Mesozoic]] to the [[Cenozoic]] (250&amp;nbsp;million years ago to present) and the lower layers from the [[Paleozoic]] to the [[Mesozoic]].
[[File:Caribbean plate tectonics-en.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Caribbean plate tectonics]]

The Caribbean sea floor is divided into five [[Oceanic basin|basins]] separated from each other by underwater ridges and mountain ranges. Atlantic Ocean water enters the Caribbean through the ''Anegada Passage'' lying between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Virgin Islands]] and the ''Windward Passage'' located between [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The [[Yucatán Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba links the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the Caribbean. The deepest points of the sea lie in [[Cayman Trough]] with depths reaching approximately {{cvt|7686|m|-1}}. Despite this, the Caribbean Sea is considered a relatively shallow sea in comparison to other bodies of water.
The pressure of the [[South American Plate]] to the east of the Caribbean causes the region of the [[Lesser Antilles]] to have high volcanic activity. There was a very serious eruption of [[Mount Pelée]] in 1902 which caused many casualties.

The Caribbean sea floor is also home to two [[oceanic trench]]es: the [[Cayman Trench]] and [[Puerto Rico Trench]], which put the area at a high risk of [[earthquake]]s. Underwater earthquakes pose a threat of generating [[tsunami]]s which could have a devastating effect on the Caribbean islands. Scientific data reveals that over the last 500 years the area has seen a dozen earthquakes above 7.5 magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Dawicki | first = Shelley | url = http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=3964 | title = Tsunamis in the Caribbean?

==Oceanography==
[[File:Golfstream.jpg|thumb|Sketch of the [[North Equatorial Current]] and the [[Gulf Stream]]]]
The [[hydrology]] of the sea has a high level of homogeneity. Annual variations in monthly average water temperatures at the surface do not exceed {{cvt|3|C-change}}. Over the past fifty years the Caribbean has gone through three stages: cooling until 1974; a cold phase with peaks during 1974–1976 and 1984–1986 then; a warming phase with an increase in temperature of {{cvt|0.6|C-change}} per year. Virtually all temperature extremes were associated with the phenomena of [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]]. The [[salinity]] of seawater is about 3.6% and its [[density]] is {{cvt|1023.5|-|1024.0|kg/m3|lb/cuft}}. The surface water colour is blue-green to green.

The Caribbean's depth in its wider basins and deep water temperatures are similar to those of the Atlantic. Atlantic deep water is thought to spill into the Caribbean and contribute to the general deep water of its sea.&lt;ref&gt;Pernetta, John. (2004). Guide to the Oceans. Buffalo, NY: Firefly Books, Inc. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-1-55297-942-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surface water (30 m; 100 feet) acts as an extension of the northern Atlantic as the Guiana Current and part of the [[North Equatorial Current]] enter the sea on the east. On the western side of the sea the [[trade winds]] influence a northerly current which causes an [[upwelling]] and a rich fishery near Yucatán.&lt;ref&gt;Pernetta, John. (2004). Guide to the Oceans. Buffalo, NY: Firefly Books, Inc. pp. 177–178. {{ISBN|978-1-55297-942-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The Caribbean is home to about 9% of the world's [[coral reef]]s covering about {{convert|50000|km2|abbr=on}}, most of which are located off the Caribbean Islands and the [[Central America]]n coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marine.wri.org/pubs_content_text.cfm?ContentID=744 Status of coral reefs in the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621003446/http://marine.wri.org/pubs_content_text.cfm?ContentID=744 |date=June 21, 2006 }} World Resource Institute. URL accessed on April 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them stands out the [[Belize Barrier Reef]] with an area of {{cvt|963|km2}} which was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996. It forms part of the [[Great Mayan Reef]] also known as the [[MBRS]] and being over {{cvt|1000|km|-2}} in length is the world's second longest. It runs along the Caribbean coasts of [[Mexico]], [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]].

During the past ten years,{{when|date=November 2015}} unusually warm Caribbean waters have been increasingly [[Coral bleaching|threatening Caribbean coral reefs]]. Coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called [[zooxanthellae]], which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called [[coral bleaching]], and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef. Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/03/mesoamerican-coral-reef-on-the-way-to-becoming-a-marine-desert/] Inter Press Service News Agency – Mesoamerican Coral Reef on the way to becoming a Marine Desert&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;Elder, Danny and Pernetta, John.

The habitats supported by the reefs are critical to such tourist activities as [[fishing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]], and provide an annual economic value to Caribbean nations of [[US$]]3.1–4.6&amp;nbsp;billion. Continued destruction of the reefs could severely damage the region's economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3679332.stm Alarm sounded for Caribbean coral]. BBC News.

In connection with the foregoing, the Institute of Marine Sciences and Limnology of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], conducted a regional study, funded by the Department of Technical Cooperation of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], in which specialists from 11 Latin American countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Dominican Republic, Venezuela plus Jamaica) participated. The findings indicate that heavy metals such as mercury, arsenic, and lead, have been identified in the coastal zone of the Caribbean Sea. Analysis of toxic metals and hydrocarbons is based on the investigation of coastal sediments that have accumulated less than 50 meters deep during the last hundred and fifty years. The project results were presented in Vienna in the forum &quot;Water Matters&quot;, and the 2011 General Conference of said multilateral organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgcs.unam.mx/boletin/bdboletin/2012_046.html Analysis of Contaminants in the Caribbean Sea over the last 150 years].

==Climate==
[[File:NASA ASMR-E image of average SSTs of Hurricane Katrina.jpg|thumb|right|Average sea surface temperatures for the Caribbean Atlantic Ocean (25–27 August 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/hurricane_record.html|title=NASA – NASA Satellites Record a Month for the Hurricane History Books|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hurricane Katrina]] is seen just above [[Cuba]].]]

The climate of the Caribbean is driven by the low latitude and tropical ocean currents that run through it. The principal ocean current is the [[North Equatorial Current]], which enters the region from the tropical [[Atlantic]]. The climate of the area is [[tropical]], varying from [[tropical rainforest]] in some areas to [[tropical savanna]] in others. There are also some locations that are [[arid]] climates with considerable drought in some years.

Rainfall varies with elevation, size and water currents (cool upwelling keep the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] arid). Warm, moist [[trade winds]] blow consistently from the east, creating both rain forest and semi arid climates across the region. The tropical rainforest climates include lowland areas near the Caribbean Sea from [[Costa Rica]] north to [[Belize]], as well as the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Puerto Rico]], while the more seasonal dry tropical savanna climates are found in [[Cuba]], northern [[Venezuela]], and southern [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán, Mexico]]. Arid climates are found along the extreme southern coast of Venezuela out to the islands including [[Aruba]] and [[Curaçao]], as well as the northern tip of Yucatán&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Alvin (1998) Weather And Climate (Science Concepts); page 17. 21st Century. {{ISBN|0-7613-3223-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tropical cyclones]] are a threat to the nations that rim the Caribbean Sea. While landfalls are infrequent, the resulting loss of life and property damage makes them significant hazard to life in the Caribbean. Tropical cyclones that impact the Caribbean often develop off the West coast of [[Africa]] and make their way west across the Atlantic Ocean toward the Caribbean, while other storms develop in the Caribbean itself. The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, with the majority of hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the [[National Hurricane Center]] 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.

==Flora and fauna==
The region has a high level of [[biodiversity]] and many species are [[endemic]] to the Caribbean.

===Vegetation===
The vegetation of the region is mostly [[tropical]] but differences in [[topography]], soil and climatic conditions increase [[species diversity]]. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are [[endemic]]. For example, guaiac wood (''[[Guaiacum officinale]]''), the flower of which is the national flower of [[Jamaica]] and the Bayahibe rose (''[[Pereskia quisqueyana]]'') which is the national flower of the [[Dominican Republic]] and the [[ceiba]] which is the national tree of both [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The [[mahogany]] is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and [[Belize]]. The caimito (''[[Chrysophyllum cainito]]'') grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are [[coconut palms]] and in [[lagoons]] and [[estuaries]] are found thick areas of [[Avicennia germinans|black mangrove]] and red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'').

In shallow water [[flora]] and [[fauna]] is concentrated around [[coral reefs]] where there is little variation in water temperature, purity and salinity. Leeward side of [[lagoons]] provide areas of growth for [[sea grass]]es. Turtle grass (''[[Thalassia testudinum]]'') is common in the Caribbean as is manatee grass (''[[Syringodium filiforme]]'') which can grow together as well as in fields of single species at depths up to {{cvt|20|m}}. Another type shoal grass (''[[Halodule wrightii]]'') grows on sand and mud surfaces at depths of up to {{cvt|5|m}}. In [[brackish water]] of harbours and estuaries at depths less than {{cvt|2.5|m}} widgeongrass (''[[Ruppia maritima]]'') grows. Representatives of three species belonging to the genus ''[[Halophila]]'', (''[[Halophila baillonii]]'', ''[[Halophila engelmannii]]'' and ''[[Halophila decipiens]]'') are found at depths of up to {{cvt|30|m}} except for ''Halophila engelmani'' which does not grow below {{cvt|5|m}} and is confined to the [[Bahamas]], [[Florida]], the [[Greater Antilles]] and the western part of the Caribbean. ''Halophila baillonii'' has been found only in the [[Lesser Antilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111215112552/http://www.seagrasswatch.org/Caribbean.html Caribbean seagrass].

Marine [[biota (ecology)|biota]] in the region have representatives of both the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans which were caught in the Caribbean before the emergence of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] four million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Robert James Menzies, John C Ogden. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/95846/Caribbean-Sea &quot;Caribbean Sea&quot;]. Britannica Online Encyclopaedia.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Caribbean Sea there are around 1,000 documented species of fish, including [[sharks]] ([[bull shark]], [[tiger shark]], [[silky shark]] and [[Caribbean reef shark]]), [[flying fish]], [[giant oceanic manta ray]], [[Pomacanthidae|angel fish]], [[spotfin butterflyfish]], [[parrotfish]], [[Atlantic Goliath grouper]], [[tarpon]] and [[moray eels]]. Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of [[lobster]] and [[sardines]] (off the coast of [[Yucatán Peninsula]]).

There are 90 species of [[mammal]]s in the Caribbean including [[sperm whale]]s, [[humpback whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s. The island of [[Jamaica]] is home to [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[manatees]]. The [[Caribbean monk seal]] which lived in the Caribbean is considered extinct. The [[solenodon]] is [[endangered]].

There are 500 species of [[reptile]]s (94% of which are [[endemic]]). Islands are inhabited by some endemic species such as [[Cyclura|rock iguanas]] and [[American crocodile]]. The [[blue iguana]], endemic to the island of [[Grand Cayman]], is endangered. The [[green iguana]] is invasive to [[Grand Cayman]].  The [[Mona ground iguana]] which inhabits the island of [[Mona, Puerto Rico]], is endangered. The [[rhinoceros iguana]] from the island of [[Hispaniola]] which is shared between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] is also endangered. The region has several types of [[sea turtle]] ([[Loggerhead sea turtle|loggerhead]], [[green turtle]], [[hawksbill]], [[leatherback turtle]], [[Atlantic ridley]] and [[olive ridley sea turtle|olive ridley]]). Some species are threatened with extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Severin Carrell, [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/caribbean-sea-turtles-close-to-extinction-534854.html &quot;Caribbean Sea Turtles Close to Extinction&quot;], ''[[The Independent]]'', 28 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Their populations have been greatly reduced since the 17th century – the number of green turtles has declined from 91&amp;nbsp;million to 300,000 and hawksbill turtles from 11&amp;nbsp;million to less than 30,000 by 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120711211016/http://news.mongabay.com/2006/0801-turtles.html Historic Caribbean Sea Turtle Population falls 99%. Plunge has significant ecological consequences]. Mongabay.com (August 1, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

All 170 species of [[amphibians]] that live in the region are endemic. The habitats of almost all members of the [[toad]] family, [[poison dart frogs]], [[tree frogs]] and [[leptodactylidae]] (a type of frog) are limited to only one island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation.org/where/priority_areas/hotspots/north_central_america/Caribbean-Islands/Pages/default.aspx Conservation International Caribbean Islands], Threatened Species.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eleutherodactylus jasperi|Golden coqui]] is in serious threat of extinction.

In the Caribbean 600 species of birds have been recorded of which 163 are [[endemic]] such as the [[tody]], [[Fernandina's flicker]] and [[palmchat]]. The [[American yellow warbler]] is found in many areas as is the [[green heron]]. Of the endemic species 48 are threatened with extinction including the [[Puerto Rican amazon]], [[yellow-breasted crake]] and the [[Zapata wren]]. According to Birdlife International in 2006 in [[Cuba]] 29 species of bird are in danger of extinction and two species officially extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/americas/news/vertebrates-get-red-list-treatment-cuba &quot;Birdlife International&quot;] – Red List Cuba.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black-fronted piping guan]] is endangered as is the [[plain pigeon]]. [[The Antilles]] along with [[Central America]] lie in the flight path of [[migrating birds]] from North America so the size of populations is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the forests are found [[parrots]], [[bananaquit]] and [[toucans]]. Over the open sea can be seen [[frigatebirds]] and [[tropicbirds]].

==Economy and human activity==
[[File:Panorámica de San Andres.JPG|thumb|A view of [[San Andrés (island)|San Andrés island]], Colombia.]]
The Caribbean region has seen a significant increase in human activity since the colonization period. The sea is one of the largest oil production areas in the world, producing approximately 170&amp;nbsp;million {{clarify|text=tons|reason=metric tonnes, long tons or short tons?|date=June 2017}} per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;marinepollution&quot;&gt;[http://www.cep.unep.org/issues/lbsp.html An Overview of Land Based Sources of Marine Pollution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207011407/http://www.cep.unep.org/issues/lbsp.html |date=2006-12-07 }} Caribbean Environment Programme. URL last accessed May 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The area also generates a large fishing industry for the surrounding countries, accounting for {{convert|500000|t}} of fish a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/lme/text/lme12.htm#fish LME 12: Caribbean Sea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504182758/http://na.nefsc.noaa.gov/lme/text/lme12.htm |date=2006-05-04 }} NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center Narragansett Laboratory. URL last accessed May 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activity in the area also accounts for a significant amount of [[pollution]], The Pan American Health Organization estimated in 1993 that only about 10% of the sewage from the Central American and Caribbean Island countries is properly treated before being released into the sea.&lt;ref name=marinepollution/&gt;

The Caribbean region supports a large [[tourism]] industry. The [[Caribbean Tourism Organization]] calculates that about 12&amp;nbsp;million people a year visit the area, including (in 1991–1992) about 8&amp;nbsp;million cruise ship tourists. Tourism based upon [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]] on [[coral reefs]] of many Caribbean islands makes a major contribution to their economies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/publication/content/7909 Reefs at Risk in the Caribbean: Economic Valuation Methodology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227165202/http://www.wri.org/publication/content/7909 |date=2012-02-27 }} World Resources Institute 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
