A '''planned economy''' is a type of [[economic system]] where [[investment]], [[Production (economics)|production]] and the allocation of [[capital good]]s take place according to economy-wide economic plans and production plans. A planned economy may use [[Centralization |centralized]], [[Decentralized planning (economics)| decentralized]] or [[Participatory economics| participatory]] forms of [[economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alec Nove]] (1987). &quot;Planned Economy&quot;. ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]''. vol. 3. p. 879.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Devine|first= Pat|title= Democracy and Economic Planning|publisher= Polity|date= 26 July 2010|isbn= 978-0745634791|page= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2019}} 

The majority of countries adopting [[socialism]] (including those based on the Soviet model) have used central planning, though a minority (such as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]) have adopted some degree of [[market socialism]]. Non-market socialism replaces [[factor market]]s with direct calculation as the means to coordinate the activities of the various [[Social ownership| socially-owned]] economic enterprises that make up the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Prychito|first= David L.|title= Markets, Planning, and Democracy: Essays After the Collapse of Communism|publisher= Edward Elgar Publishing|date= 31 July 2002|isbn= 978-1840645194|page= 72|quote= Traditional socialism strives to plan all economic activities comprehensively, both within and between enterprises.

Paul (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''command economy''' or '''administrative command economy''' may refer to the economy of a country using [[Soviet-type economic planning]] which was characteristic of the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] before most of these countries converted to market economies. These terms highlight the central role of hierarchical administration and public ownership of production in guiding the allocation of resources in these economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Comparing Economic Systems: A Political-Economic Approach|last= Zimbalist, Sherman and Brown|first= Andrew, Howard J. and Stuart|date= October 1988|publisher= Harcourt College Pub|isbn= 978-0-15-512403-5|page= [https://archive.org/details/comparingeconomi0000zimb_q8i6/page/4 4]|quote= Almost all industry in the Soviet Union is government owned and all production is directed, in theory, by a central plan (though in practice much is left for local discretion and much happens that is unplanned or not under government control).|url= https://archive.org/details/comparingeconomi0000zimb_q8i6/page/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy, 1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wilhelm|first= John Howard|year= 1985|title= The Soviet Union Has an Administered, Not a Planned, Economy|journal= [[Europe-Asia Studies |Soviet Studies]]|volume= 37|issue= 1|pages= 118–30|doi= 10.1080/09668138508411571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti|last= Ellman|first= Michael|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year= 2007|isbn= 0-230-54697-8|editor1-last= Estrin|editor1-first= Saul|location= New York|page= 22|chapter= The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning|quote= In the USSR in the late 1980s the system was normally referred to as the 'administrative-command' economy.

Planned economies contrast with [[unplanned economies]], specifically [[Market economy |market economies]], where autonomous firms operating in [[Market (economics)|market]]s make decisions about production, distribution, pricing and investment. Market economies that use [[indicative planning]] can be referred to{{by whom?|date=October 2019}} as planned market economies.

== Planned versus command economies ==
{{main|Economic planning}}
Planned economies contrast with command economies. A planned economy is &quot;an economic system in which the government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reference1&quot;&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/planned%20economy &quot;Planned economy&quot;]. Dictionary.com. Unabridged (v. 1.1). Random House, Inc. Retrieved 11 May 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a command economy necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry while also having this type of regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/command%20economy &quot;Command economy&quot;]. ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''. Retrieved 11 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of a command economy is organized in a top-down administrative model by a central authority, where decisions regarding investment and production output requirements are decided upon at the top in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]], with little input from lower levels. Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writings 1932–33|page=96|first=Leon|last=Trotsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historians have associated planned economies with [[Marxist–Leninist state]]s and the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]], some argue{{weasel inline|date=January 2018}} that the Soviet economic model did not actually constitute a planned economy in that a comprehensive and binding plan did not guide production and investment, therefore the further distinction of an administrative command economy emerged as a more accurate designation for the economic system that existed in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]], highlighting the role of centralized hierarchical decision-making in the absence of popular control over the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellman|first=Michael|chapter=The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning|title=Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti|editor1-first= Saul|editor1-last=Estrin|editor2-first=Grzegorz W.|editor2-last=Kołodko|editor3-first=Milica|editor3-last=Uvalić|location= New York|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=0-230-54697-8|page=22|quote=Realization of these facts led in the 1970s and 1980s to the development of new terms to describe what had previously been (and still were in United Nations publications) referred to as the 'centrally planned economies'. In the USSR in the late 1980s the system was normally referred to as the 'administrative-command' economy. What was fundamental to this system was not the plan but the role of administrative hierarchies at all levels of decision making; the absence of control over decision making by the population [...].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a digital planned economy was explored in Chile between 1971 and 1973 with the development of [[Project Cybersyn]] and by {{ill|Alexander Kharkevich|ru|Харкевич, Александр Александрович}}, head of the Department of Technical Physics in Kiev in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csef.ru/en/politica-i-geopolitica/223/mashiny-kommunizma-pochemu-v-sssr-tak-i-ne-sozdali-svoj-internet-6983 &quot;Machine of communism. Why the USSR did not create the Internet&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kharkevich|first1= Aleksandr Aleksandrovich|title=Theory of information. The identification of the images.

Institute of information transmission problems|location=Information and technology|page= 524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key point is that command economies are inherently [[authoritarian]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2019|reason=Supposition with no evidence provided}} whereas economic planning in general can be either [[Participatory economics|participatory and democratic]] or authoritarian. [[Indicative planning]] is a form of planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and mixed economies{{which|date=September 2018}} the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries, such as the aerospace industry. Mixed economies usually employ [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] planning while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.

Note too the utilization of [[dirigisme]], or government direction of the economy through non-coercive means, as practiced in France and in Great Britain after [[World War II]]. The Swedish government planned public-housing models in a similar fashion as [[urban planning]] in a project called [[Million Programme]], implemented from 1965 to 1974.

In the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and post-Hellenistic world, &quot;compulsory state planning was the most characteristic trade condition for the [[Hellenistic Egypt|Egyptian]] countryside, for [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Hellenistic India]], and to a lesser degree the more barbaric regions of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], the [[Kingdom of Pergamon|Pergamenian]], the southern [[Arabia]]n, and the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] empires&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heichelheim|first1=Friedrich Moritz|author-link1=Fritz Heichelheim|orig-year=1949|chapter=Commerce, Greek and Roman|editor1-last=Hammond|editor1-first=Nicholas G.

One view of [[mercantilism]] sees it as a planned economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Blaug|editor1-first=Mark|editor1-link=Mark Blaug|title=The Early mercantilists: Thomas Mun (1571–1641), Edward Misselden (1608–1634), Gerard de Malynes (1586–1623)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dua5AAAAIAAJ|series=Pioneers in economics|issue=4|publisher=E.

Scholars have argued that the [[Inca Empire|Incan]] economy was a flexible type of command economy, centered around the movement and utilization of labor instead of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=La Lone, Darrell E.|title=The Inca as a Nonmarket Economy: Supply on Command versus Supply and Demand|page=292|url=https://www.academia.edu/885136/The_Inca_as_a_nonmarket_economy_Supply_on_command_versus_supply_and_demand|accessdate=17 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-style planned economy started with [[war communism]] (1918–1921). The Soviet government founded [[Gosplan]] in 1921, but the period of the [[New Economic Policy]] intervened before regular [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] started in 1928.

== Advantages of economic planning ==
{{expand section|date=April 2019|Anti-authoritarian, anti-state, democratic and decentralized forms}}
The government can harness land, labours and capital to serve the economic objectives of the state. Consumer demand can be restrained in favor of greater capital investment for economic development in a desired pattern. In international comparisons, state-socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Ellman]] (2014). ''Socialist Planning''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4L2ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA372#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 372]. {{ISBN|1107427320}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The state can begin building a heavy industry at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry and without reliance on external financing. This is what happened in the Soviet Union during the 1930s when the government forced the share of [[gross national income]] dedicated to private consumption from eighty percent to fifty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers|url=https://archive.org/details/risefallofgreatp00kenn|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1987|isbn=0-394-54674-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/risefallofgreatp00kenn/page/322 322–3]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Soviet Union experienced massive growth in heavy industry, with a concurrent massive contraction of its agricultural sector due to labour shortage, in both relative and absolute terms. There is also no business cycle in a planned economy, and there is usually low unemployment and low homelessness.

== Disadvantages of economic planning ==
{{expand section|date=April 2019|Anti-authoritarian, anti-state, democratic and decentralized forms}}

=== Inefficient resource distribution: surplus and shortage ===
Critics of planned economies argue that planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production (in a [[market economy]], a [[free price system]] is intended to serve this purpose). This difficulty was notably written about by economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], who referred to subtly distinct aspects of the problem as the [[economic calculation problem]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mises&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth|accessdate=8 September 2008|last=Von Mises|first=Ludwig|authorlink=Ludwig von Mises|year=1990|format=PDF|publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]|url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[local knowledge problem]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AER519-30&quot;&gt;Hayek, Friedrich A. (1945). &quot;[[The Use of Knowledge in Society|The Use of Knowledge]]&quot;. ''American Economic Review''. XXXV: 4. pp. 519-30.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Whereas the former stressed the theoretical underpinnings of a market economy to [[subjective value theory]] while attacking the [[labor theory of value]], the latter argued that the only way to satisfy individuals who have a constantly changing hierarchy of needs and are the only ones to possess their particular individual's circumstances is by allowing those with the most knowledge of their needs to have it in their power to use their resources in a competing marketplace to meet the needs of the most consumers most efficiently. This phenomenon is recognized as [[spontaneous order]]. Additionally, misallocation of resources would naturally ensue by redirecting capital away from individuals with direct knowledge and circumventing it into markets where a coercive monopoly influences behavior, ignoring market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan: &quot;Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals&quot;.&lt;ref name=tibor2001&gt;{{cite book|last=Machan|first=R. Tibor|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817929428_xi.pdf|title=Liberty and Research and Development: Science Funding in a Free Society|chapter=Some Skeptical Reflections on Research and Development|publisher=Hoover Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8179-2942-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suppression of economic democracy and self-management ===
Economist [[Robin Hahnel]], who supports [[participatory economics]], a form of [[socialist]] [[decentralized planned economy]], notes that even if central planning overcame its inherent inhibitions of incentives and innovation, it would nevertheless be unable to maximize economic democracy and self-management, which he believes are concepts that are more intellectually coherent, consistent and just than mainstream notions of economic freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnel, Robin 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hahnel|first=Robin|title=The ABC's of Political Economy|location=London|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2002|isbn=0-7453-1858-4|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Hahnel states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Combined with a more democratic political system, and redone to closer approximate a best case version, centrally planned economies no doubt would have performed better. But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential [[economic power]] grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnel, Robin 2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Economic instability ===
Studies of [[Command economy|administrative command economies]] of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the 1950s and 1960s by both American and Eastern European economists found that contrary to the expectations of both groups they showed greater fluctuations in [[Output (economics)|output]] than market economies during the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Reforms in Polish Industry&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Zielinski|first=J. G.|title=Economic Reforms in Polish Industry|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1973|isbn=0-19-215323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with socialism ==
{{main|Socialism}}
While socialism is not equivalent to economic planning or to the concept of a planned economy, an influential conception of socialism involves the replacement of capital markets with some form of economic planning in order to achieve [[ex-ante]] coordination of the economy. The goal of such an economic system would be to achieve conscious control over the economy by the population, specifically so that the use of the [[surplus product]] is controlled by the producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feinstein|first=C. H.|title=Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth: Essays Presented to Maurice Dobb|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1975|isbn=0-521-29007-4|page=174|quote=We have presented the view that planning and market mechanisms are instruments that can be used both in socialist and non-socialist societies. [...] It was important to explode the primitive identification of central planning and socialism and to stress the instrumental character of planning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific forms of planning proposed for socialism and their feasibility are subjects of the [[socialist calculation debate]].

== Computational economic planning ==
In their book ''Towards a New Socialism'' (1993), the computer scientist [[Paul Cockshott]] from the [[University of Glasgow]] and the economist Allin Cottrell from the [[Wake Forest University]] claim to demonstrate how a democratically planned economy built on modern computer technology is possible and drives the thesis that it would be both economically more stable than the free market economies and also morally desirable.

When the development of computer technology was still its early stages in 1971, the socialist [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|Allende administration]] of Chile launched [[Project Cybersyn]] to install a telex machine in every corporation and organisation in the economy for the communication of economic data between firms and the government. The data was also fed into a computer simulated economy for forecasting. A control room was built for realtime observation and management of the overall economy. The prototype-stage of the project showed promise when it was used to redirect supplies around a trucker's strike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eden Medina|title=Designing Freedom, Regulating a Nation: Socialist Cybernetics in Allende's Chile|journal=J. Lat. Am. Stud.|number=38|pages=571–606|doi=10.1017/S0022216X06001179|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after CIA-backed [[Augusto Pinochet]] led a [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup in 1973]] that established a [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990)|military dictatorship]] under his rule the program was abolished and Pinochet moved Chile towards a more [[Economic liberalization|liberalized]] [[market economy]].

== Fictional portrayals of planned economies ==
The 1888 novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] depicts a fictional planned economy in a United States around the year 2000 which has become a socialist utopia.

The [[World State in Brave New World|World State]] in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' and [[Airstrip One]] in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' are both fictional examples of command economies, albeit with diametrically opposed aims. The former is a [[consumer economy]] designed to engender productivity while the latter is a [[shortage economy]] designed as an agent of totalitarian social control. Airstrip One is organized by the euphemistically named Ministry of Plenty.

Other literary portrayals of planned economies were [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' which was an influence on Orwell's work. Like ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', [[Ayn Rand]]'s dystopian story ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was also an artistic portrayal of a command economy that was influenced by ''We''. The difference is that it was a [[primitivist]] planned economy as opposed to the advanced technology of ''We'' or ''Brave New World''.
