'''David Keith Lynch''' (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, singer, sound designer, photographer, and actor. He is best known for writing and directing films such as ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), which are often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/lynchdavid.htm |title=David Lynch's Acclaimed Films |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade |title=Film Critics Pick the Best Movies of the Decade |website=Metacritic |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for his successful television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991). These works led to him being labeled &quot;the first popular [[Surrealist]]&quot; by film critic [[Pauline Kael]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Pauline Kael, quoted in Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; A recipient of an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 2019, he has received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Have 3-Time Academy Award-Nominated Filmmaker David Lynch Review Your Screenplay in LA|url=http://www.charitybuzz.com/auctions/DavidLynchFoundation/catalog_items/311513|work=charitybuzz|publisher=Charitybuzz Inc|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=charitybuzz|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has won the [[César Award for Best Foreign Film]] twice, as well as the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cannes-1990.com&quot; /&gt; and a [[Golden Lion]] award for lifetime achievement at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. He has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as &quot;the most important director of this era&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html |title=40 best directors |publisher=The Guardian Online |year=2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704012453/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/page/0,11456,1082823,00.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 |url-status=live |location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[AllMovie]] called him &quot;the [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] of modern American filmmaking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Ankeny | first = Jason | url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/david-lynch-100454 |title=David Lynch: Biography |website=AllMovie |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to a middle-class family in [[Missoula, Montana]], Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the U.S. before he studied painting at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he first made the transition to producing short films. He then moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he produced his first film, the surrealist horror ''Eraserhead'' (1977). After ''Eraserhead'' became a success on the [[midnight movie]] circuit, Lynch was hired to direct the biographical film ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), from which he gained mainstream success. He was then employed by the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] and proceeded to make two films: the sci-fi epic ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and the [[neo-noir]] mystery film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), which initially stirred controversy over its depiction of violence but later grew in reputation until it was critically acclaimed.

Lynch next created his own television series with [[Mark Frost]], the popular murder mystery ''Twin Peaks'' (1990–1991), which ran for two seasons. He also created the film prequel ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), the road film ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990), and the family film ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic [[non-linear narrative]] structures: ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006). Meanwhile, he embraced the Internet as a medium and produced several web-based shows, such as the animated series ''[[DumbLand]]'' (2002) and the surreal sitcom ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'' (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited in 2017 for a [[Twin Peaks (season 3)|third season]] of ''Twin Peaks'', which aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his onscreen role as Gordon Cole.

Lynch's other artistic endeavours include his work as a musician, encompassing the studio albums ''[[BlueBOB]]'' (2001), ''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Big Dream]]'' (2013), as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing the books ''[[Images (book)|Images]]'' (1994), ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (2006), and ''Room to Dream'' (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the [[Dior]] promotional film ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' (2006). An avid practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation]] (TM), he founded the [[David Lynch Foundation]] in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees. In 2019, he received an Academy Honorary Award, which was his first Oscar win.

David Keith Lynch was born in [[Missoula, Montana]] on January 20, 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Donald Walton Lynch (1915–2007), was a research scientist working for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), and his mother, Edwina &quot;Sunny&quot; Lynch (née Sundholm; 1919–2004), was an English language tutor. Two of Lynch's maternal great-grandparents were [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swedish]] immigrants who arrived in the U.S. during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nojesguiden.se/artiklar/david-lynch-%E2%80%9Dden-haer-vaerlden-aer-full-av-hat-och-angest%E2%80%9D David Lynch: &quot;Den Här Världen Är Full Av Hat Och Ångest&quot;] {{in lang|sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised a [[Presbyterian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Williams, Alex|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|title=David Lynch's Shockingly Peaceful Inner Life|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 31, 2007|accessdate=November 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130910174717/http://www.culteducation.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|archivedate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sadighian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Sadighian, David|url=http://www.globalgoodnews.com/education-news-a.html?art=1128100751793764|title=David Lynch thinks we're all lightbulbs. What?|newspaper=Yale Daily News|date=October 1, 2005|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lynch family often moved around according to where the USDA assigned Donald. It was because of this that Lynch, when he was two months old, moved with his parents to [[Sandpoint, Idaho]]; two years later, following the birth of his brother John, the family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]]. It was here that Lynch's sister Martha was born. The family then moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], followed by [[Boise, Idaho]], and then [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Lynch adjusted to this transitory early life with relative ease, noting that he usually had no issue making new friends whenever he started attending a new school.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on much of his early life, he remarked:

{{cquote|I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school&amp;nbsp;... for me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alongside his schooling, Lynch joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], although he would later note that he only &quot;became [a Scout] so I could quit and put it behind me&quot;. He rose to the highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. As an Eagle Scout, he was present with other Boy Scouts outside the [[White House]] at [[United States presidential inauguration|the inauguration]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which took place on Lynch's 15th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 05.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch had also been interested in painting and drawing from an early age, and became intrigued by the idea of pursuing it as a career path when living in Virginia, where his friend's father was a professional painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Lynch did not excel academically, having little interest in school work; however, he was popular with other students, and after leaving he decided that he wanted to study painting at college. He began his studies at the [[Corcoran School of the Arts and Design]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], before transferring to the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Boston]] in 1964, where he was roommates with musician [[Peter Wolf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://corcoran.gwu.edu/notable-alumni GW Corcoran - Notable Alumni]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter'sBio|url=http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|work=Peter Wolf|publisher=Peter Wolf|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=Wolf, Peter|year=2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615152715/http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|archivedate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left after only a year, stating, &quot;I was not inspired AT ALL in that place.&quot; He instead decided that he wanted to travel around Europe for three years with his friend [[Jack Fisk]], who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [[Cooper Union]]. They had some hopes that they could train in Europe with Austrian [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]] at his school. Upon reaching [[Salzburg]], however, they found that Kokoschka was not available; disillusioned, they returned to the United States after spending only two weeks of their planned three years in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===1966–1970: Philadelphia and short films===
Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia, but since his parents had moved to [[Walnut Creek, California]], he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while. He decided to move to the city of [[Philadelphia]] and enroll at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], after advice from Jack Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, claiming that &quot;In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, and they were married in 1967. The following year, Peggy gave birth to their daughter [[Jennifer Lynch|Jennifer]]. Later describing this situation, Peggy stated that &quot;[Lynch] definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; As a family, they moved to the [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] neighborhood of Philadelphia, where they were able to purchase a large 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 due to the high crime and poverty rates in the area. Later describing living there, Lynch stated that

{{cquote|We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street&amp;nbsp;... We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in&amp;nbsp;... The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, to help financially support his family alongside his art studies, he took up a job printing engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Pennsylvania Academy, Lynch made his first [[short film]], which was titled ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'' (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an [[animation]] with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $150&lt;ref name=&quot;The Short Films of David Lynch&quot;&gt;{{cite film|title=The Short Films of David Lynch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which at the time he felt to be a lot of money – to produce ''Six Men Getting Sick''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the work as &quot;57&amp;nbsp;seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit&quot;, Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand [[Bolex]] camera &quot;of [his] dreams&quot;, Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, &quot;So I called up Bart [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment with the making of a work that was a mix of animation with [[live action]], producing a four-minute short called ''[[The Alphabet (film)|The Alphabet]]'' (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the [[alphabet]] to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that &quot;Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started ''The Alphabet'' going. The rest of it was just [[subconscious]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning about the newly founded [[American Film Institute]], which gave grants to film makers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to send them a copy of ''The Alphabet'' along with a script that he had written for a new short film, one that would be almost entirely live action, named ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200 that he had requested. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Grandmother'' featured a neglected boy who &quot;grows&quot; a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell later remarked that &quot;this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1971–1979: Los Angeles and ''Eraserhead''===
[[File:Eraserhead.jpg|thumb|right|Lynch's ''Eraserhead'', featuring Henry Spencer ([[Jack Nance]])]]
In 1971, Lynch moved with his wife and daughter to [[Los Angeles]], where he began studying filmmaking at the [[AFI Conservatory]], a place that he would later describe as being &quot;completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great&amp;nbsp;... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing a script for a proposed work titled ''Gardenback'', which had &quot;unfolded from this painting I'd done&quot;. In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his ''Gardenback'' project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that ''Gardenback'' was &quot;wrecked&quot;, he instead set about on a new film, which he called ''[[Eraserhead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the film was planned to be about forty-two minutes long (it ended up being eighty-nine minutes long), the script for ''Eraserhead'' was only 21 pages long, and Lynch was able to create the film free from interference. Filming, which began on May 29, 1972, took place at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team, which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jack Fisk]], cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]] and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets as well as a food room and a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, funding for the project came from the [[American Film Institute|AFI]], who gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the work, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', they were unable to provide him with any more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father, and by money that he was able to bring in from a paper route that he took up delivering the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 76 and 60.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Not long into the production of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch and his wife Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and so he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch would remarry, this time to Mary Fisk, sister of Jack Fisk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 60, 80, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch has stated that not a single reviewer of the film understood it the way that he intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite film|title=Eraserhead Stories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2018}} Filmed in [[black and white]], ''Eraserhead'' tells the story of a quiet young man named Henry ([[Jack Nance]]) living in a [[dystopia]]n industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. It was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and Lynch referred to the film as &quot;my ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;cehwte&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |title=tip Filmjahrbuch Nr. 1 (1985) |trans-title=tip Film Yearbook No. 1 (1985) |url=http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |subject=David Lynch |interviewer=Herman Weigel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011151810/http://davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |archive-date=October 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to financial problems the filming of ''Eraserhead'' was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. It was in one such break in 1974 that Lynch created a short film titled ''The Amputee'', which  is a short one-shot film about two minutes long. David Lynch proposed that he make the film which would become ''The Amputee'' to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

''Eraserhead'' was finally finished in 1976, after five years of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the [[Cannes Film Festival]], but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the [[New York Film Festival]] also rejected it, though it was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], where [[Ben Barenholtz]], the distributor of the [[Elgin Theater]], heard about it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and ''Eraserhead'' subsequently became popular on the [[midnight movie]] underground circuit,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later described as one of the most important midnight movies of the seventies along with ''[[El Topo]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=457414|title=Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acclaimed film maker [[Stanley Kubrick]] said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch77&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the cult success of ''Eraserhead'' on the underground circuit, [[Stuart Cornfeld]], an executive producer for [[Mel Brooks]], saw it and later remarked that &quot;I was just 100 percent blown away&amp;nbsp;... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Contacting Lynch, he agreed to help him with his next planned project, a film titled ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' for which Lynch had already written a script. However, Lynch soon realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'', a film that he described as being about &quot;electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair&quot;, was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld found him four possible scripts. On hearing the title of the first, ''The Elephant Man'', Lynch chose the script.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Elephant Man'' script, written by Chris de Vore and [[Eric Bergren]], was based on a true story, that of [[Joseph Merrick]], a heavily deformed man living in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, who was held in a sideshow but was later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would alter the story from true events, but in his view make a better plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to do so he would have to get the permission of [[Mel Brooks]], whose company, [[Brooksfilms]], would be responsible for production; subsequently Brooks viewed ''Eraserhead'', and after coming out of the screening theatre, embraced Lynch, declaring that &quot;You're a madman, I love you! You're in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting film, ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', starred [[John Hurt]] as John Merrick (his name was changed from Joseph), as well as [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Frederick Treves. Filming took place in London, and Lynch brought his own distinctively surrealist approach to the film, and filmed it in black and white. Nonetheless it has been described as &quot;one of the most conventional&quot; of his films.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Elephant Man'' was a huge critical and commercial success, and earned eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Lynch personally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983–1986: The De Laurentiis films, ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet''===
Following on from the success of ''The Elephant Man'', the filmmaker [[George Lucas]], himself a fan of ''Eraserhead'', offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Lynch refused, arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's take on it.&lt;ref name = &quot;cehwte&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch113&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, however, the opportunity to direct another big-budget [[science fiction]] epic arose when [[Dino de Laurentiis]] of the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] asked him to create a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch113&quot;/&gt; Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He then set about writing a script based upon the original novel, initially with both Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, and then just by himself when De Laurentiis wasn't happy with their ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch115&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create &quot;a certain look&quot; for the film, and he particularly enjoyed building the set for the [[oil]] planet of [[Giedi Prime]], for which he &quot;used steel, bolts, and porcelain to construct&quot; it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dune'' is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a [[feudalism|feudal system]]. The main character, [[Paul Atreides]] (played by [[Kyle MacLachlan]]), is the son of a noble who takes control of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], which grows the rare spice [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], the most highly prized commodity in the empire. Lynch, however, was unhappy with the work, later remarking that &quot;''Dune'' was a kind of studio film. I didn't have [[final cut privilege|final cut]]. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises&quot; [to his own vision].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his footage was eventually removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as ''Star Wars'', Lynch's ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45 million to make, and grossed a mere $27.4 million domestically. Later on, [[Universal Studios]] released an &quot;extended cut&quot; of the film for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. Such was not representative of Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original two-hour version. Lynch objected to these changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has &quot;[[Alan Smithee]]&quot; credited as the director and &quot;Judas Booth&quot; (a pseudonym which Lynch himself invented, inspired by his own feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JwyKjpH2QC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 |title=The cinema of David Lynch: American dreams, nightmare visions |author1=Erica Sheen |author2=Annette Davison |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-903364-85-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1983, he had begun the writing and drawing of a comic strip, ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'', which featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry that it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' and other tabloid and alternative publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this period that Lynch also became interested in [[photography]] as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading industrial landscape, something that he was particularly interested in.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from ''Dune'', Lynch was contractually still obliged to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis: the first of these was a planned sequel, which due to the film's lack of success never went beyond the script stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch115&quot;/&gt; The other was a more personal work, based upon a script that Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the resulting film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was set in the real town of Lumberton, North Carolina, USA, and revolves around a college student named Jeffrey Beaumont ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who finds a severed ear in a field. Subsequently, investigating further with the help of friend Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]), he uncovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) and repeatedly subjects her to [[rape]]. Lynch himself characterizes the story as &quot;a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film, Lynch decided to include pop songs from the 1960s, including &quot;[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]&quot; by [[Roy Orbison]] and &quot;[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]&quot; by [[Bobby Vinton]], the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that &quot;It was the song that sparked the movie&amp;nbsp;... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were [[lawn]]s – lawns and the neighborhood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who would go on to produce the music for most of Lynch's subsequent cinematic works.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 130–132.&lt;/ref&gt; Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 148–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lynch had found success previously with ''The Elephant Man'', ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award nomination for Best Director]]. [[Woody Allen]], whose film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], said that ''Blue Velvet'' was his favorite film of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1987–1996: ''Twin Peaks'', ''Wild at Heart'' and ''Fire Walk with Me''===
[[File:David Lynch at the 1990 Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lynch at the 1990 [[Emmy Awards]] ceremony]]
During the late 1980s, Lynch had begun to work in [[television]] as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled ''The Cowboy and the Frenchman'' for French television in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he met the television producer [[Mark Frost]], who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', and they decided to start working together on a biopic of singer and actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] based upon Anthony Summers's book, ''The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe''. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named ''One Saliva Bubble'', but that did not see completion either.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; While they were talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called ''Northwest Passage'' but would eventually become the television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–1991).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
A drama series set in a small [[Washington (state)|Washington]] town where popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]] has been murdered, ''Twin Peaks'' featured [[FBI]] [[Dale Cooper|Special Agent Dale Cooper]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) as the investigator trying to unearth the killer, and discovering not only the [[supernatural]] elements to the murder but also the secrets of many of the local townsfolk; as Lynch himself summed it up, &quot;The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters.&quot; Lynch later revealed that &quot;[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart.&quot; They pitched the series to the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]], who agreed to finance the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] and eventually commissioned the first season, comprising seven episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 157–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second season went into production soon on 22 additional episodes. Lynch himself only directed six episodes of the series, devoting his time to working on the film ''Wild at Heart'', but carefully chose the directors for other episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch appeared in several episodes of the series as the deaf FBI agent [[Gordon Cole (Twin Peaks)|Gordon Cole]]. The series was a success, with high ratings both in the United States and in many nations abroad, and soon spawned a cult following. Executives at the ABC Network, however, believed that public interest in the show was decreasing. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal who the killer of Laura Palmer was prematurely, which they begrudgingly agreed to do.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch felt that agreeing to do so is one of his biggest professional regrets.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Slice of Lynch&quot;, a featurette included in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD set, October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the revealing of the murderer and the series' move from Thursday to Saturday night, ''Twin Peaks'' continued for several more episodes, but was cancelled following a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that the writers and directors took in the previous episodes, directed the final episode. He ended the season on a [[cliffhanger]], later remarking that &quot;that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Twin Peaks'' was in production, the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] asked Lynch and the composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who had been responsible for the music in ''Twin Peaks'', to create a theatrical piece which would be performed only twice in 1989 as a part of the [[New Music America Festival]]. The result was ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]: The Dream of the Broken Hearted'', which starred frequent Lynch collaborators such as [[Laura Dern]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J. Anderson]], and contained five songs sung by [[Julee Cruise]]. David Lynch produced a fifty-minute video of the performance in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Lynch was also involved in the creation of various [[commercials]] for different companies, including perfume companies like [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Calvin Klein]] and [[Giorgio Armani]] and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching the town of Twin Peaks for his missing wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 211–212.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=1990 was Lynch's annus mirabilis: ''Wild at Heart'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[Cannes]], and the television series ''Twin Peaks'' was proving a smash hit with audiences across the world. The musical/performance piece ''Industrial Symphony No. 1'', which Lynch had staged with Angelo Badalamenti at the Brooklyn Academy of music, had spawned the album ''Floating into the Night'' and launched singer [[Julee Cruise]]. Five one-man exhibitions between 1989 and 1991 emphasized Lynch's roots in fine art and painting, and a rash of ads (including a teaser trailer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s 'Dangerous' tour) confirmed the demand for the Lynch touch&amp;nbsp;... In an unlikely scenario for the maker of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch had become an influential and fashionable brand name.|source= —Christopher Rodley&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Lynch Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lynch at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
While Lynch was working on the first few episodes of ''Twin Peaks'', his friend [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] &quot;gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be [[executive producer]] or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'.&quot; The book was [[Barry Gifford]]'s novel ''Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula'', which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was &quot;just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', a [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[road movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sailor and [[Laura Dern]] as Lula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/film/2010/01/lynch-prosthetic-god-world|title=His dark materials|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his plot as a &quot;strange blend&quot; of &quot;a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy&quot;, Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 193–194, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cannes-1990.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/164/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Wild at Heart |accessdate=August 7, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the success of ''Wild at Heart'', Lynch decided to return to the world of the now-cancelled ''Twin Peaks'', this time without Mark Frost, to create a film that acted primarily as a prequel but also, in part, as a sequel, with Lynch stating that &quot;I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The result, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer, and was much &quot;darker&quot; in tone than the television series, having much of the humour removed, and dealing with such topics as [[incest]] and [[murder]]. Lynch himself stated that the film was about &quot;the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest&quot;. ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'' was financed by the company CIBY-2000, and most of the cast of the series agreed to reprise their roles for the film, although some refused and many were not enthusiastic about the project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 184–187.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a commercial and critical failure in the United States; however, it was a hit in Japan and some critics, such as [[Mark Kermode]], have hailed it as Lynch's &quot;masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kermode, Mark&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Kermode | first = Mark | title = David Lynch | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = February 8, 2007 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2011369,00.html | accessdate =October 27, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Lynch worked with Mark Frost on some new television shows. After ''Twin Peaks'', they produced a series of documentaries titled ''[[American Chronicles]]'' (1990) which examined life across the United States, the comedy series ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'' (1992), which was cancelled after only three episodes had aired, and the three-episode [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Hotel Room]]'' (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room but on different dates.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Lynch collaborated with Japanese musician [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] to film the music video for [[X Japan]]'s song &quot;[[Longing (song)|Longing ~Setsubou no Yoru~]]&quot;. The video was never officially released, but Lynch claimed in his 2018 memoir ''Room to Dream'' that &quot;some of the frames are so fuckin' beautiful, you can't believe it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Room to Dream|last=Lynch, David, 1946-|others=McKenna, Kristine|year=|isbn=9780399589195|edition= First|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=327|oclc=1019843510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997–2001: ''Lost Highway'', ''The Straight Story'' and ''Mulholland Drive''===
Following these unsuccessful television ventures, Lynch returned to making feature films. In 1997 he released the non-linear, [[film noir|noiresque]] ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', which was co-written by Barry Gifford and starred [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Highway (1997)|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Lost-Highway#tab=summary|website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Highway Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lost-highway|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Lost Highway'', Lynch began work directing a film from a script written by [[Mary Sweeney]] and [[John E. Roach]]. The resulting motion picture, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' was based upon a true story: that of [[Alvin Straight]] (played in the film by [[Richard Farnsworth]]), an elderly man from [[Laurens, Iowa|Laurens]], [[Iowa]], who goes on a three hundred mile journey to visit his sick brother (played by [[Harry Dean Stanton]]) in [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]], riding a [[lawnmower]] for the entire journey. Commenting on why he chose this script, Lynch said that &quot;that's what I fell in love with next&quot;, and displayed his admiration for Straight, describing him as &quot;like [[James Dean]], except he's old&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 247, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angelo Badalamenti]] again produced the music for the film, although it was &quot;very different from the kind of score he's done for [Lynch] in the past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many differences with his earlier films, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' did not contain profanity, sexuality or violence, and was rated G (general viewing) by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which came as &quot;shocking news&quot; to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it &quot;did not disturb, offend or mystify&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch245&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; As Le Blanc and Odell stated, the plot made it &quot;seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film – a surreal road movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Lynch approached [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] once again with ideas for a television [[drama]]. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series ''Mulholland Drive'', but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. However, with seven million dollars from the French [[production company]] [[StudioCanal]], Lynch completed the pilot as a film, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. The film, a non-linear narrative surrealist tale of the dark side of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], stars [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. The film performed relatively well at the [[box office]] worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch a [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] prize at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] (shared with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'') and a Best Director award from the New York Film Critics Association. In addition, Lynch received his third Academy Award nomination for Best Director.&lt;ref name=&quot;oscar-db&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy Award Database: Lynch, David|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=13035139382341|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113073650/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=13035139382341|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 13, 2012|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the film was named the top film of the 21st century by the BBC following a poll of 177 film critics from 36 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Brown |title=Mulholland Drive leads the pack in list of 21st century's top films |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 22, 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/23/mulholland-drive-david-lynch-21st-century-top-films-bbc-poll |accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–2013: Internet work and ''Inland Empire''===
With the rising popularity of the [[Internet]], Lynch decided to utilize it as a new distribution channel, releasing several new series that he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com which went online on December 10, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Enrique|last=Rivero|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Product_article.cfm?article_ID=2849|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604204833/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Product_article.cfm?article_ID=2849|title=Director David Lynch Has Do-It-Himself DVD|website=hive4media.com|archivedate=June 4, 2002|date=March 28, 2002|accessdate=September 10, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he created a series of online shorts named ''[[DumbLand]]''. Intentionally crude both in content and execution, the eight-episode series was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Just Lynch|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/its_just_lynch-38410479.html|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=Philadelphia Weekly|date=January 4, 2006|author=Leo Charney|agency=Review Publishing Limited Partnership|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120912101457/http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/screen/its_just_lynch-38410479.html|archivedate=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Lynch released a surreal [[sitcom]] on his website called ''[[Rabbits (film)|Rabbits]]'', about a family of humanoid rabbits. Later, he made his experiments with [[DV|Digital Video]] available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short ''[[Darkened Room]]''. In 2006, Lynch's feature film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' was released. At three hours long, it was the longest of Lynch's films. Like ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Lost Highway'' before it, the film did not follow a traditional narrative structure. It starred Lynch regulars [[Laura Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Justin Theroux]], with cameos by [[Naomi Watts]] and Laura Harring (voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit), and a performance by [[Jeremy Irons]]. Lynch described the piece as &quot;a mystery about a woman in trouble&quot;. In an effort to promote the film, Lynch made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan &quot;Without cheese there would be no ''Inland Empire''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-02-07/entertainment/17233482_1_inland-empire-bird-feeders-squirrels |title=Lynch dives within |author=Neva Chonin |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Lynch produced a documentary web series directed by his son, Austin Lynch, and friend Jason S. called ''Interview Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last =Hart | first =Hugh | title=David Lynch's Interview Project Probes American Dreams | url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/05/david-lynchs-interview-project-probes-american-dreams/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in working with [[Werner Herzog]], Lynch collaborated with him in 2009 to produce Herzog's film ''[[My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?]]''. Using a non-standard narrative, the film was based on the true story of an actor who committed [[matricide]] while acting in a production of the [[Oresteia]], and starred [[Grace Zabriskie]], a Lynch regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kay|first=Jeremy|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=September 1, 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Werner Herzog: a killer at the table|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jun/22/werner-herzog-david-lynch|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the ''[[Family Guy]]'' spin-off ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' as [[List of The Cleveland Show characters#Others|Gus the Bartender]]. He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], who is a fan of Lynch and who felt that his whole life had changed after seeing ''Wild at Heart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Faye | first = Denis | url = http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 | title = A Kinder, Gentler Family Guy | publisher = Writers Guild of America, West | accessdate = November 29, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130153215/http://wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 | archivedate = November 30, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' is a 16-minute promotional film that was written, directed and edited by Lynch for [[Dior]]. It was released on the Internet in May 2010.

Lynch directed a concert by English [[new wave music|new wave]] band [[Duran Duran]] on March 23, 2011. The concert was [[Streaming media|streamed live]] on YouTube from the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of ''[[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express]]''. &quot;The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage&quot;, Lynch said. &quot;A world of experimentation and hopefully some happy accidents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Lewis | first = Dave | url=http://www.hitfix.com/articles/duran-duran-david-lynch-team-for-unstaged-streaming-concert |title=Watch: David Lynch, Duran Duran team for 'Unstaged' streaming concert |publisher=www.HitFix.com |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animated short ''I Touch a Red Button Man'', a collaboration between Lynch and the band [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], played in the background during Interpol's concert at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2011.

It was believed that Lynch was going to retire from the [[film industry]]; according to [[Abel Ferrara]], Lynch &quot;doesn't even want to make films any more. I've talked to him about it, OK?

===2014–present: Reviving ''Twin Peaks''===

On October 6, 2014, Lynch confirmed via [[Twitter]] that he would start shooting together with Mark Frost a new, nine-episode season of ''[[Twin Peaks (season 3)|Twin Peaks]]'' in 2015, with the episodes expected to air in early 2016 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;revival&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Twin Peaks Revival to Air on Showtime in 2016 |url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/twin-peaks-revival-to-air-on-showtime-in-2016-1201322329 |work=Variety |first=Cynthia |last=Littleton |date=October 6, 2014 |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch and Frost wrote all nine episodes. On April 5, 2015, Lynch announced via Twitter that the project was still alive, but he was no longer going to direct because the budget was too low for what he wanted to do.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Stedman, [https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/twin-peaks-david-lych-leaves-as-director-1201466709/ &quot;David Lynch Says He Won’t Direct the ‘Twin Peaks’ Revival&quot;], ''Variety'', April 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later announced on May 15, 2015, via Twitter, that he would indeed be returning to the revival, as he had sorted out his issues with Showtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCown|first1=Alex|title=David Lynch just announced he's rejoined Showtime's ''Twin Peaks''|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/david-lynch-just-announced-hes-rejoined-showtimes--219531|website=[[The A.V.

While doing press for ''Twin Peaks'', he was again asked if he was retired from film and confirmed that he had made his last feature film, responding, &quot;Things changed a lot...

Since the last episode of ''The Return'' aired, there has been speculation as to whether there will be a fourth season of ''Twin Peaks'' or not. Though Lynch has not denied the possibility of another season, he has said if it were to happen, it would not air before 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitovich|first1=Matt|title=Twin Peaks: David Lynch Lays Out Timetable for Any Potential Season 4|url=http://tvline.com/2017/09/15/twin-peaks-season-4-premiere-date-year-2021/|website=TV Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinematic influences and themes==
===Influences===
{{quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. People do strange things constantly, to the point that, for the most part, we manage not to see it. That's why I love coffee shops and public places – I mean, they're all out there.|source= —David Lynch&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lynch says that his work is more similar in many respects to that of European filmmakers than American ones, believing that most films that &quot;get down and thrill your soul&quot; are from European directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch has commented on his admiration for such film makers as [[Federico Fellini]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;/&gt; [[Werner Herzog]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=David Lynch |interviewer=Diego Schonhals |publication-date=October 13, 2007 |title=David Lynch Favorites Movies and FilmMakers |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s7EwOeowU }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Polanski]], and [[Jacques Tati]],&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch62&quot;/&gt; along with American film directors [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Billy Wilder]]. He has stated that Wilder's ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) is one of his favourite motion pictures,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; as is Kubrick's ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962), Tati's ''[[Monsieur Hulot's Holiday]]'' (1953), Hitchcock's ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and Herzog's ''[[Stroszek]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited [[Herk Harvey]]'s ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962) and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]]'s ''[[Deep End (film)|Deep End]]'' (1970) as an influence on his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|title=Retro Cinema: Carnival of Souls|website=Moviefone|date=October 12, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218064656/https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|archive-date=February 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motifs===
There are several recurring themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell to state that &quot;his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 08.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and [[dreamlike]] imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the &quot;[[surrealist]] ethos&quot; of relying &quot;on the [[subconscious]] to provide visual drive&quot;. This can be seen in [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s dream of his mother in ''The Elephant Man'', [[Dale Cooper|Agent Cooper]]'s dreams of the red room in ''Twin Peaks'' and the &quot;dreamlike logic&quot; of the narrative found in ''Eraserhead'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Inland Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that &quot;Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose&amp;nbsp;... [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His films are known for their use of [[magic realism]]. The motif of dreams is closely linked to his recurring use of drones, real-world sounds and musical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Rogers, &quot;The Audiovisual Eerie: Transmediating Thresholds in the Work of David Lynch&quot;, in Transmedia Directors: Artistry, Industry and New Audiovisual Aesthetics, ed. Holly Rogers, Carol Vernallis, Lisa Perrott (Bloomsbury, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Lynch's prominent themes is [[industry]], with repeated imagery of &quot;the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories&quot;, as can be seen with the industrial wasteland in ''Eraserhead'', the factories in ''The Elephant Man'', the sawmill in ''Twin Peaks'' and the lawn mower in ''The Straight Story''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;&gt;[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that &quot;It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity within a society, such as with [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]]’s gang in ''Blue Velvet'' and the cocaine smugglers in ''Twin Peaks''. The idea of [[deformity]] is also found in several of Lynch's films, from ''The Elephant Man'' to the deformed baby in ''Eraserhead'', as well as death from head wounds, found in most of Lynch's films. Other imagery commonly used in Lynch's works are flickering electricity or lights, fire and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;/&gt;

With the exception of ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Dune'', which are set in [[Victorian London]] and [[Duniverse|a fictitious galaxy]] respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that &quot;I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his works, including ''Blue Velvet'', ''Twin Peaks'' and ''Lost Highway'' are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that &quot;It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways&amp;nbsp;... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch also tends to feature his leading female actors in &quot;split&quot; roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began with his choice to cast [[Sheryl Lee]] as both [[Laura Palmer]] and her cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]] in ''Twin Peaks'' and continued in his later works. In ''Lost Highway'', [[Patricia Arquette]] plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield, while in ''Mulholland Drive'' [[Naomi Watts]] plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita and in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' [[Laura Dern]] plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. The numerous alternative versions of lead characters and numerous examples of fragmented timelines may echo and/or reference the [[many worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]] and perhaps Lynch's broader interest in quantum physics/[[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch on World Peace From the Quantum Level https://www.tm.org/blog/video/world-peace-from-the-quantum-level-david-lynch-and-john-hagelin/&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also suggested that Lynch's love for the 1958 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', which employs a split lead character (the Judy Barton and Madeleine Elster characters, both portrayed by [[Kim Novak]]) may have had an influence on this aspect of Lynch's work.&lt;ref&gt;David Lynch Attends Vertigo Screening http://cinearchive.org/post/116927300550/david-lynch-watching-vertigo-the-most-studied&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;10 Films Influenced by Vertigo http://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/9-great-films-influenced-by-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo-62999/&lt;/ref&gt;

His films frequently feature characters that have supernatural and omnipotent qualities. They can be seen as physical manifestations of various different concepts, such as hatred or fear. Examples of these characters are The Man Inside the Planet from ''Eraserhead'', [[Killer BOB|BOB]] from ''Twin Peaks'', The Mystery Man from ''Lost Highway'', The Bum in ''Mulholland Drive'', and The Phantom in ''Inland Empire''. Lynch approaches his characters and film content in a way that steeps them in a dream state rather than reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/david-lynch-racial-politics.html|title=What Does David Lynch Have to Say About Race?|last=Guan|first=Frank|work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=November 15, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring collaborators===
{{Main|List of frequent David Lynch collaborators}}
Lynch is also widely noted for his collaborations with various production artists and composers on his films and other productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/my-beautiful-broken-brain-the-amazing-collaboration-of-david-lynch-and-a-woman-who-video-selfied-her-a6937571.html|title=My Beautiful Broken Brain: The woman who 'video-selfied' her stroke|date=March 17, 2016|work=The Independent|access-date=March 26, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently works with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to compose music for his productions, former wife [[Mary Sweeney]] as a film editor, casting director [[Johanna Ray]], and cast members [[Harry Dean Stanton]], [[Jack Nance]], [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Grace Zabriskie]], and [[Laura Dern]].

==Other work==
===Painting===
[[File:Lynch's So This is Love painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Lynch's painting ''So This Is Love'', 1992]]
Lynch first trained as a painter, and although he is now better known as a filmmaker, he has continued to paint. Lynch has stated that &quot;all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let [[nature]] paint more than I paint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch22&quot;&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works are very dark in colour, and Lynch has said this is because

{{cquote|I wouldn't know what to do with [colour]. Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets&amp;nbsp;... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many of his works also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains:

{{cquote|The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth&amp;nbsp;... sometimes they become the title of the painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch22&quot;/&gt;}}

Lynch considers the 20th-century Irish-born British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] to be his &quot;number one kinda hero painter&quot;, stating that &quot;Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [[Fondation Cartier]], Paris from March 3 – May 27, 2007. The show was titled ''The Air is on Fire'' and included numerous paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art [[Installation art|installations]] were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events accompanied the exhibition including live performances and concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6412525.stm | work=BBC News | title=David Lynch's dark arts laid bare | date=March 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:David Lynch -microphone -10Aug2007-2p (cropped).jpg|thumb|Lynch in August 2007]]
Lynch has also been involved in a number of music projects, many of them related to his films. His album genres switch mainly between [[experimental rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]] soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde [[electropop]] music. Most notably he produced and wrote lyrics for [[Julee Cruise]]'s first two albums, ''[[Floating into the Night]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Voice of Love (Julee Cruise album)|The Voice of Love]]'' (1993), in collaboration with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] who composed the music and also produced. Lynch also worked on the 1998 [[Jocelyn Montgomery]] album ''Lux Vivens (Living Light), The Music of Hildegard von Bingen''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allmusic.com/album/lux-vivens-the-music-of-hildegard-von-bingen-mw0000600349 Jocelyn Montgomery &amp; David Lynch - Lux Vevens] Allmusic&lt;/ref&gt; For his own productions, he composed music for ''Wild at Heart'', ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'', ''Mulholland Drive'', and ''Rabbits''. In 2001, he released ''[[BlueBob]]'', a rock album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style. He plays &quot;upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar&quot;, and relies heavily on effects pedals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/articles/bug.html |title=BOSS Users Group magazine Vol. 5, No. 1 Summer 2001 |publisher=Lynchnet.com |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently Lynch composed several pieces for ''Inland Empire'', including two songs, &quot;Ghost of Love&quot; and &quot;Walkin' on the Sky&quot;, in which he makes his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his new book-CD set ''[[Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul|Dark Night of the Soul]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/15/danger-mouses-dark-night-of-the-soul-album-threatened-by-lawsuit/|title=Music – New Music News, Reviews, Pictures, and Videos|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225131420/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/15/danger-mouses-dark-night-of-the-soul-album-threatened-by-lawsuit/|archive-date=February 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he started his own record label called David Lynch MC which first released ''Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi'' in early 2009. In August 2009, it was announced that he was releasing Afghani/American singer Ariana Delawari's ''Lion of Panjshir'' album in conjunction with [[Manimal Vinyl]] record company.

In November 2010, Lynch released two [[electropop]] music singles, &quot;Good Day Today&quot; and &quot;I Know&quot;, through the independent British label [[Sunday Best (music company)|Sunday Best Recordings]]. Describing why he created them, he stated that &quot;I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley, his engineer] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Topping | first = Alexandra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/28/david-lynch-turns-pop-singer-songwriter?intcmp=239 |title=The latest offbeat experiment from filmmaker David Lynch: pop singles |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 28, 2010 | accessdate=November 30, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singles were followed by an album, ''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'', which was released in November 2011 and described as an &quot;electronic blues album&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;clowntime&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/arts/music/david-lynchs-album-crazy-clown-time.html | title=Music, Not Movies, But Still Exploring Places of Darkness | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2012 | first=David | last=Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by [[Karen O]] of the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/ | last=Powell | first=Mike | title=Crazy Clown Time | website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=November 8, 2011 | accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and composed and performed by Lynch and Dean Hurley.&lt;ref name=&quot;clowntime&quot;/&gt; All or most of the songs for ''Crazy Clown Time'' were put into art-music videos, Lynch directing the title song's video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caWXt9lCVrc|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdDGFZhoVT0|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IugOfDBWcGc|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cph9o8faQUo|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crazy Clown Time'' song and video are a fantastic minimalistic parody of hip-hop music and videos.

===Design===
Lynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film ''Lost Highway'', notably the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case. In April 1997, he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious [[Milan Furniture Fair]] in Italy. &quot;Design and music, art and architecture – they all belong together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cityofabsurdity.com/furniture.html|title=The City of Absurdity: David Lynch's Furniture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch has conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2011/09/07/silencio-by-david-lynch/|title=Silencio by David Lynch|date=September 7, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Silencio&quot; opened in October 2011, and is a private members' club although is free to the public after midnight. Patrons have access to concerts, films and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club of the same name in his 2001 film ''Mulholland Drive'', the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. &quot;Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to programme or create what they want.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/31/david-lynch-disco-paris?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038/|title=Inside David Lynch's Paris nightclub|first=Fiachra|last=Gibbons|date=August 31, 2011|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
In 2006, Lynch authored a short book describing his creative processes, stories from throughout his career, and the benefits he had realized through his practice of [[Transcendental Meditation]] called ''[[Catching the Big Fish|Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity]]''. He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:

{{cquote|Ideas are like fish.

If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.

Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They're huge and abstract. And they're very beautiful.}}

The book weaves a non-linear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch's cognitive experiences during Transcendental Meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=David|title=Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-58542-540-2|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQqitBgFpOkC|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All author's royalties will be donated to the [[David Lynch Foundation]].

Together with [[Kristine McKenna]], Lynch, in June 2018, published the book ''Room to Dream''. The book is a hybrid of biography and memoir. The book gives the reader a look into his personal and creative life through his own words and through those of his colleagues, family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/room-to-dream/|title=Book Marks reviews of Room to Dream by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna|website=bookmarks.reviews|language=en-US|access-date=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Lynch has said that he is &quot;not a political person&quot; and that politics is &quot;something [he] know[s] little about&quot;.&lt;ref name=int/&gt; However, in the 1990s he expressed admiration for former US President [[Ronald Reagan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Willow | first =Hank | url=http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/lynch.htm |title=Twin Peaks Director David Lynch – Admires Reagan, Natural Law Party |publisher=hollywoodinvestigator |date= November 19, 2001| accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that &quot;I mostly liked that he carried a wind of old Hollywood, of a cowboy.&quot;&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite book |last =Barney | first =Richard | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGk0J0HgmcsC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20lynch%20ronald%20reagan |title=David Lynch - Interviews |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |date= November 19, 2009| accessdate=November 9, 2017| isbn =9781604732375 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing his political philosophy in 2006, he stated, &quot;at that time, I thought of myself as a [[libertarianism|libertarian]].

Lynch was working for the building and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, &quot;pumping peace for the world&quot;. He estimates the cost at US$7 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]. As of December 2005, he had spent US$400,000 of personal money, and raised US$1 million in donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP-12-01-2005&quot; /&gt; In December 2006, the ''New York Times'' reported that he continued to have that goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-12-31-06&quot; /&gt; Lynch's book, ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), discusses the impact of the Transcendental Meditation technique on his creative process. Lynch attended the funeral of the Maharishi in India in 2008.&lt;ref name=Stevens/&gt; He told a reporter, &quot;In life, he revolutionised the lives of millions of people.&amp;nbsp;...

In 2009, Lynch organized a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall for the David Lynch Foundation. On April 4, 2009, the &quot;Change Begins Within&quot; concert featured [[Paul McCartney]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Donovan]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Moby]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Ben Harper]], and [[Mike Love]] of the Beach Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-04-04-09&quot;&gt;Jon Pareles, &quot;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/paul-mccartney-ringo-starr-reunite-at-radio-city Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr Reunite at Radio City]&quot;, ''New York Times'', April 4, 2009, Arts Section&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[David Wants to Fly]]'', released in May 2010, is a documentary by German filmmaker David Sieveking &quot;that follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://german-documentaries.de/media/pdf/german-documentaries_10.pdf ''German Documentaries'', AGDF, March 2010. &quot;The young filmmaker David Sieveking follows the path of his professional idol, David Lynch, into the world of Transcendental Meditation (TM).&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Variety, David Wants to Fly Review, Alissa Simon February 14, 2010 [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942181.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 Variety Reviews - David Wants to Fly - Film Reviews - Berlin - Review by Alissa Simon]&quot; &quot;David Wants to Fly&quot; follows German writer-helmer David Sieveking on his road to enlightenment, a journey that involves David Lynch, various headquarters of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement and the icy source of the Ganges.&quot; {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this very personal documentary Sieveking deals critically with the Transcendental Mediatation. At the end of the film, it becomes clear that Sieveking rated the engagement of his former idol Lynch as problematic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Für Lynch bin ich ein Feind&quot; article in Saarbrücker Zeitung, 8.

An independent project starring Lynch called ''Beyond The Noise: My Transcendental Meditation Journey'', directed by film student Dana Farley, who has severe dyslexia and attention deficit disorder, was shown at film festivals in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dlf.tv/2010/beyond-the-noise/ | work=David Lynch Foundation | title=Beyond The Noise | date=August 24, 2010 | accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the Marbella Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marbellafilmfestival.com/archives/awards-2011/ List of 2011 documentaries] Marbella Film Festival archive section&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker [[Kevin Sean Michaels]] is one of the producers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1705102/ &quot;Beyond the Noise: My Transcendental Meditation Journey&quot;] at IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Lynch wrote: &quot;Transcendental Meditation leads to a beautiful, peaceful revolution.

In 2019 British contemporary artist [[Alexander de Cadenet]] interviewed David Lynch about his views on enlightenment and Transcendental Meditation. Lynch commented about the technique saying; ''“''Here’s an experience that utilizes the full brain, that’s what it’s for; it’s for enlightenment, for higher states of consciousness culminating in the highest state of unity consciousness.''”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.awakenedartists.com/post/2019/09/19/david-lynch-on-transcendental-meditation|title=Post|website=awakenedartists|language=en|access-date=February 20, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short videos and his [[absurdism|absurdist]] series ''[[Dumbland]]'', plus interviews and other items. The site also featured a daily [[Weather forecasting|weather report]], where Lynch gives a brief description of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resides. Until June 2010, this weather report (usually no longer than 30&amp;nbsp;seconds) was also being broadcast on his personal [[YouTube]] channel, ''David Lynch – Daily Weather Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/remember_when_david_lynch_used|title=Remember when David Lynch used to do weather reports on the Internet?|date=August 25, 2016|work=dangerousminds.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/reminder-david-lynch-used-to-do-kooky-weather-reports.html|title=Here's a Friendly Reminder That David Lynch Used to Do Kooky Weather Reports|last=Ivie|first=Devon|work=Vulture|access-date=August 18, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; An absurd [[ringtone]] (&quot;I like to kill deer&quot;) from the website was a common [[sound bite]] on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' in early 2006.
