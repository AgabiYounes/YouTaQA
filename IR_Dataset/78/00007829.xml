The '''Chaos Computer Club''' ('''CCC''') is Europe's largest association of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CCC&quot;/&gt; with {{val|7700}} registered members.&lt;ref name=&quot;eigendarstellung&quot;/&gt; It is incorporated as an ''[[eingetragener Verein]]'' in Germany, with local chapters (called ''{{ill|Erfa-Kreis{{!}}Erfa-Kreise|de|Erfahrungsaustauschgruppe}}'') in various cities in Germany and other German-speaking countries.
{{anchor|CCC-CH}}Since 1985, some chapters in Switzerland have organized an independent sister association called the {{ill|Chaos Computer Club Schweiz|de}} (CCC-CH) instead.

The CCC describes itself as &quot;a galactic community of life forms, independent of age, sex, race or societal orientation, which strives across borders for freedom of information…&quot;. In general, the CCC advocates more transparency in government, [[freedom of information]], and the [[human rights|human right]] to communication. Supporting the principles of the [[hacker ethic]], the club also fights for free universal access to computers and technological infrastructure as well as the use of [[open-source software]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Satzung&quot;/&gt; The CCC spreads an entrepreneurial vision refusing capitalist control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boullier_2016&quot;/&gt; It has been characterised as &quot;…one of the most influential digital organisations anywhere, the centre of German digital culture, [[hacker culture]], hacktivism, and the intersection of any discussion of democratic and digital rights&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadwalladr_2014&quot;/&gt;

Members of the CCC have demonstrated and publicized a number of important information security problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson_2006&quot;/&gt;
The CCC frequently criticizes new legislation and products with weak information security which endanger citizen rights or the privacy of users.
Notable members of the CCC regularly function as expert witnesses for the [[Federal Constitutional Court|German constitutional court]], organize lawsuits and campaigns, or otherwise influence the political process.

== Activities ==

=== Regular events ===
[[File:Ccc2003PirateTent.jpg|right|thumb|Chaos Communication Camp 2003 near Berlin, featuring the ''{{ill|Pesthörnchen|de}}'', a [[Jolly Roger]] malapropism to the logo of the former [[Deutsche Bundespost]], the Federal Post of Germany]]

The CCC hosts the annual [[Chaos Communication Congress]], Europe's biggest hacker gathering.
When the event was held in the [[Congress Center Hamburg|Hamburg congress center]] in 2013, it drew {{val|9000}} guests.&lt;ref name=&quot;TTF&quot;/&gt;
For the 2016 installment, {{val|11000}} guests were expected,&lt;ref name=&quot;CCC_33C3&quot;/&gt; with additional viewers following the event via live streaming.

Every four years, the [[Chaos Communication Camp]] is the outdoor alternative for hackers worldwide.
The CCC also held, from 2009 to 2013, a yearly conference called [[SIGINT (conference)|SIGINT]] in [[Cologne]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SIGINT_2009&quot;/&gt; which focused on the impact of digitisation on society. The SIGINT conference was discontinued in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sigint.ccc.de/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419234032/http://sigint.ccc.de/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-04-19|title=SIGINT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The four-day conference ''{{ill|Gulaschprogrammiernacht|de}}'' in [[Karlsruhe]] is with more than 1500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zkm.de/media/file/de/190522_gpn19_entwurf-ik.pdf |title=19. Gulaschprogrammiernacht: Chaos im Lichthof |accessdate=2019-06-03 |format=PDF |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants the second largest annual event.
Another yearly CCC event taking place on the Easter weekend is the [[Easterhegg]], which is more workshop oriented than the other events.

The CCC often uses the [[C-base|c-base station]] located in Berlin as an event location or as function rooms.

=== Publications, Outreach ===
The CCC publishes the irregular magazine ''[[Datenschleuder]]'' (''data slingshot'') since 1984.
The Berlin chapter produces a monthly radio show called {{Interlanguage link multi|Chaosradio|de}} which picks up various technical and political topics in a two-hour [[talk radio]] show. The program is aired on a local radio station called {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz (radio){{!}}Fritz|de|3=Fritz (Hörfunksender)}} and on the internet.
Other programs have emerged in the context of Chaosradio, including radio programs offered by some regional Chaos Groups and the podcast spin-off ''CRE'' by [[Tim Pritlove]].

Many of the chapters of CCC participate in the volunteer project ''Chaos macht Schule'' which supports teaching in local schools. Its aims are to improve technology and [[media literacy]] of pupils, parents, and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos macht Schule|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://ccc.de/schule|format=|accessdate=2016-01-11|last=CCC|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medienkompetenz, quo vadis?

CCC members are present in big tech companies and in administrative instances. One of the spokespersons of the CCC, as of 1986, [[Andy Müller-Maguhn]], was a member of the executive committee of the [[ICANN]] (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) between 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2008/09/MANACH/16293|title=Les &quot; bidouilleurs &quot; de la société de l’information|date=2008-09-01|work=Le Monde diplomatique|access-date=2018-03-12|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryptoparty ===
The CCC sensitises and introduces people to the questions of data privacy. They regularly host so-called cryptoparties in bars in Berlin to which anyone is invited to better understand how to protect their personal data and their computer from hacking.

==History==
{{Expand German|Chaos Computer Club|date=January 2017}}

=== Founding ===
[[File:Wau Holland.jpg|thumb|Wau Holland]]
The CCC was founded in Berlin on 12 September 1981 at a table which had previously belonged to the [[Kommune 1]] in the rooms of the newspaper [[Die Tageszeitung]] by [[Wau Holland]] and others in anticipation of the prominent role that information technology would play in the way people live and communicate.

=== BTX-Hack ===
The CCC became world-famous in 1984 when they drew public attention to the security flaws of the German [[Bildschirmtext]] computer network by causing it to debit [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] {{val|134000}} in a Hamburg bank in favor of the club. The money was returned the next day in front of the press. Prior to the incident, the system provider had failed to react to proof of the security flaw provided by the CCC, claiming to the public that their system was safe. Bildschirmtext was the biggest commercially available online system targeted at the general public in its region at that time, run and heavily advertised by the German telecommunications agency [[Deutsche Bundespost]] which also strove to keep up-to-date alternatives out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Karl Koch ===
{{main|Karl Koch (hacker)}}
In 1987, the CCC was peripherally involved in the first [[cyberespionage]] case to make international headlines. A group of [[West Germany|German]] hackers led by [[Hagbard (Karl Koch)|Karl Koch]], who was loosely affiliated with the CCC, was arrested for breaking into US government and corporate computers, and then selling operating-system source code to the Soviet [[KGB]].
This incident was portrayed in the movie ''[[23 (film)|23]]''.

=== GSM-Hack ===
In April 1998, the CCC successfully demonstrated the cloning of a [[GSM]] customer card, breaking the [[COMP128]] [[encryption]] algorithm used at that time by many GSM [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccc.de/gsm/ CCC | CCC klont D2 Kundenkarte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530204651/http://www.ccc.de/gsm/ |date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project Blinkenlights ===
[[File:Blinkenlights_CCC_at_22C3.jpg|thumb|Blinkenlights at the 22nd Chaos Communication Congress]]
{{main|Project Blinkenlights}}
In 2001, the CCC celebrated its twentieth birthday with an interactive light installation dubbed ''Project Blinkenlights'' that turned the building [[Haus des Lehrers]] in Berlin into a giant computer screen. A follow up installation, ''Arcade'', at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] was the world's biggest light installation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
Later in October 2008, CCC's Project Blinkenlights went to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada with project Stereoscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blinkenlights.net/stereoscope|title=Welcome to Project Blinkenlights - Project Blinkenlights|website=blinkenlights.net|accessdate=2018-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schäuble fingerprints ===
In March 2008, the CCC acquired and published the fingerprints of German [[Minister of the Interior (Germany)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]. The magazine also included the fingerprint on a film that readers could use to fool [[fingerprint reader]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.h-online.com/newsticker/news/item/CCC-publishes-fingerprints-of-German-Home-Secretary-734713.html|title=CCC publishes fingerprints of Wolfgang Schäuble, the German Home Secretary|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2008-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208154330/http://www.h-online.com/newsticker/news/item/CCC-publishes-fingerprints-of-German-Home-Secretary-734713.html|archive-date=2013-12-08|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to protest the use of biometric data in German identity devices such as [[Biometric passport|e-passports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/security/meldung/CCC-publiziert-die-Fingerabdruecke-von-Wolfgang-Schaeuble-Update-193732.html|title=CCC publiziert die Fingerabdrücke von Wolfgang Schäuble [Update]|first=heise|last=online|website=Security|accessdate=2018-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Staatstrojaner affair ===
[[File:Bundestrojaner.jpg|thumb|Mascot used to protest against the Staatstrojaner, a [[trojan horse]]]]
{{see also|FOXACID|MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer|Magic Lantern (software)|Heiko Maas#State trojans}}
The Staatstrojaner (''Federal [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]'') is a [[computer surveillance]] program installed secretly on a suspect's computer, which the German police uses to [[wiretap]] [[Internet telephony]]. This &quot;source wiretapping&quot; is the only feasible way to wiretap in this case, since Internet telephony programs will usually [[encryption|encrypt]] the data when it leaves the computer. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] has ruled that the police may only use such programs for telephony wiretapping, and for no other purpose, and that this restriction should be enforced through technical and legal means.

On 8 October 2011, the CCC published an analysis of the Staatstrojaner software. The software was found to have the ability to remote control the target computer, to capture [[screenshots]], and to fetch and run arbitrary extra code. The CCC says that having this functionality built in is in direct contradiction to the ruling of the constitutional court.

In addition, there were a number of security problems with the implementation. The software was controllable over the Internet, but the commands were sent completely un[[encrypted]], with no checks for authentication or integrity. This leaves any computer under surveillance using this software vulnerable to attack. The captured screenshots and audio files were encrypted, but so incompetently that the encryption was ineffective. All captured data was sent over a proxy server in the United States, which is problematic since the data is then temporarily outside the German [[jurisdiction]].

The CCC's findings were widely reported in the German press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.de/en/updates/2011/staatstrojaner|title=Chaos Computer Club analyzes government malware|date=2011-10-08|accessdate=2011-10-10|publisher=Chaos Computer Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,790756,00.html|title=CCC findet Sicherheitslücken in Bundestrojaner|work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=2011-10-10|date=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,790944,00.html|title=Electronic Surveillance Scandal Hits Germany|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=2011-10-31|date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trojan has also been nicknamed [[R2-D2]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cupa&quot;&gt;Basil Cupa, [http://www.zora.uzh.ch/81157/1/Cupa_Living_in_Surveillance_Societies_2012.pdf Trojan Horse Resurrected: On the Legality of the Use of Government Spyware (Govware)], LISS 2013, pp. 419-428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/101911-german-federal-trojan-eavesdrops-on-252153.html German federal Trojan eavesdrops on 15 applications, experts find.

The [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] released a statement in which they denied that R2-D2 has been used by the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] (BKA); this statement however does not eliminate the possibility that it has been used by state-level German police forces. The BKA had previously announced however (in 2007) that they had somewhat similar trojan software that can inspect a computer's hard drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel&quot;/&gt;

=== Domscheit-Berg affair ===
Former [[WikiLeaks]] spokesman [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] was expelled from the national CCC (but not the Berlin chapter) in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,780289,00.html Top German Hacker Slams OpenLeaks Founder], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 2011-08-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heather Brooke, [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/24/inside-secret-world-of-hackers Inside the secret world of hackers], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2011-08-25&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was revoked on February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2012/amv2012|title=CCC - Ergebnis der außerordentlichen Mitgliederversammlung|website=www.ccc.de|accessdate=2018-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of his role in the expulsion, board member [[Andy Müller-Maguhn]] was not reelected for another term.

=== Phone authentication systems ===
The CCC has repeatedly warned phone users of the weakness of biometric identification in the wake of the 2008 Schäuble fingerprints affair. In their &quot;hacker ethics&quot; the CCC includes &quot;protect people data&quot;, but also &quot;Computers can change your life for the better&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccc.de/de/hackerethik|title=CCC {{!}} Hackerethik|website=www.ccc.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club regards privacy as an individual right: the CCC does not discourage people from sharing or storing personal information on their phones, but advocates better privacy protection, and the use of specific browsing and sharing techniques by users.

==== Apple TouchID ====
From a photograph of the user's fingerprint on a glass surface, using &quot;easy everyday means&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/ccc-breaks-apple-touchid|title=CCC {{!}} Chaos Computer Club breaks Apple TouchID|website=www.ccc.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the biometrics hacking team of the CCC, was able to unlock an iPhone 5S.

==== Samsung S8 iris recognition ====
The Samsung Galaxy S8's iris recognition system claims to be &quot;one of the safest ways to keep your phone locked and the contents private&quot; as &quot;patterns in your irises are unique to you and are virtually impossible to replicate&quot;, as quoted in official Samsung content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s8/security/|title=Security - Iris Scanner {{!}} Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+|website=The Official Samsung Galaxy Site|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases, using a high resolution photograph of the phone owner's iris and a lens, the CCC claimed to be able to trick the authentification system.

=={{anchor|CCCF}}Fake Chaos Computer Club France==
The '''Chaos Computer Club France''' (CCCF) was a fake hacker organisation created in 1989 in [[Lyon]] (France) by [[Jean-Bernard Condat]], under the command of Jean-Luc Delacour, an agent of the [[Direction de la surveillance du territoire]] governmental agency. The primary goal of the CCCF was to watch and to gather information about the French hacker community, identifying the hackers who could harm the country.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Phrack]]'' No. 64, [http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=64&amp;id=17 &quot;A personal view of the french underground (1992–2007)&quot;], 2007: ''&quot;A good example of this was the fake hacking meeting created in the middle 1990' so called the CCCF (Chaos Computer Club France) where a lot of hackers got busted under the active participation of a renegade hacker so called Jean-Bernard Condat.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot;/&gt; Journalist {{ill|Jean Guisnel|fr}} said that this organization also worked with the [[Gendarmerie Nationale (France)|French National Gendarmerie]].

The CCCF had an [[Digital edition|electronic]] magazine called ''Chaos Digest (ChaosD)''. Between 4 January 1993 and 5 August 1993, seventy-three issues were published ({{ISSN|1244-4901}}).
