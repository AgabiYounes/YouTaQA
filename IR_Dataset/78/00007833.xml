:''For the mentalist Kreskin (born 1935), see [[The Amazing Kreskin]].''

'''Jeron Criswell King''' (born '''Jeron Criswell Konig''', August 7, 1907&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; October 4, 1982), known by his stage-name '''The Amazing Criswell''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|z|w|ɛ|l}}, was an American [[psychic]] known for wildly inaccurate predictions. In person, he went by '''Charles Criswell King''', and was sometimes credited as '''Jeron King Criswell'''.

Criswell was flamboyant, with [[Kiss curl|spit curled]] hair, a [[wikt:stentorian|stentorian]] style of speaking, and a [[sequin]]ed [[Black tie|tuxedo]]. He owned a [[coffin]] in which he claimed to sleep. He grew up in a troubled family in [[Indiana]] with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. He appeared in two of [[Ed Wood]]'s films.

==Career==
Criswell said he had once worked as a [[radio announcer]] and news broadcaster. He began buying time on a local Los Angeles television station in the early 1950s to run [[infomercials]] for his Criswell Family Vitamins. To fill the time, he began his &quot;Criswell Predicts&quot; part of the show. This made him a minor off-beat celebrity in Los Angeles and around Hollywood, and his friendship with old show-business people such as [[Mae West]] and rising fringe celebrities such as [[Korla Pandit]] made Criswell an entertaining presence at parties. His fame brought him appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Jack Paar Show]]'' (1957–1962) which allowed him to publish his predictions in three publications of Spaceway Magazine (February 1955, April 1955, and June 1955), as well as run a weekly syndicated newspaper article starting on September 6, 1951. He later published three books of predictions; ''From Now to the Year 2000'', ''Your  Next Ten Years'', and ''Forbidden Predictions''.  He also recorded a long playing record, ''Your Incredible Future'' (which  was later released on CD), featuring 84 minutes of his predictions in his own voice. Criswell appeared in the movies of writer and director [[Ed Wood]]. After Criswell's death, his longtime friend [[Paul Marco]] released Criswell's song &quot;Someone Walked Over My Grave&quot; on a 7&quot; record which was recorded by Criswell as a memorial song that he wanted released posthumously.

==Predictions==
[[File:Plan 9 from Outer Space - Criswell Predicts.ogv|thumb|250px|&quot;Criswell Predicts&quot; scene in [[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]]]
Criswell's predictions were nationally syndicated and he appeared on the television show ''Criswell Predicts'' on KLAC Channel 13 (now [[KCOP|KCOP-13]]) in Los Angeles as well as being recorded for syndication. His announcer was Bob Shields, who later played the judge on ''[[Divorce Court]]''. Criswell wore heavy makeup in public after his live program was broadcast in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Only selected people were allowed in the KCOP studio during his broadcast.

Criswell wrote several books of predictions, including 1968's ''Criswell Predicts: From Now to the Year 2000.'' In it, he claimed that [[Denver, Colorado]] would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of [[Natural rubber|rubber]], leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-1.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 1)]&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted mass [[cannibalism]]&lt;ref name=predicts&gt;[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-5.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 5)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[End time|end of planet Earth]], which he set as happening on August 18, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;predicts&quot;/&gt;

Criswell was a student of history. He believed history repeated itself, that the United States were the &quot;modern Romans&quot;. Each day, he read the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' looking for clues for his predictions.

Some sources claim Criswell's most famous prediction was on ''[[Jack Paar#Prime time|The Jack Paar Program]]'' (1962–65) in March 1963, when he predicted that US President [[John F. Kennedy]] would not run for reelection in 1964 because [[John F. Kennedy assassination|something]] was going to happen to him in November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c-e-n-t-e-r.com/ed_interview.html C-E-N-T-E-R Art Project interview with Criswell biographer Edwin L. Canfield]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources say that Criswell never claimed to be a real psychic; however, those who knew him, including actress and fellow ''Plan 9'' alumna [[Maila Nurmi]] (&quot;Vampira&quot;), believed he was. According to writer [[Charles A. Coulombe]], whose family rented an apartment from him, Criswell told Coulombe's father &quot;[I] had the gift, but&amp;nbsp;... lost it when I started taking money for it.&quot;

==Private life==
Criswell married a former [[speakeasy]] dancer named [[Halo Meadows]], who once appeared on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', and whom Coulombe describes as &quot;quite mad&quot;: &quot;Mrs Criswell had a huge standard [[poodle]] (named &quot;Buttercup&quot;) which she was convinced was the [[reincarnation]] of her cousin Thomas.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criswellpredicts.com/criswell.htm|title=Who Was Criswell?|publisher=Criswell Predicts|date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent a great deal of time [[Sun tanning|sunbathing]]&amp;nbsp;... which, given her size, was not too pleasing a sight.&quot;

[[Mae West]] used Criswell as her personal psychic; he once predicted her rise to [[President of the United States]], whereupon she, Criswell and [[George Liberace]], the brother of showman [[Liberace]], would take a rocket to the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;/&gt; Criswell and West were great friends and she would lavish him with home-cooked food which she had delivered to the studio that he shared with [[Maila Nurmi]] (&quot;Vampira&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/85365/haunted-world-of-ed-wood-jr|title=Watch Haunted World of Ed Wood, Jr. online &amp;#124; Free|publisher=Hulu|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that West sold Criswell her old luxury cars for five dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;/&gt;

He died in 1982 aged 75.

==Legacy==
* In 1955, Mae West wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Criswell Predicts&quot; for her album ''[[The Fabulous Mae West]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;criswellpredicts.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicnotmusic.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/mae-west-sings-about-criswell/|title=Mae West Sings About Criswell &amp;#124; Music/ Not Music|publisher=Musicnotmusic.wordpress.com|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, Criswell was portrayed in the [[Tim Burton]] biopic, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', by actor [[Jeffrey Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0109707|Ed Wood (1994)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith.

* In 2005, Criswell and the ''Plan 9'' cast were lampooned in an episode of the television series, ''Deadly Cinema'', and clips of this episode were featured in the documentary, ''Vampira: The Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vampirathemovie.com/cast.php|title=Cast of Vampira: The Movie|publisher=Vampirathemovie.com|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, Craig Brown played Criswell in ''Plan Live From Outer Space'', a stage adaptation of ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' which won a Canadian Comedy Award the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1108860|Plan Live from Outer Space (2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, a teaser trailer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh-gdpJxJo|title=Plan 9 Teaser Trailer|publisher=YouTube|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by Darkstone Entertainment for the John Johnson film ''Plan 9'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan9movie.com/|title=PLAN 9|publisher=Plan9movie.com|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a remake of ''Plan 9 From Outer Space''.
