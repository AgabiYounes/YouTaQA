In 1971, [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]] founded a small engineering company, Syzygy Engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade70.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030703021923/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/arcade/arcade70.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-07-03 |title=Atari Coin-Op/Arcade Systems |website=www.atarimuseum.com |access-date=2016-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that designed and built ''[[Computer Space]]'', the world's first commercially available arcade video game, for Nutting Associates. On June 27, 1972, the two incorporated Atari, Inc. and soon hired [[Al Alcorn]] as their first design engineer.  Bushnell asked Alcorn to produce an arcade version of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]]'s Tennis game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nolanmagnavox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ador Yano |url=http://www.ralphbaer.com/video_game_history.htm |title=Video game history |publisher=Ralphbaer.com |accessdate=December 27, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223011401/http://www.ralphbaer.com/video_game_history.htm |archivedate=December 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be named [[Pong]].  While Bushnell incorporated Atari in June 1972, Syzygy Company was never formally incorporated.  Before Atari's incorporation, Bushnell considered various terms from the game [[Go (board game)|Go]], eventually choosing ''[[Atari (go)|atari]]'', referencing a position in the game when a group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent.  Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27, 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;inc1972&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C0654542|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016062150/http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C0654542|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 16, 2007|title=California Secretary of State – California Business Search – Corporation Search Results|date=October 16, 2007|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a competitor called [[Kee Games]], headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent [[pinball]] distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market virtually the same game to different distributors, each getting an &quot;exclusive&quot; deal.  Joe Keenan's management of the subsidiary led to him being promoted president of Atari that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monfort |first1=Nick |last2=Bogost |first2=Ian |title=Racing the Beam |publisher=MIT Press |date=March 31, 2009 |origyear=1st.

In 1976, Bushnell, through [[Grass Valley, CA]] firm Cyan Engineering, started development of a flexible console that was capable of playing the four existing Atari games.  The result was the [[Atari 2600|Atari Video Computer System]], or VCS (later renamed 2600 when the 5200 was released).  The introductory price of $199 ({{Inflation|US|199|1976|fmt=eq}}) included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles, and the Combat game cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://toytales.ca/atari-2600/ |title=Atari 2600 {{!}} Toys with a History {{!}} Toy Tales – Todd Coopee |date=2015-12-28 |language=en-US |access-date=2016-07-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619185554/https://toytales.ca/atari-2600/ |archivedate=June 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive.  Looking for outside investors, Bushnell sold Atari to [[Time-Warner|Warner Communications]] in 1976 for an estimated $28–32 million, using part of the money to buy the [[Peter Folger|Folgers]] Mansion.  Nolan continued to have disagreements with Warner Management over the direction of the company, the discontinuation of the pinball division, and most importantly, the notion of discontinuing the 2600.  In 1978, Kee Games was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html |title=A History of Syzygy / Atari |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117063609/http://mcurrent.name/atarihistory/atari.html |archivedate=November 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December of that year, [[Nolan Bushnell]] was fired following an argument with Manny Gerard.  &quot;[W]e started fighting like cats and dogs.  And then the wheels came off that fall.  Warner claimed they fired me,&quot; recalled Bushnell.  &quot;I say I quit.  It was a mutual separation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsay&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first=Morgan |year=2012 |title=Gamers at Work: Stories Behind the Games People Play |isbn=978-1430233510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of a successor to the 2600 started as soon as it shipped.  The original team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years; it then set forth to build the most powerful machine possible within that time frame.  Mid-way into their effort the [[home computer]] revolution took off, leading to the addition of a keyboard and features to produce the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]] and its smaller sibling, the 400.  The new machines had some success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.  From this platform Atari released their next-generation game console in 1982, the [[Atari 5200]].  It was unsuccessful due to incompatibility with the 2600 game library, a small quantity of dedicated games, and notoriously unreliable controllers. Porting arcade games to home systems with inferior hardware was difficult. The [[port (video gaming)|ported]] version of [[Pac-man]] for Atari 2600 omitted many of the visual features of the original to compensate for the lack of [[ROM]] space and the hardware struggled when multiple ghosts appeared on the screen creating a flickering effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicoll |first1=Benjamin |title=Bridging the Gap: The Neo Geo, the Media Imaginary, and the Domestication of Arcade Games |journal=Games and Culture |date=2015 |doi=10.1177/1555412015590048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Warner and Atari's chairman and CEO, [[Raymond Kassar]], the company achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers.  At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest growing company in US history at the time.  However, it ran into problems in the early 1980s as interference from the New York-based Warner management increasingly affected daily operations. Its [[home computer]], [[video game console]], and [[Video arcade|arcade]] divisions operated independently and rarely cooperated.  Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.

These problems were followed by the [[video game crash of 1983]], with losses that totaled more than $500 million.  Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. In 1983, Ray Kassar had resigned and executives involved in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] merger lost track of negotiations, eventually killing the deal.  With Atari's financial problems and the Famicom's runaway success in Japan after its July 16, 1983, release, [[Nintendo]] decided to remain independent.

Financial problems continued to mount and Kassar's successor, [[James J. Morgan]], had less than a year in which to tackle the company's problems.  He began a massive restructuring of the company and worked with Warner Communications in May 1984 to create &quot;NATCO&quot; (an acronym for New Atari Company).  NATCO further streamlined the company's facilities, personnel, and spending.  Unknown to James Morgan and the senior management of Atari, Warner had been in talks with Tramel Technology to buy Atari's consumer electronics and home computer divisions.  Negotiating until close to midnight on July 1, 1984, [[Jack Tramiel]] purchased Atari.  Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to Tramiel for $50 cash and $240 million in promissory notes and stocks, giving Warner a 20% stake in Atari Corporation&lt;ref name=&quot;sale&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name [[Atari Games]], but sold it to [[Namco]] in 1985.  Warner also sold the '''Ataritel''' division to [[Mitsubishi Electric|Mitsubishi]].

===Logo===
The Atari [[logo]] was designed by [[George Opperman]], who was Atari's first in-house graphic designer, and drawn by Evelyn Seto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Gaming: 100 Professionals of Play|last=Marie|first=Meagan|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2018|isbn=0241395062|location=|pages=18|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is known as &quot;[[Mount Fuji|Fuji]]&quot; for its resemblance to the Japanese mountain, although the design's origins are unrelated to it. Opperman designed the logo intending for the silhouette to look like the letter A as in Atari, and for its three &quot;prongs&quot; to resemble players and the midline of the &quot;court&quot; in company's first hit game, Pong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glory of Atari's Original Logo |url=http://kotaku.com/5864035/the-glory-of-ataris-original-logo |website=Kotaku |accessdate=11 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312002909/http://kotaku.com/5864035/the-glory-of-ataris-original-logo |archivedate=March 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Tramiel's ownership, '''Atari Corp.''' used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development on a 16/32-bit computer system, the [[Atari ST]]. (&quot;ST&quot; stands for &quot;sixteen/thirty-two&quot;, referring to the machines' 16-bit bus and 32-bit processor core.) In April 1985, they released the first update to the 8-bit computer line&amp;nbsp;— the Atari 65XE, the [[Atari XE]] series. June 1985 saw the release of the Atari 130XE; Atari User Groups received early sneak-preview samples of the new Atari 520ST's, and major retailer shipments hit store shelves in September 1985 of Atari's new 32-bit [[Atari ST]] computers. In 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under Warner&amp;nbsp;— the Atari 2600jr and the [[Atari 7800]] console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, earning a $25 million profit that year.

In 1987, Atari acquired Federated Group for $67.3 million, securing shelf space in over 60 stores in California, Arizona, Texas and Kansas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-24/business/fi-2005_1_atari |title=Atari to Acquire Federated Group for $67.3 Million : Deal Would Give Video Pioneer Access to a Retail Network |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 25, 1987 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402085921/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-24/business/fi-2005_1_atari |archivedate=April 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when major American electronics outlets were reluctant to carry Atari-branded computers, and two-thirds of Atari's PC production was sold in Europe.&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollack |first=Andrew |title=Atari to Acquire Electronics Retailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/business/atari-to-acquire-electronics-retailer.html |work=New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=14 May 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213084721/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/25/business/atari-to-acquire-electronics-retailer.html |archivedate=December 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federated Group (not related to [[Federated Department Stores]]) was sold to [[Silo (store)|Silo]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=APPublished: November 11, 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/11/business/company-news-atari-is-selling-26-federated-stores.html |title=COMPANY NEWS; Atari Is Selling 26 Federated Stores |work=New York Times |date=November 11, 1989 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517223923/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/11/business/company-news-atari-is-selling-26-federated-stores.html |archivedate=May 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Atari released the [[Atari Lynx]], a handheld console with color graphics, to much fanfare.  A shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season, and the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's [[Game Boy]] which, despite only having a black and white display, was cheaper, had better battery life and had much higher availability.  Tramiel emphasized computers over game consoles but Atari's proprietary computer architecture and operating system fell victim to the success of the [[Wintel]] platform while the game market revived.  In 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendosuit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

In 1993, Atari positioned its [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] as the only 64-bit interactive media entertainment system available, but it sold poorly.  It would be the last home console to be produced by Atari and the last to be produced by an American manufacturer until [[Microsoft]]'s introduction of the [[Xbox]] in 2001.

In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;JTS-Mar-1998-8-K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/524/104746998009085/filing-main.htm |title=JTS, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 9, 1998 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516113642/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/524/104746998009085/filing-main.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-goes-to-hasbro/1100-2462915/|title=Atari goes to Hasbro|publisher=GameSpot|date=April 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transaction primarily involved the brand and intellectual property, which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000 when French software publisher [[Infogrames]] took over [[Hasbro Interactive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hasbro-Dec-2000-8-K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2187/4608000000017/filing-main.htm |title=Hasbro, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Dec 7, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516114500/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2187/4608000000017/filing-main.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2003, Infogrames had its majority-owned, but discrete US subsidiary Infogrames NA officially renamed '''Atari, Inc.''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Atari-May-2003-8-K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/597/95012303005486/filing-main.htm |title=Atari, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 8, 2003 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516120453/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/597/95012303005486/filing-main.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; renamed its European operations to Atari Europe but kept the original name of the main company [[Infogrames Entertainment]].
