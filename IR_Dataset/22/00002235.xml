As an adjective, the word Afghan also means &quot;of or relating to Afghanistan or its people, [[pashto|language]], or culture&quot;.

==Afghani==
The term &quot;Afghani&quot; refers to the unit of [[Afghan afghani|Afghan currency]]. The term is also often used (and appears in some dictionaries) for a person or thing related to Afghanistan, although some have expressed the opinion that this usage is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chatterbox: More on 'Afghani' |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/10/more_on_afghani.html |website=[[Slate.com|Slate]] |date=October 4, 2001 |accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Afghani&quot; (or more usually &quot;al-Afghani&quot;) is also a common surname among Afghans – for example, [[Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī]] and [[Jamila Afghani]].

The Afghani currency unit was created in 1925. Between 1925 and 1993 varieties of Afghani coins and banknotes were in circulation through Afghanistan. Coins issued during this period consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25 [[Pul (coin)|pul]] in bronze, brass, copper nickel, and aluminum-bronze; silver ½, 1, and 2½ Afghani; and gold ½, 1, and 2½ amani. Banknotes issued were in: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 Afghani. In 1958 bank notes worth 2 and 5 were switched with coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famouswonders.com/afghan-afghani/|title=Afghan Afghani|work=famouswonders.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
