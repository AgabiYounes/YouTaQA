'''American Media, Inc. (AMI)''' is an American publisher of magazines, [[supermarket tabloid]]s, and books based in New York City. Originally affiliated with only the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', the media company's holdings expanded considerably in the 1990s and 2000s. In November 2010, American Media filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection due to debts of nearly $1 billion, but has continued to buy and sell magazine brands since then.

AMI has been in the news affiliated with accusations of [[catch and kill]] operations. On December 12, 2018, [[United States Attorney|the U.S. Attorney's Office]] reported that AMI admitted to paying $150,000 to [[Karen McDougal]] in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign for the sole purpose of preventing damaging allegations prior to the [[2016 US presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/nyregion/trump-american-media-michael-cohen.html|title=Tabloid Publisher's Deal in Hush-Money Inquiry Adds to Trump's Danger|last=McIntire|first=Mike|date=2018-12-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-13|last2=Savage|first2=Charlie|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Rutenberg|first3=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its September 2018 non-prosecution agreement with [[Southern District of New York]] federal prosecutors, AMI &quot;shall commit no crimes whatsoever&quot; for three years, otherwise &quot;A.M.I. shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which this office has knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/jeff-bezos-sanchez-enquirer.html |title=Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer of 'Extortion and Blackmail' |authors=Jim Rutenberg and Karen Weise |date=February 7, 2019 |website=NYTimes.com |publisher= |access-date=February 8, 2019 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2019, [[Chatham Asset Management]], which controls 80 percent of AMI's stock, forced AMI to sell the ''National Enquirer''.&lt;ref name=enquirergone&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/10/american-media-inc-is-looking-to-sell-the-national-enquirer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=april102019&gt;https://bangordailynews.com/2019/04/10/news/nation/national-enquirer-expected-to-be-sold-imminently-as-parent-company-faces-pressure/&lt;/ref&gt; This came after Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, who AMI has also relied on for survival, expressed dismay over the tabloid magazine's recent scandals involving hush money assistance to [[President of the United States|U.S.]] President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 campaign and blackmail of [[Jeff Bezos]].&lt;ref name=enquirergone /&gt;&lt;ref name=april102019 /&gt; On April 18, 2019, AMI agreed to sell not only the ''National Enquirer'', but two of its other publications, ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' and ''[[National Examiner]]'', to [[Hudson Group]].&lt;ref name=aprilNPR&gt;https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715050724/national-enquirer-to-be-sold-to-hudson-news-heir-james-cohen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aprilabc&gt;https://abcnews.go.com/Business/hudson-media-buys-national-enquirer-100-million-wake/story?id=62499219&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The modern American Media came into being after [[Generoso Pope Jr.]], longtime owner of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'', died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership. American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' from Rupert Murdoch. The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the ''[[Globe (tabloid)|Globe]]'' and the ''[[National Examiner]]'') followed nine years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/02/business/the-media-business-leading-tabloid-publisher-to-buy-a-big-competitor.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Leading Tabloid Publisher to Buy a Big Competitor|last=Kuczynski|first=Alex|date=1999-11-02|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Altman]], through [[Evercore Partners]], bought a controlling stake in American Media in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1007/The_Clintonite_who_owns_National_Enquirer.html|title=The Clintonite who owns National Enquirer|first=Ben|last=Smith|work=The Politico newspaper|date=October 11, 2007|publisher=[[Politico]]|accessdate=July 9, 2016|location=[[Arlington County, Virginia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Media is not to be confused with American Media Distribution the international news coverage firm. American Media's former corporate headquarters in [[Boca Raton, Florida]], figured prominently in news headlines in late 2001, after an [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attack]] was perpetrated on the company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/27/us/traces-terror-bioterror-fbi-re-enter-building-long-after-anthrax-shut-it.html|title=Traces of Terror: The Bioterror; F.B.I to Re-enter Building Long After Anthrax Shut It|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Dana|last=Canedy|date=August 27, 2002|access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/02/15/93170200/timeline-how-the-anthrax-terror-unfolded|title=Timeline: How the Anthrax Terror Unfolded|publisher=NPR|date=February 15, 2011|access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the corporate headquarters have moved to New York City at 1 Park Avenue in [[Manhattan]], before moving to the [[Financial District]] to the former [[JP Morgan Chase]] headquarters at 4 New York Plaza. That building was severely damaged by [[Hurricane Sandy]] but reopened in February 2013. The [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[David J. Pecker]], travels between the Boca Raton and New York offices while managing the company.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

AMI continued to expand after it bought [[Joe Weider]]'s Weider Publications in 2002. Joe Weider continued to manage control of his magazines under AMI's Weider Publications subsidiary until his death in March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/joe-weider-legendary-bodybuilding-and-fitness-icon-dies-at-93-2013-03-23 |title=Joe Weider Legendary Bodybuilding and Fitness Icon Dies at 93 |publisher=MarketWatch |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trounson |first=Rebecca |url=https://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-0324-joe-weider-20130324,0,590860.story |title=Joe Weider dies at 93; bodybuilding pioneer and publisher |publisher=latimes.com |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Media also owns Distribution Services, an in-store magazine merchandising company. In fall 2002, it launched the book-publishing [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]], AMI Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030804/21271-american-media-to-expand-book-program-.html |volume=250 |issue=31 |date=August 4, 2003 |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |title=American Media to Expand Book Program |first=Jim |last=Milliot |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |archivedate=September 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907001420/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030804/21271-american-media-to-expand-book-program-.html |url-status=live |publisher=PWxyz LLC |location=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s: Bankruptcy and continued acquisitions ===
In 2009, American Media was taken over by its bondholders to keep it out of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704648604575621053554011206|title=American Media Files for Bankruptcy|last=Morath|first=Eric|date=2010-11-17|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=2019-02-03|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, American Media filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection due to nearly $1 billion in debt, and assets of less than $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Media Chapter 11 Voluntary Petition|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/7ICRXZA/American_Media,_Inc.__nysbke-10-16140__0001.0.pdf|date=November 17, 2010|work=[[PACER (law)|Pacer]]|location=[[San Antonio]]|publisher=[[Federal judiciary of the United States]]|accessdate=May 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its subsidiary, American Media Operations Inc., listed assets of $100 to $500 million and debt of over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='National Enquirer' Publisher Files for Chapter 11|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=November 17, 2010|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-11-17/national-enquirer-tabloid-publisher-american-media-files-for-bankruptcy|accessdate=July 9, 2016|first1=Don|last1=Jeffrey|first2=Phil|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|location=New York City|last2=Milford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exited in December.

In May 2014, American Media announced a decision to shift the headquarters of the ''National Enquirer'' from Florida, where it had been located since 1971, back to New York City, where it originally began as ''The New York Enquirer'' in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/business/national-enquirer-leaving-florida-headquarters-1.1020369|title=National Enquirer leaving Florida headquarters|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|accessdate=July 9, 2016|date=May 21, 2014|publisher=[[North Jersey Media Group]]|location=[[Woodland Park, New Jersey]]|author=The Associated Press|author-link=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, American Media was acquired by Chatham Asset Management and [[Leon G.

In 2015, American Media sold ''[[Shape (magazine)|Shape]]'', ''Natural Health'', and ''[[Fit Pregnancy]]'' to [[Meredith Corporation|Meredith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foliomag.com/2015/meredith-buys-shape-ami-60-million/|title=Meredith Buys Shape From AMI for $60 Million |first=Bill |last=Mickey |date=January 28, 2015 |website=foliomag.com |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pecker revealed to the Toronto Star that AMI now relied on support from Chatham Asset Management and its owner Anthony Melchiorre.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/10/19/executive-from-national-enquirer-parent-joins-postmedia-board.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=april102019 /&gt; The $4 billion hedge fund owns 80 percent of AMI's stock.&lt;ref name=april102019 /&gt;

In March 2017, American Media acquired ''[[Us Weekly]]'' from [[Wenner Media]] for a reported $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Us Weekly Is Sold to National Enquirer Publisher|date=March 15, 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/business/media/us-weekly-national-enquirer-american-media.html|accessdate=March 15, 2017|first1=Sydney|last1=Ember|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, in June 2017, American Media also acquired ''[[Men's Journal]]'' from Wenner Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/303376/american-media-buys-wenners-mens-journal-to-at.html|title=American Media Buys Wenner's 'Men's Journal' To Attract Premium Advertisers|website=mediapost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, American Media acquired 13 brands from [[Bauer Media Group]] including ''[[In Touch Weekly]]'', ''[[Life &amp; Style (magazine)|Life &amp; Style]]'' and ''[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]'' to add to their celebrity portfolio. They also acquired Bauer Media's kids group including ''[[J-14 (magazine)|J-14]]'' and ''Girl's World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/38433373/american-media-inc-acquires-celebrity-and-kids-group-titles-from-bauer-media-usa|title=American Media, Inc.

In April 2019, the ''National Enquirer'' was reported to be up for sale and likely to be sold within days. The company stated that it had shifted its emphasis away from tabloids to its &quot;glossy&quot; magazines such as ''[[Us Weekly]]'' and ''[[Men's Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/business/dealbook/national-enquirer-sale.html|title=The National Enquirer Is for Sale, and a Deal Seems Near|first1=Edmund|last1=Lee|first2=Andrew Ross|last2=Sorkin|first3=Ben|last3=Protess|date=10 April 2019|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came following pressure from Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, who expressed disapproval of the Enquirer's style of journalism.&lt;ref name=april102019 /&gt;&lt;ref name=enquirergone /&gt;  On April 18, 2019, AMI accepted an offer from Hudson News head James Cohen and agreed to sell not only the ''National Enquirer'', but also ''Globe'' and ''The Examiner'' to Hudson News for $100 million.&lt;ref name=aprilNPR /&gt;&lt;ref name=aprilabc /&gt; At the time the sales were announced, AMI was approximately $355 million in debt.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2019/04/national-enquirer-sold-in-100-million-deal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== &quot;Catch-and-kill&quot; scandals related to Donald Trump ==
In late 2015, AMI paid $30,000 to Dino Sajudin, a doorman at [[Trump Tower]], to obtain the rights to his story in which he alleged Donald Trump had an affair in the 1980s that resulted in the birth of a child. Sajudin in April 2018 identified the woman as Trump's former housekeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/12/media/trump-national-enquirer-doorman/index.html|title=Former doorman involved in story of alleged Trump affair speaks|last=Moghe|first=Chris Isidore, Tom Kludt and Sonia|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMI reporters were given the names of the woman and the alleged child, while Sajudin passed a lie detector test when testifying that he had heard the story from others. Shortly after the payment was made, Pecker ordered the reporters to drop the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-national-enquirer-a-donald-trump-rumor-and-another-secret-payment-to-buy-silence-dino-sajudin-david-pecker|title=The National Enquirer, a Trump Rumor, and Another Secret Payment to Buy Silence|last=Farrow|first=Ronan|date=2018-04-12|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|issn=0028-792X|authorlink=Ronan Farrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, AMI chief content officer [[Dylan Howard]] denied the story was “spiked” in a so-called “[[catch and kill]]” operation, insisting that AMI did not run the story because Sajudin's story lacked credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/f37ecfc4710b468db6a103a245146172|title=$30,000 rumor?

The contract instructed Sajudin to provide &quot;information regarding Donald Trump's illegitimate child,&quot; but did not contain further specifics of Sajudin's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/24/politics/trump-tower-doorman-contract-ami/index.html|title=Ex-Trump World Tower doorman releases 'catch-and-kill' contract about alleged Trump affair|first=Sonia |last=Moghe|publisher=CNN|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karen McDougal ===
[[File:American Media Inc. Non-Prosecution Agreement.pdf|alt=American Media Inc. Non-Prosecution Agreement|thumb|American Media Inc. Non-Prosecution Agreement]]
In 2016, AMI paid ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Karen McDougal]] $150,000 for exclusive rights to her allegations of a ten-month affair with [[Donald Trump]]—which she claimed happened in 2006-2007, when he was already married to [[Melania Trump|Melania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/karen-mcdougal-interview.html|title=Ex-Playboy Model Karen McDougal Details 10-Month Affair With Donald Trump|last=Rutenberg|first=Jim|date=2018-03-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but AMI never published the story. AMI publicly acknowledged having made the payment after ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' revealed it days before the 2016 presidential election, but AMI denied that its purpose had been to [[Catch and kill|&quot;kill damaging stories about]]&quot; Trump; instead, AMI claimed it had paid only for &quot;exclusive life rights to any relationship [McDougal] has had with a then-married man&quot; and &quot;two years’ worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380|title=National Enquirer Shielded Donald Trump From Playboy Model's Affair Allegation|last1=Palazzolo|first1=Joe|last2=Rothfeld|first2=Michael|date=November 4, 2016|accessdate=February 17, 2018|last3=Alpert|first3=Lukas|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/11/report-national-enquirer-bought-rights-to-trump-affair-story-but-never-published-004848|title=Report: National Enquirer bought rights to Trump affair story, but never published|last=Weprin|first=Alex|date=November 4, 2016|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, McDougal filed a lawsuit to invalidate the non-disclosure agreement she had with AMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/us/mcdougal-complaint-exhibits.pdf?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article|title=Karen McDougal v.

On December 12, 2018, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced its agreement with AMI &quot;AMI admitted that it made the $150,000 payment in concert with a candidate’s presidential campaign,&quot; the press release said, so that Karen McDougal wouldn't &quot;publicize damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 presidential election. AMI further admitted that its principal purpose in making the payment was to suppress the woman’s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election.&quot; As a result of this agreement, AMI would not face prosecution and agreed to provide extensive assistance to prosecutors about the involvement of Trump and other politicians with the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://politi.co/2C7Ikgi|title=A 'loud gong': National Enquirer's surprise deal could imperil Trump|first=Darren|last=Samuelsohn|website=POLITICO|accessdate=13 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same press release also revealed that Michael Cohen had been sentenced to three years in prison for various crimes, including the $150,000 campaign finance violation—the facilitation of the payment to McDougal—to which he pled guilty on August 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-sentenced-3-years-prison|title=Michael Cohen Sentenced To 3 Years In Prison|date=2018-12-12|website=justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45265546|title=Michael Cohen trial: Trump accused of directing hush money|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-reaches-plea-deal-reports-180821183403656.html|title=Ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleads guilty, implicates president|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jeff Bezos blackmail ==

In January 2019, the ''National Enquirer'' broke a story about the extramarital affair of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] founder and ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' owner [[Jeff Bezos]] with [[Lauren Sánchez]]. Bezos began investigating how and why the information had been leaked to the ''National Enquirer.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-accuses-national-enquirer-ami/story?id=60924072|title=National Enquirer's parent company says it will investigate allegations of extortion made by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Trump has long expressed displeasure with Bezos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/07/trump-bezos-feud-amazon-washington-post-taxes-usps|title=What is the Donald Trump v Jeff Bezos feud really about?|last=Helmore|first=Edward|date=2018-04-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/19/17371780/donald-trump-amazon-jeff-bezos-postal-service|title=Trump's trying to fight Amazon and Jeff Bezos from the White House|last=Stewart|first=Emily|date=2018-05-19|website=Vox|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/17/donald-trump-jeff-bezos-amazon-washington-post-power-money|title=Why does Trump hate Jeff Bezos: is it about power or money?|last=Smith|first=David|date=2018-06-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Trump's irritation may have increased due to the ''Washington Post's'' critical coverage of the murder (and the subsequent cover-up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/inside-the-washington-post-anger-and-fear-and-a-demand-for-the-truth-about-jamal-khashoggi|title='He's Our Colleague': Inside the Post, Anger and Fear Over Khashoggi's Fate|last=Pompeo|first=Joe|date=17 October 2018|website=The Hive|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of one of its reporters, [[Jamal Khashoggi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/05/saudi-arabia-washington-posts-coverage-khashoggi-killing-fuels-calls-amazon-boycott/|title=In Saudi Arabia, Washington Post's coverage of Khashoggi killing fuels calls for Amazon boycott|last=Taylor|first=Adam|date=5 November 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=8 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, Bezos suspects, may have been the political motivation for someone to leak his affair to the tabloid.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@jeffreypbezos/no-thank-you-mr-pecker-146e3922310f|title=No thank you, Mr. Pecker|last=Bezos|first=Jeff|date=2019-02-07|website=Jeff Bezos|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2019, Bezos shared emails that he had received the previous day&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; in which AMI sought a public statement from him and his lawyer &quot;affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage [of the sexual affair] was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility.&quot; AMI chief content officer [[Dylan Howard]] and his lawyer Jon Fine threatened Bezos, saying that if Bezos did not promptly meet their demands, AMI would publish [[selfie]]s and [[Sexting|sexts]] sent between Bezos and his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/jeff-bezos-accuses-national-enquirer-publisher-of-blackmail-extortion.html|title=Jeff Bezos accuses National Enquirer publisher of blackmail, extortion|last=Kim|first=Eugene|date=2019-02-07|website=cnbc.com|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bezos wrote that he would refuse to make this &quot;specific lie&quot; or to otherwise participate in this blackmail bargain that &quot;no real journalists [would] ever propose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; &quot;Of course I don’t want personal photos published,&quot; Bezos added, but he said he chooses to &quot;stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.&quot;

That same day, ''The Washington Post'' published an article on the matter, quoting a former federal prosecutor who speculated that this news could undermine AMI's recent deal with the government. If prosecutors decide they must file new criminal charges against AMI, the government may not be able &quot;to continue to use them [AMI] to assist other ongoing investigations,&quot; said Robert Mintz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/2019/02/07/f501d20c-2b2d-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html|title=Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos accuses National Enquirer of extortion over intimate photos|last=Farhi|first=Paul|date=7 February 2019|work=Washington Post|access-date=8 February 2019|last2=Ellison|first2=Sarah|last3=Barrett|first3=Devlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauren Sanchez's brother, Michael Sanchez, an ardent Trump supporter, stated he was told by multiple AMI employees that the Enquirer set out to do “a takedown to make Trump happy”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/was-tabloid-expose-of-bezos-affair-just-juicy-gossip-or-a-political-hit-job/2019/02/05/03d2f716-2633-11e9-90cd-dedb0c92dc17_story.html|title=Was tabloid exposé of Bezos affair just juicy gossip or a political hit job?|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported seeing documents showing that Sanchez believed the Bezos story was run with “President Trump’s knowledge and appreciation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/mistress-lauren-sanchezs-brother-leaked-bezos-racy-texts-to-enquirer-sources-say-7 |title=Mistress' Brother Leaked Bezos Texts to Enquirer |first=Lachlan|last=Markay |date=10 February 2019 |website=thedailybeast.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
