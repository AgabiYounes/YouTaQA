==Background and history==
In the early 1970s, the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) was the main Muslim rebel group fighting in Basilan and Mindanao.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt; [[Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani]], the older brother of [[Khadaffy Janjalani]], had been a teacher from Basilan, who studied Islamic theology and [[Arabic]] in Libya, [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PacCom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu Sayyaf History |publisher=U.S. Pacific Command |date=21 September 2006 |url=http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/abusayyafhist.shtml |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123213349/http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/abusayyafhist.shtml |archivedate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Who are the Abu Sayyaf |date=30 December 2000 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/719623.stm |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdurajik went to Afghanistan to fight against the [[Soviet Union]] and the Afghan government during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. During that period, he is alleged to have met [[Osama Bin Laden]] and been given $6&amp;nbsp;million to establish a more Islamic group drawn from the MNLF.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah |url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf |publisher=The National Bureau of Asian Research |accessdate=20 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927184541/http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2006 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) was established in 1989 in part in response.

Located on the northwestern part of Basilan, Isabela is the capital of the province. Isabela City is administered under the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] political region north of Basilan, while the rest of the island province of Basilan is since 1996 governed as part of ARMM to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Banlaoi |first1=Rommel |title=Al-Harakatul Al-Islamiyyah: Essays on the Abu Sayyaf Group, Terrorism in the Philippines from Al A Qaeda to ISIS |url=https://www.academia.edu/40446207 |website=Academia |publisher=Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research |accessdate=5 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani leadership (1989–1998)===
In the early 1990s, MNLF moderated into an established political government, the ARMM. It was established in 1989, fully institutionalized by 1996, and became the ruling government in southern Mindanao. When Abdurajik returned to Basilan island in 1990, he gathered radical members of the old MNLF who wanted to resume armed struggle and in 1991 established the Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt; Janjalani was fundedby a Saudi Islamist, [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], who came to the Philippines in 1987 or 1988 and was head of the Philippine branch of the [[International Islamic Relief Organization]] foundation. A defector from Abu Sayyaf told Filipino authorities, &quot;The IIRO was behind the construction of Mosques, school buildings, and other livelihood projects&quot; but only &quot;in areas penetrated, highly influenced and controlled by the Abu Sayyaf&quot;. According to the defector, &quot;Only 10 to 30% of the foreign funding goes to the legitimate relief and livelihood projects and the rest go to terrorist operations&quot;.&lt;ref name=abuza&gt;Zachary Abuza, &quot;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25798639 Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah],&quot; ''The National Bureau of Asian Research'' 14, no. 5 (December 2003): 176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

By 1995, Abu Sayyaf was active in large-scale bombings and attacks. The first attack was the assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April 1995. This year marked the escape of 20-year-old Khadaffy Janjalani from [[Camp Crame]] in [[Manila]] along with another member named Jovenal Bruno. On 18 December 1998, Abdurajik was killed in a gun battle with the [[Philippine National Police]] on Basilan Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt; He is thought to have been about 39.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt;

The death of Aburajik marked a turning point in Abu Sayyaf operations. The group shifted to kidnappings, murders and robberies, under younger brother Khadaffy. Basilan, Jolo and Sulu experienced some of the fiercest fights between government troops and Abu Sayyaf through the early 1990s. Abu Sayyaf primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members traveling to [[Manila]] and other provinces. It was reported that Abu Sayyaf began expanding into neighboring [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] by the early 1990s. Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest, but strongest of the Philippine [[Islamist]] separatist groups. Some Abu Sayyaf members studied or worked in [[Saudi Arabia]] and developed ties to [[mujahadeen]], while fighting and training in the war against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PacCom&quot; /&gt; Abu Sayyaf proclaimed themselves to be [[mujahideen]] and freedom fighters.

===Khadaffy Janjalani leadership (1999–2007)===
Until his death in a gun battle on 4 September 2006, [[Khadaffy Janjalani|Khaddafy Janjalani]] was considered the nominal leader of the group by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. Then 23-year-old Khadaffy took leadership of one of the Abu Sayyaf's factions in an internecine struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCFresh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh fighting in S Philippines |publisher=BBC |date=7 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5322680.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked to consolidate his leadership, causing the group to appear inactive for a period. After his leadership was secured, Abu Sayyaf began a new strategy, taking hostages. The group's motive for kidnapping became more financial than religious during this period, according to locals. The hostage money probably provides the group's financing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBR&quot; /&gt;

Abu Sayyaf expanded its operations to Malaysia in 2000, when it abducted foreigners from two resorts. This action was condemned by most Islamic leaders. It was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of more than 30 foreigners and Christian clerics and workers, including Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNCapture&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Manilla captures senior Abu Sayyaf|publisher=CNN|date=7 December 2003|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/12/07/philippines.abusayyaf/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-hostage describes jungle ordeal|publisher=CNN|date=9 May 2003|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/05/08/cnna.burnham/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influential commander named [[Abu Sabaya]] was killed at sea in June 2002 while trying to evade local forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ict&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prominent Abu Sayyaf Commander Believed Dead|url=http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796 |publisher=Institute for Counter-Terrorism|accessdate=20 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105081224/http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796 |archivedate=5 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death is considered a crucial turning point for the group, as the number of operatives working for Abu Sayyaf sharply decreased from 1100 in 2001 to 450 in late 2002, and had since been stagnant for the next ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;East&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=East|first=Bob|authorlink=Bob East|title=Terror Truncated: The Decline of the Abu Sayyaf Group from the Crucial Year 2002|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=[[Newcastle upon Tyne]], United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-4438-4461-1|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=pzgyBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=3 December 2019|pages=3, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2006, it was reported that Abu Sayyaf members may have been planning attacks during the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) summit in the Philippines. The group was reported to have trained alongside [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] militants.

===2010–present===
In a video published in the summer of 2014, senior Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon and other masked men swore their allegiance or &quot;[[bay'ah]]&quot; to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], the &quot;[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]&quot; (ISIL) caliph. &quot;We pledge to obey him on anything which our hearts desire or not and to value him more than anyone else.

==Supporters and funding==
Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani's first recruits were soldiers of MNLF and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF). However, both MNLF and MILF deny links with Abu Sayyaf. Both officially distance themselves because of its attacks on civilians and its supposed profiteering. The Philippine military, however, has claimed that elements of both groups provide support to Abu Sayyaf. The group was originally not thought to receive funding from outside sources, but intelligence reports from the United States, Indonesia and Australia found intermittent ties to the Indonesian [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] terrorist group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ferry bomb terror suspect held in Manila |publisher=CNN |date=30 August 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/30/philippines.suspect/index.html?iref=newssearch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines|Philippine]] government considers the Abu Sayyaf to be part of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot;/&gt; The government noted that initial funding for ASG came from [[al-Qaeda]] through the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Return of Abu Sayyaf |date=30 August 2004 |publisher=Time Asia Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501040830-686107,00.html | first=Simon | last=Elegant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCAirRebel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Air raids hit Philippines rebels |publisher=BBC |date=20 November 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4027721.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AsiaWeek: 08.31.1999 |publisher=AsiaWeek |date=31 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79205&amp;page=1&amp;page=1 | title=The Abu Sayyaf-Al Qaeda Connection-Abu Sayyaf Terrorist Group Alleged to Have Links to Al Qaeda | publisher=abc News International | accessdate=20 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091111-235574/Abu-Sayyaf-survives-US-based-Philippine-crackdown |title=Abu Sayyaf survives US-backed Philippine crackdown |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate=11 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005634/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091111-235574/Abu-Sayyaf-survives-US-based-Philippine-crackdown |archivedate=12 October 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation, beliefs, targets==
Filipino Islamist guerillas such as Abu Sayyaf have been described as &quot;rooted in a distinct class made up of closely knit networks built through marriage of important families through socioeconomic backgrounds and family structures&quot;, according to Michael Buehler. This tight-knit, familial structure provides resilience, but also limits their growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBT-9-2014&quot;/&gt; Commander of the Western Mindanao Command Lieutenant General Rustico Guerrero, describes Abu Sayyaf as &quot;a local group with a local agenda&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBT-9-2014&quot;/&gt; Two kidnapping victims, (Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]]) who were kept in captivity by ASG for over a year, &quot;gently engaged their captors in theological discussion&quot; and found Abu Sayyaf fighters to be unfamiliar with the [[Qur'an]]. They had only &quot;a sketchy&quot; notion of Islam, which they saw as &quot;a set of behavioural rules, to be violated when it suited them&quot;, according to author [[Mark Bowden]]. As &quot;[[mujahideen|holy warriors]], they were justified in kidnapping, killing and stealing. Having sex with women captives was justified by their claiming them as &quot;wives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Bowden, Mark|title=Jihadists in Paradise|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/03/jihadists-in-paradise/305613/2/|magazine=The Atlantic|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike MILF and MNLF, the group is not recognised by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and according to author [[Robert (Bob) East|Robert East]], was seen as &quot;nothing more than a criminal operation&quot; at least prior to 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;east-2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=East|first1=Robert|title=Terror Truncated: The Decline of the Abu Sayyaf Group from the Crucial Year 2002|date=17 May 2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing.|page=2|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pzgyBwAAQBAJ|page=2}}|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] report by Jack Fellman notes the political rather than religious motivation of ASG. He quotes Khadaffy's statement that his brother was right to split from MNLF because &quot;up to now, nothing came out&quot; of attempts to gain more autonomy for Moro Muslims. This suggests, Fellman believes, that ASG &quot;is merely the latest, albeit most violent, iteration of Moro political dissatisfaction that has existed for the last several decades&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fellman-4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fellman|first1=Jack|title=Abu Sayyaf Group|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/111128_Fellman_ASG_AQAMCaseStudy5.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic International Studies|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Abu Sayyaf members are also &quot;shabu&quot; ([[methamphetamine]]) users as described by surviving hostages who saw Abu Sayyaf members taking shabu as well from military findings who found drug packets in many of the abandoned Abu Sayyaf nests that justified their motivation as [[extremism|extreme]] criminals and terrorists as their state of mind were under the influence of drugs rather than being consciously fighting for the betterment of their region as well rights to living under their minority religion without any discrimination from the majority Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/583221/news/nation/military-says-abu-sayyaf-members-are-shabu-users|title=(INFO FROM EX-CAPTIVES) Military says Abu Sayyaf members are shabu users|publisher=GMA News|date=29 September 2016|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its spokesman known as Abu Rami ({{abbr|d.|died}} 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/12/17/abu-sayyaf-leader-abu-rami-killed-in-bohol-clash|title=Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Rami killed in Bohol clash|author1=Annie Fe Perez|author2=Junrey Nadela|agency=Reuters|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=12 April 2017|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared to lack knowledge of the activities of other members, as the group had apparently separated into many small groups with their own leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/one-mans-meat/2016/10/01/a-peek-into-the-mind-of-abu-sayyaf-man-daily-chats-with-a-terrorist-provide-a-chilling-insight-into/|title=A peek into the mind of Abu Sayyaf man|author=Philip Golingai|work=The Star|date=1 October 2016|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Targets===
Most Abu Sayyaf victims have been Filipinos; however, in recent years (especially from 2011 onwards), Australian, British, Canadian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Norwegian, Swiss and Vietnamese nationals have been kidnapped or attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack on fishermen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AS involved&quot;/&gt;

Previously, Americans were particularly targeted. An unnamed ASG spokesman allegedly stated, &quot;We have been trying hard to get an American because they may think we are afraid of them&quot;. He added, &quot;We want to fight the American people.&quot;&lt;ref name=ETaK&gt;{{cite web|title=Engine trouble and kidnappings|url=http://www.sailingtotem.com/2014/06/engine-trouble-and-kidnappings.html|website=sailingtotem.com|accessdate=16 May 2015|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Abu Sayyaf kidnapped an American Bible translator. In 2000, Abu Sayyaf captured an American Muslim and demanded that the United States release [[Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman]] and [[Ramzi Yousef]], who were jailed for their involvement in the 1993 [[World Trade Center bombing]] in New York City.

Between March 2016 – July 2017, the majority of Abu Sayyaf kidnap for ransom operations shifted to the high seas. Seventeen ships were boarded and some sixty-five hostages from six countries were taken. In total, thirty hostages have been released (usually after a ransom was paid), seven escaped, three were rescued by Philippine security forces, and four were executed. Two others were killed during the attacks while eight seamen escaped during the shipjackings. An additional forty seamen were not taken hostage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/08/why-vietnam-must-fight-the-islamic-state-terror-threat/|title=Why Vietnam Must Fight the Islamic State Terror Threat|work=The Diplomat by Zachary Abuza|date=3 August 2017|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes and terrorism==
{{Main|Timeline of Abu Sayyaf attacks}}
Abu Sayyaf has carried out numerous [[bombing]]s, [[kidnapping]]s, assassinations, and [[extortion]] activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;banlaoi&quot;/&gt; These include the [[2000 Sipadan kidnappings]], the 2001 [[Dos Palmas kidnappings]] and the [[2004 SuperFerry 14 bombing]].

===Kidnappings===
Although the group has engaged in kidnapping hostages to be exchanged for ransom for many years, this means of funding grew dramatically beginning in 2014, providing funds for the group's rapid growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;HookwayRansomTerror&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hookway|first1=James|title=Terror Grows in Southern Philippines From Militants Linked to Islamic State Kidnappings, beheadings by Abu Sayyaf raise fears of expanding terror threat in Southeast Asia|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/terror-grows-in-southern-philippines-from-militants-linked-to-islamic-state-1479465005|accessdate=20 November 2016|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Journalists abducted since 2000=====
[[ABS–CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]]'s ''Newsbreak'' reported that Abu Sayyaf abducted at least 20 journalists from 2000 to 2008 (mostly foreign journalists). All of them were eventually released upon payment of [[ransom]].

=====Jeffrey Schilling=====
On 31 August 2000, American citizen and Muslim convert Jeffrey Schilling from [[Oakland, California]] was captured on [[Jolo]] while visiting a terrorist camp with his new wife, Ivy Osani (a cousin of Abu Sabaya, one of the rebel leaders), whom he had met online. ASG demanded a $10&amp;nbsp;million ransom. Rebels also sarcastically threatened to behead him in 2001 as a &quot;birthday present&quot; to then Philippine President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], who responded by declaring &quot;all-out war&quot; on them. The beheading threat was withdrawn after Schilling's mother, Carol, flew to the Philippines and appealed for mercy on local radio. On 12 April 2001, Philippine soldiers raided a rebel camp and rescued the American. The United States praised the Philippine government for freeing Schilling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-13/news/0104130152_1_abu-sayyaf-ivy-osani-american-hostage-jeffrey-schilling|title=Philippine Soldiers Rescue U.s.

Many commentators have been critical of Schilling, who claims to have walked willingly into the camp after he was invited by his wife's cousin, a member of Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/14/MNE165246.DTL |title= What Was Schilling Thinking? Oblivious Oakland Man Sets Himself Up |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=14 April 2001 |author=Chip Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilling was one of more than forty hostages taken by Abu Sayyaf in 2000, including twenty-one tourists and workers seized in a raid on [[Abu Sayyaf#2000 Sipadan kidnappings|Sipadan]] diving resort in neighbouring Malaysia. Many of the hostages were released after Libya paid millions of dollars. A Libyan official stated that Schilling had visited the Jolo camp often before his capture. Philippine intelligence sources say he was interested in selling military equipment to the rebels, while the bandits accused him of being a CIA agent. Abu Sayyaf threatened several times to kill Schilling. At one stage, Schilling reportedly went on a hunger strike to win his freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;/&gt;

=====Martin and Gracia Burnham=====
{{See also|Dos Palmas kidnappings}}
On 27 May 2001, an Abu Sayyaf raid kidnapped about 20 people from Dos Palmas, an expensive resort in Honda Bay, taking them to the north of [[Puerto Princesa City]] on the island of [[Palawan]], which had been &quot;considered completely safe&quot;. The most &quot;valuable&quot; hostages were three North Americans, Martin and Gracia Burnham, a [[missionary]] couple, and Guillermo Sobero, a Peruvian-American tourist who was later [[Decapitation|beheaded]], following a $1&amp;nbsp;million [[ransom]] demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsstand.blogs.com/newsstand/2007/01/turns_out_abu_s.html|title=Newsstand: Gracia's enemies|date=6 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206072229/http://newsstand.blogs.com/newsstand/2007/01/turns_out_abu_s.html|archivedate=6 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostages and hostage-takers then returned to Abu Sayyaf territories in Mindanao.&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p54&gt;&quot;Manhunt&quot; by Mark Bowden, ''The Atlantic'', March 2007, p.54 (15)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bowden, the leader of the raid was Abu Sabaya. According to [[Gracia Burnham]], she told her husband &quot;to identify his kidnappers&quot; to authorities &quot;as 'the Osama bin Laden Group,' but Burnham was unfamiliar with that name and stuck with&quot; Abu Sayyaf. After returning to Mindanao, Abu Sayyaf conducted numerous raids, including one that culminated in the [[Siege of Lamitan]] and &quot;one at a coconut plantation called Golden Harvest; they took about 15 people captive there and later used [[bolo knife|bolo knives]] to hack the heads off two men. The number of hostages waxed and waned as some were ransomed and released, new ones were taken and others were killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p54 /&gt;

On 7 June 2002, about a year after the raid, Philippine army troops conducted a rescue operation in which Martin Burnham and Filipino nurse Ediborah Yap were killed. The remaining hostage was wounded and the hostage takers escaped. In July 2004, Gracia Burnham [[Testimony|testified]] at a trial of eight Abu Sayyaf members and identified six of the suspects as her captors, including Alhamzer Limbong, Abdul Azan Diamla, Abu Khari Moctar, Bas Ishmael, Alzen Jandul, and Dazid Baize. &quot;The eight suspects sat silently during her three-hour testimony, separated from her by a wooden grill. They face the death sentence if found guilty of kidnapping for ransom. The trial began this year and is not expected to end for several months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graciaburnham.org/pdf/Article_7-30-04.pdf |title=Burham identifies former Abu Captors |accessdate=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203025534/http://www.graciaburnham.org/pdf/Article_7-30-04.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhamzer Limbong was later killed in a [[Prison riot|prison uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.graciaburnham.org/index.asp?sec=3_1 Philippines Brace for Retaliation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509081455/http://www.graciaburnham.org/index.asp?sec=3_1 |date=9 May 2010 }}&quot; 15 March 2005, Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnham claimed that Philippine military officials were colluding with her captors, saying that the Armed Forces of the Philippines &quot;didn't pursue us...As time went on, we noticed that they never pursued us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XtE5QEW0ukUC}} |title=In the Presence of My Enemies |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 June 2007, Italian priest Reverend Giancarlo Bossi was kidnapped near [[Pagadian]], capital of [[Zamboanga del Sur]] Province in the southern Philippines. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] made an appeal to free him. Bossi was released on 19 July 2007 at Karumatan, a Muslim town in [[Lanao del Norte]] Province, allegedly after the payment of ransom. Father Bossi died in Italy on 23 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/world/europe/20iht-phils.1.6746806.html|title=Kidnapped Italian priest is freed in Philippines|work=The New York Times|date=20 July 2007|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/275293/italian-priest-giancarlo-bossi-former-kidnap-victim-in-mindanao-dies/story/|title=Italian priest Giancarlo Bossi, former kidnap victim in Mindanao, dies|work=GMA online|date=24 September 2012|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2009 Red Cross kidnapping=====
On 15 January 2009, Abu Sayyaf kidnapped [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) delegates in [[Patikul, Sulu|Patikul]], Sulu Province, Philippines. Three ICRC workers had finished conducting field work in Sulu province, located in the southwest of the country, when they were abducted by an unknown group, later confirmed as [[Albader Parad]]'s group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Alipala |title=3 Red Cross kidnap victims alive, safe |date=17 January 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009 |url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/redcrossabduction/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090117-183958 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829223037/http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/redcrossabduction/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090117-183958 |archivedate=29 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three were eventually released. According to a CNN story, Parad was reportedly killed, along with five other militants, in an assault by Philippine marines in Sulu province on Sunday, 21 February 2010.

=====2009 Irish priest kidnapping=====
On 11 October 2009, Irish Catholic missionary Michael Sinnott, aged 79, from [[Barntown]] [[County Wexford]] was kidnapped from a gated compound in [[Pagadian]], the capital of [[Zamboanga del Sur]] province, suspected to be part of ASG and some renegade members of MILF. Six kidnappers forced the priest into a mini-van and drove towards Sta. Lucia (district), where they transferred to a boat. Sinnott had a heart condition and was without medication when abducted. In early November, a demand for $US2&amp;nbsp;million ransom was made. On 11 November 2009, Father Sinnott was released in [[Zamboanga City]]. The Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland) claimed that no ransom was paid by the Irish Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/174394/gunmen-seize-irish-priest-in-pagadian-city/story/|title=Gunmen seize Irish priest in Pagadian City|work=GMA Online|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/11/kidnapped-priest-michael-sinnott-freed|title=Kidnapped Irish priest Michael Sinnott freed in Philippines|work=The Guardian|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/44787/irish-priest-who-survived-kidnapping-by-abu-sayyaf-returning-to-native-land|title=Irish priest who survived kidnapping by Abu Sayyaf returning to native land|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1111/124112-sinnottm/|title=Fr Michael Sinnott freed|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=12 November 2009|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2010, Japanese national Toshio Ito was kidnapped from [[Pangutaran, Sulu]]. At one point, the Philippine police believed the &quot;treasure hunter,&quot; a Muslim convert also known by his Muslim name Mamaito Katayama, was acting as a cook for Abu Sayyaf; however, this was disputed by other nations, including the United States, which included him on its list of kidnap victims. A classified document obtained by [[Rappler]] lists Ito first, saying he was held captive by Abu Sayyaf's most senior leader, Radullan Sahiron, in Langpas, [[Indanan, Sulu]] early in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/24580-the-men-rodwell-leaves-behind-with-the-abu-sayyaf|title=The men Rodwell leaves behind with the Abu Sayyaf|work=Rappler|date=22 August 2013|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/165123/japanese-still-a-hostage-not-abu-sayyaf-cook-academics-say|title=Japanese still a hostage, not Abu Sayyaf cook, academics say|work=Inquirer Mindanao|date=21 March 2012|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowdsourcing for ransom, and social media (such as, Facebook and YouTube) were used by Abu Sayyaf during negotiations. In her 2013 book ''From Bin Laden To Facebook: 10 Days Of Abduction, 10 Years Of Terrorism'', [[Maria Ressa]] states &quot;Social media is changing what was once a closed dialogue between kidnappers, their victims and governments.&quot;

On 16 June 2014, suspects Jimmy Nurilla (alias Doc) and Bakrin Haris were arrested. Both reportedly worked under Basilan-based Abu Sayyaf leader Khair Mundos and Furuji Indama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/612248/2-suspected-abu-sayyaf-men-believed-to-belong-to-bandits-notorious-faction|title=2 suspected Abu Sayyaf men believed to belong to bandits' notorious faction|author=Liza Jocson|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=18 June 2014|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities believed Nurilla and Haris took part in the Rodwell kidnapping, as well as the separate abduction of US citizen Gerfa Yeatts Lunsman and her son Kevin in 2012.

In May 2015, ex-[[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) officer Jun A. Malban, alias Michael Zoo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/kidnap-leader-arrested-in-zamboanga-sibugay/281241/|title=Kidnap leader arrested in Zamboanga Sibugay|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=4 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120065738/http://www.manilatimes.net/kidnap-leader-arrested-in-zamboanga-sibugay/281241/|archive-date=20 January 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; was arrested in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Malaysia]], for the crime of &quot;Kidnapping for Ransom&quot; after Rodwell identified him as the negotiator/spokesperson. Further PNP investigation revealed that Malban is the cousin of Abu Sayyaf leaders Khair and Borhan Mundos (both of whom were arrested in 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/04/17/15/nbi-files-charges-vs-abu-bandits-gensan-bombing|title=Media Release: NBI files charges vs Abu bandits for Gensan bombing|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=17 April 2015|access-date=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the Anti-Kidnapping Group (AKG) stated that Malban's arrest resulted from close co-ordination by the PNP, [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)]] and Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission with the Malaysian counterparts and through [[Interpol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnp.gov.ph/portal/index.php/press-news-releases/more-media-news/39-national-headquarters/2615-ex-cop-arrested-in-malaysia-for-kidnapping-of-australian-national|title=Media Release: EX-COP ARRESTED IN MALAYSIA FOR KIDNAPPING OF AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL|publisher=PNP-AKG Press Release|date=18 May 2015|access-date=19 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713201705/http://pnp.gov.ph/portal/index.php/press-news-releases/more-media-news/39-national-headquarters/2615-ex-cop-arrested-in-malaysia-for-kidnapping-of-australian-national|archivedate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Rodwell attended a court hearing for Malban and others in [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay]], pursuant to a Supreme Court petition to transfer his case for security reasons to a court in either [[Manila]] or [[Zamboanga City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/961363/australian-kidnap-victim-seeks-case-transfer|title=Australian kidnap victim seeks case transfer|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, ''[[The Manila Times]]'' reported the arrest of the kidnap-for-ransom group of Barahama Alih sub-leader, Hasim Calon alias Husien (also a notorious drug dealer), in his hideout in Tenan village in Ipil town. Hasim Calon was involved in Rodwell's abduction. Earlier in 2016, police forces killed Waning Abdulsalam, a former MILF leader, in the village of Singkilon. Abdulsalam was one of the most wanted criminals in the southern Philippines, and connected to ASG. He was linked to the kidnappings of Rodwell in 2011, Irish missionary Michael Sinnott in 2009 in Pagadian City, and Italian Catholic priest Giancarlo Bossi in Zamboanga del Sur's Payao town in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/kidnap-leader-arrested-in-zamboanga-sibugay/281241|title=Kidnap leader arrested in Zamboanga Sibugay|newspaper=The Manila Times|date=21 August 2016|accessdate=23 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822181746/http://www.manilatimes.net/kidnap-leader-arrested-in-zamboanga-sibugay/281241/|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2019, combined security forces of the 44th Infantry Battalion, Philippine National Police, Philippine Drugs Enforcement Agency, National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine Coast Guard arrested five members (Benhazer Anduhol, Solaiman Calonof, Nicanel Maningo, Jay-ar Abba Quartocruz and Hashim Lucas Samdani) of Barahama Alih criminal gang during drug operations with warrants in Barangay Tenan of Ipil town, Zamboanga Sibugay.

In February 2018, Abu Sayyaf sub-commander Nurhassan Jamiri was reported by Malaysia regional intelligence sources as one of three gunmen killed in a gunfight with police in [[Sabah]].

Over the preceding two years, many Abu Sayyaf bandits had surrendered to authorities in Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. More were expected to yield because of the regional government's Program Against Violence and Extremism (PAVE), designed to provide opportunities and interventions, including psychosocial sessions, medical check-ups, introduction to farming systems, and expository tours outside the island provinces to facilitate the reintegration of former combatants into society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/killed-sayyaf-leader-surrenders-in-basilan/389139//|title='Killed' Sayyaf leader surrenders in Basilan|newspaper=Manila Times|date=29 March 2018|access-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414092133/http://www.manilatimes.net/killed-sayyaf-leader-surrenders-in-basilan/389139/|archive-date=14 April 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, Rodwell lauded the surrenders and reintegration program, but said he would not interfere with the legal processing of any charges already filed against anyone involved with his own kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/979893/talk-to-abu-sayyaf-australian-kidnap-victim-urges-govt|title= Talk to Abu Sayyaf, Australian kidnap victim urges gov't|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=4 April 2018|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His statements were criticised by national media as leading to a confusion whether he wanted peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/2016/11/29/1648443/du30-confused-or-confusing-asg|title=Is Du30 confused, or confusing ASG?|author=Federico D.

In the aftermath of the [[2019 Jolo Cathedral bombings]], President Duterte ordered an &quot;All-Out-War&quot; directive against the Abu Sayyaf Group, which led to heavy ground operations, massive airstrikes, artillery bombardment in surrounding areas, the evacuation of civilian in other areas, and the creation of the [[11th Infantry Division (Philippines)|11th Infantry Division]] of the [[Philippine Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Inquirer-AllOutWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gamil |first1=Jaymee T. |last2=Alipala |first2=Julie |title=Duterte orders all-out war on terror groups |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1078558/duterte-wants-all-out-war-vs-jolo-mass-murderers-terror-groups |accessdate=5 April 2019 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213054959/https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1078558/duterte-wants-all-out-war-vs-jolo-mass-murderers-terror-groups |archivedate=13 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilStar-AllOutWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Matsuzawa |first1=Mikas |title=Military unleashes air strikes on Sulu after Duterte's 'all-out war' order |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/01/30/1889345/military-unleashes-air-strikes-onsulu-after-dutertes-all-out-war-order |accessdate=5 April 2019 |work=The Philippine Star |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=30 January 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209052643/https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/01/30/1889345/military-unleashes-air-strikes-onsulu-after-dutertes-all-out-war-order |archivedate=9 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MB-Offensives&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Recuenco |first1=Aaron |title=AFP launches offensive vs ASG |url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/01/31/afp-launches-offensive-vs-asg/ |accessdate=5 April 2019 |work=Manila Bulletin News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190131211312/https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/01/31/afp-launches-offensive-vs-asg/ |archivedate=31 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
