The timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of [[Fourier series|Fourier theory]] to consist of multiple [[harmonic]] or inharmonic ''[[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]]'' or [[overtone]]s. Each partial is a sine wave of different [[frequency]] and [[amplitude]] that swells and decays over time due to [[modulation]] from an [[ADSR envelope]] or [[low frequency oscillator]].

Additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators. Alternative implementations may use pre-computed [[Wavetable synthesis|wavetables]] or the inverse [[Fast Fourier transform]].

== Explanation ==
The sounds that are heard in everyday life are not characterized by a single [[frequency]]. Instead, they consist of a sum of pure sine frequencies, each one at a different [[amplitude]]. When humans hear these frequencies simultaneously, we can recognize the sound. This is true for both &quot;non-musical&quot; sounds (e.g. water splashing, leaves rustling, etc.) and for &quot;musical sounds&quot; (e.g. a piano note, a bird's tweet, etc.). This set of parameters (frequencies, their relative amplitudes, and how the relative amplitudes change over time) are encapsulated by the ''[[timbre]]'' of the sound. [[Fourier analysis]] is the technique that is used to determine these exact timbre parameters from an overall sound signal; conversely, the resulting set of frequencies and amplitudes is called the [[Fourier series]] of the original sound signal.

In the case of a musical note, the lowest frequency of its timbre is designated as the sound's [[fundamental frequency]]. For simplicity, we often say that the note is playing at that fundamental frequency (e.g. &quot;[[middle C]] is 261.6 Hz&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liutaiomottola.com/formulae/freqtab.htm|title=Table of Musical Notes and Their Frequencies and Wavelengths|last=Mottola|first=Liutaio|date=31 May 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the sound of that note consists of many other frequencies as well. The set of the remaining frequencies is called the [[overtone]]s (or the [[harmonic]]s) of the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/Lesson-4/Fundamental-Frequency-and-Harmonics|title=Fundamental Frequency and Harmonics|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the fundamental frequency alone is responsible for the pitch of the note, while the overtones define the timbre of the sound. The overtones of a piano playing middle C will be quite different from the overtones of a violin playing the same note; that's what allows us to differentiate the sounds of the two instruments. There are even subtle differences in timbre between different versions of the same instrument (for example, an [[upright piano]] vs. a [[Grand Piano|grand piano]]).

Additive synthesis aims to exploit this property of sound in order to construct timbre from the ground up. By adding together pure frequencies ([[sine wave]]s) of varying frequencies and amplitudes, we can precisely define the timbre of the sound that we want to create.

Harmonic additive synthesis is closely related to the concept of a [[Fourier series]] which is a way of expressing a [[periodic function]] as the sum of [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] functions with [[Frequency|frequencies]] equal to integer multiples of a common [[fundamental frequency]].  These sinusoids are called [[harmonic]]s, [[overtone]]s, or generally, [[Harmonic series (music)#Partial|partials]].  In general, a Fourier series contains an infinite number of sinusoidal components, with no upper limit to the frequency of the sinusoidal functions and includes a [[direct current|DC]] component (one with frequency of 0 [[Hertz|Hz]]).  [[Equal-loudness contour|Frequencies outside of the human audible range]] can be omitted in additive synthesis.  As a result, only a finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the audible range are modeled in additive synthesis.

A waveform or function is said to be [[periodic function|periodic]] if

: &lt;math&gt; y(t) = y(t+P) \ &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt; t \,&lt;/math&gt; and for some period &lt;math&gt; P \,&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Fourier series]] of a periodic function is mathematically expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  y(t) &amp;= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_k \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t ) - b_k \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t ) \right] \\
       &amp;= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} r_k \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right) \\
   \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where

:: &lt;math&gt;f_0 = 1/P\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and is equal to the reciprocal of the period,
:: &lt;math&gt;a_k = r_k \cos(\phi_k) = 2 f_0 \int_{0}^P y(t) \cos(2 \pi k f_0 t)\, dt, \quad k \ge 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;b_k = r_k \sin(\phi_k) = -2 f_0 \int_{0}^P y(t) \sin(2 \pi k f_0 t)\, dt, \quad k \ge 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;r_k = \sqrt{a_k^2 + b_k^2}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[amplitude]] of the &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt;th harmonic,
:: &lt;math&gt;\phi_k = \operatorname{atan2}(b_k, a_k)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase (waves)|phase offset]] of the &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt;th harmonic. [[atan2]](&amp;nbsp;) is the four-quadrant [[arctangent]] function,

Being inaudible, the [[direct current|DC]] component, &lt;math&gt;a_0/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and all components with frequencies higher than some finite limit, &lt;math&gt;K f_0\,&lt;/math&gt;, are omitted in the following expressions of additive synthesis.

===Harmonic form===
The simplest harmonic additive synthesis can be mathematically expressed as:

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right)&lt;/math&gt;,|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the synthesis output, &lt;math&gt;r_k\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k f_0\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\phi_k\,&lt;/math&gt; are the amplitude, frequency, and the phase offset, respectively, of the &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt;th harmonic partial of a total of &lt;math&gt;K\,&lt;/math&gt; harmonic partials, and &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the waveform and the [[Piano key frequencies|frequency of the musical note]].

===Time-dependent amplitudes===

| &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;line-height:130%;&quot;&gt;Example of harmonic additive synthesis in which each harmonic has a time-dependent amplitude. The fundamental frequency is 440&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;/span&gt;

|}
More generally, the amplitude of each harmonic can be prescribed as a function of time, &lt;math&gt;r_k(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, in which case the synthesis output is

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi k f_0 t + \phi_k \right)&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

Each [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] &lt;math&gt;r_k(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; should vary slowly relative to the frequency spacing between adjacent sinusoids.  The [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of &lt;math&gt;r_k(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; should be significantly less than &lt;math&gt;f_0\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Inharmonic form===
Additive synthesis can also produce [[Inharmonicity|inharmonic]] sounds (which are [[aperiodic]] waveforms) in which the individual overtones need not have frequencies that are integer multiples of some common fundamental frequency.&lt;ref name=smith05&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many conventional musical instruments have harmonic partials (e.g. an [[oboe]]), some have inharmonic partials (e.g. [[bell (instrument)|bells]]).  Inharmonic additive synthesis can be described as

: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi f_k t + \phi_k \right),&lt;/math&gt;

|}

===Time-dependent frequencies===
In the general case, the [[instantaneous frequency]] of a sinusoid is the [[derivative]] (with respect to time) of the argument of the sine or cosine function.  If this frequency is represented in [[hertz]], rather than in [[angular frequency]] form, then this derivative is divided by &lt;math&gt;2 \pi\,&lt;/math&gt;.  This is the case whether the partial is harmonic or inharmonic and whether its frequency is constant or time-varying.

In the most general form, the frequency of each non-harmonic partial is a non-negative function of time, &lt;math&gt;f_k(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, yielding

: {{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^t f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

===Broader definitions===
''Additive synthesis'' more broadly may mean sound synthesis techniques that sum simple elements to create more complex timbres, even when the elements are not sine waves.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, F. Richard Moore listed additive synthesis as one of the &quot;four basic categories&quot; of sound synthesis alongside [[subtractive synthesis]], nonlinear synthesis, and [[physical modelling synthesis|physical modeling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MooreFoundationsCM&quot;/&gt; In this broad sense, [[pipe organ]]s, which also have pipes producing non-sinusoidal waveforms, can be considered as a variant form of additive synthesizers. Summation of [[Principal component analysis|principal components]] and [[Walsh functions]] have also been classified as additive synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;

==Implementation methods==

Modern-day implementations of additive synthesis are mainly digital. (See section ''[[#Discrete-time equations|Discrete-time equations]]'' for the underlying discrete-time theory)

===Oscillator bank synthesis===

Additive synthesis can be implemented using a bank of sinusoidal oscillators, one for each partial.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOS_Additive&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--

It is possible to analyze the frequency components of a recorded sound giving a &quot;sum of sinusoids&quot; representation. This representation can be re-synthesized using additive synthesis.

New England Digital [[Synclavier]] had a resynthesis feature where samples could be analyzed and converted into ”timbre frames&quot; which were part of its additive synthesis engine. [[Technos acxel]], launched in 1987, utilized the additive analysis/resynthesis model, in an [[Additive synthesis#Inverse FFT synthesis|FFT]] implementation.

Also a vocal synthesizer, [[Vocaloid]] have been implemented on the basis of additive analysis/resynthesis: its spectral voice model called [[Excitation plus Resonances]] (EpR) model&lt;ref name=BonadaICMC01&gt;

Additive synthesis is used in electronic musical instruments. It is the principal sound generation technique used by [[Eminent BV|Eminent]] organs.

===Speech synthesis===

{{main|Speech synthesis}}

In [[linguistics]] research, harmonic additive synthesis was used in 1950s to play back modified and synthetic speech spectrograms.&lt;ref name=&quot;cooper1951&quot; /&gt;

Later, in early 1980s, listening tests were carried out on synthetic speech stripped of acoustic cues to assess their significance. Time-varying [[formant]] frequencies and amplitudes derived by [[linear predictive coding]] were synthesized additively as pure tone whistles. This method is called [[sinewave synthesis]].&lt;ref name=remez81&gt;

Composite Sinusoidal Modeling(CSM) In 1975, Itakura proposed the line spectrum representation (LSR) concept and its algorithm to obtain a set of parameters for new speech spectrum representation. Independently from this, Sagayama developed a composite sinusoidal modeling (CSM) concept which is equivalent to LSR but give a quite different formulation, solving algorithm and synthesis scheme. Sagayama clarified the duality of LPC and CSM and provided the unified view covering LPC, PARCOR, LSR, LSP and CSM, CSM is not only an new concept of speech spectrum analysis but also a key idea to understand the linear prediction from a unified point of view. ...

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time, the additive Hammond organ was already on market. Most early electronic organ makers thought it too expensive to manufacture the plurality of oscillators required by additive organs, and began instead to build [[subtractive synthesis|subtractive]] ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;comerford1993&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Comerford | first1 = P. | title = Simulating an Organ with Additive Synthesis | journal = Computer Music Journal | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 55–65 | doi = 10.2307/3680869 | year = 1993 | jstor = 3680869 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1940 [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] meeting, the head field engineer of Hammond elaborated on the company's new ''Novachord'' as having a ''&quot;subtractive system&quot;'' in contrast to the original Hammond organ in which ''&quot;the final tones were built up by combining sound waves&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Discrete-time equations==
In digital implementations of additive synthesis, [[discrete signal|discrete-time]] equations are used in place of the continuous-time synthesis equations.  A notational convention for discrete-time signals uses brackets i.e. &lt;math&gt;y[n]\,&lt;/math&gt; and the argument &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; can only be integer values.  If the continuous-time synthesis output &lt;math&gt;y(t)\,&lt;/math&gt; is expected to be sufficiently [[bandlimited]]; below half the [[sampling rate]] or &lt;math&gt;f_\mathrm{s}/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, it suffices to directly sample the continuous-time expression to get the discrete synthesis equation. The continuous synthesis output can later be [[Nyquist&amp;ndash;Shannon sampling theorem|reconstructed]] from the samples using a [[digital-to-analog converter]]. The sampling period is &lt;math&gt;T=1/f_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Beginning with ({{EquationNote|3}}),

: &lt;math&gt;y(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(t) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^t f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and sampling at discrete times &lt;math&gt; t = nT = n/f_\mathrm{s} \,&lt;/math&gt; results in

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 y[n] &amp; = y(nT) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k(nT) \cos\left(2 \pi \int_0^{nT} f_k(u)\ du + \phi_k \right) \\

where

: &lt;math&gt;r_k[n] = r_k(nT) \,&lt;/math&gt; is the discrete-time varying amplitude envelope
: &lt;math&gt;f_k[n] = \frac{1}{T} \int_{(n-1)T}^{nT} f_k(t)\ dt \,&lt;/math&gt; is the discrete-time [[Finite difference|backward difference]] instantaneous frequency.

This is equivalent to

: &lt;math&gt; y[n] = \sum_{k=1}^{K} r_k[n] \cos\left( \theta_k[n] \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where

    \theta_k[n] &amp;= \frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f_k[i] + \phi_k \\
                &amp;= \theta_k[n-1] + \frac{2 \pi}{f_\mathrm{s}} f_k[n] \\
       \end{align} &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RodetDepalle_FFTm1&quot;/&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt; \theta_k[0] = \phi_k. \,&lt;/math&gt;
