'''Amsterdamsche Football Club Ajax''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈaːjɑks}}), also known as '''AFC Ajax''', '''Ajax Amsterdam''', or simply '''Ajax''', is a Dutch professional [[Association football|football]] [[Football team|club]] based in [[Amsterdam]], that plays in the [[Eredivisie]], the top tier in Dutch football. Historically, Ajax (named after the [[Ajax the Great|legendary Greek hero]]) has been the most successful club in the [[Netherlands]], with 34 [[List of Dutch football champions|Eredivisie titles]] and 19 [[KNVB Cup]]s. It has continuously played in the Eredivisie, since the league's inception in 1956 and, along with [[Feyenoord]] and [[PSV Eindhoven]], it is one of the country's &quot;[[Big Three (Netherlands)|big three]]&quot; clubs that have dominated that competition.

Ajax has historically been one of the most successful clubs in the world. According to the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics|IFFHS]], Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century and ''The World's Club Team of the Year'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Europe's Club of the Century | publisher = International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics | date = 11 September 2009 | url = http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d | accessdate = 12 September 2009 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120524184019/http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d | archive-date = 24 May 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German magazine ''[[Kicker (sports magazine)|Kicker]]'', Ajax were the second-most successful European club of the 20th century. The club is one of the five teams that has [[European Champion Clubs' Cup#Clubs awarded the trophy permanently|earned the right]] to keep the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971–1973. In 1972, they completed the [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|continental treble]] by winning the [[1971–72 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]], [[1971–72 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], and the [[1971–72 European Cup|European Cup]].

==History==
{{main|History of AFC Ajax}}
Ajax was founded in Amsterdam on 18 March 1900. The club achieved promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911 and had its first major success in 1917, winning the [[KNVB Beker]], the Netherlands' national cup. The [[1917–18 Netherlands Football League Championship|following season]], Ajax became [[List of Dutch football champions|national champion]] for the first time. The club defended its title in [[1918–19 Netherlands Football League Championship|1918–19]], becoming the only team to achieve an unbeaten season in the Netherlands Football League Championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unbeaten.html|title=Unbeaten during a League Season|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=RSSSF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1920s, Ajax was a strong regional power, winning the Eerste Klasse West division in 1921, 1927 and 1928, but could not maintain its success at national level. This changed in the 1930s, with the club winning five national championships ([[1930–31 Netherlands Football League Championship|1931]], [[1931–32 Netherlands Football League Championship|1932]], [[1933–34 Netherlands Football League Championship|1934]], [[1936–37 Netherlands Football League Championship|1937]], [[1938–39 Netherlands Football League Championship|1939]]), making it the most successful Dutch team of the decade. Ajax won its second KNVB Cup in 1942–43, and an eighth Dutch title in [[1946–47 Netherlands Football League Championship|1946–47]], the last season the club was managed by Englishman [[Jack Reynolds (footballer, born 1881)|Jack Reynolds]], who, up to this point, had overseen all of its national championship successes as well as its 1917 KNVB Cup win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/334848|title=Ajax: the early years and the birth of Total Football|date=5 May 2012|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=World Soccer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718091841/http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/334848|archivedate=18 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-12464632|title=Ajax remembers Bury football hero Jack Reynolds|date=15 February 2011|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the [[1956–57 Eredivisie|first season]] of the Netherlands' new professional league, the [[Eredivisie]], was played with Ajax participating as a founding member. The Amsterdam club became the first national champions under the new format and made its debut in the [[European Champion Clubs' Cup]] the [[1957–58 European Cup|following year]], losing to Hungarian champions [[Vasas SC]] 6–2 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage. The team were again Eredivisie champions in [[1959–60 Eredivisie|1960]] and won a third KNVB Cup in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/3642832/2014/04/27/Ajax-weer-kampioen-zonder-topscorer.dhtml|title=Ajax weer kampioen zonder topscorer|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=AD.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cruijff afscheidswedstrijd bij Ajax.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johan Cruyff]] played at Ajax from 1959 to 1973, and from 1981 to 1983, winning 3 European Cups; his No. 14 is the only squad number Ajax has ever retired. Cruyff came back to manage the club from 1985 to 1988.]]

In 1965, [[Rinus Michels]], who had played for the club between 1946 and 1958, was appointed manager of Ajax, implementing his philosophy of [[Total Football]] which was to become synonymous with both Ajax and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8338289.stm|title=Cruyff will coach Catalonia team|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/ajax’s-youth-policy-still-its-prime-asset|title=Ajax’s youth policy still its prime asset|date=18 March 2010|accessdate=3 March 2013|work=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171634/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/ajax%E2%80%99s-youth-policy-still-its-prime-asset|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier, [[Johan Cruyff]], who would go on to become the greatest Dutch footballer of all-time, made his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/players/a/Cruyffrrofile.htm|title=Legends: Johan Cruyff|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between them, Michels and Cruyff led Ajax through the most successful period in its history, winning seven Eredivisie titles, four KNVB Cups and three European Cups.

Ajax won the Dutch championship in [[1965–66 Eredivisie|1966]], [[1966–67 Eredivisie|1967]] and [[1967–68 Eredivisie|1968]], and reached the [[1969 European Cup Final|1969 European Cup final]], losing to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. During the 1966–67 season, Ajax scored a record 122 goals in an Eredivisie season and also won the KNVB Cup to achieve its first league and cup [[Double (association football)|double]]. In [[1969–70 Eredivisie|1969–70]], Ajax won a fourth Dutch league championship and second league and cup double in five seasons, winning 27 out of 34 league matches and scoring 100 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voetbalcentra.nl/index_files/Eredivisierecords.htm|title=Eredivisierecords|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=Voetbal Centra|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220041208/http://voetbalcentra.nl/index_files/Eredivisierecords.htm|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1970–71 Eredivisie|1970–71 season]] saw Ajax retain the [[1970–71 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] and reach the [[1971 European Cup Final|1971 European Cup final]], where they defeated [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] 2–0 with goals from [[Dick van Dijk]] and [[Arie Haan]] to become continental champions for the first time, with Cruyff being named [[Ballon d'Or (1956–2009)|European Footballer of the Year]]. After this success, Michels departed to become manager of [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and was replaced by the Romanian [[Ștefan Kovács]]. In Kovács' first season, Ajax completed a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[1971–72 European Cup|European Cup]], the [[1971–72 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and a third consecutive [[1971–72 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]]. The following season, the team beat Argentine club [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] to win the [[1972 Intercontinental Cup]] and retained their [[1972–73 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and [[1972–73 European Cup|European Cup]] titles, becoming the first club to win three consecutive European Cups since [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the 1950s.

In 1973, Michels' Barcelona broke the [[World football transfer record|world transfer record]] to bring Cruyff to [[Catalonia]]. Kovács also departed to become manager of the [[France national football team|France national team]], signalling the end of this period of international success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/picturegalleries/10211043/World-record-football-transfers.html|title=Johann Cruyff – World record football transfers |accessdate=30 December 2014|work=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1976–77 Eredivisie|1976–77]], Ajax won its first domestic championship in four seasons and recorded a double of the [[1977–78 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and [[1977–78 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] two years later.

The early 1980s saw the return of Johan Cruyff to the club, as well as the emergence of young players [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]]. The team won back-to-back Eredivisie titles in [[1981–82 Eredivisie|1982]] and [[1982–83 Eredivisie|1983]], with all three playing a significant role in the latter. After Cruyff's sale to rivals [[Feyenoord]] in 1983, Van Basten became Ajax's key player, top scoring in the Eredivisie for four seasons between [[1983–84 Eredivisie|1983–84]] and [[1986–87 Eredivisie|1986–87]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=41373/|title=Van Basten, a Dutch goal machine|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax as manager and the team ended [[1985–86 Eredivisie|his first season in charge]] with 120 goals from 34 matches. However, Ajax still finished as runner-up to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] by eight points. The following season, Ajax again lost out on the [[1986–87 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] title to PSV, but won the [[1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], its first continental trophy in 14 years. After this, Cruyff left the club to become manager of Barcelona and Rijkaard and Van Basten were sold to [[Sporting CP]] and Milan respectively. Despite these losses, Ajax reached a second consecutive Cup Winners' Cup final in [[1988 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1988]], where they lost to Belgian club [[KV Mechelen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nos.nl/video/617897-1988-mechelen-klopt-ajax-in-finale-ec-ii.html|title=1988: Mechelen klopt Ajax in finale EC II|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=NOS.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1988–89 Eredivisie|1988–89]] season saw [[Dennis Bergkamp]], a young forward who had first appeared under Cruyff in 1986, establish himself as a regular goalscorer for Ajax. Bergkamp helped Ajax to the [[1989–90 Eredivisie]] title and was the top scorer in the division in [[1990–91 Eredivisie|1990–91]], [[1991–92 Eredivisie|1991–92]] and [[1992–93 Eredivisie|1992–93]]. Under the management of [[Louis van Gaal]], Ajax won the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[1991–92 UEFA Cup|1992]] to become the second club, after [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], to have won all three [[List of UEFA club competition winners|major European club competitions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/video/videoid=2121239.html|title=Watch Ajax complete European sweep|accessdate=30 December 2014|work=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sale of Bergkamp to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in 1993, Van Gaal re-signed the experienced Frank Rijkaard to complement his young Ajax team featuring academy graduates [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] and [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Michael Reiziger]] and [[Winston Bogarde]], as well as mercurial foreign talents [[Finidi George]], [[Nwankwo Kanu]] and [[Jari Litmanen]], and veteran captain [[Danny Blind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story?id=827853&amp;cc=3436|title=Ajax's adolescents master men of Milan|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=3 March 2014|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team regained the Dutch championship in [[1993–94 Eredivisie|1993–94]], and won it again in [[1994–95 Eredivisie|1994–95]] and [[1995–96 Eredivisie|1995–96]] to become the first Ajax side to win three back-to-back championships since 1968. The height of Van Gaal's success came in 1994–95, where Ajax became the first, and to date only, team to complete an entire Eredivisie season unbeaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dutch-football.com/football/eredivisie/records.shtml |title=Eredivisie – Records |accessdate=3 March 2014 |work=Dutch Football |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009042444/http://www.dutch-football.com/football/eredivisie/records.shtml |archivedate=9 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also won its first European Cup since its glorious 1970s era, defeating Milan in the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|1995 UEFA Champions League final]] 1–0, with the winning goal scored by 18-year-old [[Patrick Kluivert]]. Ajax again reached [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]] one year later, but were defeated on penalties by Juventus.

Ajax's return as a European force was short lived as Van Gaal and several members of the squad soon departed to some of the continent's biggest clubs. The 2000s was a lean decade for the club with only two Eredivisie championships won. However, Ajax's academy continued to produce star players such as [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Rafael van der Vaart]].

In 2010, Frank de Boer was appointed manager of Ajax and led the club to its first league title in seven years, and record 30th title overall, in the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]]. This was followed by back-to-back wins in [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12]] and [[2012–13 Eredivisie|2012–13]] to match his three consecutive titles as a player in the 1990s. In [[2013–14 Eredivisie|2013–14]], Ajax were again Eredivisie champions, winning four consecutive league titles for the first time in club history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=2097233.html|title=Ajax secure fourth consecutive Dutch title|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=29 April 2014|work=UEFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing as runner-up to PSV in both [[2014–15 Eredivisie|2014–15]] and [[2015–16 Eredivisie|2015–16]], De Boer resigned as Ajax head coach in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/36273607|title=Frank de Boer: Ajax boss leaves his role after six years|date=12 May 2016|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Bosz]] took over the club and led them to the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|2017 UEFA Europa League final]], their first European final in 21 years. They lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] with a lineup that was the youngest ever in a European final, averaging an age of 22 years and 282 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ajax side against Man United youngest ever in a major European final|url=http://www.espnfc.us/ajax-amsterdam/story/3133254/ajax-side-vs-manchester-united-youngest-ever-in-a-major-european-final|website=ESPN|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the third consecutive season, they finished runner-up in the [[2016–17 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]], this time to Feyenoord.

The [[2018–19 AFC Ajax season|2018–19 season]] for Ajax involved a remarkable run in the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. Due to their runner-up finish in the [[2017–18 Eredivisie]], Ajax entered the tournament in the second qualifying round. After successive victories against [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]], [[Standard Liège]], and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], they qualified for the group state. Ajax was drawn in a group with German champions [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Portuguese side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and Greek champions [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. Ajax finished runner-up in this group, qualifying for the knockout stages, where they were drawn against defending champions [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]. After losing 1–2 in the first leg, they defeated Real Madrid 4–1 in the away match, stunning the defending champions in their own stadium, [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] with aggregate score (5–3).&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/05/real-madrid-ajax-champions-league-match-report|title =Dusan Tadic inspires Ajax to stunning defeat of champions Real Madrid|date=5 March 2019|work=Guardian|accessdate=26 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dušan Tadić]] was awarded a perfect score of 10 by [[L'Équipe]] following the match. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2823746-dusan-tadic-joins-lionel-messi-and-neymar-in-earning-perfect-lequipe-rating|title=Dusan Tadic Joins Lionel Messi and Neymar in Earning Perfect L'Equipe Rating|date=6 March 2019|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=10 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Then, they progressed to quarter-finals and were drawn with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. In the first leg in the Johan Cruyff Arena, they drew 1–1. In the second leg at the [[Juventus Stadium]], Ajax won 1–2.

==Academies (Youth/Coaching)==
{{main|Ajax Youth Academy|Ajax Hellas Youth Academy|Ajax Coaching Academy}}
The club is also particularly famous for its renowned youth programme that has produced many Dutch talents over the years – [[Johan Cruyff]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Gerald Vanenburg]], [[Frank Rijkaard]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Rafael van der Vaart]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Marco van Basten]], [[Wesley Sneijder]], [[Maarten Stekelenburg]], and [[Nigel de Jong]] have come through the ranks and are just some of the talents who've played for Ajax. Ajax also regularly supplies the Dutch national youth teams with local talent.

Due to mutual agreements with foreign clubs, the youth academy has also signed foreign players as teenagers before making first team debuts, such as Belgian defensive trio [[Jan Vertonghen]], [[Toby Alderweireld]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]] along with winger [[Tom De Mul]], all of whom are full internationals, as well as Dutch international [[Vurnon Anita]] and [[Javier Martina]], representing [[Curaçao national football team|Curaçao]].

Ajax has also expanded its talent searching programme to South Africa with [[Ajax Cape Town FC|Ajax Cape Town]]. Ajax Cape Town was set up with the help of Rob Moore. Ajax has also had a satellite club in the United States under the name [[Ajax Orlando Prospects|Ajax America]], until it filed for bankruptcy. There are some youth players from Ajax Cape Town that have been drafted into the Eredivisie squad, such as South African internationals [[Steven Pienaar]], [[Thulani Serero]] and Cameroonian international [[Eyong Enoh]].

In 1995, the year Ajax won the UEFA Champions League, the Netherlands national team was almost entirely composed of Ajax players, with Edwin van der Sar in goal; players such as Michael Reiziger, Frank de Boer and Danny Blind in defence; Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids and Clarence Seedorf in midfield; and Patrick Kluivert and [[Marc Overmars]] in attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/grassroots/features/video/videoid=1562470.html |title=Inside the Ajax academy on |publisher=Uefa.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Ajax opened its first youth academies outside the Netherlands when the club partnered up with George Kazianis and All Star Consultancy in Greece to open the [[Ajax Hellas Youth Academy]]. The offices are based in [[Nea Smyrni]], [[Attica (region)|Attica]], with the main training facility located on the island of [[Corfu]], hosting a total of 15 football youth academies throughout Greece and Cyprus. Eddie van Schaik heads the organization as coach and consultant, introducing the Ajax football philosophy at the various Greek football training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajaxhellas.gr/youth_academy/en/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 |title=The Academy |publisher=AjaxHellas.gr |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152746/http://www.ajaxhellas.gr/youth_academy/en/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care24.gr/diatrofologos-ajax-hellas/ |title=Η νέα Κλινική Διαιτολόγος – Διατροφολόγος του Ajax Hellas |publisher=Care24.gr |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320092837/http://www.care24.gr/diatrofologos-ajax-hellas/ |archivedate=20 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Ajax launched the ACA (Ajax Coaching Academy) with the intention of sharing knowledge, setting up a variety of camps and clinics for both players and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ajax.nl/streams/actueel/dit-plan-is-uniek-in-nederland.htm |title=Dit plan is uniek in Nederland |publisher=Ajax.nl|date=23 February 2016 |accessdate=2019-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadiums==
{{main|Stadiums of AFC Ajax}}
Ajax's first stadium was built in 1911 out of wood and was called [[Het Houten Stadion]] (&quot;The Wooden Stadium&quot;). Ajax later played in the stadium built for the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] hosted in Amsterdam. This stadium, designed by [[Jan Wils]], is known as the Olympic Stadium. In 1934, Ajax moved to [[De Meer Stadion]] in east Amsterdam, designed by architect and Ajax-member [[Jordanus Roodenburgh|Daan Roodenburgh]], who had also designed the club's first stadium. It could accommodate 29,500 spectators and Ajax continued to play there until 1996. For big European and national fixtures the club would often play at the Olympic Stadium, which could accommodate about twice the number of spectators.
[[File:Amsterdam Arena Aerial.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]]]]
In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the Amsterdam Arena, since 2018 known as the [[Johan Cruyff Arena]]. This stadium was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The stadium is capable of holding approximately 54,990 spectators. The average attendance in 2006–07 was 48,610, rising in the next season to 49,128. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena has earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008–09 season, ground staff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably.

The much-loved De Meer Stadion was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The only thing left of the old stadium are the letters &quot;AJAX&quot;, which nowadays is in place on the façade of the youth training grounds [[Sportpark De Toekomst|De Toekomst]], near the Johan Cruyff Arena.

==Crest and colours==

===Crest===
In 1900, when the club was founded, the emblem of Ajax was just a picture of an Ajax player. The crest was slightly altered following the club's promotion to the top division in 1911 to match the club's new outfits. In 1928, the club logo was introduced with the head of the [[Greeks|Greek]] hero [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]]. The logo was once again changed in 1990 into an abstract version of the previous one. The new logo still sports the portrait of Ajax, but drawn with just 11 lines, symbolizing the 11 players of a football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html |title=History of the Ajax logo |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date=20 September 1928 |accessdate=4 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721231604/http://www.xs4all.nl/~michielh/hetlogo.html |archivedate=21 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colours===
Ajax originally played in an all-black uniform with a red sash tied around the players' waists, but that uniform was soon replaced by a red/white striped shirt and black shorts. Red, black and white are the three colours of the [[flag of Amsterdam]]. When under manager [[Jack Kirwan]], however, the club earned promotion to the top flight of Dutch football for the first time in 1911 (then the ''Eerste Klasse'' or 'First Class', later named the Eredivisie), Ajax were forced to change their colours because [[Sparta Rotterdam]] already had exactly the same outfit. Special kits for away fixtures did not exist at the time and according to football association regulations the newcomers had to change their colours if two teams in the same league had identical uniforms. Ajax opted for white shorts and white shirt with a broad, vertical red stripe over chest and back, which still is Ajax's outfit.

==Financial==

===AFC Ajax N.V.===
{{Main|AFC Ajax N.V.}}
AFC Ajax are the only Dutch club with an [[Initial public offering]] (IPO). The club is registered as a [[Naamloze vennootschap]] (N.V.) listed on the stock exchange [[Euronext]] Amsterdam, since 17 May 1998. With a launch price of ƒ25,- (Guilders) the club managed to a bring their total revenue up to €54&amp;nbsp;million (converted) in their first year on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/ajax/article1882997.ece |title=God van de handel liet Ajax in de steek |publisher=NRC.nl |accessdate=18 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125824/http://vorige.nrc.nl/sport/ajax/article1882997.ece |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After short-lived success, however, the rate dropped, at one point as low as €3.50. Criticism was brought forth that the legal grid for a naamloze vennootschap would not be suitable for a Football club, and that the sports related ambitions would suffer from the new commercial interests of the now listed Ajax. Shares of the company in the year 2008 were valued at approximately €5.90 per share.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AJAX.AS#chart2:symbol=ajax.as;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined AFC Ajax chart], Yahoo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a Commission under guidance of honorary member Uri Coronel concluded that the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] was of no value to the club, and that measures should be taken to exit the stock exchange by purchasing back all public shares.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823131227/http://www.depers.nl/sport/218320/Ajax-beslist-snel-over-beursnotering.html Ajax beslist nog dit jaar over beursnotering], De Pers, 1 juli 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax remain on the stock exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/company-profile.AFC_Ajax_NV.46101384cd08980e.html |title=AFC Ajax NV Company Information |publisher=Hoovers|date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the [[2013–14 AFC Ajax season|2013–14 season]], Ajax won the Football shirt of the Year award for their black and rose colored away shirt by Adidas. The annual award was presented by Subside Sports, which had previously given the award to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], Juventus and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

On 7 November 2014, it was announced that Ajax had agreed to a four-and-a-half-year contract worth €8&amp;nbsp;million annually with Dutch cable operating company [[Ziggo]] as the new shirt sponsor for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/3784828/2014/11/07/Ziggo-voor-8-miljoen-euro-hoofdsponsor-van-Ajax.dhtml |title=Ziggo voor 8 miljoen euro hoofdsponsor van Ajax |publisher=AD.nl |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having extended their contract with AEGON for half a season until December, the club featured ''Fonds Gehandicaptensport'', a charitable fund for handicapped sports on its away shirts for a six-month period before transitioning to Ziggo in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/3640044/2014/04/23/Fonds-Gehandicaptensport-als-sponsor-op-uitshirt-Ajax.dhtml |title=Fonds Gehandicaptensport als sponsor op uitshirt Ajax |publisher=AD.nl |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other teams==

===Reserves team===
{{Main|Jong Ajax}}
[[Jong Ajax]] (''formerly more commonly known as Ajax 2'') is the reserve team of AFC Ajax. The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/10788/Eredivisie/article/detail/3334299/2012/10/19/De-Boer-laat-herstelde-Sulejmani-bij-Jong-Ajax.dhtml |title=De Boer laat 'herstelde' Sulejmani bij Jong Ajax |publisher=Volkskrant|date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, Jong Ajax competed in the [[Beloften Eredivisie]], competing against other reserve teams such as [[Jong PSV]], [[FC Groningen|Jong FC Groningen]] or [[AZ Alkmaar|Jong AZ]]. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the [[KNVB Reserve Cup]] three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the [[Beloften Eredivisie]] title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual KNVB Cup, even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager [[Jan Olde Riekerink]] in 2001–02, when a semi-final loss to [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|Penalty shoot-out]] after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax–Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=575358&amp;sec=europe&amp;root=europe&amp;cc=5739 |title=Dutch KNVB Cup – ESPN Soccernet |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=24 September 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013–14 season marked the [[Eerste Divisie|Jupiler League]] debut of the Ajax reserves' squad, Jong Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ajaxlife.nl/updates/jong-ajax-wordt-tegen-telstar-ontgroend-in-eerste-divisie |title=Jong Ajax wordt tegen Telstar ontgroed in Eerste Divisie |publisher=Ajaxlife.nl |accessdate=4 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923065538/http://www.ajaxlife.nl/updates/jong-ajax-wordt-tegen-telstar-ontgroend-in-eerste-divisie |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously playing in the [[Beloften Eredivisie]] (a separate league for reserve teams, not included in the Dutch professional or amateur league structure), players were allowed to move around freely between the reserve team and the first team during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5609/Eerste-divisie/article/detail/3446107/2013/05/23/Reserveteams-Ajax-en-Twente-in-Jupiler-League.dhtml |title=Reserveteams Ajax en Twente in Jupiler League |publisher=AD.nl |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is no longer the case as Jong Ajax now registers and fields a separate squad from that of Ajax first team for the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands. Their home matches are played at Sportpark De Toekomst, except for the occasional match in the Johan Cruyff Arena. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/sport/3492234/jong-psv-vervangt-katwijk-in-eerste-divisie.html |title=Jong PSV vervangt Katwijk in eerste divisie |publisher=NU.nl |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the team is not eligible for promotion to the [[Eredivisie]] or to participate in the KNVB Cup. Jong Ajax were joined in the Eerste Divisie by [[Jong FC Twente|Jong Twente]] and [[Jong PSV]], reserve teams who have also moved from the Beloften Eredivisie to the Eerste Divisie, in place of [[VV Katwijk]], [[SC Veendam]] and [[AGOVV Apeldoorn]], increasing the total number of teams in the Jupiler League from 18 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/514357-ook-jong-psv-naar-jupiler-league.html |title=Ook Jong PSV naar Jupiler League |publisher=NOS.nl |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajax reserve squad Jong Ajax left the [[Beloften Eredivisie]] in 2013, having held a 21-year tenure in the reserves league, having also won the league title a record eight times (1994, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/Competities/Competitie.htm?viewid=53&amp;dbid=4283&amp;typeofpage=84136 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130222182239/http://www.vi.nl/Competities/Competitie.htm?viewid=53&amp;dbid=4283&amp;typeofpage=84136 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2013 |title=Beloften Eredivisie Statistics |publisher=Voetbal International |accessdate=4 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateur team===
{{Main|AFC Ajax (amateurs)}}
[[AFC Ajax (amateurs)|AFC Ajax Amateurs]], better known as '''Ajax Zaterdag''', is a Dutch amateur football club founded 18 March 1900.

{{Main|Ajax HVA}}
[[Ajax HVA]] (1922–1972) was the [[baseball]] team of AFC Ajax founded in 1922, and competed as founding members of the [[Honkbal Hoofdklasse]], the top flight of professional baseball in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Ajax_Amsterdam |title=Ajax Amsterdam |website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax won the national baseball title a total of four times (1924, 1928, 1942, 1948) before the club opted to no longer field a baseball team, and to focus solely on football in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/?/nl/items/ANP01:12987290 |title=Amsterdam Honkbal: Ajax-HVA |publisher=ANP Historisch Archief|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajax spent a total of 50 years at the top flight of Baseball in the Netherlands from 1922 to 1972.

==Rivalries==
''As one of the traditional [[Big Three (Netherlands)|big three clubs]] in the Netherlands, Ajax have amassed a number of intense rivalries over the years. Listed below are the most significant of the rivalries involving Ajax.''

===Rivalry with Feyenoord===
{{Main|De Klassieker}}
[[Feyenoord]] from [[Rotterdam]] are Ajax's archrivals. Every year both clubs play the ''[[De Klassieker]]'' (&quot;The Classic&quot;), a match between the teams from the two largest cities of the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/dossier/alles-over-de-klassieker-ajax-dompelt-feyenoord-in-rouw.htm |title=Alles over De Klassieker: Ajax dompelt Feyenoord in rouw |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, Ajax and Feyenoord were the only two clubs in the Netherlands who were able to clinch national titles, as well as achieve continental and even global success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.elenganche.es/2013/08/de-klassieker-ajax-feyenoord-y-el-orgullo-%E2%80%98oranje%E2%80%99.html |title=De Klassieker: Ajax-Feyenoord y el orgullo ‘oranje’ |publisher=El Enganche |accessdate=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130902173311/http://www.elenganche.es/2013/08/de-klassieker-ajax-feyenoord-y-el-orgullo-%E2%80%98oranje%E2%80%99.html |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting between the two clubs became the measure for who was truly the best club in the Netherlands. The ''Klassieker'' is the most famous of all the rivalries in the Netherlands and the matches are always sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hpdetijd.nl/2013-08-19/ajax-feyenoord-klassiekste-niet-klassieker-in-lange-reeks-klassiekers/ |title=Ajax – Feyenoord ‘klassiekste niet-Klassieker in lange reeks Klassiekers’ |publisher=HP.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fixture is seen in the public eye as &quot;the graceful and elegant football of Ajax, against the indomitable fighting spirit of Feyenoord&quot;; the confidence of the capital city versus the blue collar mentality of [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/sport/772781-1308/feyenoord-en-ajax-is-haat |title='Feyenoord en Ajax is haat' |publisher=BNR.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are known for their tension and violence, both on and off the pitch. Over the years, several violent incidents have taken place involving rival supporters, leading to the current prohibition of away supporters in both stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/7135955/Feyenoords-latest-clash-with-Ajax-peaceful-thanks-to-absent-friends.html |title=Feyenoord's latest clash with Ajax peaceful thanks to absent 'friends' |newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest point was reached on 23 March 1997, when supporters of both clubs meet on a field near [[Beverwijk]], where Ajax-supporter Carlo Picornie was fatally injured, the incident is commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Battle of Beverwijk]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/5619/Feyenoord/article/detail/2118764/2008/03/20/Stervend-in-de-modder.dhtml |title=Stervend in de modder |publisher=AD.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry with PSV===
{{Main|AFC Ajax–PSV Eindhoven rivalry}}
[[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] are also a rival of Ajax, but in terms of tension and rivalry, these matches are not as loaded as the duels with Feyenoord. The rivalry has existed for some time with PSV and stems from various causes, such as the different interpretations of whether current national and international successes of both clubs correlates and the supposed opposition between the [[Randstad]] and the province. The matches between these two teams is commonly referred to as &quot;De Topper&quot; (&quot;The Topper&quot;), and involves the two most trophy-laden sides in Dutch football and is essentially a clash of two competing schools of thought in Dutch football. Historically, PSV compete with a workmanlike ethic, preferring a more robust 4–3–1–2 or 4–2–3–1, typically shunning the frivolous 4–3–3 approach favoured in Amsterdam. While [[Rinus Michels]] and [[Johan Cruyff]] helped to innovate [[Total Football]] in the sixties and seventies, a different philosophy was honed in [[Eindhoven]] by [[Kees Rijvers]] and [[Guus Hiddink]] in the late 1970s and '80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/ajax-psv-philosophical-rivalry-dominates-dutch-mindset#2rZB5iOBKmfBu5ym.99 |title=Ajax-PSV: a philosophical rivalry that dominates the Dutch mindset |publisher=Fourfourtwo.com |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has created one of the more philosophical rivalries in football, an ideological battleground, which is gradually becoming as heated and intense as the matches Ajax and Feyenoord partake in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/nieuws/alles-over-de-topper-in-de-eredivisie-tussen-ajax-en-psv.htm |title=Alles over de topper in de Eredivisie tussen Ajax en PSV |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries with other clubs===
{{main|Amsterdam derby}}
Aside from Feyenoord and PSV, Ajax have several other rivalries, although in most cases the sentiment is mostly felt by the opposition and is more directed towards Ajax, with one of them being [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalcentraal.nl/nieuws/56261/rivaliteit-tussen-fans-ajax-en-fc-utrecht-opvallend |title=Rivaliteit tussen fans Ajax en FC Utrecht opvallend |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rivalry is more felt on the Utrecht side then with Ajax, matchups between the two sides are often quite intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bnr.nl/nieuws/sport/988786-1209/zo-n-rivaliteit-moeilijk-te-begrijpen |title=Zulke rivaliteit moeilijk te begrijpen |publisher=BNR.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams have fanatic supporters, and clashes off the pitch are more often the rule than the exception. The same goes for [[ADO Den Haag]], with both supporter groups often getting in conflicts, when ADO-Hooligans set fire to the supporters home of Ajax, and Ajax hooligans subsequently broke into the Supporters home of ADO tensions between the two clubs rose. In 2006, supporters from both clubs were banned from attending away matches for five years due to frequent violent outbreaks and clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2686/Binnenland/article/detail/820449/2006/04/25/Poging-brandstichting-supportershome-Ajax.dhtml |title=Poging brandstichting supportershome Ajax |publisher=Volkskrant|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further teams who share a rivalry with Ajax include [[FC Twente|Twente]], [[Vitesse Arnhem]], [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] and AZ, although the latter is often regarded by Ajax supporters as the club's &quot;little brother&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=193936 |title=Ajax is de buurman, rivaliteit is groot, het betekent iets voor de mensen |publisher=Voetbalzone.nl|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With AZ being from nearby [[Alkmaar]] and therefore situated in the same province as Ajax, match-ups between the two sides are commonly known as the &quot;De Noord-Hollandse Derby&quot; (&quot;[[North Holland]] Derby&quot;) and are often very competitive, intense and loaded fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/nl/match/46410/afc-ajax-vs-az/report |title=Noord-Hollandse derby makkelijke prooi Ajax |publisher=Goal.com|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Past rivalries include local [[Amsterdam derby|Amsterdam derbies]] between Ajax and clubs such as [[Blauw-Wit Amsterdam|Blauw-Wit]], [[AFC DWS|DWS]] and [[De Volewijckers]] (which later merged to become [[FC Amsterdam]] in 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/424276/1996/03/30/Blauw-Wit-de-club-van-het-Stadion-kwam-zag-en-verdween.dhtml |title=Blauw Wit, de club van het Stadion, kwam, zag en verdween |publisher=Volkskrant|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tension between the local sides lessened as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the Amsterdam clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vi.nl/webshop/product/sporen-van-ajax.htm |title=Sporen van Ajax |publisher=Voetbal International|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Amsterdam derby to take place in an official league match was when Ajax defeated FC Amsterdam 5–1 on 19 March 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/923-Europe/6986-dutch-derby-days |title=Dutch derby days |publisher=When Saturday Comes|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters==
{{Main|A.F.C.A (hooligans)|F-side|North Up Alliance|South Crew|VAK410}}
[[File:Amsterdam ArenA 15-09-2012 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Ajax supporters]]
Ajax are known for having fanatic core supporter-groups, of which [[F-side|F-Side]] and [[VAK410]] are the most famous. F-Side were founded on 3 October 1976, and are situated right behind the goal in the Johan Cruyff Arena, on the southern end of the stadium in rows 125–129. Their name is derived from the group's former location on the F-side of the old [[De Meer Stadion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ff&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUtZieCU2_g|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=2019-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F-side supporters are responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium, but are also known for rioting during and after matches. If in any match Ajax should win the coin toss, the second half of the match Ajax always play towards the south-end of the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;fg&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XKZuLqnxK0|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=2019-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAK410 (English: Row 410) were founded in 2001 and are situated in the Zuidhoek (''South corner'') of the stadium on the upper ring in rows 424–425. The group was originally situated on the North-West side of the stadium in row 410, from where it derives its name, until relocating to their current place in the stands in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajaxlife.nl/updates/minuutje-actiebeeld-van-zuid-en-vak410|title=Minuutje actiebeeld van Zuid en Vak410|publisher=Ajaxlife|accessdate=3 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907044356/http://www.ajaxlife.nl/updates/minuutje-actiebeeld-van-zuid-en-vak410|archive-date=7 September 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of VAK410 are known to perform various stunts, which include massive banners, to enhance the atmosphere in the stadium.

Through the official ''Football Top 20'' of Dutch sports research group ''SPORT+MARKT'', it was revealed in 2010 that Ajax had approximately 7.1&amp;nbsp;million supporters throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playthegame.org/uploads/media/20100909_SPORT_MARKT_Football_Top_20_2010_Abstract_Press.pdf |title=SPORT+MARKT Football Top 20|publisher=Play The Game|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is significantly more than rivals Feyenoord and PSV (each 1.6 and 1.3 million, respectively), which puts Ajax as the club with the 15th-most supporters across Europe.

==Jewish connection==
[[File:Ajaxingalgenwaard.JPG|thumb|Supporters with [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flags]] in 2008]]

Historically, Ajax was popularly seen as having &quot;Jewish roots&quot;. Although not an official Jewish club like the city's [[:nl:WV-HEDW|WV-HEDW]], Ajax has had a Jewish image since the 1930s when the home stadium was located next to a Jewish neighbourhood of [[Amsterdam-Oost]] and opponents saw many supporters walking through the Nieuwmarkt/Waterloopleinbuurt (de Jodenhoek—the &quot;Jews' corner&quot;) to get to the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2006/12/09/ajax-en-de-joden.aspx |title=de alternatieve bron voor sportnieuws |publisher=Sportgeschiedenis.nl |accessdate=2 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311033954/http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2006/12/09/ajax-en-de-joden.aspx |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Amsterdam was historically referred to as a [[Mokum]] city, Mokum (מקום) being the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] word for &quot;place&quot; or &quot;safe haven&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/dictionary/m Yiddish Dictionary Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713202443/http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/dictionary/m |date=13 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] chants and name calling developed and intensified at the old [[De Meer Stadion]] from frustrated supporters of opposing clubs, Ajax fans (few of whom are actually Jewish&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/28/world/europe/a-dutch-soccer-riddle-jewish-regalia-without-jews.html?pagewanted=1 Amsterdam Journal; A Dutch Soccer Riddle: Jewish Regalia Without Jews] – New York Times, 28 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) responded by embracing Ajax's &quot;Jewish&quot; identity: calling themselves &quot;super Jews&quot;, chanting &quot;Jews, Jews&quot; (&quot;Joden, Joden&quot;) at games, and adopting Jewish symbols such as the [[Star of David]] and the [[Flag of Israel|Israeli flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i21W_KN_iUMC&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=ajax%20jews&amp;client=safari&amp;pg=PA196 Understanding football hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Clubs] by Ramon Spaaij, published 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This Jewish imagery eventually became a central part of Ajax fans' culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding&quot; /&gt; At one point ringtones of &quot;[[Hava Nagila]]&quot;, a [[Hebrew]] [[folk song]], could be downloaded from the club's official website.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; Beginning in the 1980s, fans of Ajax's rivals escalated their [[antisemitic]] rhetoric, chanting slogans like &quot;[[Hamas]], Hamas/Jews to the [[gas chamber|gas]]&quot; (&quot;Hamas, hamas, joden aan het gas&quot;), hissing to imitate the flow of gas, giving [[Nazi salute]]s, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Ajax and the Jewish Issue | url = http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html | publisher = ajax-usa.com | accessdate =20 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113235308/http://www.ajax-usa.com/desk/ajax-and-the-jewish-issue.html |archivedate=13 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual result was that many (genuinely) Jewish Ajax fans stopped going to games.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;

Played against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], winners of the 1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup, it actually went ahead as 'a celebration of the Centenary of Rangers F.C.' (See below) because [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] were serving a one-year ban at the time imposed by UEFA for the misbehaviour of their fans. That victory meant Ajax had won every tournament (5 in total) they entered that year, a feat [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] achieved in 1967 (with 6 trophies) and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (also 6 trophies) repeated in 2009)
