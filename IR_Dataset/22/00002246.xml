[[File:Opium pod cut to demonstrate fluid extraction1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papaver somniferum|Opium poppies]] such as this one provide ingredients for the class of analgesics called [[opiate]]s]]
An '''analgesic''' or '''painkiller''' is any member of the group of [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] used to achieve analgesia, relief from [[pain]].

Analgesic drugs act in various ways on the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] and [[central nervous system|central]] nervous systems. They are distinct from [[anesthetic]]s, which temporarily affect, and in some instances completely eliminate, [[sense|sensation]]. Analgesics include [[paracetamol]] (known in North America as [[acetaminophen]] or simply APAP), the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) such as the [[salicylate]]s, and [[opioid]] drugs such as [[morphine]] and [[oxycodone]].

When choosing analgesics, the severity and response to other medication determines the choice of agent; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) [[pain ladder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anonymous |title=Cancer pain relief and palliative care; report of a WHO expert committee |series=World Health Organization Technical Report Series, 804 |year=1990 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva, Switzerland  |isbn=978-92-4-120804-8 |pages=1–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifies mild analgesics as its first step.

Analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain: For [[neuropathic pain]], traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics, such as [[tricyclic antidepressants]] and [[anticonvulsant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14623723&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dworkin RH, Backonja M, Rowbotham MC, Allen RR, Argoff CR, Bennett GJ, Bushnell MC, Farrar JT, Galer BS, Haythornthwaite JA, Hewitt DJ, Loeser JD, Max MB, Saltarelli M, Schmader KE, Stein C, Thompson D, Turk DC, Wallace MS, Watkins LR, Weinstein SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Advances in neuropathic pain: diagnosis, mechanisms, and treatment recommendations | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 60 | issue = 11 | pages = 1524–34 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14623723 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.60.11.1524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Topical [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; provide pain relief in common conditions such as muscle sprains and overuse injuries. Since the side effects are also lesser, topical preparations could be preferred over oral medications in these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derry S, Moore RA, Gaskell H, McIntyre M, Wiffen PJ | title = Topical NSAIDs for acute musculoskeletal pain in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = CD007402 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26068955 | pmc = 6426435 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007402.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tylenol.jpg|thumb|left|A bottle of [[acetaminophen]].]]

==Contraindications==
Each different type of analgesic has its own associated side effects.

== Classification ==
Analgesics are typically classified based on their mechanism of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/bnf/current/PHP78520-analgesics.htm?q=Painkillers&amp;t=search&amp;ss=text&amp;tot=2&amp;p=2#_hit|title=British National Formulary: Analgesics|website=BNF online|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paracetamol (acetaminophen) ===
{{main|Paracetamol}}
Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen or APAP, is a medication used to treat [[pain]] and [[fever]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Acetaminophen|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/acetaminophen.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063136/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/acetaminophen.html|archive-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically used for mild to moderate pain.&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt; In combination with [[opioid analgesic|opioid pain medication]], paracetamol is now used for more severe pain such as [[cancer pain]] and after surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/SIGN106.pdf|title = Guideline 106: Control of pain in adults with cancer|author = Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)|publisher = National Health Service (NHS)|location = Scotland|year = 2008|isbn = 9781905813384|chapter = 6.1 and 7.1.1|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101220061154/http://sign.ac.uk/pdf/SIGN106.pdf|archive-date = 2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically used either by mouth or [[rectally]] but is also available [[intravenously]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoch2014/&gt; Effects last between two and four hours.&lt;ref name=Hoch2014/&gt; Paracetamol is classified as a mild analgesic.&lt;ref name=Hoch2014&gt;{{cite book| first = Daniel | last = Hochhauser | name-list-format = vanc |title = Cancer and its Management |date=2014 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781118468715 |page=119 |url= https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=CXjDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910083948/https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=CXjDBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|archive-date=2017-09-10|author-link=Daniel Hochhauser}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracetamol is generally safe at recommended doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell FM, Shann F, Curtis N, Mulholland K | title = Evidence on the use of paracetamol in febrile children | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 81 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–72 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12856055 | pmc = 2572451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NSAIDs===
{{main|Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug}}

==== COX-2 inhibitors ====
{{Main|COX-2 inhibitor}}

These drugs have been derived from NSAIDs.  The [[cyclooxygenase]] enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered to have at least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2.  Research suggested most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 ([[Constitutive enzyme|constitutive]]) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 ([[Adaptive enzyme|inducible]]) enzyme.  Thus, the COX2 inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general).  These drugs (such as [[rofecoxib]], [[celecoxib]], and [[etoricoxib]]) are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular.&lt;ref name=Conaghan2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conaghan PG | title = A turbulent decade for NSAIDs: update on current concepts of classification, epidemiology, comparative efficacy, and toxicity | journal = Rheumatology International | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 1491–502 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22193214 | pmc = 3364420 | doi = 10.1007/s00296-011-2263-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After widespread adoption of the COX-2 inhibitors, it was discovered that most of the drugs in this class increase the risk of [[cardiovascular event]]s by 40% on average. This led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, and warnings on others. Etoricoxib seems relatively safe, with the risk of [[thrombotic]] events similar to that of non-coxib NSAID diclofenac.&lt;ref name=Conaghan2012/&gt;

=== Opioids ===
{{Main|Opioid}}

[[Morphine]], the archetypal [[opioid]], and other opioids (e.g., [[codeine]], [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]], [[dihydromorphine]], [[pethidine]]) all exert a similar influence on the [[Cerebrum|cerebral]] [[opioid receptor]] system. [[Buprenorphine]] is a [[partial agonist]] of the μ-opioid receptor, and [[tramadol]] is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with weak μ-opioid receptor agonist properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith HS, Raffa RB, Pergolizzi JV, Taylor R, Tallarida RJ | title = Combining opioid and adrenergic mechanisms for chronic pain | journal = Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 98–114 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25141248 | doi = 10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2788 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tramadol]] is structurally closer to [[venlafaxine]] than to [[codeine]] and delivers analgesia by not only delivering &quot;opioid-like&quot; effects (through mild agonism of the [[mu receptor]]) but also by acting as a weak but fast-acting [[serotonin releasing agent]] and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1596676&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Driessen B, Reimann W | title = Interaction of the central analgesic, tramadol, with the uptake and release of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat brain in vitro | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 147–51 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1596676 | pmc = 1908625 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1992.tb14226.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9389855&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bamigbade TA, Davidson C, Langford RM, Stamford JA | title = Actions of tramadol, its enantiomers and principal metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol, on serotonin (5-HT) efflux and uptake in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 352–6 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9389855 | doi = 10.1093/bja/79.3.352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9671098&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reimann W, Schneider F | title = Induction of 5-hydroxytryptamine release by tramadol, fenfluramine and reserpine | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 349 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 199–203 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9671098 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00195-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12354291&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gobbi M, Moia M, Pirona L, Ceglia I, Reyes-Parada M, Scorza C, Mennini T | title = p-Methylthioamphetamine and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine, two non-neurotoxic 5-HT releasers in vivo, differ from neurotoxic amphetamine derivatives in their mode of action at 5-HT nerve endings in vitro | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 82 | issue = 6 | pages = 1435–43 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12354291 | doi = 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2002.01073.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tapentadol]], with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what is believed to be a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as an SNRI. The effects of serotonin and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|norepinephrine]] on pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief.

Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, [[myoclonus|myoclonic jerks]] and pinpoint pupils), seizures ([[tramadol]]), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tozer|first1=Adam|title=Replacing Opioids: Developing drugs to treat pain|url=https://www.analyticalcannabis.com/articles/replacing-opioids-developing-drugs-to-treat-pain-289925|website=Analytical Cannabis|publisher=Analytical Cannabis|access-date=22 August 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822182648/https://www.analyticalcannabis.com/articles/replacing-opioids-developing-drugs-to-treat-pain-289925|archive-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Opioids, while very effective analgesics, may have some unpleasant side-effects.  Patients starting morphine may experience [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] (generally relieved by a short course of [[antiemetic]]s such as [[phenergan]]). [[Pruritus]] (itching) may require switching to a different opioid.  [[Constipation]] occurs in almost all patients on opioids, and [[laxative]]s ([[lactulose]], [[macrogol]]-containing or co-danthramer) are typically co-prescribed.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine, 3rd ed. (Doyle D, Hanks G, Cherney I and Calman K, eds. Oxford University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

When used appropriately, opioids and other central analgesics are safe and effective; however, risks such as addiction and the body's becoming used to the drug (tolerance) can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect.  When safe to do so, the dosage may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness against tolerance, which may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain and requiring an analgesic over long periods. Opioid tolerance is often addressed with [[opioid rotation|opioid rotation therapy]] in which a patient is routinely switched between two or more non-cross-tolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect.

Opioid tolerance should not be confused with [[opioid-induced hyperalgesia]]. The symptoms of these two conditions can appear very similar but the mechanism of action is different. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia is when exposure to opioids increases the sensation of pain ([[hyperalgesia]]) and can even make non-painful stimuli painful ([[allodynia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bannister K | title = Opioid-induced hyperalgesia: where are we now? | journal = Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–21 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25872113 | doi = 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
{{see also|Ethanol}}
Alcohol has biological, mental, and social effects which influence the consequences of using alcohol for pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZaleMaisto2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zale EL, Maisto SA, Ditre JW | title = Interrelations between pain and alcohol: An integrative review | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 37 | pages = 57–71 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25766100 | pmc = 4385458 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2015.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate use of alcohol can lessen certain types of pain in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZaleMaisto2015&quot;/&gt;

The majority of its analgesic effects come from antagonizing NMDA receptors, similarly to ketamine, thus decreasing the activity of the primary excitatory (signal boosting) neurotransmitter, glutamate. It also functions as an analgesic to a lesser degree by increasing the activity of the primary inhibitory (signal reducing) neurotransmitter, GABA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagy J | title = Alcohol related changes in regulation of NMDA receptor functions | journal = Current Neuropharmacology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–54 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 19305787 | pmc = 2645546 | doi = 10.2174/157015908783769662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to use alcohol to treat pain has also been observed to lead to negative outcomes including excessive drinking and [[alcohol use disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ZaleMaisto2015&quot; /&gt;

=== Combinations ===

Analgesics are frequently used in combination, such as the [[paracetamol]] and [[codeine]] preparations found in many non-prescription pain relievers.  They can also be found in combination with vasoconstrictor drugs such as [[pseudoephedrine]] for [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]]-related preparations, or with [[antihistamine]] drugs for allergy sufferers.

While the use of paracetamol, aspirin, [[ibuprofen]], [[naproxen]], and other [[NSAIDS]] concurrently with weak to mid-range opiates (up to about the hydrocodone level) has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12148679&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehlisch DR | title = The efficacy of combination analgesic therapy in relieving dental pain | journal = Journal of the American Dental Association | volume = 133 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–71 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12148679 | doi = 10.14219/jada.archive.2002.0300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; several combination analgesic products have been shown to have few efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components. Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to confusion that arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.&lt;ref name=nps01&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murnion B |title=Combination analgesics in adults |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=113–5 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/113/5 |access-date=12 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325192249/http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/4/113/5 |archive-date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative medicine===
There is some evidence that some treatments using alternative medicine can relieve some types of pain more effectively than [[placebo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alternative medicine reviews&quot;&gt;

=== Adjuvants ===
{{Main|analgesic adjuvant}}
Certain drugs that have been introduced for uses other than analgesics are also used in pain management.  Both first-generation (such as [[amitriptyline]]) and newer antidepressants (such as [[duloxetine]]) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems.  Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]], [[carisoprodol]], or [[tripelennamine]] to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.

Adjuvant analgesics, also called atypical analgesics, include [[orphenadrine]], [[mexiletine]], [[pregabalin]], [[gabapentin]], [[cyclobenzaprine]], [[hyoscine]] (scopolamine), and other drugs possessing anticonvulsant, anticholinergic, and/or antispasmodic properties, as well as many other drugs with CNS actions. These drugs are used along with analgesics to modulate and/or modify the action of opioids when used against pain, especially of neuropathic origin.

[[Dextromethorphan]] has been noted to slow the development of and reverse tolerance to opioids, as well as to exert additional analgesia by acting upon [[NMDA]] receptors, as does [[ketamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hewitt DJ | title = The use of NMDA-receptor antagonists in the treatment of chronic pain | journal = The Clinical Journal of Pain | volume = 16 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = S73-9 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870744 | doi = 10.1097/00002508-200006001-00013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analgesics such as [[methadone]] and [[ketobemidone]] and perhaps [[piritramide]] have intrinsic NMDA action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elliott KJ, Brodsky M, Hyanansky A, Foley KM, Inturrisi CE | title = Dextromethorphan shows efficacy in experimental pain (nociception) and opioid tolerance | journal = Neurology | volume = 45 | issue = 12 Suppl 8 | pages = S66-8 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8545027 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.45.12_Suppl_8.S66 | publisher = NEUROLOGY, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-alcohol [[liquor]], two forms of which were found in the US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by physicians well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the [[Central nervous system|CNS]] depressant effects of [[Ethanol|ethyl alcohol]], a notable example being the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willian|first1=Ronald S.|title=NDMA on Lower Back Pain|journal=The Gold Rush|date=1 May 2015|volume=CCXXIX|issue=Cincinnati|pages=38|url=http://buytramadolpainrelief.blogspot.ca/|access-date=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426071810/http://buytramadolpainrelief.blogspot.ca/|archive-date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g., morphine, codeine). As such, in general, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.

The [[anticonvulsant]] [[carbamazepine]] is used to treat neuropathic pain. Similarly, the [[Gabapentinoid|gabapentinoids]] [[gabapentin]] and [[pregabalin]] are prescribed for neuropathic pain, and phenibut is available without prescription. Gabapentinoids work as α2δ-subunit blockers of [[voltage-gated calcium channel|voltage-gated calcium channels]], and tend to have other mechanisms of action as well. Gabapentinoids are all [[Anticonvulsant|anticonvulsants]], which are most commonly used for neuropathic pain, as their mechanism of action tends to inhibit pain sensation originating from the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drug Treatment in Urology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008| first1 = Ian | last1 = Eardley | first2 = Peter | last2 = Whelan | first3 = Roger | last3 = Kirby | first4 = Anthony | last4 = Schaeffer | name-list-format = vanc |page=65|chapter=Drugs Used In The Treatment Of Interstitial Cystitis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===

Topical analgesia is generally recommended to avoid systemic side-effects.  Painful joints, for example, may be treated with an [[ibuprofen]]- or [[diclofenac]]-containing gel (The labeling for topical diclofenac has been updated to warn about drug-induced hepatotoxicity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm193047.htm Voltaren Gel (diclofenac sodium topical gel) 1% – Hepatic Effects Labeling Changes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108173957/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm193047.htm |date=2014-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;); [[capsaicin]] also is used [[topical cream|topical]]ly.  [[Lidocaine]], an [[anesthetic]], and [[glucocorticoid|steroids]] may be injected into joints for longer-term pain relief.  Lidocaine is also used for painful [[mouth sore]]s and to numb areas for [[dentistry|dental]] work and minor medical procedures. In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the bloodstream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, and prilocaine in a cream, ointment, or gel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm054718.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019055341/https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/PublicHealthAdvisories/ucm054718.htm |date=October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word ''analgesic'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''an-'' ({{lang|grc|ἀν-}}, &quot;without&quot;), ''álgos'' ({{lang|grc|ἄλγος}}, &quot;pain&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper, D.|title=Online Etymology Dictionary: Analgesia|year=2001|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=analgesia|access-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303002645/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=analgesia|archive-date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''-ikos'' ({{lang|grc|-ικος}}, forming [[adjective]]s). Such drugs were usually known as '''[[anodyne]]s''' before the 20th century.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|EB|1911}}

==Research==
Some novel and investigational analgesics include subtype-selective [[voltage-gated sodium channel]] [[sodium channel blocker|blocker]]s such as [[funapide]] and [[raxatrigine]], as well as multimodal agents such as [[ralfinamide]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.
