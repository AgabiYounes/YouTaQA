[[Angel]]s have appeared in works of art since early Christian art, and they have been a popular subject for [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Europe]]an paintings and sculpture.

Angels are usually intended, in both Christian and Islamic art, to be beautiful, though several depictions go for more awesome or frightening attributes, notably in the depiction of the [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] (which have bestial characteristics), [[ophanim]] (which are unanthropomorphic wheels) and [[cherubim]] (which have mosaic features);&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Alice. Of Wing and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim. pp. 2–4. {{ISBN|978-3-11-020528-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of theology, they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless. Many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions, but until the 19th century, even the most female looking will normally lack breasts, and the figures should normally be considered as genderless.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Because angels are purely spiritual creatures without bodies, there is no sexual difference between them. There are no male or female angels; they are not distinguished by gender.&quot;, p. 10, &quot;Catholic Questions, Wise Answers&quot;, Ed. Michael J. Daley, St. Anthony Messenger Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0867163984}}, 9780867163988. See also [https://www.catholic.com/qa/can-angels-be-male-or-female Catholic Answers], which gives the standard, unchanged, Catholic position.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 19th-century art, especially [[funerary art]], this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned.

===In the Early Church===
Specific ideas regarding how to portray angels began to develop in the early Church. Since angels are defined as pure spirits,

''Angles in the Early Modern World''], p. 5, Cambridege University Press (2006), {{ISBN|9780521843324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known Christian image of an angel, in the ''Cubicolo dell'Annunziazione'' in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], which is dated to the middle of the third century, is a depiction of the Annunciation in which Gabriel is portrayed without wings. Representations of angels on [[sarcophagi]] and on objects such as lamps and [[reliquaries]] of that period also show them without wings,&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 81-89; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt; as for example the angel in the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]'' scene in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]].

In a third-century fresco of the Hebrew children in the furnace, in the cemetery of St. Priscilla, a dove takes the place of the angel, while a fourth-century representation of the same subject, in the coemeterium majus, substitutes the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for the heavenly messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01485a.htm Hassett, Maurice. &quot;Early Christian Representations of Angels.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 Dec. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the Prince's Sarcophagus, discovered at Sarigüzel, near [[Istanbul]], in the 1930s, and attributed to the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Flying winged angels, very often in pairs flanking a central figure or subject, are derivations in visual terms from pairs of [[Victoria (mythology)|winged Victories]] in classical art.&lt;ref name=marshall/&gt;

In this same period, Saint [[John Chrysostom]] explained the significance of angels' wings: &quot;They manifest a nature's sublimity. That is why Gabriel is represented with wings. Not that angels have wings, but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature. Accordingly, the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From then on Christian art generally represented angels with wings, as in the cycle of mosaics in the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-440).&lt;ref&gt;Proverbio(2007), pp. 90-95; cf. review in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 3795-3796 (2–16 August 2008), pp. 327-328.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multi-winged angels, often with only their face and wings showing, drawn from the higher grades of angels, especially [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are derived from Persian art [citation needed], and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts, as opposed to performing tasks on earth.  They often appear in the [[pendentive]]s of [[dome]]s or [[semi-dome]]s of churches.

===Byzantine art===
[[File:Erzengel Michael und Gabriel.jpg|thumb|12th century [[icon]] of the Archangels [[Michael (angel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] wearing the ''[[loros]]'' of the Imperial guards.]]

Angels appear in Byzantine art in mosaics and icons. Artists found some of their inspiration from winged Greek figures such as &quot;Victory&quot;. They also drew from imperial iconography. Court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the Empire. They performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers. Amelia R. Brown points out that legislation under Justinian indicates that many of them came from the Caucasus, having light eyes, hair, and skin, as well as the &quot;comely features and fine bodies&quot; desired by slave traders.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;  Those &quot;castrated in childhood developed a distinctive skeletal structure, lacked full masculine musculature, body hair and beards,....&quot; As officials, they would wear a white tunic decorated with gold. Brown suggests that  &quot;Byzantine artists drew, consciously or not, on this iconography of the court eunuch&quot;.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1053017/Painting_the_Bodiless_Angels_and_Eunuchs_in_Byzantine_Art_and_Culture Brown, Amelia R., &quot;Painting the Bodiless: Angels and Eunuchs in Byzantine Art and Culture&quot;, University of Queensland (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel 10: 5-6 describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold.&lt;ref name=longhurst/&gt; Angels, especially the archangel Michael, who were depicted as military-style agents of God, came to be shown wearing [[Late Antique]] military uniform.  This could be either the normal military dress, with a tunic to about the knees, armour breastplate and [[pteruges]], but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], with a long tunic and the ''[[loros]]'', a long gold and jewelled [[pallium]] restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards, and in icons to archangels.  The basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the [[Baroque]] period and beyond in the West, and up to the present day in [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes.

===Medieval art===
Medieval depictions of angels borrow from the Byzantine. In the French ''Hours of Anne of Brittany'', Gabriel wears a dalmatic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9QQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA54 Andre, J. Lewis. &quot;The Icons and Emblems of the Holy Angels&quot;, ''The Belfry: Quarterly Papers on Art, History and Archaeology'', No. III, Burns &amp; Oates, London, October 1876,]&lt;/ref&gt; In the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a [[deacon]], a [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]], especially [[Gabriel]] in [[Annunciation]] scenes - for example ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|The Annunciation]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]]. This indicated that, for all their powers, they could not perform the [[Eucharist]], and were in this respect outranked by every priest, reinforcing the prestige of the clergy.  In [[Early Christian art]] white robes were almost invariably adopted, sometimes bound with the &quot;golden girdle&quot; of Revelation. During the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour,&lt;ref name=vinycomb&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/lcr/fsca/fsca08.htm Vinycomb, John. ''Fictitious and Symbolic Creatures in Art'', p.30, Chapman and Hall, London(1909)]&lt;/ref&gt; while junior ranks wore white. Early Renaissance painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Fra Angelico]] painted angels with multi-colored wings.  Depictions of angels came to combine medieval notions of beauty with feminine ideals of grace and beauty, as in da Panicale's 1435 ''Baptism of Christ''.&lt;ref name=gorgievski/&gt;

===Renaissance art===
[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|left|Fra Angelico, The Annunciation, 1437-46]]
The classical ''[[erotes]]'' or ''[[putto]]'' re-appeared in art during the [[Italian Renaissance]] in both religious and mythological art, and is often known in English as a [[cherub]], the singular of cherubim, actually one of the higher ranks in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy]].  They normally appear in groups and are generally given wings in religious art, and are sometimes represented as just a winged head.  They generally are just in attendance, except that they may be amusing Christ or [[John the Baptist]] as infants in scenes of the [[Holy Family]].

===Victorian art===
In the late 19th century artists' model [[Jane Morris|Jane Burden Morris]] came to embody an ideal of beauty for [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters. With the use of her long dark hair and features made somewhat more androgynous, they created a prototype Victorian angel which would appear in paintings and stained glass windows. Roger Homan notes that [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and others used her image often and in different ways, creating a new type of angel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000614.php Homan, Roger. &quot;Jane Burden: How a Pre-Raphaelite model changed our image of angels&quot;, ''The Social Affairs Unit'', 14 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islamic art ==
[[File:Islamic_angel,_persian_miniature.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Angel in a [[Mughal miniature]], in the style of [[Bukhara]], 16th century]] Angels in Islamic art often appear in illustrated manuscripts of Muhammad's life. Other common depictions of angels in Islamic art include angels with Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, angels discerning the saved from the damned on the Day of Judgement, and angels as a repeating motif in borders or textiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Images of Paradise in Islamic Art|last=Blair|first=Sheila|publisher=Hood Museum of Art|year=1991|isbn=|location=Dartmouth College|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic depictions of angels resemble winged Christian angels, although Islamic angels are typically shown with multicolored wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Angels, such as the archangel Gabriel, are typically depicted as masculine, which is consistent with God's rejection of feminine depictions of angels in several verses of [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Holy Qur'an|last=Ali|first=Mualana Muhammad|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=149-150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, later depictions of angels in Islamic art are more feminine and androgynous.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Angels in manuscripts ===
The 13th century book ''Ajā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt'' ''[[ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt|(The Wonders of Creation)]]'' by [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] describes Islamic angelology, and is often illustrated with many images of angels. The angels are typically depicted with bright, vivid colors, giving them unusual liveliness and other-worldly translucence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8961/|title=The Wonders of Creation|date=1750|website=www.wdl.org|access-date=2019-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some angels are referred to as &quot;Guardians of the Kingdom of God,&quot; others are associated with hell. An undated manuscript of ''The Wonders of Creation'' from the Bavarian State Library in Munich includes depictions of angels both alone and alongside humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8961/|title=The Wonders of Creation|date=1750|website=www.wdl.org|access-date=2019-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels are also illustrated in [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] manuscripts, such as ''The Timurid Book of the Prophet Muhammad’s Ascension (Mir‘ajnama)'' and the ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]''''.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

====Angels in heaven and hell====
[[File:Deux livres en turc-oriental écrit (...)Ferid ed-Din btv1b8427195m-1.jpg|thumb|Zabaniya and the punishment of hypocrites (cutting of flesh) from ''The Timurid Book of the Prophet Muhammad’s Ascension,'' c. 1436''.''|alt=]]
[[File:Adam and the Angels watched by Iblis.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript of the ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings|Annals of al-Tabari]]'' depicting Iblis, the angels and Adam. ''[[Topkapı Sarayı]]'' in [[Istanbul]].]]
The Qur’an makes multiple references to angels. These angels take on both active and passive roles in Quranic stories. In the story of the creation of Adam, God announces to the angels that he intends to create man. The angels act as witnesses to this announcement and subsequent creation of Adam. Although there are many versions of the story, Islamic sources relate that God used the creation of Adam as a punishment or test for the angels. Therefore, the role of angels is often described as in opposition to man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chipman|first=Leigh N. B|date=2002|title=Adam and the Angels: An Examination of Mythic Elements in Islamic Sources|url=|journal=Arabica|volume=49|pages=429–455|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another angel-like creature mentioned in the Qu’ran (4:97, 32:11) is the ''[[Zabaniyya|zabāniya]].'' A ''zabāniya'' is a black angel of hell that brings souls of sinners down to hell to punish them and can be seen in illustrations of ''The Timurid Book of the Prophet Muhammad’s Ascension'' (c. 1436 A.D.). There are nineteen ''zabāniya,'' led by ''[[Maalik|Mālik]]'', an angel considered to be the master of fire or the gatekeeper of hell''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lange|first=Christian|date=2016|title=Revisiting Hell’s Angels in the Quran|url=|journal=Locating Hell in Islamic Traditions|volume=|pages= 74–100|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mālik's'' and ''zabāniya's'' categorizations as angels are debated as some believe they are better described as spirits or demons. Actually, portrayal of ''Zabaniyya'' shares many traits characteristical for demons in Islamic arts.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Blair, Jonathan M. Bloom The Art and Architecture of Islam 1250-1800 Yale University Press 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-300-06465-0}} page 62&lt;/ref&gt; As seen in ''The Timurid Book of the Prophet Muhammad’s Ascension,'' Muhammad is greeted by ''Mālik'' and later witnesses the torture of sinners carried out by the ''zabāniya.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Similar, the [[fallen angel#Islam|fallen angel]] [[Iblis]] is shown during his moment of refusal to prostrate himself before the newly created Adam, leading to his banishment to the bottom of hell. He is depict as black skinned monstreous creature with horns and flaming eyes, in contrast to the presentation of the noble angels. Only his wings remain as a sign of his former angelic status, however with burned edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Mittman|first1=Asa Simon|last2=Dendle|first2=Peter|title=the Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous|publisher=Routledge|date=2017|chapter= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Angels associated with Muhammad====
[[File:Muhammad_during_the_Mi'raj_-_from_Jami_al-Tawarikh.jpg|thumb|Muhammad beside al-Buraq, which holds a closed book in its hands while its tail appears to transform into an angel wielding a shield and a sword, is approached by two angels, one of whom holds a gold cup on a platter from ''Jami al-Tawarikh'' (The Compendium of Chronicles), c. 1307. |alt=]]Although depictions of Muhammad are often forbidden, the few that exist often include images of angels. Specifically, the Archangel Gabriel is frequently shown alongside the prophet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Images of paradise in Islamic art|author=Blair, Sheila S.|date=1991|publisher=Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College|isbn=0944722083|oclc=611668403}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''The Timurid Book of the Prophet Muhammad’s Ascension'', the Archangel Gabriel appears to the Prophet Muhammad in Mecca to announce his ascension.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Gruber, Christiane J. (2008). ''The Timurid “Book of Ascension” (Micrajnama): A Study of the Text and Image in a Pan-Asian Context''. Patrimonia. p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Kneeling before Muhammad, Gabriel is shown with colorful wings and a crown. Later in ''The Timurid Book,'' Muhammad is shown with Gabriel meeting a group of angels in heaven. In the ''Jami' al-tawarikh'', a Persian history from the 14th century, Muhammad is depicted beside al-Buraq, whose tail is transformed into an angel, while two other angels approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; A 16th-century Ottoman manuscript of ''[[Siyer-i Nebi]]'', a Turkish epic about the life of Muhammad, also includes many depictions of the prophet alongside angels.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
