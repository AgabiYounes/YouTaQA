Erfurt lies in the southern part of the [[Thuringian Basin]], within the wide valley of the [[Gera (river)|Gera river]]. It is located {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Leipzig]], {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Berlin]], {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Munich]] and {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Frankfurt]]. Together with a string of neighbouring cities [[Gotha]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and others, Erfurt forms the central metropolitan corridor of Thuringia called ''Thüringer Städtekette'' (German &quot;Thuringian city chain&quot;) with over 500,000 inhabitants.
 
Erfurt's old town is one of the best preserved medieval city centres in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Erfurt Tourismus (2003) ''Erfurt: Erlebnis Krämerbrücke'' [parallel title: ''Merchants' Bridge'']. Erfurt: Erfurt Stadtverwaltung&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist attractions include the [[Krämerbrücke]] (Merchants' bridge), the [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], the ensemble of [[Erfurt Cathedral]] and ''Severikirche'' (St Severus's Church) and [[Petersberg Citadel]], one of the largest and best preserved town fortresses in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erfurt-web.de/Petersberg Petersberg – Erfurt-web.de] (in German). Retrieved 31 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The city's economy is based on agriculture, horticulture and microelectronics. Its central location has led to it becoming a logistics hub for Germany and central Europe. Erfurt hosts the second-largest trade fair in eastern Germany (after Leipzig) as well as the public television children's channel [[KiKa]].

The city is situated on the [[Via Regia]], a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network. Modern day Erfurt is also a hub for [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] high speed trains and other German and European transport networks. Erfurt was first mentioned in 742, as [[Saint Boniface]] founded the diocese. Although the town did not belong to any of the Thuringian states politically, it quickly became the economic centre of the region and it was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Westholm, Gun (1994) ''Hanseatic Sites, Routes and Monuments: A Traveler's Guide to the Past and Present'', Uppsala: Gotland Centre for Baltic Studies&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] during the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and later became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1802. From 1949 until 1990 Erfurt was part of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany).

The [[University of Erfurt]] was founded in 1379,&lt;ref name=&quot;uni-erfurt.de&quot;&gt;[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/portrait/history-and-buildings/timeline/ University of Erfurt. History. Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first university to be established within the geographic area which constitutes modern-day Germany. It closed in 1816 and was re-established in 1994, with the main modern campus on what was a teachers' training college. [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) was its most famous student, studying there from 1501 before entering [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St Augustine's Monastery]] in 1505.&lt;ref&gt;Metaxas, Eric (2017) ''Martin Luther: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World'', New York: Viking Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other noted Erfurters include the medieval philosopher and mystic [[Meister Eckhart]] (c. 1260–1328), the Baroque composer [[Johann Pachelbel]] (1653–1706) and the sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920).

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===
Erfurt is an old [[Germanic peoples|Germanic settlement]]. The earliest evidence of human settlement dates from the prehistoric era; archaeological finds from the north of Erfurt revealed human traces from the [[paleolithic]] period, ca. 100,000 BCE{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. The [[Melchendorf]] dig in the southern city part showed a settlement from the [[neolithic period]].{{Refn|group=note|As with the case of an [[Anthropomorphism#Examples in prehistory|anthropomorhic]] figurine excavated in Erfurt, some researchers including Olaf Höckmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Höckmann|first=Olaf|title=Menschliche Darstellungen in der bandkeramischen Kultur|trans-title=Human representations in the band ceramic culture|language=de|journal=Jb.

The town is first mentioned in 742 under the name of &quot;Erphesfurt&quot;: in that year, [[Saint Boniface]] wrote to [[Pope Zachary]] to inform him that he had established three [[diocese]]s in central Germany, one of them &quot;in a place called Erphesfurt, which for a long time has been inhabited by pagan natives.&quot; All three dioceses (the other two were [[Würzburg]] and [[Büraburg]]) were confirmed by Zachary the next year, though in 755 Erfurt was brought into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|diocese of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinemeyer|first=Karl|title=Bonifatius: Heidenopfer, Christuskreuz, Eichenkult|year=2004|publisher=Stadtverwaltung Erfurt|pages=73–87|editor=Hardy Eidam |editor2=Marina Moritz |editor3=Gerd-Rainer Riedel |editor4=Kai-Uwe Schierz|language=German|chapter=Bonifatius in Mitteldeutschland}}&lt;/ref&gt; That the place was populous already is borne out by archeological evidence, which includes 23 graves and six horse burials from the sixth and seventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Christoph G.|title=Bonifatius: Heidenopfer, Christuskreuz, Eichenkult|year=2004|publisher=Stadtverwaltung Erfurt|pages=39–56|editor=Hardy Eidam |editor2=Marina Moritz |editor3=Gerd-Rainer Riedel |editor4=Kai-Uwe Schierz|language=German|chapter=Im Machtbereich der Merowinger: Politische und gesellschaftliche Strukturen in Thüringen vom 6. bis 8.

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], Erfurt was an important trading town because of its location, near a [[ford (river)|ford]] across the Gera river. Together with the other five Thuringian [[woad]] towns of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], [[Bad Tennstedt|Tennstedt]], [[Arnstadt]] and [[Bad Langensalza|Langensalza]] it was the centre of the German woad trade, which made those cities very wealthy. Erfurt was the junction of important trade routes: the [[Via Regia]] was one of the most used east–west roads between France and Russia (via [[Frankfurt]], Erfurt, [[Leipzig]] and [[Wrocław]]) and another route in the north–south direction was the connection between the [[Baltic Sea]] ports (e. g. [[Lübeck]]) and the potent upper Italian city-states like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Milan]].

During the 10th and 11th centuries both the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and the [[Electorate of Mainz]] held some privileges in Erfurt. The German kings had an important monastery on Petersberg hill and the Archbishops of Mainz collected taxes from the people. Around 1100, some people became free citizens by paying the annual &quot;{{lang|de|Freizins}}&quot; (liberation tax), which marks a first step in becoming an independent city. During the 12th century, as a sign of more and more independence, the citizens built a city wall around Erfurt (in the area of today's {{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}}). After 1200, independence was fulfilled and a city council was founded in 1217; the town hall was built in 1275. In the following decades, the council bought a city-owned territory around Erfurt which consisted at its height of nearly 100 villages and castles and even another small town ([[Sömmerda]]). Erfurt became an important regional power between the [[Landgraviate of Thuringia]] around, the Electorate of Mainz to the west and the [[Electorate of Saxony]] to the east. Between 1306 and 1481, Erfurt was allied with the two other major Thuringian cities ([[Mühlhausen]] and [[Nordhausen]]) in the Thuringian City Alliance and the three cities joined the [[Hanseatic League]] together in 1430. A peak in economic development was reached in the 15th century, when the city had a population of 20,000 making it one of the largest in Germany. Between 1432 and 1446, a second and higher city wall was established. In 1483, a first city fortress was built on [[Cyriaksburg]] hill in the southwestern part of the town.

The Jewish community of Erfurt was founded in the 11th century and became, together with [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], one of the most influential in Germany. Their [[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]] is still extant and a museum today, as is the [[mikveh]] at Gera river near {{lang|de|Krämerbrücke}}.&lt;ref name=mikveh&gt;Archeologists Discover Medieval Jewish Bath in Erfurt, 12.04.2007, Deutsche Welle, [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2440473,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1349, during the wave of [[Black Death Jewish persecutions]] across Europe, the Jews of Erfurt were rounded up, with [[Erfurt massacre (1349)|more than 100 killed]] and the rest driven from the city. Before the persecution, a wealthy Jewish merchant buried his property in the basement of his house. In 1998, this treasure was found during construction works. The [[Erfurt Treasure]] with various gold and silver objects is shown in the exhibition in the synagogue today.&lt;ref name=&quot;AID&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stürzebecher |first=Maria |title=Zwei Schätze: Zeugnisse jüdischer Kultur in Erfurt |journal=Archäologie in Deutschland |issue=3/2014 |pages=32–35 |publisher=WGB |location=Darmstadt |date=June–July 2014 |language=German |issn=0176-8522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few years after 1349, the Jews moved back to Erfurt and founded a second community, which was disbanded by the city council in 1458.

In 1379,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/portrait/history-and-buildings/ History and Buildings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Erfurt]] was founded. Together with the [[University of Cologne]] it was one of the first city-owned universities in Germany, while they were usually owned by the ''{{lang|de|[[Territorial lord|Landesherren]]}}''. Some buildings of this old university are extant or restored in the &quot;Latin Quarter&quot; in the northern city centre (like {{lang|la|Collegium Maius}}, student dorms &quot;{{lang|de|Georgenburse}}&quot; and others, the hospital and the church of the university). The university quickly became a hotspot of German cultural life in [[Renaissance humanism]] with scholars like [[Ulrich von Hutten]], [[Helius Eobanus Hessus]] and [[Justus Jonas]].

In the year 1184, Erfurt was the location of a notable accident called the ''Erfurter Latrinensturz'' ('Latrine fall'). King [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] held council in a building of the [[Erfurt Cathedral]] to negotiate peace between two of his vassals, Archbishop Konrad I of Mainz and Landgrave Ludwig III of Thuringia. The amassed weight of all the gathered men proved too heavy for the floor to bear, which collapsed. According to contemporary accounts, dozens of people fell to their death into the [[latrine]] pit below. Ludwig III, Konrad I and Henry VI survived the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101004181057/http://www.genealogie-mittelalter.de/ludowinger_landgrafen_von_thueringen/chronik_zu_erfurt.html|title=Chronicle of Erfurt|website=Web Archive|archive-date=2010-10-04|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefortweekly.com/issues/issue-1/curio-1-the-erfurter-latrinensturz/|title=Curio #1: The Erfurter Latrinensturz – The Fortweekly|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1501 [[Martin Luther]] (1483 - 1546) moved to Erfurt and began his studies at the university. After 1505, he lived at [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St. Augustine's Monastery]] as a friar. In 1507 he was ordained as a priest in Erfurt Cathedral. He moved permanently to [[Wittenberg]] in 1511. Erfurt was an early adopter of the [[Protestant Reformation]], in 1521.&lt;ref&gt;Metaxas, Eric (2017) ''Martin Luther: The Man Who Rediscovered God and Changed the World'', New York: Viking Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1530, the city became one of the first in Europe to be officially bi-confessional with the [[Hammelburg]] Treaty. It kept that status through all the following centuries. The later 16th and the 17th century brought a slow economic decline of Erfurt. Trade shrank, the population was falling and the university lost its influence. The city's independence was endangered. In 1664, the city and surrounding area were brought under the dominion of the [[Electorate of Mainz]] and the city lost its independence. The Electorate built a huge fortress on Petersberg hill between 1665 and 1726 to control the city and instituted a governor to rule Erfurt.

During the late 18th century, Erfurt saw another cultural peak. Governor [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]] had close relations with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who often visited him at his court in Erfurt.

With the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]] forming after French defeat in Russia, on 24 February 1813 Napoleon ordered the Petersburg Citadel to prepare for [[siege]], visiting the city on 25 April to inspect the fortifications, in particular both Citadels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erfurt Chronik 1806–1814&quot;/&gt; On 10 July 1813, Napoleon put {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexandre d'Alton|fr}}, [[nobility of the First French Empire|baron of the Empire]], in charge of the defences of Erfurt.&lt;!-- ref name=&quot;Koch&quot; confirms d'Alton's name (see below) but the date and his rank as Baron of the Empire are unsourced within [[:de:Belagerung von Erfurt (1813)]] and [[:fr:Alexandre d'Alton]]--&gt; However, when the French decreed that 1000 men would be conscripted into the {{lang|fr|Grande Armée}}, the recruits were joined by other citizens in rioting on 19 July that led to 20 arrests, of whom 2 were [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by French [[court-martial]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Erfurt Chronik 1806–1814&quot;/&gt; as a result, the French ordered the closure of all inns and alehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Willibald Gutsche |title=Geschichte der Stadt Erfurt |trans-title=History of the city of Erfurt |edition=2nd revised |language=German |location=Weimar |year=1989 |isbn=3-7400-0095-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a week of the Sixth Coalition's decisive [[battle of Leipzig|victory at Leipzig]] (16–19 October 1813), however, Erfurt was besieged by Prussian, Austrian and Russian troops under the command of Prussian Lt Gen [[Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf|von Kleist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erfurt Chronik 1806–1814&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koch&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Christoph Wilhelm von Koch |title=Histoire abrégée des traités de paix entre les puissances de l'Europe depuis la paix de Westphalie, Volume 3 |trans-title=Abridged history of the peace treaties between the powers of Europe since the Peace of Westphalia, Volume 3 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7lw_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA303 |publisher=Meline, Cans et Compagnie |year=1838 |language=French |quote=''{{lang|fr|Le général Kleist assiégeait Erfurt.

After the [[Congress of Vienna]], Erfurt was restored to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] on 21 June 1815, becoming the capital of one of the three districts (''{{lang|de|Regierungsbezirke}}'') of the new [[Province of Saxony]], but some southern and eastern parts of Erfurter lands joined Blankenhain in being transferred to the [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] the following September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erfurt Chronik 1814–1850&quot;/&gt; Although enclosed by [[Thuringia]]n territory in the west, south and east, the city remained part of the Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] until 1944.

After the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolution]], many Germans desired to have a united national state. An attempt in this direction was the failed [[Erfurt Union]] of German states in 1850.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] reached Erfurt in the 1840s, when the [[Thuringian Railway]] connecting [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt]] was built. During the following years, many factories in different sectors were founded. One of the biggest was the &quot;Royal Gun Factory of [[Prussia]]&quot; in 1862. After the [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871, Erfurt moved from the southern border of Prussia to the centre of Germany, so the fortifications of the city were no longer needed. The demolition of the city fortifications in 1873 led to a construction boom in Erfurt, because it was now possible to build in the area formerly occupied by the city walls and beyond. Many public and private buildings emerged and the infrastructure (such as a tramway, hospitals, and schools) improved rapidly. The number of inhabitants grew from 40,000 around 1870 to 130,000 in 1914 and the city expanded in all directions.

The &quot;[[Erfurt Program]]&quot; was adopted by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] during its congress at Erfurt in 1891.

Between the wars, the city kept growing. Housing shortages were fought with building programmes and social infrastructure was broadened according to the welfare policy in the [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Great Depression]] between 1929 and 1932 led to a disaster for Erfurt, nearly one out of three became unemployed. Conflicts between far-left and far-right-oriented milieus increased and many inhabitants supported the new Nazi government and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Others, especially some communist workers, put up resistance against the new administration. In 1938, the new synagogue was destroyed during the {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}}. Jews lost their property and emigrated or were deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]] (together with many communists). In 1914, the company ''[[Topf and Sons]]'' began the manufacture of crematoria later becoming the market leader in this industry. Under the Nazis, ''JA Topf &amp; Sons'' supplied specially developed crematoria, ovens and associated plants to the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]], [[Buchenwald]] and [[Mauthausen-Gusen]] concentration camps. On 27 January 2011 a memorial and museum dedicated to the Holocaust victims was opened at the former company premises in Erfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Schüle, Annegret (2017) ''J.A Topf &amp; Söhne: ein Erfurter Familieunternehmen und der Holocaust''. Erfurt: Landeszentrale für politische Bildung Thüringen&lt;/ref&gt;

Bombed as a target of the [[Oil Campaign of World War II]], Erfurt suffered only limited damage and was captured on 12 April 1945, by the US [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946'', Stackpole Books (Revised Edition 2006), p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July, American troops left the city, which then became part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Soviet Zone of Occupation]] and eventually of the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]). In 1948, Erfurt became the capital of [[Thuringia]], replacing [[Weimar]]. In 1952, the {{lang|de|[[States of Germany|Länder]]}} in the GDR were dissolved in favour of centralization under the new socialist government. Erfurt then became the capital of a new &quot;{{lang|de|[[Erfurt (Bezirk)|Bezirk]]}}&quot; (district). In 1953, the {{lang|de|[[Hochschule]]}} of education was founded, followed by the {{lang|de|Hochschule}} of medicine in 1954, the first academic institutions in Erfurt since the closing of the university in 1816.

On 19 March 1970, the East and West German heads of government [[Willi Stoph]] and [[Willy Brandt]] met in Erfurt, the first such meeting since the division of Germany. During the 1970s and 1980s, as the economic situation in GDR worsened, many old buildings in city centre decayed, while the government fought against the housing shortage by building large {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} settlements in the periphery. The [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989/1990 led to [[German reunification]].

[[File:DDR Street signs.jpg|thumb|Socialist-era street signs removed from around the city of Erfurt after 1990]]
With the re-formation of the state of [[Thuringia]] in 1990, the city became the state capital. After reunification, a deep economic crisis occurred in Eastern Germany. Many factories closed and many people lost their jobs and moved to the former West Germany. At the same time, many buildings were redeveloped and the infrastructure improved massively. In 1994, the new university was opened, as was the Fachhochschule in 1991. Between 2005 and 2008, the economic situation improved as the unemployment rate decreased and new enterprises developed. In addition, the population began to increase once again.

A [[Erfurt school massacre|school shooting]] occurred on 26 April 2002 at the Gutenberg-Gymnasium.

== Geography and demographics ==
[[File:Erfurt.Gera Fluss.jpg|thumb|Gera river in the city centre]]

=== Topography ===
Erfurt is situated in the south of the [[Thuringian basin]], a fertile agricultural area between the [[Harz]] mountains {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north and the [[Thuringian forest]] {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the southwest. Whereas the northern parts of the city area are flat, the southern ones consist of hilly landscape up to 430 m of elevation. In this part lies the municipal forest of ''{{lang|de|Steigerwald}}'' with [[Fagus sylvatica|beeches]] and [[Quercus robur|oaks]] as main tree species. To the east and to the west are some non-forested hills so that the [[Gera (river)|Gera]] river valley within the town forms a basin. North of the city are some [[gravel pit]]s in operation, while others are abandoned, flooded and used as leisure areas.

=== Climate ===
Erfurt has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb) or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system.&lt;ref name = koppen&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

Winters are relatively cold with average high temperatures of {{convert|2|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|-3|C|F}}. The city's topography creates a microclimate caused by the location inside a basin with sometimes [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] in winter (quite cold nights under {{convert|-20|C|F}}) and inadequate air circulation in summer. Annual precipitation is only {{convert|502|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:Erfurt-Ortsteile.png|thumb|Districts of Erfurt]]
Erfurt abuts the districts of [[Sömmerda (district)|Sömmerda]] (municipalities [[Witterda]], [[Elxleben]], [[Walschleben]], [[Riethnordhausen, Thuringia|Riethnordhausen]], [[Nöda]], [[Alperstedt]], [[Großrudestedt]], [[Udestedt]], [[Kleinmölsen]] and [[Großmölsen]]) in the north, [[Weimarer Land]] (municipalities [[Niederzimmern]], [[Nohra]], [[Mönchenholzhausen]] and [[Klettbach]]) in the east, [[Ilm-Kreis]] (municipalities [[Kirchheim, Thuringia|Kirchheim]], [[Rockhausen]] and [[Amt Wachsenburg]]) in the south and [[Gotha (district)|Gotha]] (municipalities [[Nesse-Apfelstädt]], [[Nottleben]], [[Zimmernsupra]] and [[Bienstädt]]) in the west.

The city itself is divided into 53 districts. The centre is formed by the district ''{{lang|de|Altstadt}}'' (old town) and the {{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} districts ''{{lang|de|Andreasvorstadt}}'' in the northwest, ''{{lang|de|Johannesvorstadt}}'' in the northeast, ''{{lang|de|Krämpfervorstadt}}'' in the east, ''{{lang|de|Daberstedt}}'' in the southeast, ''{{lang|de|Löbervorstadt}}'' in the southwest and ''{{lang|de|Brühlervorstadt}}'' in the west. More former industrial districts are ''{{lang|de|Ilversgehofen}}'' (incorporated in 1911), ''{{lang|de|Hohenwinden}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Sulzer Siedlung}}'' in the north. Another group of districts is marked by [[Plattenbau]] settlements, constructed during the [[East Germany|DDR]] period: ''{{lang|de|Berliner Platz}}'', ''{{lang|de|Moskauer Platz}}'', ''{{lang|de|Rieth}}'', ''{{lang|de|Roter Berg}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Johannesplatz}}'' in the northern as well as ''{{lang|de|Melchendorf}}'', ''{{lang|de|Wiesenhügel}}'' and ''{{lang|de|Herrenberg}}'' in the southern city parts.

Finally, there are many villages with an average population of approximately 1,000 which were incorporated during the 20th century; however, they have mostly stayed rural to date:

Around the year 1500, the city had 18,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The population then more or less stagnated until the 19th century. The population of Erfurt was 21,000 in 1820, and increased to 32,000 in 1847, the year of rail connection as industrialization began. In the following decades Erfurt grew up to 130,000 at the beginning of World War I and 190,000 inhabitants in 1950. A maximum was reached in 1988 with 220,000 persons. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 200,000 in 2002 before rising again to 206,000 in 2011. The average growth of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.68% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Erfurt. It occurred after reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.

The birth deficit was 200 in 2012, this is −1.0 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).&lt;ref&gt;According to {{lang|de|[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Thüringer Landesamt für Statistik]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important regions of origin of Erfurt migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]] as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan and Hungary.

Like other eastern German cities, foreigners account only for a small share of Erfurt's population: circa 3.0% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.9% are migrants (according to the [[2011 EU census]]).

Due to the official atheism of the former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 14.8% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 6.8% are Catholics (according to the 2011 EU census). The Jewish Community consists of 500 members. Most of them migrated to Erfurt from Russia and Ukraine in the 1990s.

=== Theatre ===
Since 2003, the modern opera house is home to [[Theater Erfurt]] and its Philharmonic Orchestra. The &quot;grand stage&quot; section has 800 seats and the &quot;studio stage&quot; can hold 200 spectators. In September 2005, the opera ''[[Waiting for the Barbarians (opera)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]'' by [[Philip Glass]] premiered in the opera house. The Erfurt Theater has been a source of controversy recently. In 2005, a performance of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s opera ''{{lang|de|[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]}}'' stirred up the local press since the performance contained suggestions of pedophilia and incest. The opera was advertised in the program with the addition &quot;for adults only&quot;.

On 12 April 2008, a version of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''{{lang|it|[[Un ballo in maschera]]}}'' directed by Johann Kresnik opened at the Erfurt Theater. The production stirred deep controversy by featuring nude performers in [[Mickey Mouse]] masks dancing on the ruins of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and a female singer with a painted on [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] toothbrush moustache performing a straight arm [[Nazism|Nazi]] salute, along with sinister portrayals of American soldiers, [[Uncle Sam]], and [[Elvis Presley]] impersonators. The director described the production as a populist critique of modern American society, aimed at showing up the disparities between rich and poor. The controversy prompted one local politician to call for locals to boycott the performances, but this was largely ignored and the première was sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/11/wopera111.xml |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |title=German staging of Verdi's ''A Masked Ball'' on 9/11 with naked cast in Mickey Mouse masks |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sport ===
[[File:Luftbild Gunda Niemann Stirnemann Halle.jpg|thumb|''{{lang|de|Gunda-Niemann-Stirnemann Halle}}'']]
The [[Messe Erfurt]] serves as home court for the [[Oettinger Rockets]], a professional basketball team in Germany's first division, the [[Basketball Bundesliga]].

Notable types of sport in Erfurt are athletics, ice skating, cycling (with the oldest velodrome in use in the world, opened in 1885), swimming, handball, volleyball, tennis and football. The city's football club {{lang|de|[[FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt]]}} is member of {{lang|de|[[3. Fußball-Liga]]}} and based in {{lang|de|[[Steigerwaldstadion]]}} with a capacity of 20,000. The ''{{lang|de|Gunda-Niemann-Stirnemann Halle}}'' was the second [[Speed skating rink#Indoor speed skating tracks|indoor speed skating arena]] in Germany.

=== Cityscape ===
[[File:Brühlervorstadt.JPG|thumb|Architecture from the ''{{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}}'' in Brühlervorstadt district]]
Erfurt's cityscape features a medieval core of narrow, curved alleys in the centre surrounded by a belt of ''{{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}}'' architecture, created between 1873 and 1914. In 1873, the city's fortifications were demolished and it became possible to build houses in the area in front of the former city walls. 
In the following years, Erfurt saw a construction boom. In the northern area (districts Andreasvorstadt, Johannesvorstadt and Ilversgehofen) [[tenement]]s for the factory workers were built whilst the eastern area (Krämpfervorstadt and Daberstedt) featured apartments for white-collar workers and clerks and the southwestern part (Löbervorstadt and Brühlervorstadt) with its beautiful valley landscape saw the construction of villas and mansions of rich factory owners and notables.

During the interwar period, some settlements in [[Bauhaus]] style were realized, often as housing cooperatives.

After World War II and over the whole GDR period, housing shortages remained a problem even though the government started a big apartment construction programme. Between 1970 and 1990 large {{lang|de|[[Plattenbau]]}} settlements with high-rise blocks on the northern (for 50,000 inhabitants) and southeastern (for 40,000 inhabitants) periphery were constructed. After reunification the renovation of old houses in city centre and the ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}'' areas was a big issue. The federal government granted substantial subsidies, so that many houses could be restored.

Compared to many other German cities, little of Erfurt was destroyed in World War II. This is one reason why the centre today offers a mixture of medieval, Baroque and [[Neoclassical architecture]] as well as buildings from the last 150 years.

Public green spaces are located along Gera river and in several parks like the ''{{lang|de|Stadtpark}}'', the ''{{lang|de|Nordpark}}'' and the ''{{lang|de|Südpark}}''. The largest green area is the {{Interlanguage link multi|Egapark|de}}, a horticultural exhibition park and botanic garden established in 1961.

As religious freedom was granted in the 19th century, some Jews returned to Erfurt. They built their synagogue on the banks of the Gera river and used it from 1840 until 1884. The neoclassical building is known as the ''Kleine Synagoge'' (Small Synagogue). Today it is used an events centre.

A larger synagogue, the ''Große Synagoge'' (Great Synagogue), was opened in 1884 because the community had become larger and wealthier. This moorish style building was destroyed during nationwide Nazi riots, known as {{lang|de|[[Kristallnacht]]}} on 9–10 November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Available at: [http://juedisches-leben.erfurt.de/jl/en/19-century/great_synagogue/index.html Jewish Life in Erfurt.

==== Secular architecture ====
Besides the religious buildings there is a lot of historic secular architecture in Erfurt, mostly concentrated in the city centre, but some 19th- and 20th-century buildings are located on the outskirts. 
[[File:Michaelisstraße Erfurt.JPG|thumb|The {{lang|de|Michaelisstraße}} is known as the lithic chronicle of Erfurt]]

=====Street and square ensembles=====
* The ''{{lang|de|[[Krämerbrücke]]}}'' (Merchants' bridge) is the most famous tourist attraction of Erfurt. This 15th-century bridge is completely covered with dwellings and unique in Europe north of the Alps. Today, there are some art handicraft and souvenir shops in the houses.
* The ''{{lang|de|Domplatz}}'' (Cathedral Square) is the largest square in Erfurt and one of the largest historical market squares in Germany. The cathedral and St Severus' Church on its western side can be reached over the ''{{lang|de|Domstufen}}'', a wide flight of stairs. On the north side lies the courthouse, a historic building from 1880. The eastern and southern side is fronted by early-modern patrician houses. On the square are the Minerva Fountain from 1784 and the Erthal Obelisk from 1777. The Domplatz is the main setting of the Erfurt Christmas Market in December and the location for &quot;DomStufen-Festival&quot;, an open-air theatre festival in summer. 
* The ''{{lang|de|Fischmarkt}}'' (Fish Market) is the central square of Erfurt's city centre. It is surrounded by renaissance-style patrician houses and the town hall, a neo-gothic building from 1882. In the middle of the square is a statue called ''{{lang|de|Römer}}'' (Roman), a symbol of the city's independence, erected by the citizens in 1591. 
* The ''{{lang|de|Wenigemarkt}}'' (Minor Market) is a small square on the east side of the Gera river (opposite to the Fischmarkt on the west side), surrounded by early-modern patrician and merchants' houses. The fountain on this square with the sculpture &quot;Scuffling Boys&quot; was created in 1975. Today, {{lang|de|Wenigemarkt}} square also has various cafés and bars. Next to the {{lang|de|Wenigemarkt}} in {{lang|de|Futterstraße}} is the {{lang|de|Kaisersaal}} building, a neoclassicistic event hall from 1831 (current building). The [[Congress of Erfurt]] took place here in 1808. 
* The ''{{lang|de|Anger}}'' (originally the German term for &quot;[[village green]]&quot;) is a protracted square{{clarify|date=October 2014}} in the eastern city centre. All tram lines are linked here, so that it became the new city centre during the 20th century with many important buildings. On its northern side is the main post office, built in 1886 in neo-gothic style with its prominent clock tower. In the north-east there is the Martin Luther monument from 1889 in front of the Merchants' Church. Between the church and the Ursuline monastery lies the &quot;Anger 1&quot; department store from 1908. On the south side next to Station Street is the {{lang|de|Angermuseum}}, the art history museum of Erfurt, inside a Baroque palace from 1711. The western part of Anger square is surrounded by large historicist business houses from the late 19th century. The west end of the square is marked by the Angerbrunnen fountain from 1890. The Jesuit College near {{lang|de|Schlösserstraße}} was built in 1737 and used until the ban of the Jesuits in 1773.
* The ''[[Willy Brandt]] Square'' is the southern gate to the city centre in front of the main station. Opposite to the station is the former hotel ''{{lang|de|Erfurter Hof}}'', where the first meeting of the East- and West-German heads of government took place in 1970. On the western side is the building of the old Erfurt station (1847–95) with a clock tower and the former offices of the Thuringian Railway Company. 
* The ''{{lang|de|Hirschgarten}}'' (Deer Garden) is a small park in front of the Thuringian government seat in the western city centre. The minister-president's seat is the ''{{lang|de|Kurmainzische Statthalterei}}'', a Renaissance-Baroque palace from the 17th century. 
* The ''{{lang|de|Michaelisstraße}}'' (Michael's Street) is known as &quot;the lithic chronicle of Erfurt&quot;, because of its mostly medieval buildings. It is the main street of the Latin quarter around the old university and today one of the favourite nightlife districts of the Erfurters with various bars, restaurants and cafés. The central building of the old university, {{lang|la|Collegium Maius}}, was built in 1515, destroyed by Allied bombs in 1945 and originally rebuilt in 1999.
* The ''{{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}}'' is an inner-city circular road following the former inner city wall. The road was set out in the 1890s by closing a branch of the Gera river. The buildings along the street originate from all periods of the 20th century, including some GDR-era highrise residence buildings. An old building complex here is the former Great Hospital, established in the 14th century. Today, it hosts the museum of popular art and cultural anthropology. 
* The ''{{lang|de|Andreasviertel}}'' (St Andrew's Quarter) is a small quarter in the northern part of the city centre between {{lang|de|Domplatz}} in the south-west and {{lang|de|Moritzwallstraße}} in the north-east. It was the former craftsmen quarter with narrow alleys and old (16th/17th century) little houses. During the 20th century, there were plans to demolish the quarter because of its bad housing conditions. After 1990, the houses were redeveloped by private individuals so that it is one of the favourite neighbourhoods today. The largest building here is the former Municipal Corn Storage in Gothic style from 1466 with a floor area of {{convert|1800|m2|0|abbr=on}}.

=====Fortifications=====
[[File:Zitadelle_Erfurt.jpg|thumb|[[Petersberg Citadel]]]]
From 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries.&lt;ref name=walls&gt;Stadtverwaltung Erfurt (4 September 2012). [http://www.erfurt-web.de/Stadtbefestigung ''Stadtbefestigung einst und jetzt'']. Retrieved 28 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[German Unification]] in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created [[German Empire]]. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today. A piece of inner wall can be found in a small park at the corner Juri-Gagarin-Ring and Johannesstraße and another piece at the flood ditch (''Flutgraben'') near Franckestraße. There is also a small restored part of the wall in the Brühler Garten, behind the Catholic orphanage. Only one of the wall's fortified towers was left standing, on Boyneburgufer, but this was destroyed in an air raid in 1944.&lt;ref name=walls /&gt;

The [[Petersberg Citadel]] is one of the largest and best preserved city fortresses in Europe, covering an area of 36 hectares in the north-west of the city centre. It was built from 1665 on Petersberg hill and was in military use until 1963. Since 1990, it has been significantly restored and is now open to the public as an historic site.&lt;ref name=&quot;350jahre&quot;&gt;Verein der Freunde der Citadelle Petersberg zu Erfurt
e.V. (2015). ''350 Jahre Zitadelle Petersberg. Tagungsband: Wissenschaftliches Kolloquim zum 350. Jahrestages der Grundsteinlegung der Zitadelle Petersberg vom 29. Mai bis 31 Mai 2015. Universität Erfurt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Interlanguage link multi|Cyriaksburg Citadel|de|3=Zitadelle Cyriaksburg}} is a smaller citadel south-west of the city centre, dating from 1480. Today, it houses the German horticulture museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gartenbaumuseum.de/die-cyriaksburg.html  ''Die Cyriaksburg: Sitz des Deutschen Gartenbaumuseums Erfurt'']. Retrieved 23 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=====19th- and 20th-century architecture in the outskirts=====
Between 1873 and 1914, a belt of ''{{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}}'' architecture emerged around the city centre. The mansion district in the south-west around {{lang|de|Cyriakstraße}}, {{lang|de|Richard-Breslau-Straße}} and {{lang|de|Hochheimer Straße}} hosts some interesting ''{{lang|de|Gründerzeit}}'' and ''Art Nouveau'' buildings.

The &quot;Mühlenviertel&quot; (&quot;mill quarter&quot;), is an area of beautiful Art Nouveau apartment buildings, cobblestone streets and street trees just to the north of the old city, in the vicinity of Nord Park, bordered by the Gera river on its east side. The [[Schmale Gera]] stream runs through the area. In the Middle Ages numerous small enterprises using the power of water mills occupied the area, hence the name &quot;Mühlenviertel&quot;, with street names such as Waidmühlenweg (woad, or indigo, mill way), Storchmühlenweg (stork mill way) and Papiermühlenweg (paper mill way).

The ''[[Bauhaus]]'' style is represented by some housing cooperative projects in the east around {{lang|de|Flensburger Straße}} and {{lang|de|Dortmunder Straße}} and in the north around {{lang|de|Neuendorfstraße}}. Lutherkirke Church in {{lang|de|Magdeburger Allee}} (1927), is an [[Art Deco]] building.

The former malt factory &quot;Wolff&quot; at {{lang|de|Theo-Neubauer-Straße}} in the east of Erfurt is a large industrial complex built between 1880 and 1939, and in use until 2000. A new use has not been found yet, but the area is sometimes used as a location in movie productions because of its atmosphere.

Some examples of Nazi architecture are the buildings of the {{lang|de|Landtag}} (Thuringian parliament) and {{lang|de|Thüringenhalle}} (an event hall) in the south at {{lang|de|Arnstädter Straße}}. While the {{lang|de|Landtag}} building (1930s) represents more the neo-Roman/fascist style, {{lang|de|Thüringenhalle}} (1940s) is marked by some neo-Germanic ''{{lang|de|Heimatschutz}}'' style elements.

The Stalinist early-GDR style is manifested in the main building of the university at {{lang|de|Nordhäuser Straße}} (1953) and the later more international modern GDR style is represented by the horticultural exhibition centre &quot;{{lang|de|Egapark}}&quot; at {{lang|de|Gothaer Straße}}, the {{lang|de|Plattenbau}} housing complexes like Rieth or {{lang|de|Johannesplatz}} and the redevelopment of {{lang|de|Löbertor}} and {{lang|de|Krämpfertor}} area along {{lang|de|Juri-Gagarin-Ring}} in the city centre.

The current international glass and steel architecture is dominant among most larger new buildings like the Federal Labour Court of Germany (1999), the new opera house (2003), the new main station (2007), the university library, the Erfurt Messe (convention centre) and the {{lang|de|[[Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann]]}} ice rink.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved: the unemployment rate declined from 21% in 2005 to 9% in 2013. Nevertheless, some 14,000 households with 24,500 persons (12% of population) are dependent upon state social benefits ([[Hartz concept|Hartz IV]]).

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===
[[File:Optima-Werk Erfurt.JPG|thumb|Former factory building, now reused for services]]
[[File:Anger 1 Erfurt Kaufhaus Römischer Kaiser 686-vLh.jpg|thumb|''Anger 1'', a big department store in centre]]

Farming has a great tradition in Erfurt: the cultivation of [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]] made the city rich during the Middle Ages. Today, horticulture and the production of flower seeds is still an important business in Erfurt. There is also growing of fruits (like apples, strawberries and sweet cherries), vegetables (e.g. cauliflowers, potatoes, cabbage and sugar beets) and grain on more than 60% of the municipal territory.

Industrialization in Erfurt started around 1850. Until World War I, many factories were founded in different sectors like engine building, shoes, guns, malt and later electro-technics, so that there was no industrial monoculture in the city. After 1945, the companies were nationalized by the [[East Germany|GDR]] government, which led to the decline of some of them. After reunification, nearly all factories were closed, either because they failed to successfully adopt to a free market economy or because the German government sold them to west German businessmen who closed them to avoid competition to their own enterprises.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, in the early 1990s the federal government started to subsidize the foundation of new companies. It still took a long time before the economic situation stabilized around 2006. Since this time, unemployment has decreased and overall, new jobs were created. Today, there are many small and medium-sized companies in Erfurt with electro-technics, semiconductors and photovoltaics in focus. Engine production, food production, the [[Braugold]] brewery, and [[Born Feinkost]], a producer of Thuringian mustard, remain important industries.

Erfurt is an ''{{lang|de|Oberzentrum}}'' (which means &quot;supra-centre&quot; according to [[Central place theory]]) in German regional planning. Such centres are always hubs of service businesses and public services like hospitals, universities, research, trade fairs, retail etc. Additionally, Erfurt is the capital of the federal state of Thuringia, so that there are many institutions of administration like all the Thuringian state ministries and some nationwide authorities. Typical for Erfurt are the logistic business with many distribution centres of big companies, the [[Erfurt Trade Fair]] and the media sector with [[KiKa]] and [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] as public broadcast stations. A growing industry is tourism, due to the various historical sights of Erfurt. There are 4,800 hotel beds and (in 2012) 450,000 overnight visitors spent a total of 700,000 nights in hotels. Nevertheless, most tourists are one-day visitors from Germany. The Christmas Market in December attracts some 2,000,000 visitors each year.

=== Transport ===
[[File:Erfurt Hbf Front.JPG|thumb|[[Erfurt Hauptbahnhof]], Erfurt's main railway station.]]

==== By rail ====
The [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] railway network puts Erfurt 1½ hours from [[Berlin]], 2½ hours from [[Frankfurt]], 2 hours from [[Dresden]], and 45 minutes from [[Leipzig]]. In 2017, the ICE line to [[Munich]] opened, making the trip to Erfurt only 2½ hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bahn.de Deutsche Bahn]. Retrieved 1 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

There are regional trains from Erfurt to [[Weimar]], [[Jena]], [[Gotha]], [[Eisenach]], [[Bad Langensalza]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Nordhausen]], [[Göttingen]], [[Mühlhausen]], [[Würzburg]], [[Meiningen]], [[Ilmenau]], [[Arnstadt]], and [[Gera]].

In freight transport there is an [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] terminal in the district of Vieselbach ''({{lang|de|Güterverkehrszentrum, GVZ}})'' with connections to rail and the autobahn.

==== By road ====
The two [[Autobahn]]en crossing each other nearby at ''Erfurter Kreuz'' are the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] ([[Frankfurt]]–[[Dresden]]) and the [[Bundesautobahn 71]] ([[Schweinfurt]]–[[Sangerhausen]]). Together with the east tangent both motorways form a circle road around the city and lead the interregional traffic around the centre. Whereas the A 4 was built in the 1930s, the A 71 came into being after the reunification in the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to both motorways there are two [[Bundesstraße]]n: the [[Bundesstraße 7]] connects Erfurt parallel to A 4 with [[Gotha]] in the west and [[Weimar]] in the east. The [[Bundesstraße 4]] is a connection between Erfurt and [[Nordhausen]] in the north. Its southern part to [[Coburg]] was annulled when A 71 was finished (in this section, the A 71 now effectively serves as B 4). Within the circle road, B 7 and B 4 are also annulled, so that the city government has to pay for maintenance instead of the German federal government. The access to the city is restricted as ''{{lang|de|[[Low-emission zone|Umweltzone]]}}'' since 2012 for some vehicles. Large parts of the inner city are a pedestrian area which can not be reached by car (except for residents).

==== By light rail and bus ====
[[File:Erfurt Straßenbahn Schlösserstr.JPG|thumb|Light rail tram near Anger square]]
The Erfurt public transport system is marked by the area-wide {{lang|de|[[Erfurt Stadtbahn]]}} ([[light rail]]) network, established as a tram system in 1883, upgraded to a light rail (''{{lang|de|Stadtbahn}}'') system in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stadtwerke-erfurt.de/pb/site/swegruppe/node/140107/Lde/index.html |title=Ausbau der Erfurter Straßenbahn zur Stadtbahn |publisher=Essener Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft (EVAG) |language=German |trans-title=Expansion of Erfurt tram to light rail |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continually expanded and upgraded through the 2000s. Today, there are six ''Stadtbahn'' lines running every ten minutes on every light rail route.

Additionally, Erfurt operates a bus system, which connects the sparsely populated outer districts of the region to the city center. Both systems are organized by ''SWE EVAG'', a transit company owned by the city administration. Trolleybuses were in service in Erfurt from 1948 until 1975, but are no longer in service.

==== By airplane ====
[[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]] lies {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city centre. It is linked to the central train station via Stadtbahn (tram). It was significantly extended in the 1990s, with flights mostly to Mediterranean holiday destinations and to London during the peak Christmas market tourist season. Connections to longer haul flights are easily accessible via [[Frankfurt Airport]], which can be reached in 2 hours via a direct train from Frankfurt Airport to Erfurt, and from [[Leipzig Halle Airport|Leipzig/Halle Airport]], which can be reached within half an hour.

==== By bike ====
Biking is becoming increasingly popular since construction of high quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. There are cycle lanes for general commuting within Erfurt city.

Long-distance trails, such as the ''Gera track'' and the ''{{lang|de|Radweg Thüringer Städtekette}}'' (Thuringian cities trail), connect points of tourist interest. The former runs along the [[Gera (river)|Gera]] river valley from the [[Thuringian forest]] to the river [[Unstrut]]; the latter follows the medieval [[Via Regia]] from [[Eisenach]] to [[Altenburg]] via [[Gotha]], Erfurt, [[Weimar]], and [[Jena]].

The [[Rennsteig Cycle Way]] was opened in 2000. This designated high-grade hiking and bike trail runs along the ridge of the Thuringian Central Uplands. The bike trail, about {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} long, occasionally departs from the course of the historic Rennsteig hiking trail, which dates back to the 1300s, to avoid steep inclines. It is therefore about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} longer than the hiking trail.

The Rennsteig is connected to the [[E3 European long distance path]], which goes from the Atlantic coast of Spain to the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, and the [[E6 European long distance path]], running from Arctic Finland to Turkey.

=== Education ===
After reunification, the educational system was reorganized. The [[University of Erfurt]], founded in 1379&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; and closed in 1816, was refounded in 1994 with a focus on social sciences, modern languages, humanities and teacher training. Today there are approximately 6,000 students working within four faculties, the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, and three academic research institutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/university-of-erfurt/faculties-institutes-services/ Faculties, Institutes &amp; Services&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The University has an international reputation and participates in international student exchange programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uni-erfurt.de/en/international/incoming/ Universität Efurt. International Students]. Retrieved 15 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Fachhochschule Erfurt'', is a [[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]], founded in 1991, which offers a combination of academic training and practical experience in subjects such as social work and social pedagogy, business studies, and engineering. There are nearly 5,000 students in six faculties, of which the faculty of landscaping and horticulture has a national reputation.

The [[International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef - Bonn|International University of Applied Sciences Bad Honnef – Bonn (IUBH)]], is a privately run university with a focus on business and economics. It merged with the former Adam-Ries-Fachhochschule in 2013.

The world renowned [[Bauhaus]] design school was founded in 1919 in the city of [[Weimar]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bauhaus-2019.de/cms/website.php?id=/en/index.htm Bauhaus 2019. The Bauhaus in Thuringia.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116004431/https://www.bauhaus-2019.de/cms/website.php?id=%2Fen%2Findex.htm |date=16 January 2018 }} Retrieved 19 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; approximately {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Erfurt, 12 minutes by train. The buildings are now part of a [[World Heritage Site]] and are today used by the [[Bauhaus-Universität Weimar]], which teaches design, arts, media and technology related subjects.

Furthermore, there are eight ''{{lang|de|[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasien]]}}'', six state-owned, one Catholic and one Protestant. One of the state-owned schools is a ''{{lang|de|Sportgymnasium}}'', an elite boarding school for young talents in athletics, swimming, ice skating or football. Another state-owned school, ''{{lang|de|Albert Schweitzer Gymnasium}}'', offers a focus in sciences as an elite boarding school in addition to the common curriculum.

MDR, [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]], a radio and television company, has a broadcast centre and studios in Erfurt.

The [[Thüringer Allgemeine]] is a statewide newspaper that is headquartered in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thueringer-allgemeine.de/kontakt Thüringer Allgemeine. Kontakt]. Retrieved 13 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==

=== Mayor and city council ===
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was [[Manfred Ruge]], [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] (in office from 1990 to 2006), followed by [[Andreas Bausewein]], [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (in office since 2006).

The last municipal election was held in 2014 with the result:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erfurt.de/mam/ef/rathaus/wahlen/ergebnisse/kommunal/erfurter_statistik_-_endgueltiges_ergebnis_gewaehlte_bewerber_2014.pdf Stadtsratmitgliederwahl 2014 – endgueltiges Ergebnis] Retrieved 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
