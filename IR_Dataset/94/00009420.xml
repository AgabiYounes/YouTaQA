It had a population of 231,469 in 2019, making it the largest city in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]]. Eindhoven was originally located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Dommel]] and [[Gender (stream)|Gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1 = Schippers |first1 = Hans |contribution = Stadsrechten en een stadswapen, 1232: het vroege Eindhoven |title = De canon van Eindhoven |editor-last = Lintsen |editor-first = Harry|place = 's-Hertogenbosch |publisher= Heijnen |pages = 29–34 |year = 2009 |language = Dutch |isbn=9789086801275|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s, but the Dommel still runs through the city.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20151113141028/http://eindhoven.buurtmonitor.nl/quickstep/QsReportAdvanced.aspx?report=fact_2_01 Bevolking 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The agglomeration has a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population urbanmetro|Eindhoven Urban}}}}. The metropolitan area consists of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population urbanmetro|Eindhoven Metro}}}} inhabitants. The [[city region]] has a population of 753,426. The [[Brabantse Stedenrij]] combined [[metropolitan area]] has about 2 million inhabitants.

== Name ==
The name may derive from the contraction of the regional words ''eind'' (meaning &quot;last&quot; or &quot;end&quot;) and ''hove'' (or ''hoeve'', a section of some 14 [[hectares]] of land). [[toponomy|Toponymically]],  ''eind'' occurs commonly as a prefix and postfix in local place- and streetnames. A &quot;hove&quot; comprised a parcel of land which a local lord might [[leasehold|lease]] to private persons (such as farmers). Given that a string of such parcels existed around [[Woensel]], the name ''Eindhoven'' may have originated with the meaning &quot;last hoves on the land of Woensel&quot;.
Another explanation is that &quot;Eind&quot; has deriven from &quot;Gender&quot;, a river that goes through the city.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Eindhoven}}

=== 13th–15th centuries ===
The [[Recorded history|written history]] of Eindhoven started in 1232, when Duke [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Hendrik I of Brabant]] granted [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]] to ''Eindhoven'', then a small town right on the confluence of the Dommel and Gender streams. At the time of granting of its [[Municipal charter|charter]], Eindhoven had approximately 170 houses enclosed by a [[Defensive wall|rampart]]. Just outside the city walls stood a small castle. The city was also granted the right to organize a weekly market and the farmers in nearby villages were obliged to come to Eindhoven to sell their produce. Another factor in its establishment was its location on the [[trade route]] from Holland to [[Liège]].

Around 1388, the city's fortifications were strengthened further. And between 1413 and 1420, a new castle was built within the city walls. In 1486, Eindhoven was plundered and burned by troops from [[Guelders]].

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
[[File:Eindhoven Hogenberg.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Eindhoven (1583)|capture of Eindhoven]] in 1583, by [[Frans Hogenberg]]]]
The reconstruction of Eindhoven was finished in 1502, with a stronger rampart and a new castle. However, in 1543 it fell again, its defense works having been neglected due to poverty.

A big fire in 1554 destroyed 75% of the houses but by 1560 these had been rebuilt with the help of [[William the Silent|William I of Orange]]. During the [[Dutch Revolt]], Eindhoven changed hands between the Dutch and the [[Spain|Spanish]] several times during which it was burned down by renegade Spanish soldiers, until [[Siege of Eindhoven (1583)|finally in 1583 it was captured once more by Spanish troops]] and its city walls were demolished.

Eindhoven did not become part of the Netherlands until 1629. During the French occupation, Eindhoven suffered again with many of its houses destroyed by the invading forces. Eindhoven remained a minor city after that until the start of the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]].

=== 19th century ===
The [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] of the 19th century provided a major growth impulse. Canals, roads and railroads were constructed. Eindhoven was connected to the major [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]] canal through the [[Eindhovens Kanaal]] branch in 1843 and was connected by rail to [[Tilburg]], [['s-Hertogenbosch]], [[Venlo]] and [[Belgium]] between 1866 and 1870. Industrial activities initially centred around [[tobacco]] and [[textile]]s and boomed with the rise of [[lighting]] and [[electronics]] giant [[Philips]], which was founded as a [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]] manufacturing company in Eindhoven in 1891.

Industrialisation brought population growth to Eindhoven. On the establishment of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815, Eindhoven had 2,310 inhabitants.

=== 20th century ===
By 1920, the population was 47,946; by 1925 it was 63,870 and in 1935 that had ballooned to 103,030.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrowthOfEndhoven&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/historie-1/Groei-van-Eindhoven-1.htm |title=Eindhoven - Groei van Eindhoven (inwoners) |website=Eindhoven.nl |date=2016-04-30 |accessdate=2017-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306133502/https://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/historie-1/Groei-van-Eindhoven-1.htm |archive-date=6 March 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosive growth of industry in the region and the subsequent housing needs of workers called for radical changes in administration, as the City of Eindhoven was still confined to its [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[moat]] city limits. In 1920, the five neighbouring [[municipality|municipalities]] of [[Woensel]] (to the north), [[Tongelre]] (northeast and east), [[Stratum, Netherlands|Stratum]] (southeast), [[Gestel en Blaarthem]] (southwest) and [[Strijp]] (west), which already bore the brunt of the housing needs and related problems, were incorporated into the new Groot-Eindhoven (&quot;Greater Eindhoven&quot;) municipality. The prefix &quot;Groot-&quot; was later dropped.

[[File:Openluchtvergadering NSB - Fotodienst der NSB - NIOD - 78459.jpeg|thumb|The [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]], Eindhoven in April 1941]]
After the incorporation of 1920, the five former municipalities became districts of the Municipality of Eindhoven, with Eindhoven-Centrum (the City proper) forming the sixth. Since then, an additional seventh district has been formed by dividing the largest district, that of Woensel, into Woensel-Zuid and Woensel-Noord.

The early 20th century saw additions in technical industry with the advent of [[Automobile|car]] and [[truck]] manufacturing company [[DAF Trucks|Van Doorne's Automobiel Fabriek]] (DAF) and the subsequent shift towards electronics and engineering, with the traditional tobacco and textile industries waning and finally disappearing in the 1970s.

A first [[airstrike|air raid]] in [[World War II]] was flown by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on 6 December 1942 targeting the [[Philips]] factory downtown. 148 civilians died, even though the attack was carried out on a Sunday by low-flying [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec42.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec42.html |archivedate=6 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/6th-december-1942-low-level-daylight-attack-on-the-philips-plant-holland|title=Low level daylight attack on the Philips plant, Holland - WWII Today|date=6 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale air raids, including the bombing by the Luftwaffe on 18 September, 1944 during [[Operation Market Garden]], destroyed large parts of the city. The reconstruction that followed left very little historical remains and the postwar reconstruction period saw drastic renovation plans in [[High-rise|highrise]] style, some of which were implemented. At the time, there was little regard for historical [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]. During the 1960s, a new [[City and town halls|city hall]] was built and its neogothic predecessor (1867) demolished to make way for a planned [[arterial road]] that never materialised.

The 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s saw large-scale [[housing developments]] in the districts of Woensel-Zuid and Woensel-Noord, making Eindhoven the fifth-largest city in the Netherlands. At the start of the 21st century, a whole new [[Subdivision (land)|housing development]] called [[Meerhoven]] was constructed at the site of the old [[airport]] of Welschap, west of Eindhoven. The airport itself, now called [[Eindhoven Airport]], had moved earlier to a new location, paving the way for much needed new houses. Meerhoven is part of the Strijp district and partially lies on lands annexed from the municipality of [[Veldhoven]].

==Geography==
{{See also|Subdivision of Eindhoven into districts, quarters and neighborhoods}}
[[File:Eindhoven-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Topographic map of Eindhoven (city), September 2014]]
The villages and city that make up modern Eindhoven were originally built on sandy elevations between the Dommel, Gender and [[Tongelreep (river)|Tongelreep]] streams. Beginning in the 19th century, the [[sedimentary basin|basins]] of the streams themselves have also been used as housing grounds, resulting in occasional floodings in the city centre. Partly to reduce flooding, the bed of the Gender stream, which flowed directly through the city centre, was dammed off and filled up after the War, and the course of the Dommel was regulated. New [[ecology|ecological]] and socio-historical insights have led to parts of the Dommel's course being restored to their original states, and plans to have the Gender flow through the centre once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cognito.nl/stadsdeelkantoren/centrum/item.asp?newsid=2238 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828184931/http://www.cognito.nl/stadsdeelkantoren/centrum/item.asp?newsid=2238 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-08-28 |title=Map and De Nieuwe Gender |language=nl|accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large-scale housing developments of the 20th century saw residential areas being built on former [[agriculture|agricultural lands]] and [[forest|woods]], former [[heath (habitat)|heaths]] that had been turned into cultivable lands in the 19th century.

The city is currently divided into seven districts:
{|

# Centrum
# Woensel-Noord
# Woensel-Zuid
# Tongelre
# Stratum
# Gestel
# Strijp
|}

===Climate===
Eindhoven has an [[oceanic climate]] with slightly warmer summers and colder winters than the coastal parts of the Netherlands. Its all-time record is {{convert|40.3|C|abbr=}} set on 25 July 2019 and {{convert|-21.7|°C}} set on 13 January 1968, while winter lows have dipped below {{convert|-15|C|F}} during extreme cold snaps. Although frosts are frequent in winter, there is no lasting snow cover in a normal winter due to the mild daytime temperatures.

The municipal agglomeration of Eindhoven (an administrative construct which includes only some of the surrounding towns and villages) has 327,245 inhabitants as of 1 January 2010.

The spoken language is a combination of Kempenlands (a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialect spoken in a large area east and south east of the city, including Arendonk and Lommel in Belgium) and North [[Meierij]]s (between the south of [[Den Bosch]] and into Eindhoven). Both dialects belong to the [[East Brabantian]] dialect group), which is very similar to colloquial [[Dutch language|Dutch]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jos &amp; Cor Swanenberg: Taal in stad en land: Oost-Brabants, {{ISBN|9012090105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Districts===
Of all Eindhoven districts, the historical centre is by far the smallest in size and population, numbering only 5,419 in 2006. Woensel-Noord is the largest, having been the city's main area of expansion for several decades.

===Religion===
Eindhoven is located in the southeast of the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]]. This area is historically [[Roman Catholic]] and the population of Eindhoven was similarly mostly Catholic for a very long time until the late 1970s. However, the internationalizing influence of the university, Philips and other companies have created a more mixed population over the last few decades.

===Crime===
In research by the Dutch newspaper [[Algemeen Dagblad]] based on the police's [[Statistics|statistical data]] on [[Crime statistics|crime rates]], Eindhoven was found to have the highest crime rate in the Netherlands for 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. In 2011, Eindhoven has slipped down the list to number six.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rotterdam onveiligste gemeente&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Binnenland/article/detail/2443794/2011/06/10/Rotterdam-onveiligste-gemeente.dhtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613204248/http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1012/Binnenland/article/detail/2443794/2011/06/10/Rotterdam-onveiligste-gemeente.dhtml |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Eindhoven does not have its own, uniform dialect. Varieties of the [[Brabantian dialect]] used to be spoken in the former villages of Gestel, Woensel and Stratum, but are now almost extinct. The closest city to Eindhoven in which Brabantian is spoken is [[Helmond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;daniels&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
Eindhoven has grown from a little town in 1232 to one of the biggest cities in the [[Netherlands]] with around 230,000 inhabitants in 2020. Much of its growth is due to [[Philips]], [[DAF Trucks]] and [[Brabantia]].

After the resurrection of the Netherlands in 1815 and the end of the [[Belgian Revolution]], Eindhoven was a small village of some 1250 people in an economically backward and mostly agricultural area. Cheap land, cheap labor and the existence of pre-industrial [[homesourcing]]  (''huisnijverheid'' in Dutch) made Eindhoven an attractive area for the developing industries which were being stimulated by the government of [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]]. During the 19th century, Eindhoven grew into an industrial town with factories for [[textile industry|textile weaving]], [[cigar]] manufacturing, [[match|match making]] and [[hat|hat making]]. Most of these industries disappeared again after [[World War II]], though.
[[File:Aanzicht op de Lichttoren en gebouw ED en EC, met links de Emmasingel en rechts de Mathildelaan - Eindhoven - 20338971 - RCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[:nl:Lichttoren (Eindhoven)|Philips Light Tower]] in 2000.]]

In 1891, brothers [[Gerard Philips|Gerard]] and [[Anton Philips]] founded the small light bulb factory that would grow into one of the largest electronics firms in the world. [[Philips]]' presence is probably the largest single contributing factor to the major growth of Eindhoven in the 20th century. It attracted and spun off many [[High tech|hi-tech]] companies, making Eindhoven a major technology and industrial hub. In 2005, a full third of the total amount of money spent on research in the Netherlands was spent in or around Eindhoven. A quarter of the jobs in the region are in [[technology]] and [[Information technology|ICT]], with companies such as [[FEI Company]] (once Philips Electron Optics), [[NXP Semiconductors]] (formerly Philips Semiconductors), [[ASML Holding|ASML]], [[ALTEN]], Simac, Neways Electronics and the aforementioned Philips and DAF.

Eindhoven has long been a centre of cooperation between research institutes and industry. This tradition started with Philips (the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|NatLab]] was a physical expression of this) and has since expanded to large cooperative networks. The [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] hosts an incubator for technology startups and the NatLab has developed into the [[High Tech Campus Eindhoven]]. Also, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has opened a branch on the university campus. This tradition has also fostered inter-industry cooperation in the region; one example of this is the announcement in September 2010 of a new research lab for high-grade packaging materials, a cooperation of [[IPS Packaging (Netherlands)|IPS Packaging]] and [[Thales Nederland|Thales Cryognetics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PackagingLab&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technischweekblad.nl/nieuw-testlab-voor-hoogwaardige-verpakkingen.108164.lynkx |title=Nieuw testlab voor hoogwaardige verpakkingen |first=Joop |last=Wenstedt |date=25 September 2010 |work=[[Technisch Weekblad]] |publisher=Uitgeverij Bèta Publishers |location=[[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] |language=Dutch |trans-title=New testing lab for high-grade packaging materials |accessdate=30 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719233939/http://www.technischweekblad.nl/nieuw-testlab-voor-hoogwaardige-verpakkingen.108164.lynkx |archive-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cooperative tradition has also developed into a different direction than the traditional technology research done at the university. Starting in 2002, the university, the Catharina hospital, Philips Medical and the [[University of Maastricht]] joined forces and started joint research into [[biomedical science]], [[biomedical technology|technology]] and [[biomedical engineering|engineering]]. Within Eindhoven, this research has been concentrated in a new university faculty (BioMedical Technology or BMT). This development has also made Eindhoven a biomedical technology hub within the country and its (European) region.

Prime examples of industrial heritage in Eindhoven are the renovated Witte Dame (''&quot;White Lady&quot;'') complex, a former Philips lamp factory; and the Admirant building (informally known as Bruine Heer or ''&quot;Brown Gentleman&quot;'' in reference to the Witte Dame across the street), the former Philips main offices. The Witte Dame currently houses the municipal [[library]], the [[Design Academy Eindhoven|Design Academy]] and a selection of shops. The Admirant has been renovated into an [[Office|office building]] for small companies. Across the street from the Witte Dame and next to the Admirant is Philips' first light bulb factory (nicknamed Roze Baby, or ''&quot;Pink Baby&quot;'', in reference to its pink colour and much smaller size when compared to the &quot;White Lady&quot; and &quot;Brown Gentleman&quot;). The small building now houses the &quot;Centrum Kunstlicht in de Kunst&quot; (centre artificial light in art)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstlichtkunst.nl |title=Centrum kunstlicht in de kunst te Eindhoven. Museum voor lichtkunst en lichteffecten |language=nl |publisher=Kunstlichtkunst.nl |date= |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Philips Incandescent Lamp Factory of 1891&quot; museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philipsfabriek1891.nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010124030300/http://www.philipsfabriek1891.nl/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-01-24 |title=Philips gloeilampenfabriekje anno 1891 |publisher=Philipsfabriek1891.nl |accessdate=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge economy initiatives===
Due to its high-tech environment, Eindhoven is part of several initiatives to develop, foster and increase a [[knowledge economy]]. Chief among these are:

*Brainport Top Technology Region:&lt;ref name=&quot;Brainport&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainport.nl |title=Brainport |website=Brainport.nl |date=2017-02-18 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cooperative initiave of local government, industry and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] to develop the local knowledge economy of the Eindhoven region.
*Brainport Development:&lt;ref name=&quot;BrainportDevelopment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainportdevelopment.nl/en/ |title=Home - Brainport Development |website=Brainportdevelopment.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of the Top Technology Region, Brainport Development serves as the Eindhoven's regional innovation agency to maintain its position as top innovation hub in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Morisson, A. &amp; Doussineau, M.

Although SRE is far more than just an economic agreement, it includes economic cooperation.
*The Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle:&lt;ref name=&quot;ELAt&quot;&gt;[http://www.elat.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313190025/http://www.elat.org/ |date=13 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive cooperation agreement between the universities and surrounding regions of Eindhoven, [[Leuven]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Aachen]] ([[Germany]]).
*Within the Eindhoven region (particularly around Helmond), several parties are working together to set up an automotive testing facility of European scale, for testing and European certification of vehicles. This cooperation involves the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO Automotive]] and the different automotive companies in and around Helmond.

As a result of these efforts, the [[Intelligent Community Forum]] named the Eindhoven metro region one of the top-21 intelligent communities in 2008 and one of the top-7 intelligent communities in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICFIntelComm2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=news&amp;srctype=detail&amp;category=Partner%20News&amp;refno=582 |title=Intelligent Community Forum Announces Top Seven Intelligent Communities of 2011 |date=19 January 2011 |publisher=Intelligent Community Forum |accessdate=23 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722103029/http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=news&amp;srctype=detail&amp;category=Partner%20News&amp;refno=582 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC20110122-Brabo-Techniek&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Brabantse techniek terug in de wereld |first=Renée |last=Postma |url=http://digitaleeditie.nrc.nl/NH/2011/0/20110122___/3_13/article5.html |newspaper=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |page=13 |accessdate=23 January 2011 |language=Dutch |trans-title=Brabant technology back in the world}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 2011, the ICF named Eindhoven the Intelligent Community of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICFIntelComm2011Winner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=news&amp;srctype=detail&amp;category=Partner%20News&amp;refno=629 |title=ICF Names Eindhoven Region of the Netherlands as its Intelligent Community of the Year 2011 |date=3 June 2011 |publisher=Intelligent Community Forum |accessdate=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726181907/http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=news&amp;srctype=detail&amp;category=Partner%20News&amp;refno=629 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EIT Co-location===
Eindhoven is one of the co-location centres of the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]] (EIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eit.europa.eu/home.html |title=European Institute of Innovation and Technology: Home |publisher=Eit.europa.eu |accessdate=2011-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328175502/http://eit.europa.eu/home.html |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosts two Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs): Innoenergy (Sustainable Energy) and EIT ICT Labs (Information and Communication Technology). The co-locations are on the [[High Tech Campus Eindhoven]].

==Education==
Eindhoven, being a city with a 200,000+ population, is served by a large number of schools both at primary and secondary education levels. In addition, Eindhoven is a higher-education hub within the southern Netherlands, with several institutes of higher education that serve students from the extended region of [[North Brabant]], [[Zeeland]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and parts of the surrounding provinces.

== Politics ==
=== Municipal council ===
The [[municipal council (Netherlands)|municipal council]] is the [[legislative council]] at the municipal level in Eindhoven; its existence is mandated by the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]]. The Eindhoven city council consists of 45 elected representatives from the Eindhoven municipality. These are elected during municipal elections from candidates running in Eindhoven. Eindhoven politics consists of local branches of the national political parties and purely local parties with strictly local interests. The city council reflects this mix in its makeup.

The last three municipal elections were held on 7 March 2006, 3 March 2010 and 19 March 2014. The division of the 45 seats in the Eindhoven city council after these elections is shown below:&lt;ref name=&quot;ElectionResultsCityCouncil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/Default.aspx |title=Databank verkiezingsuitslagen |website=Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Municipal executive ===

==== Aldermen ====
The executive council in Dutch municipalities is called the ''College of the Mayor and Aldermen'' (Dutch: ''[[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders]]'' or ''College van B&amp;W'' for short). The [[burgemeester|mayor]] is appointed by the [[monarchy of the Netherlands|monarch]], but the council of [[wethouder|aldermen]] is composed as a result of the formation of a local [[coalition government]]. This coalition is formed in such a way as to be able to rely on a majority of the votes in the city council.

In May 2014, a coalition was formed between [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]], [[Democrats 66|D66]], [[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]] and [[GroenLinks]]. Together they have 26 seats in the city council. The council of aldermen consists of the following people:&lt;ref name=&quot;CollegeBW2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/artikelen/College-van-BW-20142018.htm |title=College van B&amp;W 2014–2018 |publisher=Gemeente Eindhoven |accessdate=20 May 2014 |language=nl |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803141123/http://www.eindhoven.nl/artikelen/College-van-BW-20142018.htm |archive-date=3 August 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Mary-Ann Schreurs ([[Democrats 66|D66]]): [[innovation]] and [[design]], [[sustainability]] and [[culture]]
* Lenie Scholten ([[GroenLinks|GreenLeft]]): [[healthcare]] and WIJeindhoven
* {{proper name|Staf}} Depla ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]): [[economy]], [[Employment|work]] and [[income]] and [[vocational education]]
* Bianca van Kaathoven ([[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]]): Active city, [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and permits
*[[Marco van Dorst]] ([[Democrats 66|D66]]): [[Spatial planning]] and [[treasury]]
*[[Yasin Torunoglu]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]): Living, [[borough]]s, space and citizen participation
*[[Jannie Visscher]] ([[Socialist Party (Netherlands)|SP]]): [[Youth]], [[education]], [[traffic]] and [[transport]]

==== Mayor ====
The [[burgemeester|mayors]] of the Netherlands are not elected but appointed by the [[Politics of the Netherlands|crown]]. Nevertheless, there has been a movement over the last few years to give the municipalities more say in who will be their mayor, which has resulted in [[referendum|consultative referenda]] being held in the larger cities to &quot;suggest&quot; a candidate for the post. This was also tried in Eindhoven and as a result the previous mayor was [[Rob van Gijzel]] ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]]).

On 23 January 2008, a referendum to elect a mayor was held in Eindhoven. This referendum, the second of its kind in the Netherlands, was attended by 24.6% of the inhabitants. This was less than the required 30% needed to make a referendum binding. Nevertheless, the city council would choose the winner of the referendum as the preferred candidate. The main reason for the low attendance was that the candidates, [[Leen Verbeek]] and Rob van Gijzel, were from the same party. Rob van Gijzel won the referendum with 61.8% of the votes and was appointed the city's new mayor.

The mayor is the chairman of the Council of B&amp;W. He also has responsibility for a number of specific posts (like the aldermen). In the previous council, mayor Van Gijzel held responsibility for the following posts:&lt;ref name=&quot;CollegeBW2014&quot;/&gt;

*Communication

If unavailable, the mayor is temporarily replaced by one of the aldermen.

==Culture and recreation==
Culturally and recreationally, Eindhoven was formed by two forces:

*Being a university city, Eindhoven has a large student population. The students from the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and a number of undergraduate schools give Eindhoven a young population, whose recreational needs are catered to by several different festivals, clubs and such.
*For a long time Eindhoven was the main location of Philips. The Philips company undertook a lot of effort in the &quot;cultural formation&quot; of its workforce and has given the city both cultural institutions (such as the former [[Philips Ontspannings Centrum|POC]] and the [[Muziekcentrum Frits Philips]]) and sporting institutions (notably [[Philips Sport Vereniging|PSV]]).

Eindhoven is also known as the City of Light, due to Philips originating from there and because of several projects involving lighting up buildings of the city. During [[Carnival]], Eindhoven is rechristened ''Lampegat'' (Hamlet of Lamps, although for the ironic purposes of carnival the translation ''Hole in the ground with lamps'' is closer to the mark); this refers again to the important role of [[Philips]] in the Eindhoven community.

===Cultural institutions===
There are several cultural institutions in and around the city.

====Museums====
 
*There are two museums dedicated to the major topics of the city's industrial heritage: the [[DAF Museum]] has a collection of DAF cars and the [[Philips Gloeilampenfabriekje anno 1891]] (across the street from the Kempenland) documents the early [[lightbulb]] industry.
*The former district court house now houses the [[Designhuis]], a public podium and interaction area for modern design and innovation.
*The [[Eindhoven Museum]] is an [[archaeological open-air museum]] which focuses on the region's [[Iron Age]] and [[Middle Ages]]. It merged in 2011 with Museum Kempenland which was a regional museum, which documents the history of the [[Kempenland]] region in objects, documents, paint and educational activities. Museum Kempenland's old location, the Steentjeskerk, is closed. 
*The [[Inkijkmuseum]] (the ''Look-In museum''; housed in an old [[linen]] factory in the Dommelstraat) is a small but special museum: it offers ever-changing exhibits, which are to be viewed through the building's windows.
*The [[Van Abbemuseum]] has a collection of modern and [[contemporary art]], including works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Piet Mondriaan|Mondriaan]] and [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]].
* De '''Ontdekfabriek''' (Discovery Factory) children's museum at [[Strijp-S]]

Eindhoven was home to the [[Evoluon]] [[science museum]], sponsored by [[Philips]]. The Evoluon building has evolved into a [[convention center|conference centre]].

====Open-air art====
The Eindhoven [[public space]] contains many forms of artistic expression (a book published by the Eindhoven tourist board records 550 as of 2001 and more have been added since), with high &quot;concentrations&quot; of them in the [[parks]]. The [[Stadswandelpark]] for instance, contains over 30 works of [[modern art]]. There are also several other works of art on permanent display throughout the city, such as ''Flying Pins'' (by [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Coosje van Bruggen]], who considered the location on the southern stretch of the John F. Kennedylaan to be like a [[bowling alley]]) and ''Swing'' (a construct on the Karel de Grotelaan, which morphs into different geometric shapes as you move around it). There are also a number of statues of famous city inhabitants, such as [[Johan Frederik Rudolph van Hooff|Jan van Hooff]] (by [[Auke Hettema]], 1992) and [[Frits Philips]] (by [[Kees Verkade]]) on the Market Square. There is a statue of [[Anton Philips]] in front of the central railway station.
[[File:Piazza Center Eindhoven.jpg|thumbnail|left|Piazza Centre as seen from Demer]]

Eindhoven is also, to some degree, open to forms of impromptu and alternative art. For example, the [[Berenkuil (Eindhoven)|Berenkuil]] is a freezone for [[graffiti]] artists in the city.

=====Light art=====
[[Strijp-S]] is a place for experimentiation with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting, which keeps the historic connection with Philips' past.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/regio/eindhoven/lichtproject-op-strijp-s-pakt-auroralia-award-in-lyon-1.4663520 Lichtproject op Strijp-S pakt Auroralia Award in Lyon]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[light art]] includes the project '''Fakkel''' by Har Hollands. In the underground passage to NatLab artist [[Daan Roosegaarde]] installed his project '''Crystal'''.

Strijp-S is a regular location for the light festival '''[[GLOW Festival Eindhoven|GLOW]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/extra/glow/herbeleef-glow-eindhoven-routes-en-hoogtepunten-door-de-jaren-heen-1.4075747 Herbeleef Glow Eindhoven: Routes en hoogtepunten door de jaren heen]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.ed.nl/extra/glow/licht-zien-voelen-en-zelfs-opslaan-op-glow-next-1.4615697 Licht zien, voelen en zelfs opslaan op Glow Next]', ''Eindhovens Dagblad''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music and theatre====
[[File:Effenaar.jpg|thumb|The Effenaar [[music venue]].]]

The [[Effenaar]] is a [[popular music]] venue and cultural center in Eindhoven, and is located at the Dommelstraat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evenement |url=http://www.effenaar.nl |title=Effenaar |publisher=Effenaar.nl |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Muziekcentrum Frits Philips]] was opened as a stage for classical and popular music in Eindhoven, reviewed by critics as a concert hall with acoustics that rival the best halls in Europe. Before that, Philips sponsored the [[Philips Ontspannings Centrum|POC]].

Parktheater Eindhoven is Eindhoven's stage for opera, cabaret, ballet etc. Opened in 1964, it has received over 250,000 visitors every year. With its 1,000 m2 it has one of the largest stages in the Netherlands. With a major renovation ending in 2007, the new Parktheater will receive an estimated 300,000 visitors a year.

Eindhoven's Plaza Futura is now a cinema featuring cultural movies, lectures and special cultural events.

Especially for students, [[Studium Generale Eindhoven]] organizes &quot;socially, culturally and intellectually formative events&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;StudiumGenerale&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl/sg/ |title=Studium Generale Eindhoven |website=Studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl |accessdate=2017-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722190708/http://www.studiumgenerale-eindhoven.nl/sg/ |archive-date=22 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; From within the student body, two [[Tuna (music)|Tunas]] provide entertainment from time to time at university and city events: [[Tuna Ciudad de Luz]] (''Tuna of the City of Light'') and the ladies tuna [[La Tuniña]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TunaCdL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.tunacl.nl/index.php?id=en |title=Tuna Ciudad de Luz |publisher=Tuna Ciudad de Luz |accessdate=29 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171203/http://w3.tunacl.nl/index.php?id=en |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LaTunina&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stud.tue.nl/~tunina/index%20Engels.html |title=La Tuniña |publisher=La Tuniña |accessdate=29 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171204/http://www.stud.tue.nl/~tunina/index%20Engels.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general music and theatre scene in Eindhoven (in the broadest sense) is supported by a foundation called PopEi.&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popei.nl |title=Home &amp;#124; POPEI |website=Popei.nl |date=2017-02-22 |accessdate=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this foundation is to support artistic groups with facilities, especially rehearsal stages and areas (housed in the old Philips location of [[Strijp-S]]) but also storage facilities. PopEi also provides a working environment for groups (through cafeteria facilities in [[Strijp-S]], so groups can have real working days) and provides some logistical support for organizing events.

===Recreation===
Eindhoven has a lively recreational scene. For going out, there are numerous bars on the [[Market square]], Stratumseind (Stratum's End) which is the largest pub-street in the Netherlands, Dommelstraat, Wilhelmina square and throughout the rest of the city. In addition to the more culturally oriented Plaza Futura, there are three [[movie theatre|cinema]]s in the centre of town (&quot;Servicebioscoop Zien&quot;, &quot;Vue&quot; and [[Pathé|Pathé Eindhoven]], which offers THX sound, IMAX screens and 3D movie viewing).

Eindhoven Centraal is served by both intercity and local services while the smaller station, [[Eindhoven Strijp-S railway station|Eindhoven Strijp-S]] is only served by local trains. Towards 's-Hertogenbosch, Utrecht and Amsterdam trains run every ten minutes, on every day of the week. [[Eindhoven Stadion railway station|Eindhoven Stadion ]] is a small station that serves [[Philips Stadion]] in the event of football matches or other special events at the stadium. It is located 900m west of the [[Eindhoven railway station|main station]].

Up until [[World War II]], a train service connected Amsterdam to [[Liège (city)|Liège]] via Eindhoven and [[Valkenswaard]], but the service was discontinued and the line broken up. Recently, talks have resumed to have a service to [[Neerpelt]], [[Belgium]] via [[Weert]].

The [[A2 motorway (Netherlands)|A2]]/[[European route E25|E25]] motorway from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Luxembourg]] passes Eindhoven to the west and south of the city. The A2 connects to the highway [[A58 motorway (Netherlands)|A58]] to [[Tilburg]] and [[Breda]] just north of the city. Just south of Eindhoven, the A2 connects to the [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] / [[European route E34|E34]] between [[Antwerp]] and [[Duisburg]]. In 2006, the [[List of motorways in the Netherlands|A50]] was completed connecting Eindhoven to [[Nijmegen]] and [[Zwolle]].

The public transport of Eindhoven consists of more than 20 [[Transit bus|city bus]] lines, which also serve neighbouring villages such as [[Veldhoven]], [[Geldrop]] and [[Nuenen]]. Seven of these buslines (400 - 407) are marketed as [[Bus rapid transit|high quality public transport]] and run with 43 electric articulated busses. Two specially built separated busways (HOV1 &amp; HOV2) are used by lines 401 to 406. Line 401 to the airport runs almost completely on separated busways. Apart from the city lines there are some 30 regional and [[Rush hour|rush-hour]] lines.

Like [[Cycling in the Netherlands|all large Dutch cities]], Eindhoven has an extensive network of [[bicycle path]]s. Since 2012, the Eindhoven bicycle path network has incorporated the [[Hovenring]].

==Medical care==
Eindhoven has two hospitals in three locations: the [[Catharina Ziekenhuis|Catharina Hospital]] and the [[Máxima Medisch Centrum]], which has a branch in Woensel-Zuid (the old Diaconessenhuis) and one in [[Veldhoven]] (the old Sint Joseph Hospital). These three have an extensive cooperation and have divided specialties among each other. Emergency medicine, for example, is concentrated in the MMC Veldhoven branch and the Catharina Hospital, the MMC Eindhoven branch has no emergency department. Cardiac procedures are done in the Catharina.

Catharina is also an academic and research hospital and participates in a shared research program with [[Philips Medical]], the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] and the [[Maastricht University]] into [[biomedical science]], [[biomedical technology|technology]] and [[biomedical engineering|engineering]].
