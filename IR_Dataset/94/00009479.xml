{{infobox einsteinium}}
'''Einsteinium''' is a [[synthetic element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Es''' and [[atomic number]] 99. As a member of the [[actinide]] series, it is the seventh [[transuranic element]].

Einsteinium was discovered as a component of the debris of the [[Ivy Mike|first hydrogen bomb]] explosion in 1952, and named after [[Albert Einstein]]. Its most common [[isotope]] einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of [[californium]]-253 in a few dedicated high-power [[nuclear reactor]]s with a total yield on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but in much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element [[mendelevium]] in 1955.

Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]]. Its chemistry is typical of the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 [[oxidation state]]; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 [[watt]]s per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to [[berkelium]]-249 and then [[californium]]-249 at a rate of about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://periodic.lanl.gov/99.shtml Einsteinium]. periodic.lanl.gov&lt;/ref&gt; Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.&lt;ref name=h1579/&gt;

Like all synthetic [[transuranic element]]s, isotopes of einsteinium are very [[radioactivity|radioactive]] and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|left|Einsteinium was first observed in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
Einsteinium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first identified]] in December 1952 by [[Albert Ghiorso]] and co-workers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in collaboration with the [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]] and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] National Laboratories, in the fallout from the ''[[Ivy Mike]]'' nuclear test. The test was carried out on November 1, 1952, at [[Enewetak Atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] and was the first successful test of a [[hydrogen bomb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghiorso&quot;/&gt; Initial examination of the debris from the explosion had shown the production of a new isotope of [[plutonium]], {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}, which could only have formed by the absorption of six [[neutron]]s by a [[uranium-238]] nucleus followed by two [[beta decay]]s.
:&lt;chem&gt;^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{+ 6(n,\gamma)}][-2\ \beta^-]{} ^{244}_{94}Pu&lt;/chem&gt;
At the time, the multiple neutron absorption was thought to be an extremely rare process, but the identification of {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}} indicated that still more neutrons could have been captured by the uranium nuclei, thereby producing new elements heavier than [[californium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghiorso&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first = Albert|last = Ghiorso|authorlink = Albert Ghiorso|date = 2003 |title = Einsteinium and Fermium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/einsteiniumfermium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36|doi = 10.1021/cen-v081n036.p174|pages = 174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Ghiorso ca 1970.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The element was discovered by a team headed by [[Albert Ghiorso]].]]
Ghiorso and co-workers analyzed filter papers which had been flown through the explosion cloud on airplanes (the same sampling technique that had been used to discover {{nuclide|Pu|Z=94|A=244}}).&lt;ref name=s39&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, which were delivered to the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghiorso&quot;/&gt; The separation of suspected new elements was carried out in the presence of a [[citric acid]]/[[ammonium]] [[buffer solution]] in a weakly acidic medium ([[pH]] ≈ 3.5), using [[ion exchange]] at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end.&lt;ref name=em&gt;John Emsley [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA133 Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements], Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-19-850340-7}} pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, element 99 (einsteinium), namely its &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy [[alpha decay]] at 6.6&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ghiorso&quot;/&gt; It was produced by the [[neutron capture|capture]] of 15 [[neutron]]s by [[uranium-238]] nuclei followed by seven beta-decays, and had a [[half-life]] of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the [[mass number]] without changing the [[atomic number]] of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghiorso&quot;/&gt;

^{238}_{92}U -&gt;[\ce{+15n}][6 \beta^-] ^{253}_{98}Cf -&gt;[\beta^-] ^{253}_{99}Es
&lt;/chem&gt;

Some &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U atoms, however, could absorb two additional neutrons (for a total of 17), resulting in &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es, as well as in the &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Fm isotope of another new element, [[fermium]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es, &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Fm and &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Fm would not be produced because of lack of beta decay in &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf and &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the new elements and the associated new data on multiple neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;military until 1955 due to [[Cold War]] tensions and competition with Soviet Union in nuclear technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghiorso&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ES_FM&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Ghiorso|first1 = A.|last2 = Thompson|first2 = S.|last3 = Higgins|first3 = G.|last4 = Seaborg|first4 = G.|last5 = Studier|first5 = M.|last6 = Fields|first6 = P.|last7 = Fried|first7 = S.|last8 = Diamond|first8 = H.|last9 = Mech|first9 = J.|first10 = G. |last10 = Pyle

Meanwhile, isotopes of element 99 (as well as of new element 100, [[fermium]]) were produced in the Berkeley and Argonne laboratories, in a [[nuclear fusion|nuclear reaction]] between [[nitrogen]]-14 and uranium-238,&lt;ref name = &quot;PhysRev.93.257&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Physical Review| volume = 93|issue = 1| date = 1954|title = Reactions of U-238 with Cyclotron-Produced Nitrogen Ions| author = Ghiorso, Albert| author2 = Rossi, G.

In their discovery of the elements 99 and 100, the American teams had competed with a group at the [[Nobel Institute for Physics]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. In late 1953 – early 1954, the Swedish group succeeded in the synthesis of light isotopes of element 100, in particular &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Fm, by bombarding uranium with oxygen nuclei. These results were also published in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atterling|first1=Hugo|last2=Forsling|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Holm|first3=Lennart|last4=Melander|first4=Lars|last5=Åström|first5=Björn|title=Element 100 Produced by Means of Cyclotron-Accelerated Oxygen Ions|journal=Physical Review|volume=95|pages=585–586|date=1954|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.95.585.2|issue=2|bibcode = 1954PhRv...95..585A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the priority of the Berkeley team was generally recognized, as its publications preceded the Swedish article, and they were based on the previously undisclosed results of the 1952 thermonuclear explosion; thus the Berkeley team was given the privilege to name the new elements. As the effort which had led to the design of ''Ivy Mike'' was codenamed Project PANDA,&lt;ref name=&quot;underthecloud&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Under the cloud: the decades of nuclear testing |author=Richard Lee Miller |page=115 |isbn=978-1-881043-05-8 |publisher=Two-Sixty Press |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; element 99 had been jokingly nicknamed &quot;Pandamonium&quot;&lt;!-- sic: /not/ pandemonium --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcphee&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curve of Binding Energy |author=John McPhee |author-link=John McPhee |page=116 |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux Inc. |isbn=978-0-374-51598-0 |date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the official names suggested by the Berkeley group derived from two prominent scientists, [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]: &quot;We suggest for the name for the element with the atomic number 99, einsteinium (symbol E) after Albert Einstein and for the name for the element with atomic number 100, fermium (symbol Fm), after Enrico Fermi.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ES_FM &quot;/&gt; Both Einstein and Fermi died between the time the names were originally proposed and when they were announced.

Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, radioactive metal. In the [[periodic table]], it is located to the right of the actinide [[californium]], to the left of the actinide [[fermium]] and below the lanthanide [[holmium]] with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is lower than that of californium (15.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860&amp;nbsp;°C) is also relatively low – below [[californium]] (900&amp;nbsp;°C), [[fermium]] (1527&amp;nbsp;°C) and holmium (1461&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C.

Contrary to the lighter actinides [[californium]], [[berkelium]], [[curium]] and [[americium]] which crystallize in a double [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] structure at ambient conditions, einsteinium is believed to have a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] (''fcc'') symmetry with the space group ''Fm''{{overline|3}}''m'' and the lattice constant ''a'' = 575 pm. However, there is a report of room-temperature hexagonal einsteinium metal with ''a'' = 398 pm and ''c'' = 650 pm, which converted to the ''fcc'' phase upon heating to 300&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=ev/&gt;

The self-damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice,&lt;ref name=g1268/&gt; and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es, induces a visible glow.&lt;ref name=h1579&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1579&lt;/ref&gt; These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium.&lt;ref Name=&quot;ES_METALL&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haire|first1=R.

Apart from the self-destruction of solid einsteinium and its compounds, other intrinsic difficulties in studying this element include scarcity – the most common &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope is available only once or twice a year in sub-milligram amounts – and self-contamination due to rapid conversion of einsteinium to berkelium and then to californium at a rate of about 3.3% per day:&lt;ref name=&quot;ES_F3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref Name=&quot;ES2O3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=s55&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/chem&gt;

Thus, most einsteinium samples are contaminated, and their intrinsic properties are often deduced by extrapolating back experimental data accumulated over time. Other experimental techniques to circumvent the contamination problem include selective optical excitation of einsteinium ions by a tunable laser, such as in studying its luminescence properties.&lt;ref name=s76&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic properties have been studied for einsteinium metal, its oxide and fluoride.

===Chemical===
Like all actinides, einsteinium is rather reactive. Its trivalent [[oxidation state]] is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induces a pale pink color.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOWI_1956&quot;&gt;[[#Holleman|Holleman]], p. 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in the solid phase; such +2 state is not observed in many other actinides, including [[protactinium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]], plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with [[samarium(II) chloride]].&lt;ref name=s53&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.&lt;ref name=h1578&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1578&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of einsteinium}}
Nineteen [[nuclide]]s and three [[nuclear isomer]]s are known for einsteinium, with [[mass number]]s ranging from 240 to 257. All are radioactive and the most stable nuclide, &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Es, has a half-life of 471.7 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmad|first1=I.|title=Half-life of the longest-lived einsteinium isotope-252Es|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=39|pages=1509–1511|date=1977|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(77)80089-4|issue=9|last2=Wagner|first2=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next most stable isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es (half-life 275.7 days),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McHarris|first1=William|last2=Stephens|first2=F.|last3=Asaro|first3=F.|last4=Perlman|first4=I.|title=Decay Scheme of Einsteinium-254|journal=Physical Review|volume=144|pages=1031–1045|date=1966|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.144.1031|issue=3|bibcode = 1966PhRv..144.1031M }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es (39.8 days), and &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es (20.47 days). All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, and most of them decay within less than 30 minutes. Of the three nuclear isomers, the most stable is &lt;sup&gt;254m&lt;/sup&gt;Es with a half-life of 39.3 hours.{{NUBASE2016|ref}}

===Nuclear fission===
Einsteinium has a high rate of [[nuclear fission]] that results in a low [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30-centimeter-thick steel [[neutron reflector]], or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20-cm-thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es isotope.&lt;ref name=&quot;irsn&quot;&gt;Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire, [https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/20131018_trm_evaluation.pdf &quot;Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety data and limits for actinides in transport&quot;], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural occurrence===
Because of the short half-life of all isotopes of einsteinium, any [[Primordial nuclide|primordial]] einsteinium — that is, einsteinium that could possibly have been present on the Earth during its formation — has long since decayed. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally-occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], and is present only within a few years from the time of the synthesis.&lt;ref name=em/&gt; The [[transuranic element]]s from [[americium]] to [[fermium]], including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] at [[Oklo]], but no longer do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;emsley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einsteinium was observed in [[Przybylski's Star]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3103/S0884591308020049 | volume=24 |issue = 2| title=Identification of absorption lines of short half-life actinides in the spectrum of Przybylski's star (HD 101065) | journal=Kinematics and Physics of Celestial Bodies | pages=89–98| bibcode=2008KPCB...24...89G |year = 2008|last1 = Gopka|first1 = V.

Einsteinium is produced in minute quantities by bombarding lighter actinides with neutrons in dedicated high-flux [[nuclear reactor]]s. The world's major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt [[High Flux Isotope Reactor]] (HFIR) at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in Tennessee, U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = High Flux Isotope Reactor|url = http://neutrons.ornl.gov/facilities/HFIR/|publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory|accessdate = 2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the SM-2 loop reactor at the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] (NIIAR) in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Радионуклидные источники и препараты|url = http://www.niiar.ru/?q=radioisotope_application|publisher = Research Institute of Atomic Reactors|accessdate = 2010-09-26|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium (''Z''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 96) elements. These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements,&lt;ref name=h1582&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1582&lt;/ref&gt; although the quantities produced at NIIAR are not widely reported. In a &quot;typical processing campaign&quot; at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of [[curium]] are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of [[californium]], milligram quantities of berkelium (&lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk) and einsteinium and picogram quantities of [[fermium]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 1262&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = C.

The first microscopic sample of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es sample weighing about 10 [[nanogram]]s was prepared in 1961 at HFIR. A special magnetic balance was designed to estimate its weight.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Darleane C.; Ghiorso, Albert and Seaborg, Glenn Theodore (2000) ''The Transuranium People: The Inside Story'', Imperial College Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;190–191, {{ISBN|978-1-86094-087-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger batches were produced later starting from several kilograms of plutonium with the einsteinium yields (mostly &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es) of 0.48 milligrams in 1967–1970, 3.2 milligrams in 1971–1973, followed by steady production of about 3 milligrams per year between 1974 and 1978.&lt;ref name=s36&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; These quantities however refer to the integral amount in the target right after irradiation. Subsequent separation procedures reduced the amount of isotopically pure einsteinium roughly tenfold.&lt;ref name=h1582/&gt;

===Laboratory synthesis===
Heavy neutron irradiation of plutonium results in four major isotopes of einsteinium: &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es (α-emitter with half-life of 20.47 days and with a spontaneous fission half-life of 7×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years); &lt;sup&gt;254''m''&lt;/sup&gt;Es (β-emitter with half-life of 39.3 hours), &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es (α-emitter with half-life of about 276 days) and &lt;sup&gt;255&lt;/sup&gt;Es (β-emitter with half-life of 39.8 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=M.|last2=Schuman|first2=R.|last3=Butler|first3=J.|last4=Cowper|first4=G.|last5=Eastwood|first5=T.|last6=Jackson|first6=H.|title=Isotopes of Einsteinium and Fermium Produced by Neutron Irradiation of Plutonium|journal=Physical Review|volume=102|issue=1|pages=203–207|date=1956|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.203|bibcode = 1956PhRv..102..203J }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{NUBASE2016|ref}} An alternative route involves bombardment of uranium-238 with high-intensity nitrogen or oxygen ion beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guseva|first1=L.|last2=Filippova|first2=K.|last3=Gerlit|first3=Y.|last4=Druin|first4=V.|last5=Myasoedov|first5=B.|last6=Tarantin|first6=N.|title=Experiments on the production of einsteinium and fermium with a cyclotron|journal=Journal of Nuclear Energy (1954)|volume=3|pages=341–346|date=1956|doi=10.1016/0891-3919(56)90064-X|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einsteinium-247 (half-life 4.55 minutes) was produced by irradiating americium-241 with carbon or uranium-238 with nitrogen ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binder&quot;&gt;Harry H.

===Synthesis in nuclear explosions===
[[File:ActinideExplosionSynthesis.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Estimated yield of transuranium elements in the U.S. nuclear tests Hutch and Cyclamen.&lt;ref name=s40/&gt;]]
The analysis of the debris at the 10-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test was a part of long-term project. One of the goals of which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was that synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the [[neutron flux]], and nuclear explosions are the most powerful man-made neutron sources, providing densities of the order 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within a microsecond, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5{{e|15}} neutrons/(cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at [[Enewetak Atoll]] for preliminary analysis of debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the mainland U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than fermium, none of these were found even after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.&lt;ref name=s39/&gt;

The atmospheric results were supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the [[Nevada National Security Site|Nevada Test Site]], as it was hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and [[thorium]] have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.&lt;ref name=s39/&gt;&lt;ref name=s40&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the nine underground tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969,&lt;ref&gt;These were codenamed: &quot;Anacostia&quot; (5.2 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons]], 1962), &quot;Kennebec&quot; (&lt;5 kilotons, 1963), &quot;Par&quot; (38 kilotons, 1964), &quot;Barbel&quot; (&lt;20 kilotons, 1964), &quot;Tweed&quot; (&lt;20 kilotons, 1965), &quot;Cyclamen&quot; (13 kilotons, 1966), &quot;Kankakee&quot; (20-200 kilotons, 1966), &quot;Vulcan&quot; (25 kilotons, 1966) and &quot;Hutch&quot; (20-200 kilotons, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf United States Nuclear Tests July 1945 through September 1992] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615000000/http://www.nv.doe.gov/library/publications/historical/DOENV_209_REV15.pdf |date=June 15, 2010 }}, DOE/NV--209-REV 15, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the last one was the most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond.&lt;ref name=s40/&gt; However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4{{e|-14}} of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1{{e|-7}} of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4&amp;nbsp;kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock.&lt;ref name=s43&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.&lt;ref name=s44&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no new elements (apart from einsteinium and fermium) could be detected in the nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.&lt;!-- About 6{{e|9}} atoms of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm could be recovered after the Hutch detonation. These were then used in the studies of thermal-neutron induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Fm, and in discovery of a new fermium isotope. &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Fm. Also, the rare &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm isotope was synthesized in large quantities, which would have been otherwise very difficult to produce in nuclear reactors from its progenitor &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm – the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (64 minutes) is much too short for months-long reactor irradiations, but is very &quot;long&quot; on the timescale of an explosion.--&gt;&lt;ref name=s47&gt;[[#Seaborg|Seaborg]], p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation===
[[File:Elutionskurven Fm Es Cf Bk Cm Am.png|thumb|[[Elution]] curves: chromatographic separation of Fm(100), Es(99), Cf, Bk, Cm and Am]]
Separation procedure of einsteinium depends on the synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target is attached to a thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low.&lt;ref name=h1583&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1583&lt;/ref&gt; The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.&lt;ref name=h1584&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], pp. 1584–1585&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of trivalent actinides from lanthanide fission products can be done by a cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) as [[eluant]]. It is usually followed by [[anion-exchange chromatography]] using 6 [[molar concentration|molar]] HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is then used to separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&amp;pg=PA11|pages=9–11|title=The new chemistry|author=Hall, Nina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|isbn=978-0-521-45224-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of the 3+ actinides can also be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.&lt;ref name=book2/&gt;

===Preparation of the metal===
Einsteinium is highly reactive and therefore strong reducing agents are required to obtain the pure metal from its compounds.&lt;ref name=h1588&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1588&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved by reduction of einsteinium(III) fluoride with metallic [[lithium]]:
:EsF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Li → Es + 3 LiF

However, owing to its low melting point and high rate of self-radiation damage, einsteinium has high vapor pressure, which is higher than that of lithium fluoride. This makes this reduction reaction rather inefficient. It was tried in the early preparation attempts and quickly abandoned in favor of reduction of einsteinium(III) oxide with [[lanthanum]] metal:&lt;ref name=ev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haire|first1=R.|title=Preparation, properties, and some recent studies of the actinide metals|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=5235830|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(86)90554-0|date=1986|pages=379–398|volume=121|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ES_METALL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=h1590&gt;[[#Haire|Haire]], p. 1590&lt;/ref&gt;

Einsteinium(III) chloride (EsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be prepared by annealing einsteinium(III) oxide in the atmosphere of dry hydrogen chloride vapors at about 500&amp;nbsp;°C for some 20 minutes. It crystallizes upon cooling at about 425&amp;nbsp;°C into an orange solid with a [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] structure of [[uranium(III) chloride|UCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; type]], where einsteinium atoms are 9-fold coordinated by chlorine atoms in a tricapped trigonal prism geometry.&lt;ref name=m99&gt;Miasoedov, B.

===Organoeinsteinium compounds===
The high radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in [[radiation therapy]], and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium [[citrate]] (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs.&lt;ref name=h1579/&gt; Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone [[Chelation|chelate]] complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited [[luminescence]] among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nugent|first1=Leonard J.|last2=Burnett|first2=J. L.|last3=Baybarz|first3=R.

Luminescence of Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions was however observed in inorganic hydrochloric acid solutions as well as in organic solution with di(2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid. It shows a broad peak at about 1064 nanometers (half-width about 100&amp;nbsp;nm) which can be resonantly excited by green light (ca. 495&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength). The luminescence has a lifetime of several microseconds and the quantum yield below 0.1%. The relatively high, compared to lanthanides, non-radiative decay rates in Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; were associated with the stronger interaction of f-electrons with the inner Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; electrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beitz|first1=J.|last2=Wester|first2=D.|last3=Williams|first3=C.|title=5f state interaction with inner coordination sphere ligands: Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion fluorescence in aqueous and organic phases|journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=93|pages=331–338|date=1983|doi=10.1016/0022-5088(83)90178-9|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
There is almost no use for any isotope of einsteinium outside basic scientific research aiming at production of higher [[transuranic elements]] and [[transactinides]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele099.html It's Elemental – The Element Einsteinium]. Retrieved 2 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, [[mendelevium]] was synthesized by irradiating a target consisting of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; atoms of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es in the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley Laboratory. The resulting &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es(α,n)&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md reaction yielded 17 atoms of the new element with the atomic number of 101.&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.98.1518|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e53sNAOXrdMC&amp;pg=PA101|isbn=978-981-02-1440-1|title=New Element Mendelevium, Atomic Number 101|date=1955|last1=Ghiorso|first1=A.|last2=Harvey|first2=B.|last3=Choppin|first3=G.|last4=Thompson|first4=S.|last5=Seaborg|first5=G.|journal=Physical Review|volume=98|pages=1518–1519|issue=5|bibcode = 1955PhRv...98.1518G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rare isotope [[einsteinium-254]] is favored for production of [[superheavy element|ultraheavy elements]] because of its large mass, relatively long half-life of 270 days, and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schadel|first1=M.|last2=Bruchle|first2=W.|last3=Brugger|first3=M.|last4=Gaggeler |first4=H.|last5=Moody|first5=K.|last6=Schardt|first6=D.|last7=Summerer|first7=K.|last8=Hulet|first8=E.|last9=Dougan|first9=A.|first10=R. |last10=Dougan|first11=J. |last11=Landrum|first12=R. |last12=Lougheed|first13=J. |last13=Wild|first14=G. |last14=O'Kelley|first15=R. |last15=Hahn

Einsteinium-254 was used as the calibration marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer (&quot;[[Surveyor 5#Alpha-scattering surface analyzer|alpha-scattering surface analyzer]]&quot;) of the [[Surveyor 5]] lunar probe.

==Safety==
Most of the available einsteinium toxicity data originates from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and is similar to that of plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=International Commission on Radiological Protection|title=Limits for intakes of radionuclides by workers, Part 4|issue=4|volume=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTxcCV4w0VEC&amp;pg=PA18|isbn=978-0-08-036886-3|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|date=1988|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
