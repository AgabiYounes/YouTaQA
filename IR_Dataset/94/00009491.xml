'''Eskimo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|k|ɪ|m|oʊ}} {{respell|ESS|kih|moh}}) or '''Eskimos''' are the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[circumpolar peoples]] who have traditionally inhabited the northern circumpolar region from eastern [[Siberia]] (Russia) to [[Alaska]] (of the United States), [[Canada]], and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stern2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Pamela R.

A third northern group, the [[Aleut]], is closely related to both. They share a relatively recent common ancestor and a language group ([[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]). The [[Chukcha| Chukchi]] People, from Siberia, are also the closest living relatives of Inuit, and Yupik people.

The non-Inuit sub-branch of the Eskimo branch of the Eskimo-Aleut language family consists of four distinct [[Yupik languages]], two used in the [[Russian Far East]] and [[St. Lawrence Island]], and two used in western Alaska, southwestern Alaska, and the western part of [[Southcentral Alaska]]. The extinct language of the [[Sirenik]] people is sometimes argued to be related to these.

The lingual origin of &quot;Eskimo&quot; comes from the Montagnais word for &quot;snowshoe-netter&quot; according to scholars at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403110006/http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxeskimo.html|title=AUE: FAQ excerpt: &quot;Eskimo&quot;|date=2012-04-03|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xd7ka4/the-little-known-history-of-how-the-canadian-government-made-inuit-wear-eskimo-tags|title=The Little-Known History of How the Canadian Government Made Inuit Wear 'Eskimo Tags'|first=Natasha|last=MacDonald-Dupuis|date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Greenland{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} have ceased using it in official documents.

Several earlier indigenous peoples existed in the northern circumpolar regions of eastern Siberia, Alaska, and Canada (although probably not in Greenland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natmus.dk/sw18632.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419200203/http://www.natmus.dk/sw18632.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 19, 2011|title=- Saqqaq|date=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The earliest positively identified [[Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures ([[Early Paleo-Eskimo]]) date to 5,000 years ago.They appear to have developed in Alaska from people related to the [[Arctic small tool tradition]] in eastern Asia, whose ancestors had probably migrated to Alaska at least 3,000 to 5,000 years earlier. Similar artifacts have been found in Siberia that date to perhaps 18,000 years ago.

The Yupik languages and cultures in Alaska evolved in place, beginning with the original [[pre-Dorset]] indigenous culture developed in Alaska. Approximately 4000 years ago, the Unangan culture of the [[Aleut]] became distinct. It is not generally considered an Eskimo culture.

Approximately 1,500–2,000 years ago, apparently in northwestern Alaska, two other distinct variations appeared. Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across northern Alaska, through Canada and into Greenland. The distinct culture of the [[Thule people]] developed in northwestern Alaska and very quickly spread over the entire area occupied by Eskimo people, though it was not necessarily adopted by all of them.

===Origin===
{{Further|Native American name controversy}}

The most commonly accepted etymological origin of the word &quot;Eskimo&quot; is derived by [[Ives Goddard]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], from the Montagnais (see [[Algonquian languages]]) word meaning &quot;snowshoe-netter&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aueo&quot;/&gt; or &quot;to net snowshoes&quot;.&lt;ref name=anlc /&gt; The word ''assime·w'' means &quot;she laces a snowshoe&quot; in Montagnais.

In 1978, Jose Mailhot, a Quebec anthropologist who speaks Montagnais, published a paper suggesting that Eskimo meant &quot;people who speak a different language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mailhot1&quot;&gt;Mailhot, J.

One of the first printed uses of the French word 'Esquimaux' comes from [[Samuel Hearne]]'s ''A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in the Years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772'' first published in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38404/38404-h/38404-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of A Journey from Prince of Wales's Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean, by Samuel Hearne.|website=www.gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada and Greenland, the term ''Eskimo'' has largely been supplanted by the term ''Inuit''.&lt;ref name=anlc /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stern1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ostg1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ahdinuit&quot;&gt;Usage note, [https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Inuit &quot;Inuit&quot;,] ''American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'': Fourth Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Inuit'' can be accurately applied to all of the Eskimo peoples in Canada and Greenland, that is not true in Alaska and Siberia. In Alaska the term ''Eskimo'' is commonly used, because it includes both Yupik and Iñupiat. ''Inuit'' is not accepted as a collective term and it is not used specifically for Iñupiat (although they are related to the Canadian Inuit peoples).&lt;ref name=anlc/&gt; 

In 1977, the [[Inuit Circumpolar Council|Inuit Circumpolar Conference]] (ICC) meeting in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]], officially adopted Inuit as a designation for all circumpolar native peoples, regardless of their local view on an appropriate term. As a result, the Canadian government usage has replaced the (locally) defunct term Eskimo with ''Inuit'' (''Inuk'' in singular). The preferred term in Canada's Central Arctic is ''Inuinnaq'',&lt;ref name=translate&gt;{{cite book|last=Ohokak|first=G.|author2=M. Kadlun |author3=B. Harnum |title=Inuinnaqtun-English Dictionary|publisher=Kitikmeot Heritage Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the eastern Canadian Arctic ''Inuit''. The language is often called ''[[Inuktitut]]'', though other local designations are also used. Despite the ICC's 1977 decision to adopt the term ''Inuit'', this was never accepted by the Yupik peoples, who likened it to calling all [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Indians ''[[Navajo]]'' simply because the Navajo felt that that's what all tribes should be called.

The [[Greenlandic Inuit|Inuit of Greenland]] refer to themselves as &quot;Greenlanders&quot; and speak the [[Greenlandic language]].&lt;ref name=ethno&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal &quot;Inuktitut, Greenlandic&quot;.] ''Ethnologue''. Retrieved 6 Aug 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the linguistic, ethnic, and cultural differences between Yupik and Inuit peoples, it seems unlikely that any umbrella term will be acceptable. There has been some movement to use ''Inuit'', and the [[Inuit Circumpolar Council]], representing a circumpolar population of 150,000 Inuit and Yupik people of Greenland, Northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia, in its charter defines ''Inuit'' for use within that ICC document as including &quot;the Inupiat, Yupik (Alaska), Inuit, [[Inuvialuit]] (Canada), [[Kalaallit]] (Greenland) and Yupik (Russia)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICCcharter&quot;&gt;Inuit Circumpolar Council.

In 2010, the ICC passed a resolution in which they implored scientists to use &quot;Inuit&quot; and &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot; instead of &quot;Eskimo&quot; or &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICC2010-01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Inuit Circumpolar Council|title=On the use of the term Inuit in scientific and other circles|type=Resolution 2010-01|url=https://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iccexcouncilresolutiononterminuit.pdf|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; American linguist [[Lenore Grenoble]] has explicitly deferred to this resolution and used &quot;Inuit–Yupik&quot; instead of &quot;Eskimo&quot; with regards to the language branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grenoble, 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grenoble|first1=Lenore A.|editor1-last=Day|editor1-first=Delyn|editor2-last=Rewi|editor2-first=Poia|editor3-last=Higgins|editor3-first=Rawinia|title=The Journeys of Besieged Languages|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars|isbn=978-1-4438-9943-7|page=284|chapter=Kalaallisut: The Language of Greenland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 commentary in the journal ''[[Arctic (journal)|Arctic]]'', Canadian archaeologist Max Friesen argued fellow Arctic archaeologists should follow the ICC and use &quot;Paleo-Inuit&quot; instead of &quot;Paleo-Eskimo&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friesen, 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friesen|first1=T.

But, in Alaska, the Inuit people refer to themselves as ''Iñupiat,'' plural, and ''Iñupiaq'', singular (their [[Inupiaq language|North Alaskan Inupiatun language]] is also called ''Iñupiaq''). They do not commonly use the term Inuit. In Alaska, ''Eskimo'' is in common usage.&lt;ref name=anlc /&gt;

Alaskans also use the term [[Alaska Natives|Alaska Native]], which is inclusive of all Eskimo, Aleut and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of Alaska. It does not apply to Inuit or Yupik people originating outside the state. The term ''Alaska Native'' has important legal usage in Alaska and the rest of the United States as a result of the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] of 1971.

The term &quot;Eskimo&quot; is also used in linguistic or ethnographic works to denote the larger branch of Eskimo–Aleut languages, the smaller branch being Aleut.

The [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] family of languages includes two cognate branches: the [[Aleut language|Aleut]] (Unangan) branch and the Eskimo branch.

The number of [[Grammatical case|cases]] varies, with Aleut languages having a greatly reduced case system compared to those of the Eskimo subfamily. Eskimo–Aleut languages possess voiceless plosives at the [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]] and [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] positions in all languages except Aleut, which has lost the bilabial stops but retained the [[Nasal consonant|nasal]]. In the Eskimo subfamily a voiceless [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] [[Fricative consonant|fricative]] is also present.

The Eskimo sub-family consists of the [[Inuit languages|Inuit language]] and Yupik language sub-groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;FortecueM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Comparative Eskimo Dictionary with Aleut Cognates | author = Michael Fortescue|author2=Steven Jacobson |author3=Lawance Kaplan | publisher = [[Alaska Native Language Center]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sirenik Eskimo language|Sirenikski language]], which is virtually extinct, is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Eskimo language family. Other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;FortecueM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;&gt;Kaplan, Lawrence. (2001-12-10). [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/resources/yupik-inuit/ &quot;Comparative Yupik and Inuit&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516200017/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/resources/yupik-inuit/ |date=2015-05-16 }}.

Inuit languages comprise a [[dialect continuum]], or dialect chain, that stretches from [[Unalakleet, Alaska|Unalakleet]] and [[Norton Sound]] in Alaska, across northern Alaska and Canada, and east to Greenland. Changes from western (Iñupiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., ''kumlu'', meaning &quot;thumb&quot;, changes to ''kuvlu'', changes to ''kublu'',&lt;ref name=livingdict/&gt; changes to ''kulluk'',&lt;ref name=livingdict/&gt; changes to ''kulluq''&lt;ref name=livingdict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?language=en&amp;searchString=thumb&amp;languageSet=all |title=thumb|work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to understand one another, but speakers from dialects distant from each other on the dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt; [[Seward Peninsula]] dialects in western Alaska, where much of the [[Iñupiat]] culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages. [[Tunumiit dialect|Eastern Greenlandic]], at the opposite end of the Inuit range, has had significant word replacement due to a unique form of ritual name avoidance.&lt;ref name=&quot;FortecueM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt;

The four [[Yupik languages]], by contrast, including [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]] (Sugpiaq), [[Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]], [[Naukan Yupik language|Naukan]] (Naukanski), and [[Central Siberian Yupik language|Siberian Yupik]], are distinct languages with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences. They demonstrate limited mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;FortecueM&quot;/&gt; Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup'ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages – Siberian Yupik and Naukan Yupik – are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, which is the southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically. Differences of vocabulary between Inuit and any one of the Yupik languages are greater than between any two Yupik languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt; Even the dialectal differences within Alutiiq and Central Alaskan Yup'ik sometimes are relatively great for locations that are relatively close geographically.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt;

The Sirenikski language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of the Eskimo language family, but other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the [[Innu]], a First Nations people in eastern Quebec and Labrador.}}
The Inuit inhabit the [[Arctic]] and northern [[Bering Sea]] coasts of Alaska in the United States, and Arctic coasts of the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[Quebec]], and [[Labrador]] in Canada, and Greenland (associated with Denmark). Until fairly recent times, there has been a remarkable homogeneity in the culture throughout this area, which traditionally relied on fish, [[marine mammal]]s, and land animals for food, heat, light, clothing, and tools. They maintain a unique [[Inuit culture]].

===Greenland's Inuit===
{{Main|Greenlandic Inuit}}
[[Greenlandic Inuit]] make up 90% of Greenland's population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html &quot;Greenland&quot;.] ''CIA World Factbook''. Accessed 14 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; They belong to three major groups:
* [[Kalaallit]] of west Greenland, who speak [[Kalaallisut]]
* [[Tunumiit]] of east Greenland, who speak [[Tunumiit dialect|Tunumiisut]]
* [[Inughuit]] of north Greenland, who speak [[Inuktun]] or Polar Eskimo.&lt;ref name=&quot;ethno&quot;/&gt;

===Inuit of Canada's Eastern Arctic===
{{Main|Inuit}}
Canadian Inuit live primarily in [[Nunavut]] (a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territory of Canada]]), [[Nunavik]] (the northern part of [[Quebec]]) and in [[Nunatsiavut]] (the Inuit settlement region in [[Labrador]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Inuvialuit of Canada's Western Arctic===
[[File:Inupiat Family from Noatak, Alaska, 1929, Edward S. Curtis (restored).jpg|thumb|An [[Iñupiat]] family from [[Noatak, Alaska]], 1929]]
{{Main|Inuvialuit}}
The Inuvialuit live in the western [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] region. Their homeland – the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]] – covers the [[Arctic Ocean]] coastline area from the Alaskan border east to [[Amundsen Gulf]] and includes the western [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Islands]]. The land was demarked in 1984 by the Inuvialuit Final Agreement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Alaska's Iñupiat===
{{Main|Iñupiat}}
The Iñupiat are the Inuit of Alaska's [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic]] and [[North Slope Borough, Alaska|North Slope]] boroughs and the [[Bering Strait]]s region, including the Seward Peninsula. [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]], the northernmost city in the United States, is above the [[Arctic Circle]] and in the Iñupiat region. Their language is known as [[Inupiaq language|Iñupiaq]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Yupik==
[[File:AlutiiqDancer.jpg|thumb|[[Alutiiq]] dancer during the biennial &quot;Celebration&quot; cultural event]]
{{Main| Yupik peoples}}
The Yupik are indigenous or aboriginal peoples who live along the coast of western Alaska, especially on the [[Yukon River|Yukon]]-[[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]] delta and along the Kuskokwim River ([[Yup'ik|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]]); in southern Alaska (the [[Alutiiq]]); and along the eastern coast of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] in the Russian Far East and [[St. Lawrence Island]] in western Alaska (the [[Siberian Yupik]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The Yupik economy has traditionally been strongly dominated by the harvest of [[marine mammal]]s, especially [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and [[whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Yupik&quot;. (2008). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved January 13, 2008, from: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/655025/Yupik Encyclopædia Britannica Online] Retrieved August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alutiiq===
{{Main|Alutiiq}}
The Alutiiq, also called ''Pacific Yupik'' or ''Sugpiaq'', are a southern, coastal branch of Yupik.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} They are not to be confused with the Aleut, who live further to the southwest, including along the [[Aleutian Islands]]. They traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources such as [[salmon]], [[halibut]], and whales, as well as rich land resources such as berries and land mammals.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Alutiiq people today live in coastal fishing communities, where they work in all aspects of the modern economy. They also maintain the cultural value of a subsistence lifestyle.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the Yupik in the [[Bethel, Alaska]] area. But, it is considered a distinct language with two major dialects: the Koniag dialect, spoken on the [[Alaska Peninsula]] and on [[Kodiak Island]], and the Chugach dialect, spoken on the southern [[Kenai Peninsula]] and in [[Prince William Sound]]. Residents of [[Nanwalek, Alaska|Nanwalek]], located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near [[Seldovia, Alaska|Seldovia]], speak what they call Sugpiaq. They are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the hundreds, Alutiiq communities are working to revitalize their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alutiiqmuseum.org/learn/the-alutiiq-sugpiaq-people/language/906-language-loss-revitalization|title=Language Loss &amp; Revitalization|website=alutiiqmuseum.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Alaskan Yup'ik===
{{Main|Yup'ik}}
''Yup'ik'', with an apostrophe, denotes the speakers of the Central Alaskan [[Yup'ik language]], who live in western Alaska and southwestern Alaska from southern [[Norton Sound]] to the north side of [[Bristol Bay]], on the [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], and on [[Nelson Island (Alaska)|Nelson Island]]. The use of the apostrophe in the name ''Yup'ik'' is a written convention to denote the long pronunciation of the ''p'' sound; but it is spoken the same in other [[Yupik languages]]. Of all the [[Alaska Native languages]], Central Alaskan Yup'ik has the most speakers, with about 10,000 of a total Yup'ik population of 21,000 still speaking the language. The five dialects of Central Alaskan Yup'ik include General Central Yup'ik, and the Egegik, Norton Sound, Hooper Bay-Chevak, and Nunivak dialects. In the latter two dialects, both the language and the people are called ''Cup'ik''.&lt;ref name=&quot;centralyup'ik&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher = [[Alaska Native Language Center]].

===Siberian Yupik===
[[File:FMIB 37576 Siberian Eskimos aboard the steamer bowhead, showing their furs to trade after indulging in a lunch of whale blubber.jpeg|thumb|[[Siberian Yupik]] aboard the steamer Bowhead]]
{{Main|Siberian Yupik}}
Siberian Yupik reside along the Bering Sea coast of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]] in Siberia in the Russian Far East&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt; and in the villages of [[Gambell, Alaska|Gambell]] and [[Savoonga, Alaska|Savoonga]] on St. Lawrence Island in Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;siberianyupik&quot;&gt;Alaska Native Language Center. (2001-12-07).[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages/sy/ St. Lawrence Island Yupik (Siberian Yupik).] [[Alaska Native Language Center]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. Retrieved on August 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Siberian Yupik spoken on the Chukchi Peninsula and on St. Lawrence Island is nearly identical. About 1,050 of a total Alaska population of 1,100 Siberian Yupik people in Alaska speak the language. It is the first language of the home for most St. Lawrence Island children. In Siberia, about 300 of a total of 900 Siberian Yupik people still learn and study the language, though it is no longer learned as a first language by children.&lt;ref name=&quot;siberianyupik&quot;/&gt;

===Naukan===
{{Main|Naukan people|Naukan Yupik language}}
About 70 of 400 Naukan people still speak Naukanski. The Naukan originate on the Chukot Peninsula in [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] in Siberia.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaplanB&quot;/&gt;

==Sirenik Eskimos==
[[File:Model of an Ice Scoop, 1900-1930, 36.83.jpg|thumb|''Model of an Ice Scoop'', Eskimo, 1900–1930, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
{{Main|Sirenik Eskimos}}
Some speakers of Siberian Yupik languages used to speak an Eskimo variant in the past, before they underwent a [[language shift]]. These former speakers of [[Sirenik Eskimo language]] inhabited the settlements of [[Sireniki]], &lt;!--This is the correct spelling as per the source. Please don't use AWB to change it. Thanks.--&gt;Imtuk, and some small villages stretching to the west from Sireniki along south-eastern coasts of Chukchi Peninsula.&lt;ref name=VES&gt;[http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/bevakhtin.pdf Vakhtin 1998]: 162&lt;/ref&gt; They lived in neighborhoods with Siberian Yupik and [[Chukchi people]]s.

As early as in 1895, &lt;!--This is the correct spelling as per the source. Please don't use AWB to change it. Thanks.--&gt;Imtuk was a settlement with a mixed population of Sirenik Eskimos and Ungazigmit&lt;ref&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 7&lt;/ref&gt; (the latter belonging to Siberian Yupik). Sirenik Eskimo culture has been influenced by that of Chukchi, and the language shows [[Chukchi language]] influences.&lt;ref name=linfranc&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000861/086162e.pdf Menovshchikov 1990]: 70&lt;/ref&gt; Folktale [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] also show the influence of Chuckchi culture.&lt;ref name=rein-rape&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The above peculiarities of this (already [[Extinct language|extinct]]) Eskimo language amounted to mutual unintelligibility even with its nearest language relatives:&lt;ref&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; in the past, Sirenik Eskimos had to use the unrelated Chukchi language as a [[lingua franca]] for communicating with Siberian Yupik.&lt;ref name=linfranc/&gt;

Many words are formed from entirely different [[Root (linguistics)|root]]s from in Siberian Yupik,&lt;ref name=diff-root&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 42&lt;/ref&gt; but even the grammar has several peculiarities distinct not only among Eskimo languages, but even compared to Aleut. For example, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] is not known in Sirenik Eskimo, while most [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]] have dual,&lt;ref name=only2&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 38&lt;/ref&gt; including its neighboring Siberian Yupikax relatives.&lt;ref name=verb2&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the origin of this diversity. The peculiarities of this language may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Eskimo groups,&lt;ref&gt;Menovshchikov 1962: 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menovshchikov 1964: 9&lt;/ref&gt; and being in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries. The influence of the Chukchi language is clear.&lt;ref name=linfranc/&gt;

Because of all these factors, the classification of Sireniki Eskimo language is not settled yet:&lt;ref name=VE3&gt;[http://www.siberian-studies.org/publications/PDF/bevakhtin.pdf Vakhtin 1998]: 161&lt;/ref&gt; Sireniki language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of Eskimo (at least, its possibility is mentioned).&lt;ref name=&quot;VE3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vakh-Sir&gt;Linguist List's description about [http://linguistlist.org/people/personal/get-personal-page2.cfm?PersonID=5548&amp;RequestTimeout=500 Nikolai Vakhtin]'s book: [http://linguistlist.org/pubs/books/get-book.cfm?BookID=938 ''The Old Sirinek Language: Texts, Lexicon, Grammatical Notes''].
