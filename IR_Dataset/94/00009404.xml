      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transport in Ethiopia''' is overseen by the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]]. Over the last years, the [[Ethiopia]]n federal authorities have significantly increased funding for rail and road construction to build an infrastructure, that allows better [[economic development]]. 

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Ethiopian Railways.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Current railways in Ethiopia:{{legend-line|red solid 4px|[[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway|Addis Ababa–Djibouti]]}}{{legend-line|yellow solid 4px|[[Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway|Awash–Hara Gebeya]][[Hara Gebeya–Mek'ele Railway|–Mek'ele]]}}]]
Ethiopia is building a [[standard gauge]] railway network, the [[National Railway Network of Ethiopia]], planned to consist of up to 5,000 km of railways in a number of years. The railway network serves a strategic goal to allow Ethiopia a sustainable and stable [[economic development]]. The railway network's primary purpose is then both to connect [[Landlocked country|landlocked]] [[Ethiopia]] to the [[World economy|world market]] by ensuring a seamless access to one or several [[sea port]]s for [[trade]] and for transporting most [[imports]] and [[exports]]. The [[rail transport]] of [[goods]] appears favorable – if compared to [[road transport]] – in terms of volume, costs, safety and speed of transportation for both imports and exports. The primary port for Ethiopia is the [[Port of Djibouti]] in [[Djibouti]]. More than 95% of Ethiopia's [[trade]] passes through Djibouti.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap2016&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meseret|first1=Elias|title=Ethiopia's new coastal rail link runs through restive region|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/541fbd8c7bd041ecafeff0058ea25b97/ethiopias-new-coastal-rail-link-runs-through-restive-region|agency=Associated Press|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;signature1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maasho|first1=Aaron|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/17/ethiopia-railway-idUSL6E7NH07M20111217|agency=Reuters|date=17 December 2011|title=Ethiopia signs Djibouti railway deal with China|quote=Ethiopia and Djibouti's economies are reliant on each other with about 70 percent of all trade through Djibouti's port coming from its land-locked neighbour.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The port of Djibouti is served by one international railway, the [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] standard gauge 756&amp;nbsp;km long [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway|Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway]] (of which 656&amp;nbsp;km run in Ethiopia). This railway has officially been opened in October 2016 but it is in trial service with no regular traffic in 2017. Once operational by the end of 2017 or in 2018, it will allow passenger transport and a travel time from Addis Ababa to [[Djibouti City]] in less than twelve hours with a designated speed of 120&amp;nbsp;km/hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway line opens|url =  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37562177|website = bbc.co.uk|accessdate = 2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another railway, the [[Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway|Awash – Hara Gebeya Railway]] will go into trial service over its first 270&amp;nbsp;km in 2018. This second railway links Addis Ababa and the Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway with the north of Ethiopia. Once operational over its first 270&amp;nbsp;km, possibly 2018 or 2019, it will allow both freight and passenger transport. A train ride from Addis Ababa to the twin cities of [[Kombolcha]] and [[Dessie]] will be possible in around six hours with a designated speed of 120&amp;nbsp;km/hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;AKH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akhrailway.com/index.php/about-project/project-summary|title=Project Summary|date=January 2017|publisher=AKH Project owners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Highway to Hawzen, Ethiopia (8108169057).jpg|thumb|A highway to [[Hawzen]], one of the many new roads built through the governmental Road Sector Development Program (RSDP)]]
Road projects now represent around a quarter of the annual infrastructure budget of the Ethiopian federal government. Additionally, through the Road Sector Development Program (RSDP), the government has earmarked $4 billion to construct, repair and upgrade roads over the next decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goei&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Infrastructure|url=http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/infrastructure|publisher=Government of Ethiopia|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first part of a 10-year Road Sector Development Program, between 1997 and 2002 the Ethiopian government began a sustained effort to improve its infrastructure of roads. As a result, as of 2002 Ethiopia has a total (federal and regional) 33,297&amp;nbsp;km of roads, both paved and gravel. The share of federally managed roads in good quality improved from 14% in 1995 to 31% in 2002 as a result of this program, and to 89% in 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethiopia earmarks&quot; /&gt; the road density increased from 21&amp;nbsp;km per 1000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (in 1995) to 889&amp;nbsp;km; per 1000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (in 2009) however, this is much greater than the average of 50&amp;nbsp;km per 1000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64193027&amp;piPK=64187937&amp;theSitePK=523679&amp;menuPK=64187510&amp;searchMenuPK=64187283&amp;theSitePK=523679&amp;entityID=000112742_20030530104124&amp;searchMenuPK=64187283&amp;theSitePK=523679 Ethiopia - Second Road Sector Development Program Project]&quot;, p.3 ([[World Bank]] Project Appraisal Document, 19 May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian government had begun the second part of the Road Sector Development Program, which was completed in 2007. This had involved the upgrading or construction of over 7,500&amp;nbsp;km of roads, with the goal of improving the average road density for Ethiopia to 35&amp;nbsp;km per 1000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and reduce the proportion of the country area that is more than 5&amp;nbsp;km from an all-weather road from 75% to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, &quot;Second Road Sector&quot;, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Government of Ethiopia]], it has spent over 600 billion [[Ethiopian birr|birr]] (USD $50 billion, €30 billion) on infrastructure since 1990.

===Expressways===
[[File:Adama (3).jpg|thumb|''Addis Ababa–Adama Expressway'' at [[Adama, Ethiopia|Adama]]]]
The [[Addis Ababa–Adama Expressway]] was completed in 2014 as the first expressway in Ethiopia.  In December 2015, construction began on a second expressway between [[Awasa]] and [[Mojo, Ethiopia|Mojo]], where it will connect to the existing expressway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$700m Ethiopian highway gets started after four-year search for funding|url=http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/700m-ethiopian-high8w8a8y-gets-started-after-four/|work=Global Construction Review|date=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) has undertaken a three year project to upgrade over 370&amp;nbsp;km of roads in the country. Contracts have been signed with the Ethiopian Defense Construction, China Railway Engineering, Eney Construction, China Wuyi, Yotek Construction and FAL General Contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201702020665.html|title=Ethiopia: Road Projects Expanding, Authority Awards Billions|last=Yohannes|first=Frehiwot|date=2017-02-02|newspaper=Addis Fortune (Addis Ababa)|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldhighways.com/categories/road-highway-structures/news/three-year-programme-for-ethiopia-road-projects-planned/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers of vehicular transport===

It is said that Ethiopia has the highest rates of traffic fatalities per vehicle in the world. This is due to many factors. For example, the roads are poorly maintained, lightened and marked; which are major factors in road accidents. Another major factor is the people themselves, who ignore the rules of the road. Their disregard of road safety puts every other driver at risk. Due to this, foreigners are advised to keep a safe distance from the car in front of them because the driving is unpredictable; anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Even the surroundings involving transport can be incredibly dangerous. For example, there are instances when carjackings and robberies occur on highways or streets that are away from the public eye. Due to this, people are forced to be highly alert of their surroundings, such as checking to make sure no one is lurking around their vehicle before entering and avoiding nighttime travel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17028&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ports and harbours ==
[[File:Adama (6).jpg|thumb|''Modjo dry port'']]
Ethiopia is [[list of landlocked countries|landlocked]] and was by agreement with [[Eritrea]] using the ports of [[Asseb]] and [[Massawa]] until 1997; since the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]], Ethiopia has used the port of [[Djibouti]] for nearly all of its imports. Ethiopia increasingly relies on inland [[dry port]]s for distributing cargo, after cargo arrived from Djibouti. The main Ethiopian dry port is [[Modjo dry port]]. 

=== Merchant marine ===
Only one river, the [[Baro River|Baro]] is used for transport.

''Total:''
9 ships (with a volume of {{GT|1,000}} or over) {{GT|81,933}}/{{DWT|101,287}} (2003 est.)

[[cargo ship]] 7; [[container ship]] 1; [[oil tanker|petroleum tanker]] 1; [[roll-on/roll-off ship]] 3 (1999 est.), 1 (2003 est.)

== Airports ==
[[File:Boeing 757-23N, Ethiopian Airlines AN1418402.jpg|thumb|Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 757-23N at [[Bole International Airport]], Addis Ababa (2008)]]There were an estimated 84 airports in 2005, only 14 of which had paved runways as of 2005. The [[Addis Ababa Airport]] handles international jet transportation. It is the main hub of Ethiopian Airlines, the national airline that serves destinations in Ethiopia and throughout the African continent, as well as nonstop service to Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The airport is also the base of the Ethiopian Aviation Academy. As of June 2018, nearly 450 flights per day were departing from and arriving at the airport. In 2018, about 12 million passengers were carried on domestic and international flights.
