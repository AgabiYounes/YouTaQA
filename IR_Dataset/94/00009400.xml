The country's population is highly diverse, comprising over 80 different ethnic groups. Most people in Ethiopia speak [[Afroasiatic languages]], mainly of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] or [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches. Among these are the [[Oromo people|Oromo]], [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Somalis|Somali]] and [[Tigrayans]], who together constitute around three-quarters of the population.

[[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic minorities also inhabit the southern regions of the country, particularly in areas bordering [[South Sudan]]. Among these are the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] and [[Anuak people|Anuak]].

==Languages==
{{main article|Languages of Ethiopia}}
Ethiopia, like most countries in Africa, is a multi-ethnic state. Although the original physical differences between the major ethnic groups have been blurred by centuries, if not millennia, of intermarriage, there remain many who are distinct and unique.

Ethnic differences may also be observed from the great variety of languages spoken in the country, of which there are an astonishing eighty-three, with 200 dialects. These can be broken into four main groups: Semitic, Cushitic, Omotic, and Nilo-Saharan.

The Semitic languages of Ethiopia are related to both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]]. The Ethiopian languages of this family are derived from Ge'ez, the language of the ancient Axumite kingdom, which was also the language of the country's literature prior to the mid-nineteenth century, as well as parts of most present-day church services.

Ethiopia's Semitic languages are today spoken mainly in the north and centre of the country. The most important of them in the north is Tigrinya, which is used throughout Tigray.

The principal Semitic language of the north-western and centre of the country is Amharic, which is the language of Gondar and Gojjam, as well as much of Wollo and Shewa. Moreover, Amharic is also the official language of administration, and the language of much modern Ethiopian literature.

Two other Semitic languages are spoken to the south and east of Addis Ababa: Guraginya, used by the Gurage in a cluster of areas to the south of the capital, and Adarinya, a tongue current only within the old walled city of Harar and used by the Adare, also known as Harrari, people.

The Cushitic languages, which are less closely related than the Semitic, are found mainly in the south of the country. The most important tongue in this group is Afan Oromo. It is used in a wide stretch of country, including Welega and parts of Ilubabor in the west, Wollo in the north, Shewa and Arsi in the centre, Bale and Sidamo in the south, and Harerge in the east.

Other Cushitic language in the area comprise Somalinya, which is spoken by the Somali in the Ogaden to the east, as well as in the neighboring Somali Republic and part of Djibouti, and the Sidaminya language, used in part of the Sidama region. Cushitic languages, however, are also used in the north of the country, namely Afarinya, spoken by the Afar of eastern Wollo and the northern half of the Djibouti Republic; Saho, in parts of Tigray; and Agawinya, in small pockets in different parts of western Ethiopia.

The Omotic group of languages, which comprise considerably fewer speakers than either the Semitic or the Cushitic, are spoken the south-west of the country, mainly in Gamo Gofa. They have been given the name in recent years because they are spoken in the general area of the Omo River.

The Nilo-Saharan languages, largely peripheral to Ethiopian civilization, are spoken in a wide arc of the country towards the Sudan frontier. They include, from north to south, Gumuz in Gondar and Gojjam, Berta in Welega, and Anuak in Ilubabor

==Religion==
{{main article|Religion in Ethiopia}}
Various religions are adhered to in Ethiopia. Most [[Christianity in Ethiopia|Christian]]s live in the [[Ethiopian highlands|highlands]], whereas [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]]s mainly inhabit the [[lowland]]s. Adherents of [[Traditional African religions|traditional faiths]] are primarily concentrated in the southern regions.

According to the Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (2007 census), the national religious composition is [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] 43.5%, [[Protestantism in Ethiopia|Protestantism]] 18.6%, [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Roman Catholicism]] 0.7%, [[Islam in Ethiopia|Islam]] 33.9%, [[Traditional African religion|traditional]] 2.6%, and [[Religion in Ethiopia|others]] 0.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=14 February 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=27 August 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214000000/http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf|archivedate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN estimates===
According to {{UN_Population|source}}, the total population was {{UN_Population|Ethiopia}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to 18,434,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.5%, 55.8% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 3.3% was 65 years or older. The average age was 25.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPP 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=2017-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
