In [[physics]], '''electromagnetic radiation''' ('''EM radiation''' or '''EMR''') refers to the waves (or their [[Quantum|quanta]], [[photon]]s) of the [[electromagnetic field]], propagating (radiating) through space, carrying electromagnetic [[radiant energy]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | author=Purcell and Morin, Harvard University. | title=Electricity and Magnetism, 820p| edition= 3rd | publisher= Cambridge University Press, New York| year = 2013 | isbn= 978-1-107-01402-2}} p 430: &quot;These waves... require no medium to support their propagation.

[[Classical electromagnetism|Classically]], electromagnetic radiation consists of '''electromagnetic waves''', which are synchronized [[oscillation]]s of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the [[speed of light]], commonly denoted ''c''. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a [[transverse wave]]. The [[wavefront]] of electromagnetic waves emitted from a [[point source]] (such as a light bulb) is a [[sphere]]. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] can be characterized by either its [[frequency]] of oscillation or its [[wavelength]].  Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter.  In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, [[visible spectrum|visible light]], ultraviolet radiation, [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=J.

EM waves carry [[energy]], [[momentum]] and [[angular momentum]] away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to [[matter]] with which they interact.  Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (&quot;radiate&quot;) without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the [[Near and far field|far field]]. In this language, the [[Near and far field|near field]] refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[electrostatic induction]] phenomena.

In [[quantum mechanics]], an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of [[photon]]s, uncharged [[elementary particle]]s with zero [[rest mass]] which are the [[quantum|quanta]] of the [[electromagnetic force]], responsible for all electromagnetic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/physics/ekspong/|title=The Dual Nature of Light as Reflected in the Nobel Archives|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715170621/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/physics/ekspong/|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Quantum electrodynamics]] is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/astronomy-and-space-exploration/astronomy-general/electromagnetic-spectrum|title=Electromagnetic Spectrum facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Electromagnetic Spectrum|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613005456/http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/astronomy-and-space-exploration/astronomy-general/electromagnetic-spectrum|archivedate=13 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the [[Atomic electron transition|transition of electrons]] to lower [[energy level]]s in an atom and [[black-body radiation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tipler&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1  = Tipler| first1 = Paul A. | title  = Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 1: Mechanics, Oscillations and Waves, Thermodynamics| publisher = MacMillan| date   = 1999| pages  = 454| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=U9lkAkTdAosC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=%22electromagnetic+waves%22+charges+accelerate| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 978-1572594913}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy of an individual photon is [[Quantization (physics)|quantized]] and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by [[Planck–Einstein relation|Planck's equation]] {{nowrap begin}}''E'' = ''hν''{{nowrap end}}, where ''E'' is the energy per photon, ''ν'' is the frequency of the photon, and ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.

The effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's [[Power (physics)|power]] and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called ''[[non-ionizing radiation]]'', because its photons do not individually have enough energy to [[ionization|ionize]] atoms or molecules or break [[chemical bond]]s. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ''[[ionizing radiation]]'', since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to [[ionization|ionize]] molecules or break [[chemical bond]]s. These radiations have the ability to cause [[chemical reaction]]s and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard.

==== Maxwell’s equations ====
[[James Clerk Maxwell]] derived a [[Electromagnetic wave equation|wave form of the electric and magnetic equations]], thus uncovering the wave-like nature of electric and magnetic fields and their [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]. Because the speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the measured [[speed of light]], Maxwell concluded that [[light]] itself is an EM wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.info/em-waves/|title=Electromagnetic Waves|website=The Physics Hypertextbook|last=Elert|first=Glenn|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/maxwell-s_impact_.html|title=The Impact of James Clerk Maxwell's Work|website=www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org|access-date=2017-09-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917213509/http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/html/maxwell-s_impact_.html|archivedate=17 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations were confirmed by [[Heinrich Hertz]] through experiments with radio waves.

According to [[Maxwell's equations]], a spatially varying [[electric field]] is always associated with a [[magnetic field]] that changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, p 438, section 9.4: ''An Electromagnetic Wave''.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a spatially varying magnetic field is associated with specific changes over time in the electric field. In an electromagnetic wave, the changes in the electric field are always accompanied by a wave in the magnetic field in one direction, and vice versa. This relationship between the two occurs without either type of field causing the other; rather, they occur together in the same way that time and space changes occur together and are interlinked in [[special relativity]]. In fact, magnetic fields can be viewed as electric fields in another frame of reference, and electric fields can be viewed as magnetic fields in another frame of reference, but they have equal significance as physics is the same in all frames of reference, so the close relationship between space and time changes here is more than an analogy. Together, these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave, which moves out into space and need never again interact with the source. The distant EM field formed in this way by the acceleration of a charge carries energy with it that &quot;radiates&quot; away through space, hence the term.

==== Near and far fields ====
{{main|Near and far field|Liénard–Wiechert potential}}
[[File:FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|In electromagnetic radiation (such as microwaves from an antenna, shown here) the term applies only to the parts of the [[electromagnetic field]] that radiate into infinite space and decrease in intensity by an [[inverse-square law]] of power, so that the total radiation energy that crosses through an imaginary spherical surface is the same, no matter how far away from the antenna the spherical surface is drawn. Electromagnetic radiation thus includes the [[near and far field|far field]] part of the electromagnetic field around a transmitter. A part of the &quot;near-field&quot; close to the transmitter, forms part of the changing [[electromagnetic field]], but does not count as electromagnetic radiation.]]
Maxwell's equations established that some charges and currents (&quot;sources&quot;) produce a local type of [[electromagnetic field]] near them that does ''not'' have the behaviour of EMR. Currents directly produce a magnetic field, but it is of a [[magnetic dipole]] type that dies out with distance from the current. In a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an [[electric dipole]] type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields make up the [[near and far field|near-field]] near the EMR source. Neither of these behaviours are responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they cause electromagnetic field behaviour that only efficiently transfers power to a receiver very close to the source, such as the [[electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] inside a [[transformer]], or the feedback behaviour that happens close to the coil of a [[metal detector]]. Typically, near-fields have a powerful effect on their own sources, causing an increased “load” (decreased [[electrical reactance]]) in the source or transmitter, whenever energy is withdrawn from the EM field by a receiver. Otherwise, these fields do not “propagate” freely out into space, carrying their energy away without distance-limit, but rather oscillate, returning their energy to the transmitter if it is not received by a receiver.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

By contrast, the EM far-field is composed of ''radiation'' that is free of the transmitter in the sense that (unlike the case in an electrical transformer) the transmitter requires the same power to send these changes in the fields out, whether the signal is immediately picked up or not. This distant part of the electromagnetic field ''is'' &quot;electromagnetic radiation&quot; (also called the [[Near and far field|far-field]]). The far-fields propagate (radiate) without allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and receiver. Due to [[conservation of energy]], the amount of power passing through any spherical surface drawn around the source is the same. Because such a surface has an area proportional to the square of its distance from the source, the [[power density]] of EM radiation always decreases with the inverse square of distance from the source; this is called the [[inverse-square law]]. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM field close to the source (the near-field), which varies in power according to an inverse cube power law, and thus does ''not'' transport a conserved amount of energy over distances, but instead fades with distance, with its energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil).

The far-field (EMR) depends on a different mechanism for its production than the near-field, and upon different terms in Maxwell's equations. Whereas the magnetic part of the near-field is due to currents in the source, the magnetic field in EMR is due only to the local change in the electric field. In a similar way, while the electric field in the near-field is due directly to the charges and charge-separation in the source, the electric field in EMR is due to a change in the local magnetic field. Both processes for producing electric and magnetic EMR fields have a different dependence on distance than do near-field dipole electric and magnetic fields. That is why the EMR type of EM field becomes dominant in power “far” from sources. The term “far from sources” refers to how far from the source (moving at the speed of light) any portion of the outward-moving EM field is located, by the time that source currents are changed by the varying source potential, and the source has therefore begun to generate an outwardly moving EM field of a different phase.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

A more compact view of EMR is that the far-field that composes EMR is generally that part of the EM field that has traveled sufficient distance from the source, that it has become completely disconnected from any feedback to the charges and currents that were originally responsible for it. Now independent of the source charges, the EM field, as it moves farther away, is dependent only upon the accelerations of the charges that produced it. It no longer has a strong connection to the direct fields of the charges, or to the velocity of the charges (currents).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the [[Liénard–Wiechert potential]] formulation of the electric and magnetic fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell's equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that results from the particle's uniform velocity, are both associated with the electromagnetic near-field, and do not comprise EM radiation.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:Electromagneticwave3D.gif|thumb|Electromagnetic waves can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave of electric and magnetic fields. This 3D animation shows a plane linearly polarized wave propagating from left to right. The electric and magnetic fields in such a wave are in-phase with each other, reaching minima and maxima together.]]

[[Electrodynamics]] is the [[physics]] of electromagnetic radiation, and [[electromagnetism]] is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of [[superposition principle|superposition]]. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same space due to other causes. Further, as they are [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] fields, all magnetic and electric field vectors add together according to [[vector addition]].&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, p442: &quot;Any number of electromagnetic waves can propagate through the same region without affecting one another. The field '''E''' at a space time point is the vector sum of the electric fields of the individual waves, and the same goes for '''B'''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by constructive or destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] yield a resultant irradiance deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual lightwaves.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Since light is an oscillation it is not affected by traveling through static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum. However, in nonlinear media, such as some [[crystal]]s, interactions can occur between light and static electric and magnetic fields — these interactions include the [[Faraday effect]] and the [[Kerr effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Experimental observation of relativistic nonlinear Thomson scattering|first1=Szu-yuan|last1=Chen|first2=Anatoly|last2=Maksimchuk|first3=Donald|last3=Umstadter|date=17 December 1998|journal=Nature|volume=396|issue=6712|pages=653–655|doi=10.1038/25303|arxiv=physics/9810036|bibcode=1998Natur.396..653C|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crowther-1920&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowther|first1=James Arnold|title=The life and discoveries of Michael Faraday|date=1920|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|pages=54–57|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iWe4AAAAIAAJ|page=5}}|accessdate=15 June 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[refraction]], a wave crossing from one medium to another of different [[density]] alters its [[Velocity|speed and direction]] upon entering the new medium. The ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of refraction, and is summarized by [[Snell's law]]. Light of composite wavelengths (natural sunlight) disperses into a visible [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] passing through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent [[refractive index]] of the [[prism]] material ([[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]); that is, each component wave within the composite light is bent a different amount.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and [[Subatomic particle|particle]] properties at the same time (see [[wave-particle duality]]). Both wave and particle characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller than 1. It is not so difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not evidence of &quot;particulate&quot; behavior. Rather, it reflects the quantum nature of ''matter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qo.phy.auckland.ac.nz/talks/photoelectric.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627171942/http://www.qo.phy.auckland.ac.nz/talks/photoelectric.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 June 2007|title=Einstein and the Photoelectric Effect |first=H. J. |last=Carmichael |publisher=Quantum Optics Theory Group, University of Auckland |accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrating that the light itself is quantized, not merely its interaction with matter, is a more subtle affair.

Some experiments display both the wave and particle natures of electromagnetic waves, such as the self-interference of a single [[photon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1119/1.1737397|url=http://people.whitman.edu/~beckmk/QM/grangier/Thorn_ajp.pdf|title=Observing the quantum behavior of light in an undergraduate laboratory|year=2004|last1=Thorn|first1=J.

A [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter such as electrons is described by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]].

In dissipation less (lossless) media, these '''E''' and '''B''' fields are also in phase, with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see illustrations). A common misconception is that the '''E''' and '''B''' fields in electromagnetic radiation are out of phase because a change in one produces the other, and this would produce a phase difference between them as sinusoidal functions (as indeed happens in [[electromagnetic induction]], and in the [[near and far field|near-field]] close to antennas). However, in the far-field EM radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell [[curl (mathematics)|curl operator]] equations, a more correct description is that a time-change in one type of field is proportional to a space-change in the other. These derivatives require that the '''E''' and '''B''' fields in EMR are in-phase (see math section below).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

An important aspect of light's nature is its frequency. The frequency of a wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in [[hertz]], the [[SI]] unit of frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per [[second]]. Light usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave. Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon known as [[Dispersion relation|dispersion]].

A wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between two adjacent crests or troughs is called the [[wavelength]]. Waves of the electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v=f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the speed of the wave (''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum, or less in other media), ''f'' is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.

Electromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell's [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. Two main classes of solutions are known, namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite) distance from the source.  Both types of waves can have a waveform which is an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to conform to the wave equation).  As with any time function, this can be decomposed by means of [[Fourier analysis]] into its [[frequency spectrum]], or individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single frequency, amplitude and phase. Such a component wave is said to be ''monochromatic''.  A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some reference phase, its direction of propagation and its polarization.

Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive interference. An example of interference caused by EMR is [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI) or as it is more commonly known as, [[Radio frequency interference|radio-frequency interference]] (RFI).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Additionally, multiple polarization signals can be combined (i.e. interfered) to form new states of polarization, which is known as [[parallel polarization state generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=She|first1=Alan|last2=Capasso|first2=Federico|title=Parallel Polarization State Generation|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=26019|doi=10.1038/srep26019|pmid=27184813|pmc=4869035|date=17 May 2016|arxiv=1602.04463|bibcode=2016NatSR...626019S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laser photons.gif|thumb|right|Representation of how the alternating electric field vector of a wave of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation emerge.]]
An anomaly arose in the late 19th century involving a contradiction between the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as [[black body|black bodies]]. Physicists struggled with this problem unsuccessfully for many years. It later became known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]. In 1900, [[Max Planck]] developed a new theory of [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|black-body radiation]] that explained the observed spectrum. Planck's theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit light (and other electromagnetic radiation) only as discrete bundles or packets of [[energy]]. These packets were called [[quantum|quanta]]. In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles. Later the particle of light was given the name [[photon]], to correspond with other particles being described around this time, such as the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. A photon has an energy, ''E'', proportional to its frequency, ''f'', by

: &lt;math&gt;E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This is sometimes known as the [[Planck–Einstein equation]].&lt;ref&gt;

Likewise, the momentum ''p'' of a photon is also proportional to its frequency and inversely proportional to its wavelength:

: &lt;math&gt;p = { E \over c } = { hf \over c } = { h \over \lambda }. &lt;/math&gt;

The source of Einstein's proposal that light was composed of particles (or could act as particles in some circumstances) was an experimental anomaly not explained by the wave theory: the [[photoelectric effect]], in which light striking a metal surface ejected electrons from the surface, causing an [[electric current]] to flow across an applied [[voltage]]. Experimental measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons was proportional to the ''[[frequency]]'', rather than the ''[[intensity (physics)|intensity]]'', of the light. Furthermore, below a certain minimum frequency, which depended on the particular metal, no current would flow regardless of the intensity. These observations appeared to contradict the wave theory, and for years physicists tried in vain to find an explanation. In 1905, Einstein explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to explain the observed effect. Because of the preponderance of evidence in favor of the wave theory, however, Einstein's ideas were met initially with great skepticism among established physicists. Eventually Einstein's explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was observed, such as the [[Compton effect]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As a photon is absorbed by an [[atom]], it [[Excited state|excites]] the atom, elevating an [[electron]] to a higher [[energy level]] (one that is on average farther from the nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called [[fluorescence]], a type of [[photoluminescence]]. An example is visible light emitted from fluorescent paints, in response to ultraviolet ([[blacklight]]). Many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than visible light. Delayed emission is called [[phosphorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.majordifferences.com/2016/11/7-differences-between-fluorescence-and-Phosphorescence.html|title=7 Differences between Fluorescence and Phosphorescence|last=Haneef|first=Deena T.

===Wave–particle duality===
{{main|Wave–particle duality}}

The modern theory that explains the nature of light includes the notion of wave–particle duality. More generally, the theory states that everything has both a particle nature and a wave nature, and various experiments can be done to bring out one or the other. The particle nature is more easily discerned using an object with a large mass. A bold proposition by [[Louis de Broglie]] in 1924 led the scientific community to realize that matter (e.g. [[electron]]s) also exhibits wave–particle duality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Browne, Michael|title= ''Physics for Engineering and Science'' | publisher= McGraw-Hill/Schaum |edition= 2nd | date=2010| isbn= 978-0-07-161399-6}} Chapter 36, page 382: de Broglie Waves. &quot;Light exhibits both wave properties (interference, diffraction, refraction) and particle properties (photoelectric effect, scattering.)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wave and particle effects of electromagnetic radiation===
Together, wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and absorption spectra of EM radiation. The matter-composition of the medium through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and emission spectrum. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in the atoms. Dark bands in the [[absorption spectroscopy|absorption spectrum]] are due to the atoms in an intervening medium between source and observer. The atoms absorb certain frequencies of the light between emitter and detector/eye, then emit them in all directions. A dark band appears to the detector, due to the radiation scattered out of the beam. For instance, dark bands in the light emitted by a distant [[star]] are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. A similar phenomenon occurs for [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]], which is seen when an emitting gas glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism, including heat. As electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons, but lines are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after excitation.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, p 376: &quot;Radiation is emitted or absorbed only when the electron jumps from one orbit to the other, and the frequency of radiation depends only upon on the energies of the electron in the initial and final orbits.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] spectrum of [[nebula]]e.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Rapidly moving electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency electromagnetic radiation observed in nature.

These phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition of gases lit from behind (absorption spectra) and for glowing gases (emission spectra). Spectroscopy (for example) determines what [[chemical element]]s comprise a particular star. Spectroscopy is also used in the determination of the distance of a star, using the [[red shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spectroscopy|url=http://www.redshift.org.uk/spectroscopy|website=National Redshift Project|publisher=National Redshift Project|accessdate=19 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234024/http://www.redshift.org.uk/spectroscopy|archivedate=1 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propagation speed===
{{main|Speed of light}}

When any wire (or other conducting object such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]) conducts [[alternating current]], electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same frequency as the current. In many such situations it is possible to identify an electrical dipole moment that arises from separation of charges due to the exciting electrical potential, and this dipole moment oscillates in time, as the charges move back and forth. This oscillation at a given frequency gives rise to changing electric and magnetic fields, which then set the electromagnetic radiation in motion.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

At the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates. Charged particles in a [[stationary state]] do not move, but a superposition of such states may result in a transition state that has an [[electric dipole moment]] that oscillates in time. This oscillating dipole moment is responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum states of a charged particle. Such states occur (for example) in atoms when photons are radiated as the atom shifts from one stationary state to another.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As a wave, light is characterized by a velocity (the [[speed of light]]), [[wavelength]], and [[frequency]]. As particles, light is a stream of [[photon|photons.]] Each has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by [[Max Planck|Planck's]] relation ''E = hf'', where ''E'' is the energy of the photon, ''h'' = 6.626 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; J·s is [[Planck's constant]], and ''f'' is the frequency of the wave.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

One rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum travels at the [[speed of light]], ''relative to the observer'', regardless of the observer's velocity. (This observation led to Einstein's development of the theory of [[special relativity]].){{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In a medium (other than vacuum), [[velocity of propagation|velocity factor]] or [[refractive index]] are considered, depending on frequency and application. Both of these are ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Special theory of relativity===
{{Main|Special theory of relativity}}

By the [[late nineteenth century]], various experimental anomalies could not be explained by the simple wave theory. One of these anomalies involved a controversy over the speed of light. The speed of light and other EMR predicted by Maxwell's equations did not appear unless the equations were modified in a way first suggested by [[George Francis FitzGerald|FitzGerald]] and [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] (see [[history of special relativity]]), or else otherwise that speed would depend on the speed of observer relative to the &quot;medium&quot; (called [[luminiferous aether]]) which supposedly &quot;carried&quot; the electromagnetic wave (in a manner analogous to the way air carries sound waves). Experiments failed to find any observer effect. In 1905, Einstein proposed that space and time appeared to be velocity-changeable entities for light propagation and all other processes and laws. These changes accounted for the constancy of the speed of light and all electromagnetic radiation, from the viewpoints of all observers—even those in relative motion.

==History of discovery==
{{see also|History of electromagnetic theory|Timeline of electromagnetic theory}}

Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of [[infrared]] radiation is ascribed to astronomer [[William Herschel]], who published his results in 1800 before the [[Royal Society of London]].&lt;ref name=HerschelRSIR&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=107057|title=Experiments on the Refrangibility of the Invisible Rays of the Sun. By William Herschel, LL. D. F. R. S|first=William|last=Herschel|date=1 January 1800|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|volume=90|pages=284–292|doi=10.1098/rstl.1800.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herschel used a glass [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] to [[refract]] light from the [[Sun]] and detected invisible rays that caused heating beyond the [[red]] part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded with a [[thermometer]]. These &quot;calorific rays&quot; were later termed infrared.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1801, German physicist [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] discovered [[ultraviolet]] in an experiment similar to Hershel's, using sunlight and a glass prism. Ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum dispersed by a triangular prism darkened [[silver chloride]] preparations more quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter's experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the ultraviolet rays (which at first were called &quot;chemical rays&quot;) were capable of causing chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[File:James Clerk Maxwell sitting.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]]]]
In 1862–64 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed equations for the electromagnetic field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed that was very close to the known speed of light. Maxwell therefore suggested that visible light (as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet rays by inference) all consisted of propagating disturbances (or radiation) in the electromagnetic field. Radio waves were first produced deliberately by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light, following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested by Maxwell's equations. Hertz also developed ways to detect these waves, and produced and characterized what were later termed [[radio wave]]s and [[microwave]]s.&lt;ref name=Jeans&gt;[[James Jeans|Jeans, James]] (1947) [https://archive.org/stream/growthofphysical029068mbp#page/n11/mode/2up The Growth of Physical Science]. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|286,7}}

[[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered and named [[X-rays]]. After experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. In one month, he discovered X-rays' main properties.&lt;ref name=Jeans/&gt;{{rp|307}}

The last portion of the EM spectrum to be discovered was associated with [[radioactivity]]. [[Henri Becquerel]] found that [[uranium]] salts caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner similar to X-rays, and [[Marie Curie]] discovered that only certain elements gave off these rays of energy, soon discovering the intense radiation of [[radium]]. The radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays ([[alpha particle]]s) and beta rays ([[beta particle]]s) by [[Ernest Rutherford]] through simple experimentation in 1899, but these proved to be charged particulate types of radiation. However, in 1900 the French scientist [[Paul Villard]] discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named [[gamma ray]]s. In 1910 British physicist [[William Henry Bragg]] demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles, and in 1914 Rutherford and [[Edward Andrade]] measured their wavelengths, finding that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and higher frequency, although a 'cross-over' between X and gamma rays makes it possible to have X-rays with a higher energy (and hence shorter wavelength) than gamma rays and vice versa. The origin of the ray differentiates them, gamma rays tend to be a natural phenomena originating from the unstable nucleus of an atom and X-rays are electrically generated (and hence man-made) unless they are as a result of [[bremsstrahlung]] X-radiation caused by the interaction of fast moving particles (such as beta particles) colliding with certain materials, usually of higher atomic numbers.&lt;ref name=Jeans/&gt;{{rp|308,9}}

EM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and magnetic and [[near and far field|near fields]]) is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave|radio]], [[microwave]], [[infrared]], [[visible spectrum|visible]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]]. Arbitrary electromagnetic waves can be expressed by [[Fourier analysis]] in terms of [[sinusoidal]] [[monochromatic]] waves, which in turn can each be classified into these regions of the EMR spectrum.

For certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as ''random'', and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different mathematical techniques appropriate to random or [[stochastic process]]es. In such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of their ''power'' content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a representation is called the [[power spectral density]] of the random process. Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very wideband forms of radiation such as the [[Zero point field|Zero point wave field]] of the electromagnetic vacuum.

The behavior of EM radiation and its interaction with matter depends on its frequency, and changes qualitatively as the frequency changes. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and are associated with photons of higher energy. There is no fundamental limit known to these wavelengths or energies, at either end of the spectrum, although photons with energies near the [[Planck energy]] or exceeding it (far too high to have ever been observed) will require new physical theories to describe.

=== Radio and microwave ===
{{main|Radio waves|Microwaves}}
Radio waves have the least amount of energy and the lowest frequency. When radio waves impinge upon a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], they couple to the conductor, travel along it and [[radio frequency induction|induce]] an electric current on the conductor surface by moving the electrons of the conducting material in correlated bunches of charge. Such effects can cover macroscopic distances in conductors (such as radio antennas), since the wavelength of radiowaves is long.

Electromagnetic radiation phenomena with wavelengths ranging from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter are called microwaves; with frequencies between 300&amp;nbsp;MHz (0.3&amp;nbsp;GHz) and 300&amp;nbsp;GHz.

At radio and microwave frequencies, EMR interacts with matter largely as a bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of affected atoms. In [[electrical conductor]]s, such induced bulk movement of charges ([[electric current]]s) results in absorption of the EMR, or else separations of charges that cause generation of new EMR (effective reflection of the EMR). An example is absorption or emission of radio waves by antennas, or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with an electric dipole moment, as for example inside a [[microwave oven]]. These interactions produce either electric currents or heat, or both.

=== Infrared ===
{{main|Infrared}}
Like radio and microwave, infrared (IR) also is reflected by metals (and also most EMR, well into the ultraviolet range). However, unlike lower-frequency radio and microwave radiation, Infrared EMR commonly interacts with dipoles present in single molecules, which change as atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond. It is consequently absorbed by a wide range of substances, causing them to increase in temperature as the vibrations dissipate as [[heat]]. The same process, run in reverse, causes bulk substances to radiate in the infrared spontaneously (see [[thermal radiation]] section below). 

Infrared radiation is divided into spectral subregions. While different subdivision schemes exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Roy |url=http://info.tuwien.ac.at/iflt/safety/section1/1_1_1.htm |title=Wavelength considerations |publisher=Instituts für Umform- und Hochleistungs |accessdate=2007-10-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028072110/http://info.tuwien.ac.at/iflt/safety/section1/1_1_1.htm |archivedate = 2007-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html |title=Near, Mid and Far-Infrared |publisher=NASA IPAC |accessdate=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/Regions/irregions.html |archivedate=2012-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the spectrum is commonly divided as near-infrared (0.75&amp;nbsp;–1.4 μm), short-wavelength infrared (1.4&amp;nbsp;–3 μm), mid-wavelength infrared (3&amp;nbsp;–8 μm), long-wavelength infrared (8&amp;nbsp;–15 μm) and [[far infrared]] (15&amp;nbsp;–1000 μm).&lt;ref name=&quot;Byrnes&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Byrnes |first=James |title=Unexploded Ordnance Detection and Mitigation |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |pages=21–22 |isbn=978-1-4020-9252-7|bibcode=2009uodm.book.....B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visible light ===
{{main|Light}}
Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum. EM radiation with a [[wavelength]] between approximately 400 [[nanometre|nm]] and 700&amp;nbsp;nm is directly detected by the [[human eye]] and perceived as visible [[light]]. Other wavelengths, especially nearby infrared (longer than 700&amp;nbsp;nm) and ultraviolet (shorter than 400&amp;nbsp;nm) are also sometimes referred to as light.

As frequency increases into the visible range, photons have enough energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules. It is not a coincidence that this happens in the visible range, as the [[Visual system|mechanism of vision]] involves the change in bonding of a single molecule ([[retinal]]) which absorbs light in the [[rhodopsin]] in the [[retina]] of the human eye. [[Photosynthesis]] becomes possible in this range as well, for similar reasons, as a single molecule of [[chlorophyll]] is excited by a single photon. Animals that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change temperature, in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons (see [[infrared sensing in snakes]]). For this reason, infrared, microwaves and radio waves are thought to damage molecules and biological tissue only by bulk heating, not excitation from single photons of the radiation.

Visible light is able to affect a few molecules with single photons, but usually not in a permanent or damaging way, in the absence of power high enough to increase temperature to damaging levels. However, in plant tissues that conduct photosynthesis, [[carotenoids]] act to quench electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process called [[non-photochemical quenching]], in order to prevent reactions that would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels. Limited evidence indicate that some [[reactive oxygen species]] are created by visible light in skin, and that these may have some role in photoaging, in the same manner as [[ultraviolet A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liebel | first1 = F. | last2 = Kaur | first2 = S. | last3 = Ruvolo | first3 = E. | last4 = Kollias | first4 = N. | last5 = Southall | first5 = M.

=== Ultraviolet ===
{{main|Ultraviolet}}
As frequency increases into the ultraviolet, photons now carry enough energy (about three [[electron volt]]s or more) to excite certain doubly bonded molecules into permanent chemical rearrangement. In [[DNA]], this causes lasting damage. DNA is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species produced by ultraviolet A (UVA), which has energy too low to damage DNA directly. This is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage DNA, and is capable of causing cancer, and (for [[UVB]]) skin burns (sunburn) that are far worse than would be produced by simple heating (temperature increase) effects. This property of causing molecular damage that is out of proportion to heating effects, is characteristic of all EMR with frequencies at the visible light range and above. These properties of high-frequency EMR are due to quantum effects that permanently damage materials and tissues at the molecular level.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

At the higher end of the ultraviolet range, the energy of photons becomes large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be liberated from the atom, in a process called [[photoionisation]]. The energy required for this is always larger than about 10 [[electron volt]] (eV) corresponding with wavelengths smaller than 124&amp;nbsp;nm (some sources suggest a more realistic cutoff of 33&amp;nbsp;eV, which is the energy required to ionize water). This high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the approximate ionization range, is sometimes called &quot;extreme UV.&quot; Ionizing UV is strongly filtered by the Earth's atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

=== X-rays and gamma rays ===
{{main|X-rays|Gamma rays}}
Electromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization energy, or more, (which includes the entire spectrum with shorter wavelengths), is therefore termed [[ionizing radiation]]. (Many other kinds of ionizing radiation are made of non-EM particles). Electromagnetic-type ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths, which means that all [[X-rays]] and [[gamma rays]] qualify. These are capable of the most severe types of molecular damage, which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule, including mutation and cancer, and often at great depths below the skin, since the higher end of the X-ray spectrum, and all of the gamma ray spectrum, penetrate matter.

==Atmosphere and magnetosphere==
{{main|ozone layer|shortwave radio|skywave|ionosphere}}
[[File:Atmospheric electromagnetic opacity.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|Rough plot of Earth's atmospheric absorption and scattering (or [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of various [[wavelength]]s of electromagnetic radiation]]
Most UV and X-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular [[nitrogen]], and then (for wavelengths in the upper UV) from the electronic excitation of [[dioxygen]] and finally [[ozone]] at the mid-range of UV. Only 30% of the Sun's ultraviolet light reaches the ground, and almost all of this is well transmitted.

Visible light is well transmitted in air, as it is not energetic enough to excite nitrogen, oxygen, or ozone, but too energetic to excite molecular vibrational frequencies of water vapor.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Absorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation in water vapor. However, at energies too low to excite water vapor, the atmosphere becomes transparent again, allowing free transmission of most microwave and radio waves.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Finally, at radio wavelengths longer than 10 meters or so (about 30&amp;nbsp;MHz), the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio, but plasma in certain layers of the [[ionosphere]] begins to interact with radio waves (see [[skywave]]). This property allows some longer wavelengths (100 meters or 3&amp;nbsp;MHz) to be reflected and results in [[shortwave radio]] beyond line-of-sight. However, [[Ionosphere#D layer|certain ionospheric effects]] begin to block incoming radiowaves from space, when their frequency is less than about 10&amp;nbsp;MHz (wavelength longer than about 30 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dabas|first=R S|title=Ionosphere and its influence on radio communications|journal=Resonance|language=en|volume=5|issue=7|pages=28–43|doi=10.1007/bf02867245|issn=0971-8044|date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal and electromagnetic radiation as a form of heat==
{{main|Thermal radiation|Planck's law}}
The basic structure of [[matter]] involves charged particles bound together. When electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter, it causes the charged particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy depends on the context. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may get dissipated into other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to [[thermal equilibrium]] and manifesting itself as [[thermal energy]], or even [[Temperature#Kinetic theory approach to temperature|kinetic energy]], in the material. With a few exceptions related to high-energy photons (such as [[fluorescence]], [[harmonic generation]], [[photochemical reaction]]s, the [[photovoltaic effect]] for ionizing radiations at far ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation), absorbed electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by [[heat]]ing the material. This happens for infrared, microwave and radio wave radiation. Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In addition to infrared [[laser]]s, sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet lasers can easily set paper afire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuceng.ca/candu/|title=CANDU textbook|website=www.nuceng.ca|access-date=2017-03-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420121747/http://www.nuceng.ca/candu/|archivedate=20 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Ionizing radiation creates high-speed electrons in a material and breaks chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other atoms eventually most of the energy becomes thermal energy all in a tiny fraction of a second. This process makes ionizing radiation far more dangerous per unit of energy than non-ionizing radiation. This caveat also applies to UV, even though almost all of it is not ionizing, because UV can damage molecules due to electronic excitation, which is far greater per unit energy than heating effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Infrared radiation in the spectral distribution of a [[black body]] is usually considered a form of heat, since it has an equivalent temperature and is associated with an entropy change per unit of thermal energy. However, &quot;heat&quot; is a technical term in physics and thermodynamics and is often confused with thermal energy. Any type of electromagnetic energy can be transformed into thermal energy in interaction with matter. Thus, ''any'' electromagnetic radiation can &quot;heat&quot; (in the sense of increase the [[thermal energy]] temperature of) a material, when it is absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdeedu/kstars/ai-blackbody.html|title=Blackbody Radiation|website=docs.kde.org|access-date=2017-03-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808154617/https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kdeedu/kstars/ai-blackbody.html|archivedate=8 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is thermal radiation. Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of matter, with the deposited energy heating the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/wparkinson/help/thermochemistry/|title=Thermodynamics Part 1: Work, Heat, Internal Energy and Enthalpy|website=www2.southeastern.edu|access-date=2017-03-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324012259/http://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/wparkinson/help/thermochemistry/|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum [[entropy|radiation entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.lu.se/Education/utb/ASTA21/pdf/Planck's%20law.pdf|title=Planck's law|last=|first=|date=|website=astro.lu.se|url-status=dead|access-date=24 March 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130131244/http://www.astro.lu.se/Education/utb/ASTA21/pdf/Planck's%20law.pdf|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological effects ==
{{main|Electromagnetic radiation and health|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
[[Bioelectromagnetics]] is the study of the interactions and effects of EM radiation on living organisms. The effects of electromagnetic radiation upon living cells, including those in humans, depends upon the radiation's power and frequency. For low-frequency radiation (radio waves to visible light) the best-understood effects are those due to radiation power alone, acting through heating when radiation is absorbed. For these thermal effects, frequency is important as it affects the intensity of the radiation and penetration into the organism (for example, microwaves penetrate better than infrared). It is widely accepted that low frequency fields that are too weak to cause significant heating could not possibly have any biological effect.&lt;ref name=Binhi/&gt;

Despite the commonly accepted results, some research has been conducted to show that weaker ''non-thermal'' electromagnetic fields, (including weak ELF magnetic fields, although the latter does not strictly qualify as EM radiation&lt;ref name=Binhi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Delgado | first1 = J.

For example, epidemiological studies looking for a relationship between cell phone use and brain cancer development, have been largely inconclusive, save to demonstrate that the effect, if it exists, cannot be a large one.

At higher frequencies (visible and beyond), the effects of individual photons begin to become important, as these now have enough energy individually to directly or indirectly damage biological molecules.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal | pmid =22318388 | doi=10.1038/jid.2011.476 | volume=132 | issue=7 | title=Irradiation of skin with visible light induces reactive oxygen species and matrix-degrading enzymes | date=July 2012 | journal=J.

With UVB, the damage to DNA becomes direct, with [[photochemistry|photochemical]] formation of [[pyrimidine dimers]].&lt;/ref&gt; All UV frequences have been classed as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narayanan|first=DL |author2=Saladi, RN |author3=Fox, JL|title=Ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|date=September 2010|volume=49|issue=9|pages=978–86|pmid=20883261|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2010.04474.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Review05&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saladi|first=RN|author2=Persaud, AN|title=The causes of skin cancer: a comprehensive review|journal=Drugs of Today|date=January 2005|volume=41|issue=1|pages=37–53|pmid=15753968|doi=10.1358/dot.2005.41.1.875777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, at UV frequencies and higher (and probably somewhat also in the visible range),&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; electromagnetic radiation does more damage to biological systems than simple heating predicts. This is most obvious in the &quot;far&quot; (or &quot;extreme&quot;) ultraviolet. UV, with X-ray and gamma radiation, are referred to as [[ionizing radiation]] due to the ability of photons of this radiation to produce [[ion]]s and [[free radical]]s in materials (including living tissue). Since such radiation can severely damage life at energy levels that produce little heating, it is considered far more dangerous (in terms of damage-produced per unit of energy, or power) than the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum.

===Use as weapon===
{{see also|Directed energy weapons#Microwave weapons}}
The heat ray is an application of EMR that makes use of microwave frequencies to create an unpleasant heating effect in the upper layer of the skin.  A publicly known heat ray weapon called the [[Active Denial System]] was developed by the US military as an experimental weapon to deny the enemy access to an area.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  A [[death ray]] is a weapon that delivers heat ray electromagnetic energy at levels that injure human tissue.  The inventor of the death ray, [[Harry Grindell Matthews]],  claims to have lost sight in his left eye while developing his death ray weapon based on a primitive microwave [[magnetron]] from the 1920s (a typical [[microwave oven]] induces a tissue damaging cooking effect inside the oven at about 2 kV/m).

==Derivation from electromagnetic theory==
{{main|Electromagnetic wave equation}}

Electromagnetic waves are predicted by the classical laws of electricity and magnetism, known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. There are nontrivial solutions of the homogeneous Maxwell's equations (without charges or currents), describing ''waves'' of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with Maxwell's equations in [[vacuum|free space]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
:where
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[vector field]]s of the [[Electric Field]] (measured in [[Volt|V]]/[[meter|m]] or [[Newtons|N]]/[[Coulomb|C]]) and the [[Magnetic Field]] (measured in [[Tesla (unit)|T]] or [[Weber (unit)|Wb]]/[[Square meter|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]), respectively;
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot X &lt;/math&gt; yields the [[divergence]] and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times X &lt;/math&gt; the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field &lt;math&gt;X;&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt; are [[partial derivatives]] (rate of change in time, with location fixed) of the magnetic and electric field;
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of a vacuum (4&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; x 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Henry (unit)|H]]/m)), and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permittivity]] of a vacuum (8.85×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Farad (unit)|F]]/m));
::

Besides the trivial solution
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{0},&lt;/math&gt;
useful solutions can be derived with the following [[vector calculus identities|vector identity]], valid for all vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; in some vector field:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right) = \nabla \left( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \right) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the curl of the second Maxwell equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) yields:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \right) = \nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

Evaluating the left hand side of ({{EquationNote|5}}) with the above identity and simplifying using ({{EquationNote|1}}), yields:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \nabla \times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \right) = \nabla\left(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} \right) - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = - \nabla^2 \mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

Evaluating the right hand side of ({{EquationNote|5}}) by exchanging the sequence of derivations and inserting the fourth {{nowrap|Maxwell equation ({{EquationNote|4}}),}} yields:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \left(-\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right) = -\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

Combining ({{EquationNote|6}}) and ({{EquationNote|7}}) again, gives a vector-valued [[differential equation]] for the electric field, solving the homogeneous Maxwell equations:

{{Equation box 1|border=2|border colour=#ccccff
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{E} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{E}}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Taking the curl of the fourth Maxwell equation ({{EquationNote|4}}) results in a similar differential equation for a magnetic field solving the homogeneous Maxwell equations:

{{Equation box 1|border=2|border colour=#ccccff
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{B}}{\partial t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}

Both differential equations have the form of the general [[wave equation]] for waves propagating with speed &lt;math&gt;c_0,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function of time and location, which gives the amplitude of the wave at some time at a certain location:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f = \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
This is also written as:
::&lt;math&gt;\Box f = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; denotes the so-called [[d'Alembert operator]], which in Cartesian coordinates is given as:
::&lt;math&gt;\Box = \nabla^2 - \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \ &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the terms for the speed of propagation, yields in the case of the electric and magnetic fields:

::&lt;math&gt;c_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum. Thus Maxwell's equations connect the [[vacuum permittivity]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[vacuum permeability]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;, and the speed of light, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, via the above equation. This relationship had been discovered by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] prior to the development of Maxwell's electrodynamics, however Maxwell was the first to produce a field theory consistent with waves traveling at the speed of light.

These are only two equations versus the original four, so more information pertains to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. A generic vector wave for the electric field.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the constant amplitude, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is any second differentiable function, &lt;math&gt; \hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and &lt;math&gt; {\mathbf{x}} &lt;/math&gt; is a position vector. &lt;math&gt;f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right)&lt;/math&gt; is a generic solution to the wave equation. In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2 f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = \frac{1}{{c_0}^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} f\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right),&lt;/math&gt;
for a generic wave traveling in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

This form will satisfy the wave equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{E}_0 f'\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The first of Maxwell's equations implies that the electric field is orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{E}_0 f'\left( \hat{\mathbf{k}} \cdot \mathbf{x} - c_0 t \right) = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{c_0} \hat{\mathbf{k}} \times \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

The second of Maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field. The remaining equations will be satisfied by this choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

The electric and magnetic field waves in the far-field travel at the speed of light. They have a special restricted orientation and proportional magnitudes, &lt;math&gt;E_0 = c_0 B_0&lt;/math&gt;, which can be seen immediately from the [[Poynting vector]]. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same direction as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, '''E''' and '''B''' far-fields in free space, which as wave solutions depend primarily on these two Maxwell equations, are in-phase with each other. This is guaranteed since the generic wave solution is first order in both space and time, and the [[curl (mathematics)|curl operator]] on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations, which gives the other field, is first-order in time, resulting in the same [[phase shift]] for both fields in each mathematical operation.

From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to propagation direction is known as [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. On a quantum level, it is described as [[photon polarization]]. The direction of the polarization is defined as the direction of the electric field.

More general forms of the second-order wave equations given above are available, allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources. Many competing derivations exist, all with varying levels of approximation and intended applications. One very general example is a form of the electric field equation,&lt;ref name=kinsler2010&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; which was factorized into a pair of explicitly directional wave equations, and then efficiently reduced into a single uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution approximation.
