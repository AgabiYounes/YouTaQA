[[Helsingør Municipality]] had a population of 62,686 on 1 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF44&amp;PLanguage=1|title=Population 1. January by urban areas (DISCONTINUED) - StatBank Denmark - data and statistics|website=Statistikbanken.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helsingør and [[Helsingborg]] in [[Sweden]] together form the northern reaches of the [[Øresund Region]], centered on [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]]. The [[HH Ferry route]] connects Helsingør with Helsingborg, 4&amp;nbsp;km (2 miles) across the [[Øresund]].

It is known for its castle [[Kronborg]], which [[William Shakespeare]] presumably had in mind for his famous play ''[[Hamlet]].''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/denmark/articles/Shakespeares-Danish-links/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kronborg 02.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Kronborg Castle]]]]
[[File:Porto de Helsingor.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Helsingør port]]
[[File:Helsingør street.JPG|thumb|left|180px|An alley in Helsingør]]

The name ''Helsingør'' is derived from the word ''hals'' meaning &quot;neck&quot; or &quot;narrow strait&quot;, referring to the narrowest point of the 
''[[Øresund]]'' (Øre Sound) between what is now Helsingør and [[Helsingborg]], Sweden. 
The people were mentioned as ''Helsinger'' (which may mean &quot;the people of the strait&quot;) for the first time in [[Valdemar II of Denmark|King Valdemar the Victorious]]'s ''[[Liber Census Daniæ]]'' from 1231 (not to be confused with the Helsings of [[Hälsingland]] in Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;early records of Helsingør and Flynderborg (&quot;possibly already mentioned by Saxo&quot;): J. D. Qvist, ''Annaler for nordisk oldkyndighed'', Kongelige Nordiske oldskriftselskab, 1836, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=InEJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA306 p. 306]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Placenames show that the Helsinger may have had their main fort at [[Helsingborg]] and a fortified landing place at Helsingør, to control the ferry route across the strait.

Helsingør as it is known today was founded in the 1420s by the Danish king [[Eric of Pomerania]]. He established the [[Sound Dues]] in 1429, meaning all foreign ships passing through the strait had to pay a toll, which constituted up to two-thirds of Denmark's state income. With this income [[Eric of Pomerania]] built the castle Krogen. The castle was expanded in the 1580s and renamed [[Kronborg]].  All ships had to stop in Helsingør to get their cargo taxed and pay a toll to the Danish Crown, but it also generated a significant trade for the town. In 1672 Helsingør had grown into the third biggest town in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byhistorie.dk/filer/Byhistorie1300aar.pdf|format=PDF|title=Danske byers historie gennem 1300 år|website=Byhistorie.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Johan Isaksson Pontanus]] (''Rerum Danicarum Historica'', 1631) attributes a long and partially fictitious history to Helsingør.

The [[Sound Dues]] were abolished in 1857 with the [[1857 Copenhagen Convention|Copenhagen Convention]], where all naval nations agreed to pay a one-time fee.

The oldest known fortified building of Helsingør is ''Flynderborg'', an early medieval fortress situated on a hill just south of the medieval city.

Around 1200, the first church, [[St. Olaf's Church, Helsingør|Saint Olaf's Church]], was built.&lt;ref name=&quot;TouristBoard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visithelsingor.dk/ENGELSK/mainmenu.html|title=Helsingør Turistbureau - Victoria Design|website=Visithelsingor.dk|accessdate=21 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828200051/http://www.visithelsingor.dk/ENGELSK/mainmenu.html|archive-date=28 August 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A number of convents once surrounded the church, but now all that remains is the church building, today the cathedral of the [[Diocese of Helsingør]]. The oldest parts of the cathedral of Helsingør date back to the 13th century and tell us that the fishing village, as Helsingør was then, had grown to a town of importance.

In [[World War II]], Helsingør was among the most important transport points for the rescue of Denmark's [[Judaism|Jewish population]] during the [[Holocaust]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] had ordered that all Danish Jews were to be arrested and deported to the [[concentration camps]] on [[Rosh HaShanah]], the Jewish New Year which fell on 2 October 1943. When [[Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz]], a diplomatic attaché of [[Nazi]] Germany to Denmark, received word of the order on 28 September 1943, he shared it with political and Jewish community leaders. Using the name [[Elsinore Sewing Club]] (Danish: ''Helsingør Syklub'') as a cover for messages, the Danish population formed an [[underground railroad]] of sorts, moving Jews away from the closely watched [[Copenhagen]] docks to spots further away, especially Helsingør, just two miles across the [[Øresund]] from [[Helsingborg]] in neutral [[Sweden]]. Hundreds of civilians hid their fellow Danish citizens—Jews—in their houses, farm lofts and churches until they could board them onto Danish fishing boats, personal pleasure boats and ferry boats. Over the course of three nights, Danes had smuggled over 7,200 Jews and 680 non-Jews (gentile family members of Jews or political activists) across the Øresund, to safety in Helsingborg and [[Malmö]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;historia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/rescue-of-the-danish-jews-evacuation-effects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
The car ferry line between Helsingør and [[Helsingborg]], [[Scania]], [[Sweden]] is the busiest in the world with more than 70 departures in each direction every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directferries.co.uk/helsingborg_ferry.htm|title=Helsingborg ferry, compare prices, times and book tickets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Directferries.co.uk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route is known as the [[HH Ferry route]] and has been sailed by several shipping lines throughout history. The car ferry terminal is connected to the town's [[Helsingør station|main railway station]]. From the station, trains depart to [[Copenhagen]] every 20 minutes. Trains also depart to [[Hillerød]] and [[Gilleleje]]. There are another six stations or train stops within the city and connected suburbs. Apart from ''Helsingør Station and Ferry Terminal'' also ''Snekkersten station'', ''Espergærde station'', ''Mordrup station'' and the train stops at the line to Gilleleje,  ''Grønnehave'', ''Marienlyst'' and ''Højstrup''.&lt;ref&gt;Google maps&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviatrafik.dk/dinrejse/kort/trafikkort/Documents/Hovedstadsomraadet/BusserHelsingor.pdf|title=Forside - DOT|website=Moviatrafik.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[European route E47|E47 motorway]] towards Copenhagen begins just outside the city limits. The town and surrounding areas also have a network of local and regional buses.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviatrafik.dk/dinrejse/kort/Pages/Kort.aspx?direction_gid=9014200080210000&amp;line_name=802&amp;linegid=9011200080200000|title=Forside - DOT|website=Moviatrafik.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrialisation==
For a century the [[:da:Helsingør Skibsværft og Maskinbyggeri|Helsingør Værft]] or Elsinore shipyard was a prominent landmark, which covered the whole area between the town and Kronborg Castle. It was founded in 1882. At its height in 1957, it had 3,600 employees. The last ship left the shipyard in 1983 and it closed the same year following substantial losses.

The [[:da:Wiibroe|Wiibroe]] brewery, founded in 1840, was the second brewery in Denmark to ship bottled beer, just three years after [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]. The last beer was brewed at [[:da:Wiibroe|Wiibroe]] in Helsingør in 1998. [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] continues to brew beer under the Wiibroe Årgangsøl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/brands/Pages/WiibroeAArgangsoel.aspx|title=Carlsberg Group - Wiibroe Årgangsøl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Carlsberggroup.com|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; label.

==Post-industrialisation==
[[File:Kulturhavn kronborg opened May 2013.jpg|thumb|360px|right|[[Culture Harbour Kronborg]]]]
[[File:&quot;Han&quot; by Elmgreen and Dragset.jpg|thumb|360px|right|''Han'' by Elmgreen and Dragset]]
After the end of the industrial era, the town of Helsingør had to redefine itself, and came up with an ambitious project: [[Kulturhavn Kronborg]], literally &quot;Culture-harbour of Kronborg&quot;. It officially opened on 26 May 2013, intended to appeal to tourists with an interest in culture. The main attraction of [[Kulturhavn Kronborg]] is [[Kronborg Castle]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Besides the historical attractions of the site, [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'' has been performed annually in its courtyard since 1937. There is a longstanding tradition of performing the play in English, and notable actors in the title role have included [[Laurence Olivier]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Derek Jacobi]], and in 2009 [[Jude Law]]. At the heart of [[Kulturhavn Kronborg]] lies [[kulturværftet]] or The Culture Yard, a new cultural centre and a public library located in the old [[:da:Helsingør Skibsværft og Maskinbyggeri|dockyard]]. It opened in 2010. The former [[dry dock]] now houses the [[Danish Maritime Museum]].

In the centre of the harbour basin stands the polished steel sculpture ''Han'' (''He'') by artist duo [[Elmgreen and Dragset]], commissioned by the City of Helsingør in 2012. It was inaugurated by then Minister of culture, [[Uffe Elbæk]], in June 2012. It is seen as the counterpart (and even little brother) to [[Edvard Eriksen]]'s world-famous ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue in [[Copenhagen]], and has caused both praise and protests among locals.

The Swedish city of [[Helsingborg]] lies a short distance across the [[Øresund]] from Helsingør, approximately {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}}. [[European route E55]] joins the two cities; [[ferry|ferries]] connect the two sides.

==Architecture==
[[File:Helsingør Rådhus.jpg|thumb|left|Helsingør City Hall]]

The new [[Danish Maritime Museum]] was designed by Danish prize-winning architects [[Bjarke Ingels Group]] (BIG).

[[Jørn Utzon]] lived in Helsingør in his youth because his father was an engineer at [[:da:Helsingør Skibsværft og Maskinbyggeri|Helsingør Værft]]. Utzon designed The [[Kingo Houses]] (1956–60) and The Hammershøj Care Centre (1962) in the city. The project was completed by Birger Schmidt (1966) after Utzon moved to Sydney to work on the [[Sydney Opera House]].
