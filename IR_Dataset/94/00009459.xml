It is located almost exactly in the centre of the county, between the Upper and Lower sections of [[Lough Erne]]. It had a population of 13,823 at the [[United Kingdom census, 2011|2011 Census]].&lt;ref name=Census2011&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/public/AreaProfileReportViewer.aspx?FromAPAddressMulipleRecords=Enniskillen@Exact%20match%20of%20location%20name:%20@Exact%20Match%20Of%20Location%20Name:%20%20Enniskillen@23? | title = Census 2011 Population Statistics for Enniskillen Settlement | publisher = [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] | accessdate = 5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the seat of local government for the former [[Fermanagh District Council]], and is the [[county town]] of Fermanagh as well as its largest town.

== History ==
[[File:Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh, late 19th century (7595791674).jpg|thumb|250px|Enniskillen in the late 19th century]]
The town's name comes from the {{lang-ga|Inis Ceithleann}}. This refers to [[Cethlenn]], a figure in [[Irish mythology]] who may have been a goddess. Local legend has it that Cethlenn was wounded in battle by an arrow and attempted to swim across the [[River Erne]], which surrounds the island, but she never reached the other side, so the island was named in reference to her. It has been [[anglicisation|anglicised]] many ways over the centuries – ''Iniskellen'', ''Iniskellin'', ''Iniskillin'', ''Iniskillen'', ''Inishkellen'', ''Inishkellin'', ''Inishkillin'', ''Inishkillen'' and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/?text=enniskillen&amp;placeID=1167106|title=Bunachar Logainmneacha na hÉireann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town's oldest building is [[Enniskillen Castle]], built by Hugh (Maguire) the Hospitable who died in 1428.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Rogers|title=Prospect of Fermanagh|publisher=Watergate Press, Enniskillen|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earthwork, the Skonce on the shore of [[Lough Erne]], may be the remains of an earlier [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte]]. The castle was the stronghold of the junior branch of the [[Maguire (surname)|Maguire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/articles/MaguiresDuffysHibernian2-10/index.php|title=The Maguires of Fermanagh|website=www.libraryireland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Watergate (architecture)|watergate]] was built around 1580 by [[Cú Chonnacht Maguire]], though subsequent lowering of the level of the lough has left it without water. The strategic position of the castle made its capture important for the English in 1593, to support their plans for the control of [[Ulster]]. The castle was [[Siege of Enniskillen (1594)|besieged three times in 1594–95]]. The English, led by a Captain Dowdall, captured it in February 1594. Maguire then laid siege to it, and defeated a relieving force at the [[Battle of the Ford of the Biscuits]] at Drumane Bridge on the [[Arney River]]. Although the defenders were relieved, Maguire gained possession of the castle from 1595 to 1598 and it was not finally captured by the English until 1607.

This was part of a wider campaign to bring the province of Ulster under English control; the final capture of Enniskillen Castle in 1607 was followed by the [[Plantation of Ulster]], during which the lands of the native Irish were seized and handed over to planters loyal to the English Crown. The Maguires were supplanted by William Cole, originally from [[Devon]], who was appointed by James I to build an English settlement there.

Captain Cole was installed as Constable and strengthened the castle wall and built a &quot;fair house&quot; on the old foundation as the centre point of the county town. The first Protestant parish church was erected on the hilltop in 1627. The [[Portora Royal School|Royal Free School of Fermanagh]] was moved onto the island in 1643. The first bridges were drawbridges; permanent bridges were not installed before 1688.

By 1689 the town had grown significantly. During the conflict which resulted from the ousting of King [[James II of England|James II]] by his Protestant rival, [[William III of England|William III]], Enniskillen and [[siege of Derry|Derry]] were the focus of Williamite resistance in Ireland, including the nearby [[Battle of Newtownbutler]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Witherow|Witherow, Thomas]]. [http://www.libraryireland.com/Derry1689/VI-1.php &quot;The Defence of Enniskillen&quot;]. ''Derry and Enniskillen in the Year 1689''. Library Ireland. Retrieved 24 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enniskillen and Derry were the two garrisons in Ulster that were not wholly loyal to James II, and it was the last town to fall before the siege of Derry. As a direct result of this conflict, Enniskillen developed not only as a market town but also as a garrison, which became home to two regiments.

The current site of Fermanagh College (now part of the South West College) was the former Enniskillen Gaol.  Many people were tried and hanged in the square during the times of public execution. Part of the old Gaol is still used by the college.

=== Military history ===
[[File:Enniskillen Castle by Paride.JPG|thumb|[[Enniskillen Castle]]]]
Enniskillen is the site of the foundation of two [[British Army]] regiments:
* [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]]
* [[The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons)]]

The town's name (with the archaic spelling) continues to form part of the title to [[The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling) 83rd and 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]. [[Enniskillen Castle]] features on the cap badge of both regiments.

=== The Troubles ===
{{main|The Troubles in Enniskillen}}

Enniskillen was the site of several events during [[The Troubles]], the most notable being the [[Remembrance Day bombing]] in which 11 people were killed. [[Bill Clinton]] opened the Clinton centre in 2002 on the site of the bombing. The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] claimed responsibility for the attack.

=== Alleged sexual abuse and assault ===
In 2019, at least nine men reported to the police and the press and said in public forums that, in the 1980s and 90s, when they were children, they were repeatedly molested and raped by a [[paedophile]] ring of at least 20 men in the Enniskillen area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50550996|title=Victim of alleged paedophile ring speaks out|last=Grandjean|first=Stephen Dempster and Guy|date=2019-11-26|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48150317|title=Police unit to examine historic sex abuse|date=2019-05-03|access-date=2019-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18003425.public-meeting-enniskillen-hears-alleged-sex-abuse-victims/|title=Public meeting in Enniskillen hears from alleged sex abuse victims|website=Impartial Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/child-sex-abuse-in-fermanagh-was-an-open-secret-claim-victims-1.4032807|title=Child sex abuse in Fermanagh was an ‘open secret’, claim victims|last=Edwards|first=Rodney|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Investigations are continuing.

=== Miscellaneous ===
* [[The Enniskillen Dragoon]] is a famous Irish folk song associated with the [[Inniskilling Dragoons|Inniskilling Dragoons Regiment]]. [[Tommy Makem]] wrote additional verses and re-named the song [[Fare Thee Well, Enniskillen]]. 

* [[The Chieftains]] sing a song that mentions Enniskillen titled &quot;North Amerikay&quot;.

* [[Jim Kerr]] of [[Simple Minds]] was so moved by the horror of the [[Enniskillen bombing]] in 1987 that he wrote new words to the traditional folk song &quot;[[She Moved Through The Fair]]&quot; and the group recorded it with the name &quot;[[Belfast Child]]&quot;. The recording reached No. 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Charts]], Ireland and several other countries in 1989. The single was taken from the album ''[[Street Fighting Years]]''; the single version was also published with the title &quot;Ballad of the Streets&quot;. The video to the song was shot in black and white and displays poignant footage of children and the destruction of the bombing.  Similarly, [[U2]] held a concert the same day as the bombing; during a performance of their song &quot;[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]&quot;, singer [[Bono]] passionately condemned the bombing, stating &quot;fuck the revolution&quot; in his mid-song speech. The footage is included in U2's [[rockumentary]] ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RH&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=U2, Phil Joanou (director)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096328|title=U2: Rattle and Hum|medium=DVD|publisher=Paramount|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Neil Hannon]] also mentions Enniskillen in his song &quot;[[Sunrise (Divine Comedy song)|Sunrise]]&quot;. 

* The [[Irish language]] novel ''Mo Dhá Mhicí'' by Séamus Mac Annaidh is set in Enniskillen.

== Twinning ==
Enniskillen was originally twinned with Brackwede – a Bielefeld suburb – where the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards|Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]] were stationed in the late 1950s when the twinning was initiated; however, this suburb was incorporated into Stadt [[Bielefeld]] in 1973, the city with which Enniskillen is now officially twinned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bielefeld.de/de/rv/partner/ |title=Städtepartnerschaften |website=www.bielefeld.de |language=German |accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/13867677.Fermanagh_people_help_to_celebrate_twin_town_rsquo_s_800th_anniversary/|title=Fermanagh people help to celebrate twin town’s 800th anniversary|work=The Impartial Reporter|date=2 August 2014|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the twinning arrangements are still operational, at a meeting of the Regeneration and Community Committee, in February 2018, it was agreed that the twinning arrangements would be formally terminated at the end of the Council term in June 2018. However, [[Fermanagh and Omagh District Council]] still have plans to send representatives to Brackwede for the 60th anniversary celebrations of the twinning. Therefore, the future of the twinning is now somewhat unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fermanaghherald.com/2018/09/looks-like-auf-wiedersehen-to-enniskillens-twin-town/|title=Looks like Auf Wiedersehen to Enniskillen’s twin town|date=1 September 2018|website=The Fermanagh Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;
