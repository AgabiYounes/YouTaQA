{{Greek Alphabet|letter=eta}}
'''Eta''' (uppercase '''{{Script|Grek|Η}}''', lowercase '''{{Script|Grek|η}}'''; {{lang-grc|ἦτα}} ''ē̂ta'' {{IPA-el|êːtaː|}} or {{lang-ell|ήτα}} ''ita'' {{IPA-el|ˈita|}}) is the seventh letter of the [[Greek alphabet]]. Originally denoting  [[Heta (letter)|a consonant]] /h/, its sound value in the classical [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]] of [[Ancient Greek]] was a long vowel [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|[ɛː]}}]], raised to {{IPA-el|i|}} in hellenistic Greek, a process known as [[iotacism]].

In the ancient [[Attic numerals|Attic number system]] (Harodianic or acrophonic numbers), the number 100 was represented by &quot;{{Script|Grek|Η}}&quot;, because it was the initial of ''ΗΕΚΑΤΟΝ'', the ancient spelling of ''ἑκατόν'' = &quot;one hundred&quot;.  In the latter system of (Classical) [[Greek numerals]] it has a value of 8. 

Eta was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician letter]] [[heth]] [[File:Phoenician heth.svg|20px]]. Letters that arose from eta include the Latin [[H]] and the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter [[I (Cyrillic)|И]].

==History==

===Consonant h===

{{main|Heta (letter)}}
The letter shape 'H' was originally used in most Greek dialects to represent the sound /h/, a [[voiceless glottal fricative]]. In this function, it was borrowed in the 8th century BC by the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan and other Old Italic alphabets]], which were based on the [[Cumaean alphabet|Euboean]] form of the Greek alphabet. This also gave rise to the Latin alphabet with its letter [[H]].

Other regional variants of the Greek alphabet ([[epichoric alphabets]]), in dialects that still preserved the sound /h/, employed various glyph shapes for consonantal ''heta'' side by side with the new vocalic ''eta'' for some time. 
In the southern Italian colonies of [[Heraclea Lucania|Heracleia]] and [[Taranto|Tarentum]], the letter shape was reduced to a &quot;half-heta&quot; lacking the right vertical stem (Ͱ). From this sign later developed the sign for [[rough breathing]] or ''spiritus asper'',  which brought back the marking of the  /h/ sound into the standardized post-classical ([[Greek diacritics|polytonic]]) orthography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas&quot;&gt;[http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/unicode_aitch.html Nick Nicholas (2003), &quot;Greek /h/&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130901210905/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis//unicode/unicode_aitch.html |date=2013-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Dionysius Thrax]] in the second century BC records that the letter name was still pronounced ''heta'' (ἥτα), correctly explaining this irregularity by stating &quot;in the old days the letter Η served to stand for the rough breathing, as it still does with the Romans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|παρὰ τοῖς ἀρχαίοις ὁ τύπος τοῦ Η ἐν τύπῳ δασείας ἔκειτο, ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν &lt;παρὰ&gt; τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις}} 
Alfredus Hilgard (ed), &quot;In artis Dionysianae §6&quot; in ''Grammatici Graeci. Scholia in Dionysii Thracis Artem Grammaticam'' (1901), p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long e===
In the East [[Ionic dialect]], however, the sound /h/ disappeared by the sixth century BC, and the letter was re-used initially to represent a development of a long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}}, which later merged in East Ionic with  {{IPA|/ɛː/}} instead.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 403 BC, [[Athens]] took over the Ionian spelling system and with it the vocalic use of H (even though it still also had the /h/ sound itself at that time). This later became the standard orthography in all of Greece.

===Itacism===
During the time of post-classical [[Koiné Greek]], the {{IPA|/ɛː/}} sound represented by eta was [[Vowel height|raised]] and merged with several other formerly distinct vowels, a phenomenon called ''iotacism'' or ''[[itacism]]'', after the new pronunciation of the letter name as ''ita'' instead of ''eta''.

Itacism is continued into [[Modern Greek]], where the letter name  is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈita]}} and represents the sound /i/ (a [[close front unrounded vowel]]). It shares this function with several other letters ([[Iota|ι]], [[Upsilon|υ]]) and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] (ει, οι), which are all pronounced alike. This phenomenon at large is called [[iotacism]].

===Cyrillic script===
Eta was also borrowed with the sound value of [i] into the [[Cyrillic script]], where it gave rise to the Cyrillic letter [[I (Cyrillic)|И]].

==Uses==

===Letter===
In [[Modern Greek]], due to [[iotacism]], the letter (pronounced {{IPA-el|ˈita|}}) represents a [[close front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/i/}}. In [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]], it represented a long [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]], {{IPA|/ɛː/}}.

===Symbol===

====Upper case====
The uppercase letter Η is used as a symbol in [[textual criticism]] for the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (from [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]], its once-supposed editor).

In [[chemistry]], the letter H as symbol of [[enthalpy]] sometimes is said to be a Greek eta, but since enthalpy comes from ἐνθάλπος, which begins in a smooth breathing and epsilon, it is more likely a Latin [[H]] for 'heat'.

In information theory the uppercase Greek letter H is used to represent the concept of [[Entropy_(information_theory)#Definition|entropy]] of a discrete random variable.

====Lower case====
The lowercase letter η is used as a symbol in:
*[[Thermodynamics]], the efficiency of a [[Carnot heat engine]], or [[packing density|packing fraction]].
*[[Chemistry]], the [[hapticity]], or the number of atoms of a ligand attached to one coordination site of the metal in a [[coordination compound]]. For example, an [[allyl group]] can coordinate to [[palladium]] in the η¹ mode (only one atom of an allyl group attached to palladium) or the η³ mode (3 atoms attached to palladium).
*[[Optics]], the [[electromagnetic impedance]] of a medium, or the [[quantum efficiency]] of detectors.
*[[Particle physics]], to represent the [[η meson]]s.
*[[Particle physics|Experimental particle physics]], η stands for [[pseudorapidity]].
*[[Cosmology]], η represents [[conformal time]]; dt = adη.
*[[Cosmology]], [[Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis#Baryon–photon ratio|baryon–photon ratio]].
*[[Theory of relativity|Relativity]] and [[Quantum field theory]] (physics), η (with two subscripts) represents the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of [[Minkowski space]] (flat spacetime).
*[[Statistics]], ''η''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the &quot;partial regression coefficient&quot;. ''η'' is the symbol for the linear predictor of a [[generalized linear model]], and can also be used to denote the median of a population, or thresholding parameter in Sparse Partial Least Squares regression.
*[[Economics]], ''η'' is the [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]].
*[[Astronomy]], the seventh-brightest (usually) star in a [[constellation]]. ''See'' [[Bayer designation]].
*Mathematics, η-conversion, see [[lambda calculus#η-conversion|lambda calculus]]
*Mathematics, the [[Dirichlet eta function]], [[Dedekind eta function]], and [[Weierstrass eta function]].
*In [[category theory]], the unit of an [[Adjoint functors#Counit-unit adjunction|adjunction]] or [[Monad (category theory)#Formal definition|monad]] is usually denoted ''η''.
*[[Biology]], a [[DNA polymerase]] found in higher [[eukaryotes]] and implicated in Translesion Synthesis.
*[[Artificial neural network|Neural network]] [[backpropagation]], and [[stochastic gradient descent]] more generally, η stands for the [[learning rate]].
*[[Telecommunications]], η stands for efficiency
*[[Electronics]], η stands for the ideality factor of a [[bipolar transistor]], and has a value close to 1.000.  It appears in contexts where the transistor is used as a temperature sensing device, e.g. the thermal &quot;diode&quot; transistor that is embedded within a computer's microprocessor.
*[[Power electronics]], η stands for the efficiency of a [[power supply]], defined as the output power divided by the input power.
*[[Atmospheric science]], η represents [[Vorticity#Atmospheric sciences|absolute atmospheric vorticity]].
*[[Rheology]], η represents [[viscosity]].
*[[Oceanography]], η is the measurement (usually in metres) of sea-level height above or below the mean sea-level at that same location.
