{{See also|History of Ethiopia}}
Though the issuing of minted coins didn't begin until around 270, metal coins may have been used in [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]] centuries prior to centralized minting. The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' mentions that Aksum imported brass &quot;which they use[d] for ornaments and for cutting as money&quot;, and that they imported &quot;a little money (''[[Denarius|denarion]]'') for [use with] foreigners who live there.&quot; Some outside influences encouraging the use of coins is undeniable. [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Himyar]]ite, and [[Kushan Empire|Kushana]] coins have all been found in major Aksumite cities. The minting of coins began around 270 [[Common Era|CE]], beginning with the reign of [[Endubis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.dskmariam.org/artsandlitreature/litreature/pdf/aksum.pdf|title=Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart C.|date=1991|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748601066|location=|pages=151–154|language=en|oclc=24695872|quote=|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 5th–8th century, the coffee plant was introduced into the [[Arab world]] from Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsX5i56JXI0C|title=Plant-Parasitic Nematodes of Coffee|last=Souza|first=Ricardo M.|date=2 September 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402087202|pages=3, 165|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Coffea arabica]]'', the most highly regarded species, is native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia.

Following the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy a marxist military government nationalized all companies and land, expelled foreign investors, and pursued an extensive military expenditure. The Ethiopian economy significantly deteriorated due to the [[Ethiopian Civil War|civil war]] and [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famines]] of the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1991, the Ethiopian government has embarked on a program of economic reform, including privatization of state enterprises and rationalization of government regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seid|first=Yared|last2=Taffesse|first2=Alemayehu S.|last3=Ali|first3=Seid Nuru|date=8 November 2016|title=Ethiopia—an agrarian economy in transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNyACwAAQBAJhttps://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/global_20160816_ethiopia_economy.pdf|language=en|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815729501|oclc=961309230|ref=harv|work=Africa's Lions: Growth Traps and Opportunities for Six African Economies}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the process is still ongoing, the reforms have attracted much-needed foreign direct investment.

In 2015, Ethiopia has 2,700 millionaires, a number that has more than doubled since 2007. Their fortunes are mainly built in niches of economic rents (banks, mines, etc.) without investing in structural and strategic sectors (industrial production, infrastructure, etc.) and should in no way promote economic development or represent a source of [[competition]] for Western multinationals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2017/11/PIOT/58045&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ethiopian government is stepping up its efforts to attract foreign investors, particularly in the textile sector. They can now import their machines without customs duties, benefit from a tax exemption for ten years, rents much lower than market prices and almost free water and electricity. Major brands have established themselves in the country, such as Decathlon, H&amp;M and Huajian. These companies also benefit from a cheap labour force, with a monthly salary of around 35 euros. Finally, trade agreements between Ethiopia and the European Union allow them to export duty-free.&lt;ref&gt;https://mondediplo.com/2019/04/06ethopia-box&lt;/ref&gt;

Production is overwhelmingly of a subsistence nature, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include [[coffee production in Ethiopia|coffee]], [[Pulse (legume)|pulse]]s (e.g., beans), [[rapeseed|oilseeds]], [[cereal]]s, potatoes, [[sugarcane]], and vegetables.  Exports are almost entirely agricultural commodities, with coffee as the largest foreign exchange earner, and its flower industry becoming a new source of revenue: for 2005/2006 (the latest year available) Ethiopia's coffee exports represented 0.9% of the world exports, and oilseeds and flowers each representing 0.5%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22219.0 &quot;The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia: Selected Issues Series&quot;], International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 08/259, pp. 35f (Retrieved 4 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9304411 | work=The Economist | title=Get the gangsters out of the food chain | date=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Ethiopia's [[livestock]] contributed to 19% of total GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livestock Sector Brief: Ethiopia|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/resources/en/publications/sector_briefs/lsb_ETH.pdf|work=FAO Country Profiles|publisher=FAO|accessdate=7 November 2011|author=Food and Agriculture Organization|authorlink=Food and Agriculture Organization|page=1|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest products are mainly logs used in construction. The [[Silviculture|silvicutural]] properties are used in [[construction]] and [[manufacturing]], and as [[Energy development|energy sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wakjira|first=Dereje T.|last2=Gole|first2=Tadesse W.|year=2007|title=Customary Forest Tenure in Southwest Ethiopia|journal=Forests, Trees and Livelihoods|volume=17|issue=4|pages=325–338|doi=10.1080/14728028.2007.9752607|issn=1472-8028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silviculture in the Tropics|last=Lemenih|first=Mulugeta|last2=Bongers|first2=Frans|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642199851|editor-last=Günter|editor-first=Sven|series=Tropical Forestry|volume=8|pages=261–272|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-19986-8_17|editor-last2=Weber|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Stimm|editor-first3=Bernd|editor-last4=Mosandl|editor-first4=Reinhard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethiopia's [[Fishery|fisheries]] are entirely [[fresh water]], as it has no marine [[coast]]line. Although total production has been continuously increasing since 2007, the fishing industry is a very small part of the economy. Fishing is predominantly [[Artisanal fishing|artisanal]]. In 2014, nearly 45,000 fishermen were employed in the sector with only 30% of them employed full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/facp/ETH/en|title=Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture - Country Profile|authors=Fisheries and Aquaculture Department|date=1 October 2015|series=Ethiopia|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170111113716/http://www.fao.org/fishery/facp/ETH/en|archive-date=11 January 2017|url-status=live|access-date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile industry ===

Employees of Ethiopian garment factories, who work for brands such as [[Guess]], [[H&amp;M]] or [[Calvin Klein]], receive a monthly salary of 26 dollars per month. These very low wages have led to low productivity, frequent strikes and high turnover. Some factories have replaced all their employees on average every 12 months, according to the 2019 report of the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at [[New York University]]

The report states:&quot; Rather than the docile and cheap labour force promoted in Ethiopia, foreign-based suppliers have met employees who are unhappy with their pay and living conditions and who want to protest more and more by stopping work or even quitting. In their eagerness to create a &quot;made in Ethiopia&quot; brand, the government, global brands and foreign manufacturers did not anticipate that the base salary was simply too low for workers to make a living from. »&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2019/05/08/en-ethiopie-les-petites-mains-de-h-m-ou-calvin-klein-gagnent-23-euros-par-mois_5459655_3212.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minerals and mining===
{{main|Mining in Ethiopia}}
The mining sector is small in Ethiopia. The country has deposits of [[coal]], [[opal]], [[gemstones]], [[kaolin]], [[Iron ore in Africa|iron ore]], [[soda ash]], and [[tantalum]], but only [[gold]] is mined in significant quantities. In 2001 gold production amounted to some 3.4 tons.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; [[Salt]] extraction from salt beds in the [[Afar Depression]], as well as from salt springs in [[Dire (woreda)|Dire]] and [[Afder (woreda)|Afder]] districts in the south, is only of internal importance and only a negligible amount is exported.

On 30 August 2012 it was announced that British firm [[Nyota Minerals]] was about to become the first foreign company to receive a mining licence to extract gold from an estimated resource of 52 tonnes in western Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/30/gold-mining-boost-ethiopia-development   Matthew Newsome, &quot;Gold mining promises big boost for Ethiopia's development&quot;, ''The Guardian'' (30 August 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy===
{{main|Energy in Ethiopia}}
Waterpower and forests are Ethiopia's main energy sources. The country derives about 90 percent of its electricity needs from hydropower, which means that electricity generation, as with agriculture, is dependent on abundant rainfall. Present installed capacity is rated at about 2000 megawatts, with planned expansion to 10,000 megawatts. In general, Ethiopians rely on forests for nearly all of their energy and construction needs; the result has been [[Ethiopian deforestation|deforestation]] of much of the highlands during the last three decades.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Less than one-half of Ethiopia's towns and cities are connected to the national grid. Petroleum requirements are met via imports of refined products, although some oil is being hauled overland from Sudan. Oil exploration in Ethiopia has been underway for decades, ever since Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] granted a 50-year concession to [[SOCONY-Vacuum]] in September 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,854515,00.html &quot;Sinco Places a Bet&quot;], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 17 September 1945 (Retrieved 14 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent oil and gas discoveries across East Africa have seen the region emerge as a new player in the global oil and gas industry. As exciting as the huge gas fields of East Africa are, however, the strong decline in oil prices and expectations for an L-shaped recovery with low prices over the coming years are increasingly challenging the economic viability of the industry in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is East Africa's gas asset boom about to go bust?|url = http://www.mineweb.com/articles-by-type/independent-viewpoint/is-east-africas-gas-asset-boom-about-to-go-bust/|website = Mineweb|access-date = 18 February 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Africa's exports by region {{!}} Bright Africa|url = http://www.riscura.com/brightafrica/exports-by-region/#gs.SFnDodg|website = www.riscura.com|access-date = 18 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225100354/http://www.riscura.com/brightafrica/exports-by-region/#gs.SFnDodg|archive-date = 25 February 2016|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reserves are estimated at {{convert|4|Tcuft}}, while exploration for gas and oil is underway in the [[Gambela Region]] bordering Sudan.&lt;ref name=&quot;cp&quot; /&gt;

However, falling global oil prices are threatening the commercial viability of many of these gas prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Oil Prices: What’s Behind the Drop?

===Manufacturing===
{{main|Manufacturing in Ethiopia}}
A program to privatize state-owned enterprises has been underway since the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Ethiopia.pdf Ethiopia country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (April 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a large growth of manufacturing in Ethiopia. Several industrial parks have been built with a focus on textiles. 

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Ethiopia}}
[[File:Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 787-8 ET-AOS FRA 2012-10-28.png|thumb|[[Ethiopian Airlines]] is the largest and most profitable airline in Africa.]]
Prior to the outbreak of the 1998&amp;ndash;2000 [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]], landlocked Ethiopia mainly relied on the seaports of [[Asseb]] and [[Massawa]] in [[Eritrea]] for international trade. {{As of|2005}}, Ethiopia uses the ports of [[Djibouti]], connected to [[Addis Ababa]] by the [[Rail transport in Ethiopia|Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway]], and to a lesser extent [[Port Sudan]] in [[Sudan]].  In May 2005, the Ethiopian government began negotiations to use the port of [[Berbera]] in [[Somaliland]].

The Ethiopian railway network has been rapidly expanding. In 2015, the first light rail in Africa was opening in Addis Ababa. In 2017, the electric [[Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway|Addis Ababa-Djibouti]] railway began operations. Presently, two other electric railways are under construction: [[Awash–Weldiya Railway|Awash-Woldiya]] and [[Weldiya–Mekelle Railway|Woldiya-Mekelle]].

===Telecommunications===
{{See also|Telecommunications in Ethiopia|Media in Ethiopia|Internet in Ethiopia|label 1=Telecommunications|label 2=Media}}
Telecommunications are provided by a state-owned monopoly, Ethio Telecom, formerly the [[Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation]].

===Tourism===
{{main|Tourism in Ethiopia}}
Aside from wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and communications, the services sector consists almost entirely of tourism. Developed in the 1960s, tourism declined greatly during the later 1970s and the 1980s under the military government. Recovery began in the 1990s, but growth has been constrained by the lack of suitable hotels and other infrastructure, despite a boom in construction of small and medium-sized hotels and restaurants, and by the impact of drought, the 1998–2000 [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War|war with Eritrea]], and the specter of terrorism. In 2002 more than 156,000 tourists entered the country, many of them Ethiopians visiting from abroad, spending more than US$77 million.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;  In 2008, the number of tourists entering the country had increased to 330,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNdata&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=Ethiopia | title=UNdata country profile: Ethiopia | accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Ethiopia was ranked the &quot;World's Best Tourist Destination&quot; by the European Council on Tourism and Trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3160651/Forget-sunny-Spain-enchanting-Thailand-romance-France-Ethiopia-named-World-s-Best-Tourism-Destination.html|title=Ethiopia is named World's Best Tourism Destination|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2013, the major agricultural export crop was [[Coffee production in Ethiopia|coffee]], providing about 26.4% of Ethiopia's foreign exchange earnings. In the beginning of 2014, oilseeds exports have been more important.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiosports.com/2014/06/30/oilseed-overtakes-coffee-as-ethiopias-top-export-earner/ &quot;Oilseed overtakes coffee as Ethiopia’s top export earner&quot;] Ethiosports, 2014. (Retrieved 1 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy. More than 15 million people (25% of the population) derive their livelihood from the coffee sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=279 &quot;Ethiopian coffee: The best in the world?&quot;] African Business, 2001. (Retrieved 24 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exports include live animals, leather and leather products, chemicals, [[gold]], [[legume|pulses]], oilseeds, flowers, fruits and vegetables and [[khat]] (or ''qat''), a leafy [[shrub]] which has psychotropic qualities when chewed. Cross-border trade by pastoralists is often informal and beyond state control and regulation. In [[East Africa]], over 95% of cross-border trade is through unofficial channels and the unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]] and [[Djibouti]] generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot;&gt;Pavanello, Sara 2010.

London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot; /&gt; However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allowing disease to spread more easily across national borders. Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot; /&gt; Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODI&quot; /&gt;

Dependent on a few vulnerable crops for its foreign exchange earnings and reliant on imported oil, Ethiopia lacks sufficient foreign exchange. The financially conservative government has taken measures to solve this problem, including stringent import controls and sharply reduced subsidies on retail gasoline prices. Nevertheless, the largely subsistence economy is incapable of supporting high military expenditures, drought relief, an ambitious development plan, and indispensable imports such as oil; it therefore depends on [[Foreign aid to Ethiopia|foreign assistance]].

In December 1999, Ethiopia signed a $1.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] joint venture deal with the Malaysian oil company, Petronas, to develop a huge natural gas field in the [[Somali Region]]. By the year 2010, however, implementation failed to progress and Petronas sold its share to another oil company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article231616.ece &quot;Petronas sells Ethiopian assets to SouthWest&quot;] Upstream Online news, 6 October 2010. (Retrieved 10 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
