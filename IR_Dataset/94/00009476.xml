Being [[fermion]]s, no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state]], in accordance with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;curtis74&quot;/&gt; Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of [[wave-particle duality|both particles and waves]]: they can collide with other particles and can be [[electron diffraction|diffracted]] like light. The [[#Quantum properties|wave properties of electrons]] are easier to observe with experiments than those of other particles like [[neutron]]s and protons because electrons have a lower mass and hence a longer [[de Broglie wavelength]] for a given energy.

Electrons play an essential role in numerous [[physics|physical]] phenomena, such as [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[chemistry]] and [[thermal conductivity]], and they also participate in [[gravitational wave|gravitational]], [[Lorentz force|electromagnetic]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] [[Fundamental interaction|interactions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anastopoulos1&quot; /&gt; Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding [[electric field]], and if that electron is moving relative to an observer, said observer will observe it to generate a [[magnetic field]]. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources will affect the motion of an electron according to the [[Lorentz force law]]. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of [[photon]]s when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as [[Plasma (physics)|electron plasma]] by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special [[telescope]]s can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as [[electronics]], [[Electron beam welding|welding]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, [[electron microscope]]s, [[radiation therapy]], [[Free-electron laser|lasers]], [[gaseous ionization detectors]] and [[particle accelerator]]s.

Interactions involving electrons with other subatomic particles are of interest in fields such as [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] interaction between the positive [[proton]]s within [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the negative electrons without, allows the composition of the two known as [[atom]]s. Ionization or differences in the proportions of negative electrons versus positive nuclei changes the [[binding energy]] of an atomic system. The exchange or sharing of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of [[chemical bond]]ing.&lt;ref name=Pauling/&gt; In 1838, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] first hypothesized the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the [[Chemical property|chemical properties]] of atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabatzis&quot;/&gt; Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and [[J. J. Thomson]] and his team of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson&quot;/&gt;  Electrons can also participate in [[nuclear reaction]]s, such as [[stellar nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthesis in stars]], where they are known as [[beta particle]]s. Electrons can be created through [[beta decay]] of [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and in high-energy collisions, for instance when [[cosmic ray]]s enter the atmosphere.  The [[antiparticle]] of the electron is called the [[positron]]; it is identical to the electron except that it carries electrical and other [[charge (physics)|charges]] of the opposite sign. When an [[Electron–positron annihilation|electron collides with a positron]], both particles can be [[annihilation|annihilated]], producing [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.

In the early 1700s, French chemist [[Charles François de Cisternay du Fay|Charles François du Fay]] found that if a charged gold-leaf is repulsed by glass rubbed with silk, then the same charged gold-leaf is attracted by amber rubbed with wool. From this and other results of similar types of experiments, du Fay concluded that electricity consists of two [[Aether theories|electrical fluids]], ''vitreous'' fluid from glass rubbed with silk and ''resinous'' fluid from amber rubbed with wool.  These two fluids can neutralize each other when combined.&lt;ref name=Benjamin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher [[Richard Laming]] developed the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by subatomic particles that had unit [[electric charge]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;farrar&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1846, German physicist [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|William Weber]] theorized that electricity was composed of positively and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was governed by the [[Inverse-square law|inverse square law]]. After studying the phenomenon of [[electrolysis]] in 1874, Irish physicist [[George Johnstone Stoney]] suggested that there existed a &quot;single definite quantity of electricity&quot;, the charge of a [[Valence (chemistry)|monovalent]] [[ion]]. He was able to estimate the value of this elementary charge ''e'' by means of [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stoney believed these charges were permanently attached to atoms and could not be removed. In 1881, German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] argued that both positive and negative charges were divided into elementary parts, each of which &quot;behaves like atoms of electricity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabatzis&quot;&gt;

Stoney initially coined the term ''electrolion'' in 1881. Ten years later, he switched to ''electron'' to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894: &quot;... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable fundamental unit of electricity, for which I have since ventured to suggest the name ''electron''&quot;. A 1906 proposal to change to ''electrion'' failed because [[Hendrik Lorentz]] preferred to keep ''electron''.&lt;ref&gt;

The discovery of electrons by Joseph Thomson was closely tied with the experimental and theoretical research of cathode rays for decades by many physicists.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabatzis&quot;/&gt;  While studying electrical conductivity in [[wikt:rarefied|rarefied]] gases in 1859, the German physicist [[Julius Plucker]] observed that the phosphorescent light, which was caused by radiation emitted from the cathode, appeared at the tube wall near the cathode, and the region of the phosphorescent light could be moved by application of a magnetic field.  In 1869, Plucker's student [[Johann Wilhelm Hittorf]] found that a solid body placed in between the cathode and the phosphorescence would cast a shadow upon the phosphorescent region of the tube.  Hittorf inferred that there are straight rays emitted from the cathode and that the phosphorescence was caused by the rays striking the tube walls.  In 1876, the German physicist [[Eugen Goldstein]] showed that the rays were emitted perpendicular to the cathode surface, which distinguished between the rays that were emitted from the cathode and the incandescent light.  Goldstein dubbed the rays [[cathode ray]]s.&lt;ref name=Whittaker&gt;{{citation|last=Whittaker|first= E. T.|title=A history of the theories of aether and electricity.

During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir [[William Crookes]] developed the first cathode ray tube to have a [[vacuum|high vacuum]] inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;dekosky&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then showed in 1874 that the cathode rays can turn a small paddle wheel when placed in their path.  Therefore, he concluded that the rays carried momentum. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged.&lt;ref name=&quot;leicester&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, he proposed that these properties could be explained by regarding cathode rays as composed of negatively charged gaseous [[molecule]]s in fourth state of matter in which the mean free path of the particles is so long that collisions may be ignored.&lt;ref name=Whittaker/&gt;{{rp|394–395}}

The German-born British physicist [[Arthur Schuster]] expanded upon Crookes' experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and applying an [[electric potential]] between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of [[Electric current|current]], in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the [[Mass-to-charge ratio|charge-to-mass ratio]]&lt;!-- Note: the older sources list charge-to-mass rather than the modern mass-to-charge ratio --&gt; of the ray components. However, this produced a value that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;leicester&quot;/&gt;

In 1892 [[Hendrik Lorentz]] suggested that the mass of these particles (electrons) could be a consequence of their electric charge.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Wilczek: &quot;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=happy-birthday-electron Happy Birthday, Electron]&quot; ''Scientific American'', June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J.J Thomson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J. J. Thomson]]]]
While studying naturally [[Fluorescence|fluorescing]] minerals in 1896, the French physicist [[Henri Becquerel]] discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials became the subject of much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist [[Ernest Rutherford]] who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles [[alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle|beta]], on the basis of their ability to penetrate matter.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1897, the British physicist [[J. J. Thomson]], with his colleagues [[John Sealy Townsend|John S. Townsend]] and [[Harold A. Wilson (physicist)|H. A.

The electron's charge was more carefully measured by the American physicists [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Harvey Fletcher]] in their [[Oil drop experiment|oil-drop experiment]] of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a result of gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team,&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson&quot;/&gt; using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by [[Abram Ioffe]], who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;

By 1914, experiments by physicists [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Henry Moseley]], [[James Franck]] and [[Gustav Ludwig Hertz|Gustav Hertz]] had largely established the structure of an atom as a dense [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;smirnov&quot;/&gt; In 1913, Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]] postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the [[spectral line]]s of the hydrogen atom.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1924, Austrian physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] observed that the shell-like structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that defined every quantum energy state, as long as each state was occupied by no more than a single electron. This prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter, which had two distinct possible values, was provided by the Dutch physicists [[Samuel Goudsmit]] and [[George Uhlenbeck]].  In 1925, they suggested that an electron, in addition to the angular momentum of its orbit, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and [[magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smirnov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Quantum mechanics===
{{see_also|History of quantum mechanics}}
In his 1924 dissertation ''{{lang|fr|Recherches sur la théorie des quanta}}'' (Research on Quantum Theory), French physicist [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that all matter can be represented as a [[Matter wave|de Broglie wave]] in the manner of [[light]].&lt;ref name=&quot;de_broglie&quot;&gt;

In 1927, [[George Paget Thomson]] discovered the interference effect was produced when a beam of electrons was passed through thin metal foils and by American physicists [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] by the reflection of electrons from a crystal of [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;

De Broglie's prediction of a wave nature for electrons led [[Erwin Schrödinger]] to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the influence of the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the [[Schrödinger equation]], successfully described how electron waves propagated.&lt;ref&gt;

This approach led to a second formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1928, building on Wolfgang Pauli's work, [[Paul Dirac]] produced a model of the electron&amp;nbsp;– the [[Dirac equation]], consistent with [[Principle of relativity|relativity]] theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|hamiltonian]] formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1947, [[Willis Lamb]], working in collaboration with graduate student [[Robert Retherford]], found that certain quantum states of the hydrogen atom, which should have the same energy, were shifted in relation to each other; the difference came to be called the [[Lamb shift]]. About the same time, [[Polykarp Kusch]], working with [[Henry M. Foley]], discovered the magnetic moment of the electron is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac's theory. This small difference was later called [[anomalous magnetic dipole moment]] of the electron. This difference was later explained by the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]], developed by [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]], [[Julian Schwinger]] and
[[Richard Feynman]] in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;

On the basis of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s principle of [[mass–energy equivalence]], this mass corresponds to a rest energy of [[Orders of magnitude (energy)#1E-15|0.511&amp;nbsp;MeV]]. The ratio between the mass of a [[proton]] and that of an electron is about 1836.&lt;ref name=nist_codata_mu&gt;

The issue of the radius of the electron is a challenging problem of modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the [[self-energy]] of the electron tending to infinity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eduard Shpolsky]], Atomic physics (Atomnaia fizika), second edition, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Observation of a single electron in a [[Penning trap]] suggests the upper limit of the particle's radius to be 10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;meters.&lt;ref&gt;

There ''is'' also a physical constant called the &quot;[[classical electron radius]]&quot;, with the much larger value of {{val|2.8179|e=-15|u=m}}, greater than the radius of the proton. However, the terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores the effects of [[quantum mechanics]]; in reality, the so-called classical electron radius has little to do with the true fundamental structure of the electron.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The classical electron radius is derived as follows. Assume that the electron's charge is spread uniformly throughout a spherical volume. Since one part of the sphere would repel the other parts, the sphere contains electrostatic potential energy. This energy is assumed to equal the electron's [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], defined by [[special relativity]] (''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
From [[electrostatics]] theory, the [[potential energy]] of a sphere with radius ''r'' and charge ''e'' is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm p} = \frac{e^2}{8\pi \varepsilon_0 r},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]. For an electron with rest mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the rest energy is equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle E_{\mathrm p} = m_0 c^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the speed of light in a vacuum. Setting them equal and solving for ''r'' gives the classical electron radius.&lt;br /&gt;

===Quantum properties===
As with all particles, electrons can act as waves. This is called the [[wave–particle duality]] and can be demonstrated using the [[double-slit experiment]].

The wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be the case for a classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one particle can be described mathematically as a [[complex number|complex]]-valued function, the [[wave function]], commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (''ψ''). When the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|absolute value]] of this function is [[square (algebra)|squared]], it gives the probability that a particle will be observed near a location—a [[probability density function|probability density]].&lt;ref name=&quot;munowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Asymmetricwave2.png|right|thumb|alt=A three dimensional projection of a two dimensional plot. There are symmetric hills along one axis and symmetric valleys along the other, roughly giving a saddle-shape|Example of an antisymmetric wave function for a quantum state of [[Particle in a box|two identical fermions in a 1-dimensional box]]. If the particles swap position, the wave function inverts its sign.]]
Electrons are [[identical particles]] because they cannot be distinguished from each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics, this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, {{nowrap|''ψ''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} −''ψ''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where the variables ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to the first and second electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. [[Boson]]s, such as the photon, have symmetric wave functions instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;munowitz&quot;/&gt;{{rp|162–218}}

In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a [[zero probability]] that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This is responsible for the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.&lt;ref name=&quot;munowitz&quot;/&gt;{{rp|162–218}}

===Virtual particles===

In a simplified picture, every photon spends some time as a combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly [[Annihilation|annihilate]] each other shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;

In effect, the energy needed to create these virtual particles, Δ''E'', can be &quot;borrowed&quot; from the [[Vacuum state|vacuum]] for a period of time, Δ''t'', so that their product is no more than the [[reduced Planck constant]], {{nowrap|''ħ'' ≈ {{val|6.6|e=-16|u=eV·s}}}}.

While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the [[Coulomb's law|coulomb force]] from the ambient [[electric field]] surrounding an electron causes a created positron to be attracted to the original electron, while a created electron experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called [[vacuum polarization]]. In effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a [[Relative permittivity|dielectric permittivity]] more than [[1|unity]]. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing distance from the electron.&lt;ref name=&quot;genz&quot;&gt;

When an electron is moving through a magnetic field, it is subject to the [[Lorentz force]] that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This [[centripetal force]] causes the electron to follow a [[Helix|helical]] trajectory through the field at a radius called the [[gyroradius]]. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;munowitz&quot; /&gt;{{rp|160}}&lt;ref&gt;

Photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in [[quantum electrodynamics]]. An isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate [[conservation of energy]] and [[momentum]].

An inelastic collision between a photon (light) and a solitary (free) electron is called [[Compton scattering]]. This collision results in a transfer of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength of the photon by an amount called the [[Compton scattering|Compton shift]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The change in wavelength, Δ''λ'', depends on the angle of the recoil, ''θ'', as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Delta \lambda = \frac{h}{m_{\mathrm{e}}c} (1 - \cos \theta),&lt;/math&gt;

The relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two charged particles, such as an electron and a proton, is given by the [[fine-structure constant]]. This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by the ratio of two energies: the electrostatic energy of attraction (or repulsion) at a separation of one Compton wavelength, and the rest energy of the charge.

In the theory of [[electroweak interaction]], the [[Chirality (physics)|left-handed]] component of electron's wavefunction forms a [[weak isospin]] doublet with the [[Neutrino|electron neutrino]]. This means that during [[weak interaction]]s, electron neutrinos behave like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a [[charged current]] interaction by emitting or absorbing a {{SubatomicParticle|W boson|link=yes}} and be converted into the other member. Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation. Charged current interactions are responsible for the phenomenon of [[beta decay]] in a [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] atom. Both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a [[neutral current]] interaction via a {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson0|link=yes}} exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino-electron [[elastic scattering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;quigg&quot;&gt;

An electron can be ''bound'' to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an [[ion]]. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an [[atomic orbital]]. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their [[spin quantum number]].

Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in potential.&lt;ref name=Tipler2003/&gt;{{rp|159–160}} Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the [[Auger effect]].&lt;ref&gt;

The orbital angular momentum of electrons is [[Angular momentum operator#Quantization|quantized]]. Because the electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is proportional to the angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each other out.&lt;ref&gt;

If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the [[triboelectric effect]].&lt;ref&gt;

Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ziman&quot; /&gt; which states that the ratio of [[thermal conductivity]] to the electrical conductivity is proportional to the temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|resistivity]] of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.&lt;ref name=&quot;durrant&quot;&gt;

According to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]], as an electron's speed approaches the [[speed of light]], from an observer's point of view its [[Mass in special relativity|relativistic mass]] increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, ''c''. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to ''c''—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than ''c'', the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called [[Cherenkov radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;

The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the [[Lorentz factor]], defined as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\gamma=1/ \sqrt{ 1-{v^2}/{c^2} }&lt;/math&gt; where ''v'' is the speed of the particle. The kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; of an electron moving with velocity ''v'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle K_{\mathrm{e}} = (\gamma - 1)m_{\mathrm{e}} c^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of electron. For example, the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford linear accelerator]] can [[Acceleration|accelerate]] an electron to roughly 51&amp;nbsp;GeV.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first millisecond of the Big Bang, the temperatures were over 10&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s and photons had mean energies over a million [[electronvolt]]s. These photons were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form pairs of electrons and positrons. Likewise, positron-electron pairs annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons:
: {{SubatomicParticle|photon|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|photon}} ↔ {{SubatomicParticle|positron|link=yes}} + {{SubatomicParticle|electron}}
An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained during this phase of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

For reasons that remain uncertain, during the annihilation process there was an excess in the number of particles over antiparticles. Hence, about one electron for every billion electron-positron pairs survived. This excess matched the excess of protons over antiprotons, in a condition known as [[baryon asymmetry]], resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Stellar --&gt;
Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of [[star]]s began to form.&lt;ref name=&quot;science5789&quot;/&gt; Within a star, [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] results in the production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays. The net result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons, and a matching increase in the number of neutrons. However, the process of [[stellar evolution]] can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes. Selected isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron and antineutrino from the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;

However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of [[Hawking radiation]] at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the [[event horizon]] of these [[Compact star|stellar remnants]].

When a pair of virtual particles (such as an electron and positron) is created in the vicinity of the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called [[quantum tunnelling]]. The [[gravitational potential]] of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

For example, in high-energy environments such as the [[corona]] of a star, free electrons form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that radiates energy due to [[Bremsstrahlung]] radiation. Electron gas can undergo [[plasma oscillation]], which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using [[radio telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the [[hydrogen spectral series]].

The last problem limits the resolution to about 10&amp;nbsp;nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the production of small numbers of specialized [[integrated circuit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Linear particle accelerator]]s generate electron beams for treatment of superficial tumors in [[radiation therapy]]. [[Electron therapy]] can treat such skin lesions as [[basal-cell carcinoma]]s because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5&amp;nbsp;cm for electron energies in the range 5–20&amp;nbsp;MeV. An electron beam can be used to supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Particle accelerator]]s use electric fields to propel electrons and their antiparticles to high energies.  These particles emit synchrotron radiation as they pass through magnetic fields. The dependency of the intensity of this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam—a process known as the [[Sokolov–Ternov effect]].{{refn|The polarization of an electron beam means that the spins of all electrons point into one direction. In other words, the projections of the spins of all electrons onto their momentum vector have the same sign.|group=note}} Polarized electron beams can be useful for various experiments. [[Synchrotron]] radiation can also [[Radiation damping|cool]] the electron beams to reduce the momentum spread of the particles.  Electron and positron beams are collided upon the particles' accelerating to the required energies; [[particle detector]]s observe the resulting energy emissions, which [[particle physics]] studies .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Imaging===
[[Low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED) is a method of bombarding a crystalline material with a [[Collimated light|collimated beam]] of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine the structure of the material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200&amp;nbsp;eV.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[electron microscope]] directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.

Two main types of electron microscopes exist: [[Transmission electron microscopy|transmission]] and [[scanning electron microscope|scanning]]. Transmission electron microscopes function like [[overhead projector]]s, with a beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a [[Reversal film|photographic slide]] or a [[charge-coupled device]].  Scanning electron microscopes [[Raster scan|rasteri]] a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The [[scanning tunneling microscope]] uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;bozzola_1999&quot;&gt;

===Other applications===
In the [[free-electron laser]] (FEL), a [[relativistic electron beam]] passes through a pair of [[undulator]]s that contain arrays of [[dipole magnet]]s whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that [[Coherence (physics)|coherently]] interacts with the same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the [[resonance]] frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-[[Radiance|brilliance]] electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of frequencies, from [[microwave]]s to soft X-rays. These devices are used in manufacturing, communication, and in medical applications, such as soft tissue surgery.&lt;ref&gt;
