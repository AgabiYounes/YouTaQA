{{Literature}}
An '''epic poem''', '''epic''', '''epos''', or '''epopee''' is a lengthy [[narrative poem]], ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who, in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces, gave shape to the moral universe for their descendants, the poet and his audience, to understand themselves as a people or nation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'' (Bedford: St. Martin's, 2005), 2128. {{ISBN|0-312-41242-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of epic poetry is [[epyllion]] (plural: epyllia), which is a brief narrative poem with a [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[Mythology|mythological]] [[Theme (literature)|theme]]. The term, which means &quot;little [[:wikt:epic|epic]]&quot;, came into use in the nineteenth century. It refers primarily to the erudite, shorter hexameter poems of the [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic period]] and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the [[neoteric]]s; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Epyllion |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/epyllion |website=www.britannica.com |accessdate=21 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] epyllion is perhaps [[Catullus 64]].

==Etymology==
The English word ''epic'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''epicus'', which itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|ἐπικός}} (''epikos''), from {{lang|grc|ἔπος}} (''epos''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | epic | id=63237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;word, story, poem&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epic Epic] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originating before the invention of writing, primary epics were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances. Hence aside from writers like Dante, Camões, and Milton, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' and Virgil in ''[[Aeneid]]'' adopted and adapted [[Homer]]'s [[Parallels between Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|style and subject matter]], but used devices available only to those who write, and in their works [[Nonnus|Nonnus' ''Dionysiaca'']] and [[Tulsidas]]' ''[[Sri Ramacharit Manas]]'' also used stylistic elements typical of epics.

The oldest epic recognized is the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa|2500–1300 BCE}}), which was recorded in ancient [[Sumer]] during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The poem details the exploits of [[Gilgamesh]], the king of [[Uruk]]. Although recognized as a historical figure, Gilgamesh, as represented in the epic, is a largely legendary or mythical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lawall |editor1-first=Sarah N. |editor2-last=Mack |editor2-first=Maynard |date=1999 |title=Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition |volume=1 |edition=7 |url=https://archive.org/details/nortonanthologyo0001unse_z9t3/page/10 |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The longest epic written is the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which consists of 100,000 [[śloka]]s or over 200,000 verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), as well as long prose passages, so that at ~1.8 million words it is roughly four times the length of the ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', and roughly ten times the length of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lochtefeld2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Famous examples of epic poetry include the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', the Tamil ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', the Persian ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the Ancient Greek ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'', the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the French ''[[Song of Roland]]'', the Spanish ''[[Cantar de mio Cid]]'', the Portuguese [[Os Lusíadas|Os ''Lusíadas'']], the Armenian [[Daredevils of Sassoun]], [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and Adam Mickiewicz's ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.

==Oral epics==
The first epics were products of [[literacy|preliterate]] [[societies]] and [[oral history]] poetic traditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Oral tradition]] was used alongside written scriptures to communicate and facilitate the spread of culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goody1987p82&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://archive.org/details/interfacebetween00good |url-access=registration |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0-521-33794-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/interfacebetween00good/page/110 110]–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these traditions, poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means. Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.

[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Composition and conventions===

In his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race. (Harmon and Holman)&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon and Harmon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An attempt to delineate ten main characteristics of an epic:&lt;ref name=&quot;Harmon and Harmon&quot;&gt;Taken from William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature, 8th ed., Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Begins [[in medias res]].
# The setting is vast, covering many nations, the world or the universe.
# Begins with an invocation to a [[muse]] (epic invocation).
# Begins with a statement of the theme.
# Includes the use of [[epithets]].
# Contains long lists, called an [[epic catalogue]].
# Features long and formal speeches.
# Shows divine intervention in human affairs.
# Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization.
# Often features the tragic hero's descent into the [[underworld]] or [[hell]].

The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates traits, performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are [[recurring character]]s in the legends of their native cultures.

Conventions of epics:{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''Proposition'': Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed &quot;to justify the ways of God to men&quot;); of a question (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which [[Homer]] initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation (as in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Song of Roland]]'', with [[Charlemagne]] in Spain).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''[[Invocation]]'': Writer invokes a [[Muse]], one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]]. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battles|first=Paul|date=2014|title=Toward a Theory of Old English Poetic Genres: Epic, Elegy, Wisdom Poetry, and the &quot;Traditional Opening&quot;|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy|volume=111,1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1353/sip.2014.0001|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This convention is restricted to cultures influenced by European Classical culture. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', for example, or the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' do not contain this element.)
# ''[[In medias res]]'': narrative opens &quot;in the middle of things&quot;, with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
# ''[[Enumeratio]]'': Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.
# ''[[Epithet]]'': Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., [[Epithets in Homer|Homer]]'s &quot;rosy-fingered dawn&quot; and &quot;wine-dark sea&quot;.

== Form ==
Many verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages, but each language's literature typically gravitates to one form, or at least to a very limited set. Ancient Sumerian epic poems did not use any kind of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] and [[Line (poetry)|lines]] did not have consistent lengths;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer1963&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Kramer|first=Samuel Noah|author-link=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sumerianstheirhi00samu/page/184 184–185]|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/sumerianstheirhi00samu/page/184}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Sumerian poems derived their rhythm solely through constant [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], with subtle variations between lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer1963&quot;/&gt; [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] epic poetry, by contrast, usually places strong emphasis on the importance of line consistency and poetic meter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kramer1963&quot;/&gt; Ancient Greek and Latin poems were written in dactylic [[hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/hexameter|title=Hexameter &amp;#124; poetry|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old English, German and Norse poems were written in [[alliterative verse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/alliterative-verse|title=Alliterative verse &amp;#124; literature|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually without [[rhyme]]. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese long poems were usually written in [[terza rima]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/terza-rima|title=Terza rima &amp;#124; poetic form|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; or especially [[ottava rima]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/ottava-rima|title=Ottava rima &amp;#124; poetic form|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century English epic poems were written in [[heroic couplet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/heroic-couplet|title=Heroic couplet &amp;#124; poetry|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rhyme royal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/rhyme-royal|title=Rhyme royal &amp;#124; poetic form|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the 16th century the [[Spenserian stanza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Spenserian-stanza|title=Spenserian stanza &amp;#124; poetic form|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blank verse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/blank-verse|title=Blank verse &amp;#124; poetic form|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also introduced. The [[French alexandrine]] is currently the heroic line in French literature, though in earlier periods the [[decasyllable]] took precedence. In Polish literature, couplets of [[Polish alexandrine]]s (syllabic lines of 7+6 syllables) prevail.&lt;ref&gt;See: Trzynastozgłoskowiec, [in:] Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, [[iambic tetrameter]] verse is the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;[Alexandra Smith, Montaging Pushkin: Pushkin and Visions of Modernity in Russian Twentieth Century Poetry, p. 184.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbian poetry, the decasyllable is the only form employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6qTpBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=serbian+decasyllable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MktD0VfvNW&amp;sig=E-2QFetJSwJHIDDl_ADj3mAK7i0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidq_a-ztjQAhWBXCwKHd9HAJkQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian+decasyllable&amp;f=falseDavid|title=Early Tahitian Poetics|first=David|last=Meyer|date=27 November 2013|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britic.co.uk/2012/10/06/the-spirit-of-the-serb-r-w-seton-watson-1915/|title=The Spirit of the Serb – R.
