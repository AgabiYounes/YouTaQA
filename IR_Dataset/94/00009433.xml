'''''Spain in Flames''''' is a 1937 [[compilation film]] made by [[Helen van Dongen]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news |last=Mastrangelo |first=Bob |title=Helen van Dongen Obituary |work=The Guardian |date=10 November 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/nov/10/guardianobituaries.obituaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]] has written that the film &quot;... is remarkable in its willingness to offer both sides of the conflict -- though its sympathies are firmly with the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Loyalists]].&quot;&lt;ref name=allmovie&gt;{{cite web |last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=Spain in Flames |publisher=allmovie.com |url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/spain-in-flames-235752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film consists of two parts. The first, &quot;The Fight for Freedom&quot;, was based on film footage from a Spanish government documentary ''Spain and the Fight for Freedom''.&lt;ref name=Schoots&gt;{{cite book |title=Living Dangerously: a Biography of Joris Ivens |last=Schoots |first=Hans |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2000 |page=116 |isbn=978-90-5356-433-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlcfbzDx9HEC&amp;pg=PA116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A foreword by the then Spanish Ambassador to the United States, [[Fernando de los Ríos]], began one of the film's screenings in New York in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/01/28/archives/news-of-thescreen-plough-and-the-stars-opens-todayhelen-jepson.html|title=NEWS OF THE-SCREEN; ' Plough and the Stars' Opens Today-Helen Jepson Signed by Goldwyn-Return of Constance Bennett News From Hollywood|date=1937-01-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-02-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second part, &quot;They Shalt Not Pass&quot;, was based on a short film ''No Pasaran!'' done by the Artkino Film Company of the Soviet Union, where van Dongen was working at the time the film was made.&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt;&lt;ref name=allmovie /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoots /&gt; [[John Dos Passos]] narrated parts of the film,&lt;ref name=obituary /&gt; and the commentary was written by Dos Passos, [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], and Prudencio de Pareda.&lt;ref name=Schoots /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hemingway:War in Spain and the Fifth Column |url=http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/amlit/hemingway/hem6.html |last1=Scott |first1=Patrick |last2=Bruccoli |first2=Mathew J. |publisher=University of South Carolina |year=2002 }} Webpages based on the catalog for the Speiser and Easterling-Hallman Collection of Ernest Hemingway at the University of South Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson writes that, &quot;The horrendous images of battlefield carnage, not to mention the close-ups of suffering and dying Spanish children, still pack a wallop when seen today.&quot;&lt;ref name=allmovie /&gt;

Later, Hemingway, Dos Passos, [[Lillian Hellman]] and others founded the company Contemporary Historians, which produced another film called ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'' (1937), directed by [[Joris Ivens]] and edited by van Dongen.
