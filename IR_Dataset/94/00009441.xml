'''''The Downward Spiral''''' is the second studio album by American [[industrial rock]] band [[Nine Inch Nails]], released on March 8, 1994, by [[Nothing Records]] and [[Interscope Records]] in the United States and by [[Island Records]] in Europe. It is a [[concept album]] detailing the destruction of a man from the beginning of his &quot;downward spiral&quot; to his death by suicide. ''The Downward Spiral'' features elements of industrial rock, [[techno]] and [[heavy metal music]], in contrast to the band's [[synthpop]]-influenced debut album ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), and was produced by Nine Inch Nails frontman [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Flood (producer)|Flood]].

In 1992, Reznor moved to [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles]], where actress [[Sharon Tate]] was [[Tate murders|murdered]] by members of the [[Manson Family]]. It was used as a studio called &quot;Le Pig&quot; for recording ''[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]'' (1992) and ''The Downward Spiral'' with collaborations from other musicians. The album was influenced by late-1970s rock music albums such as [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Wall]]'' in particular, and focused on texture and space.

The album spawned two singles, &quot;[[March of the Pigs]]&quot; and &quot;[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]&quot;, in addition to the promotional singles &quot;[[Piggy (song)|Piggy]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]&quot;. &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; and &quot;Closer&quot; were accompanied by music videos, with the former shot twice and the latter's heavily censored. 

''The Downward Spiral'' was a commercial success, and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the [[1990s in music|1990s music scene]], with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media attention and multiple honors, while diverging into drug abuse and depression. It has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s, and was praised for its abrasive and eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for some of its lyrics. A [[remix album]] titled ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'' was released in 1995.

==Writing and recording==
[[File:Adrian Belew (2006 - 02).jpg|thumb|left|[[Adrian Belew]] in 2006. Belew's approach to guitar parts on the album improved Reznor's confidence in the instrument.]]
''The Downward Spiral'' was conceived after the Lollapalooza festival tour as Trent Reznor thought of a &quot;negative vibe&quot; felt by the band when they were in a European hotel. [[Nine Inch Nails live performances]] were known for its aggressive on-stage dynamic, in which band members act angry, injure themselves, and destroy instruments. Reznor had a [[Trent Reznor–TVT Records feud|feud]] with [[TVT Records]] that resulted in him co-founding Nothing Records with his former manager [[John Malm, Jr.]] and signing with Interscope. He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the album's themes; he later used the concept as lyrics. The concept was based on Reznor's social issues at the time: he had personal conflicts with band member [[Richard Patrick]] and was known for enjoying [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Martin|title=Nine Inch Nails: Self Destruct|date=September 1997|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=0-312-15612-X|url=https://archive.org/details/nineinchnailssel00huxl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NIN Spin 1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Estlund |first=Kristina |date=November 1994 |title=Trent Speaks |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/rip1.shtml|magazine=[[Rip (magazine)|Rip]]|access-date=2017-08-24|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When developing ''The Downward Spiral'', Reznor struggled with drug addiction and was depressed as he wrote songs related to personal issues.

He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive &quot;terrifying&quot; because he already knew it and read books related to the incident. Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources, a move that he believed was cheaper than renting.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=97–99}} The studio was also used for the recording of [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s debut album ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'', which Reznor co-produced. Marilyn Manson accepted Reznor's offer of signing a contract with Nothing Records.&lt;ref name=&quot;MansonLongHardRoad&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manson|first1=Marilyn|last2=Strauss|first2=Neil|title=The Long Hard Road Out of Hell|url=https://archive.org/details/longhardroadouto00mans|url-access=registration|quote=The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.|date=February 14, 1998|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] division [[ReganBooks]]|location=New York|isbn=0-06-039258-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor collaborated with former [[Jane's Addiction]] and [[Porno for Pyros]] drummer [[Stephen Perkins]], progressive rock guitarist [[Adrian Belew]], and Nine Inch Nails drummer [[Chris Vrenna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KPOsu8JOHO8C|title=The A to X of Alternative Music|author=Steve Taylor|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2004|page=165|isbn=0-8264-8217-1|accessdate=2017-08-24|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belew's first visit to the studio involved playing the guitar parts in &quot;Mr. Self-Destruct&quot;, and he was told to play freely, think on reacting to melodies, concentrate on rhythm, and use noise. This approach improved Reznor's confidence in the instrument: he found it to be more expressive than the keyboard due to the interface.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=106–108}} Belew praised Reznor for his &quot;command of technology,&quot; and commented that the music of Nine Inch Nails made innovations &quot;that are in [his] realm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar Player.

Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts: he would tape 20- to 25-minute-long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard disc recorder with the Studio Vision sequencer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Machine Head&quot; /&gt;

Most of the music was recorded into a [[Macintosh]] computer using a board and manipulated with music editor programs on the computer. Unique effects such as analyzing and inverting the frequency were applied to the tracks to create original sounds. The band would &quot;get an arrangement together&quot; and convert it into analog tape.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=109–110}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Machine Head&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/machine.shtml|title=Machine Head|magazine=[[Guitar World]]|author=Alan Di Perna|date=April 1994|accessdate=2017-08-24|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reznor sampled excerpts from guitar tracks and processed them to the point of randomness and expression.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=109}} [[Digidesign]]'s TurboSynth and [[Zoom Corporation|Zoom]] 9030 [[effects unit]] were used extensively to process guitar tracks, often in conjunction with a [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] JMP-1 [[Guitar amplifier|preamp]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Guitar Player.

In December 1993, Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate, who asked if he was exploiting Sharon Tate's death in the house. Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there. He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':

{{quote|While I was working on ''[The] Downward Spiral'', I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed. Then one day I met her sister [Patti Tate]. It was a random thing, just a brief encounter. And she said: 'Are you exploiting my sister's death by living in her house?' For the first time, the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face. I said, 'No, it's just sort of my own interest in American folklore. I'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred.' I guess it never really struck me before, but it did then. She lost her sister from a senseless, ignorant situation that I don't want to support. When she was talking to me, I realized for the first time, 'What if it was my sister?' I thought, 'Fuck [[Charles Manson|Charlie Manson]].' I went home and cried that night.

Flood, known for engineering and producing [[U2 (band)|U2]] and [[Depeche Mode]] albums, was employed as co-producer on ''The Downward Spiral''. It became his last collaboration with Nine Inch Nails due to creative differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor&quot; /&gt; A &quot;very dangerously self-destructive,&quot; humorous short song written for the album, &quot;Just Do It&quot;, was not included in the final version and criticized by Flood in that Reznor had &quot;gone too far.&quot; Reznor completed the last song written for the album, &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot;, in late 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Details&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spin&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Spin|volume=15|issue=9|date=September 1999|page=124|first=Eric|last=Weisbard|title=The 90 Greatest Albums of the '90s: 11 Nine Inch Nails ''The Downward Spiral''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGjsvmNt8UgC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2017-08-24|df=mdy-all}} Also posted at {{cite web|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart89.shtml|title=Rank 11.

Numerous layers of metaphors are present throughout ''The Downward Spiral'', leaving it open to wide interpretation. The album relays [[nihilism]] and is defined by a prominent theme of [[self-destructive behaviour|self-abuse]] and [[self-control]]. It is a semi-autobiographical concept album, in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist's descent into madness in his own inner [[solipsism|solipsistic]] world through a metaphorical &quot;downward spiral&quot;, dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally, suicide.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=120}}&lt;ref name=Allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-downward-spiral-mw0000110711|title=The Downward Spiral – Nine Inch Nails|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=April 27, 2004|last=Huey|first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quietus&quot; /&gt; Reznor described the concept as consisting of &quot;someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trent Reznor 1994 Select&quot; /&gt; Media journalists like ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer [[Jon Pareles]] noted the album's theme of angst had already been used by [[grunge]] bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and that Nine Inch Nails' depiction was more generalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot; /&gt;

==Packaging==
''Committere'', an installation featuring artwork and sketches for ''The Downward Spiral'', &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;March of the Pigs&quot; by [[Russell Mills (artist)|Russell Mills]] was displayed at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. Mills explained the ideas and materials that made up the painting (titled &quot;Wound&quot;) that was used for the album's [[cover art]]:

{{quote|I had been thinking about making works that dealt with layers, physically, materially and conceptually. I wanted to produce works that were about both exposure and revealing and at the same dealt with closure and covering. Given the nature of the lyrics and the power of the music I was working with, I felt justified in attempting to make works that alluded to the apparently contradictory imagery of pain and healing. I wanted to make beautiful surfaces that partially revealed the visceral rawness of open wounds beneath. The mixed media work 'Wound' was the first piece I tackled in this vein (no pun intended) and it became the cover of the album. It is made of plaster, acrylics, oils, rusted metals, insects, moths, blood (mine), wax, varnishes, and surgical bandaging on a wooden panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shedmatter.co.uk/russellmills/mills/installations/committere.html |title=Committere |last=Russell Mills |year=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503082254/http://www.shedmatter.co.uk/russellmills/mills/installations/committere.html |archive-date=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=2017-08-24 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tour===
{{See also|Self Destruct Tour}}
[[File:Trent Reznor Self-Destruct.jpg|thumb|Reznor performing during the Self Destruct tour, circa 1994–1995]]
The Nine Inch Nails live band embarked on the Self Destruct tour in support of ''The Downward Spiral''. Chris Vrenna and [[James Woolley]] performed drums and keyboards respectively, [[Robin Finck]] replaced [[Richard Patrick]] on guitar and bassist [[Danny Lohner]] was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as &quot;Hurt&quot;. The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very few actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=145–148}}

The tour included a set at [[Woodstock '94]] broadcast on [[pay-per-view]] and seen in as many as 24&amp;nbsp;million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing. Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have &quot;stolen the show&quot; from its popular contemporaries, mostly classic rock bands, and its fan base expanded.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=151–153}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PPV&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811221008/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-08-11|title=Feedback muddy from Woodstock PPV|last=Umstead|first=Thomas R.|newspaper=[[Multichannel News]]|date=1994-08-22|volume=15|issue=32|pages=3–4|accessdate=2017-08-23|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DFP Woodstock&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Band's Hot Image Rooted In Woodstock '94 Mud|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/detroit.shtml|last=Graff|first=Gary|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=1994-08-28|accessdate=2017-08-23|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Pit: Nine Inch Nails|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xreview1.shtml|magazine=Guitar School|publication-date=May 1995|accessdate=2017-10-15|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its performance of &quot;[[Happiness in Slavery]]&quot; from the Woodstock concert earned the group a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/38th-annual-grammy-awards|title=38th Annual GRAMMY Awards (1995)|work=grammy.com|accessdate=2017-08-23|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented about the band's Woodstock '94 performance: &quot;Reznor unstrings rock to its horrifying, melodramatic core—an experience as draining as it is exhilarating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2017-08-23|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart199.shtml|title=Trent Reznor : The Entertainers|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=1994-12-30|last=Hajari|first=Nisid|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this acclaim, Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=152–153}}

The main leg of the tour featured Marilyn Manson as the supporting act, who featured bassist [[Jeordie White]] (then playing under the pseudonym &quot;Twiggy Ramirez&quot;); White later played bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;break-up&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2007/09/14/features/story05.html|title=Reznor's edge cuts NIN's bleak outlook|last=Chun|first=Gary|newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|volume=12|issue=257|date=2007-09-14|accessdate=2017-08-23|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After another tour leg supporting the remix album ''Further Down the Spiral'', Nine Inch Nails contributed to the [[Alternative Nation Festival]] in Australia and subsequently embarked on the [[Outside Tour|Dissonance Tour]], which included 26 separate performances with co-headliner David Bowie. Nine Inch Nails was the opening act for the tour, and its set transitioned into Bowie's set with joint performances of both bands' songs.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=215–220}} However, the crowds reportedly did not respond positively to the pairing due to their creative differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D605D5D44A2F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Outside looking in|author=Christensen, Thor|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=1995-10-13|accessdate=2017-08-23|format=fee required|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour concluded with &quot;Nights of Nothing&quot;, a three-night showcase of performances from Nothing Records bands Marilyn Manson, [[Prick (band)|Prick]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], and [[Pop Will Eat Itself]], which ended with an 80-minute set from Nine Inch Nails. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' described the Nine Inch Nails set during the Nights of Nothing showcase as &quot;tight, brash and dramatic&quot;, but was disappointed at the lack of new material.

''The Downward Spiral''{{'}}s release date was delayed at various times to slow down Reznor's intended pace of the album's recording. The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take longer than he expected, and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on ''Broken'' and ''Pretty Hate Machine''. He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993, only to experience a [[writer's block]] as he was unable to produce any satisfactory material. Interscope grew impatient and concerned with this progress, but Reznor was not forced by their demands of expediency despite crediting the label for giving him creative freedom. He told rock music producer [[Rick Rubin]] that his motivation for creating the album was to get it finished, thus Rubin responded that Reznor might not do so until he makes music that is allowed to be heard.

Many music critics and audiences praised ''The Downward Spiral'' for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes and commented on the concept of a destruction of a man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot; /&gt; ''The New York Times'' writer Jon Pareles' review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive. Pareles asserted that unlike other electro-industrial groups like [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Nitzer Ebb]], &quot;Reznor writes full-fledged tunes&quot; with stronger use of melodies than riffs. He noticed criticisms of Nine Inch Nails from industrial purists for popularizing the genre and the album's transgression.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 8, 1994|first=Jon|last=Pareles |author-link=Jon Pareles|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDC1130F93BA35756C0A962958260|title=A Noise Sculptor Reveals An Ear for the Commercial|accessdate=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Village Voice]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave it an &quot;honorable mention&quot; in his [[capsule review]] column and summed the record up as, &quot;musically, [[Hieronymus Bosch]] as postindustrial atheist; lyrically, [[Transformers]] as kiddie porn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=February 21, 1995|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv395-95.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=March 30, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Gold, writing for ''Rolling Stone'', likened the album to cyberpunk fiction.&lt;ref name=RS1994 /&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' reviewer Tom Sinclair commented: &quot;Reznor's pet topics (sex, power, S&amp;M, hatred, transcendence) are all here, wrapped in hooks that hit your psyche with the force of a blowtorch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinclair&quot; /&gt;

The immediate success of ''The Downward Spiral'' established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s. The band's image and musical style became so recognizable that a [[Gatorade]] commercial featured a remix of &quot;[[Down in It]]&quot; without their involvement. Reznor felt uncomfortable with the media hype and success the band earned, received false reports of his death, depression, and was falsely reported to have had a relationship with serial killer [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], and was depicted as a sex icon due to his visual appearance.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=165–180}} Nine Inch Nails received several honors, including Grammy Award nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Performance]] for ''The Downward Spiral'' and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song|Best Rock Song]] for &quot;Hurt&quot;.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=207}} After the release of ''The Downward Spiral'', many bands such as [[Gravity Kills]], [[Stabbing Westward]], [[Filter (band)|Filter]], and [[Mötley Crüe]] made albums that imitated the sound of Nine Inch Nails.&lt;ref name=RS763&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Rolling Stone|issue=763|date=June 26, 1997|first=Jon|last=Wiederhorn|title=Generation Swine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/generation-swine-19970626|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StereogumTDS20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1668716/the-downward-spiral-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary|title=The Downward Spiral turns 20|author=Tom Breihan|work=Stereogum|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reznor interpreted ''The Downward Spiral'' as an extension of himself that &quot;became the truth fulfilling itself,&quot; as he experienced personal and social issues presented in the album after its release. He had already struggled with [[social anxiety disorder]] and depression and started his abuse of [[narcotic]]s including cocaine while he went on an alcohol binge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hell&quot; /&gt; Around this time, his studio perfectionism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Trent Reznor|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/ap_97d_a.shtml|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=January 1998|issue=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of ''[[The Fragile]]'', and Reznor completed rehabilitation from drugs in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hell&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=To Hell and back|url=http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=21|issue=1050|author=Chick, Steve|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=March 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal Edge July 2005 Nine Inch Nails&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Trent Reznor Bites Back|url=http://theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=138|last=Gargano|first=Paul|magazine=Metal Edge|date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===&quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; lyrics===
''The Downward Spiral''{{'}}s emphasis on transgressive themes made its lyrics vulnerable to criticism from [[Conservatism in the United States#Social conservatism and tradition|American social conservatives]]. Senator [[Bob Dole]], then the head of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], sharply denounced [[Time Warner]], the former owner of Interscope's former parent company [[Warner Music Group]], after a meeting between [[Michael J. Fuchs]] (head of WMG), [[William Bennett]], and [[C. Delores Tucker]].

Reznor called Tucker (who erroneously referred to Nine Inch Nails as a gangsta rap act) &quot;such a fucking idiot&quot;, and claimed that the song was actually a [[satire]] of the gangsta rap genre as a whole and was originally about madness. Reznor conceded ''The Downward Spiral'' could be &quot;harmful, through implying and subliminally suggesting things&quot;, whereas [[hardcore hip hop]] could be &quot;cartoonish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIN Spin 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Spin|volume=11|issue=11|date=February 1996|page=34|first=Eric|last=Weisbard|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 4, 2011}} Also posted at {{cite journal|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xint8a.shtml|work=theninhotline.net|accessdate=August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=208–210}} [[Robert Bork]] also repeatedly referenced &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; in his book ''[[Slouching Toward Gomorrah]]'' as evidence of a cultural decline.

'''Notes'''
* The opening sounds of &quot;Mr. Self Destruct&quot; are a sample from the film ''[[THX 1138]]'' in which a man is being beaten by a prison guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quietus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14684-nin-nine-inch-nails-downward-spiral-review|author=Val Siebert|title=Two Way Alchemy: Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral Revisited|work=The Quietus|date=March 10, 2014|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sample of screams that plays throughout &quot;The Becoming&quot; is from the film ''[[Robot Jox]]'', when a giant robot falls on a crowd of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kushner|first=Nick|title=Films, Samples and Influences|url=http://www.nachtkabarett.com/NIN/Samples|work=The Nachtkabarett|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sample at the beginning of &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; comes from a studio-altered recording of a porn star having an orgasm. According to the album booklet, this &quot;sample&quot; is titled &quot;Steakhouse&quot; and is credited to [[Tommy Lee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TDSbooklet&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Downward Spiral|type=CD liner notes|others=Nine Inch Nails|publisher=[[Interscope Records]]|year=1994|page=28|id=92346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Japanese pressings of the album contain a cover of [[Joy Division]]'s song &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, originally included on the [[The Crow: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] to the film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''. The track is placed in between &quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; and &quot;A Warm Place&quot;.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=191}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/en/artist_Nine-Inch-Nails_000000000032326/item_The-Downward_956818|title=The Downward : Nine Inch Nails|publisher=[[HMV Japan]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The break in &quot;Reptile&quot; contains an audio sample (starting at 5:06) of a woman falling down a hill from the 1974 film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuse.tv/2014/03/nine-inch-nails-the-downward-spiral-facts|author=Samantha Vincenty|title=13 things you didn't know about Nine Inch Nails' 'The Downward Spiral'|work=[[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]]|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first Australian pressing has track length errors. Affected tracks do not play at their beginnings when selected individually (&quot;Big Man with a Gun&quot; has the beginning of &quot;A Warm Place&quot; tacked on, likewise all the songs up to &quot;Hurt&quot; start 41 seconds earlier than they should. &quot;Hurt&quot; itself has 44 seconds of silence on the end as a result); however, the disc plays and flows correctly as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halo Eight – Australian First Pressing CD5|url=http://www.nincollector.com/archive/releases/halo_08/08_aus_cd_firstpressing.htm|publisher=NIN Collector|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deluxe edition (Halo 8 DE)===
To mark the album's tenth anniversary, ''The Downward Spiral'' was re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc one of the album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly identical to the original version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a stereo and multi-channel [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.&lt;ref name=&quot;TDS10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/66210/nin-revisits-the-downward-spiral|author=Billboard staff|title=NIN Revisits ''The Downward Spiral''|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=November 2004|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic TDSDE&quot;&gt;{{Allmusic|author=Steve Huey|class=album|id=r717657|label=The Downward Spiral (Deluxe Edition)|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
