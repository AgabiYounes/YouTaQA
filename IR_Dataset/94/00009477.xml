{{infobox europium}}
'''Europium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Eu''' and [[atomic number]] 63. Europium is the most reactive [[lanthanide]] by far, having to be stored under an inert fluid to protect it from atmospheric [[oxygen]] or moisture. Europium is also the softest lanthanide, as it can be dented with a fingernail and easily cut with a knife. When oxidation is removed a shiny-white metal is visible. Europium was isolated in 1901 and is named after the continent of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Periodic Table: Europium |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |url=https://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/63/europium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3, but the oxidation state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with oxidation state +2 are slightly [[redox|reducing]]. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds. Europium is one of the rarest of the rare earth elements on Earth.&lt;ref name=Stwertka&gt;Stwertka, Albert.

Europium is a [[ductile]] metal with a hardness similar to that of [[lead]]. It crystallizes in a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] lattice.&lt;ref name=Holleman/&gt; Some properties of europium are strongly influenced by its half-filled [[electron shell]]. Europium has the second lowest melting point and the lowest density of all lanthanides.&lt;ref name=Holleman/&gt;

Europium becomes a [[superconductor]] when it is cooled below 1.8 K and compressed to above 80 GPa. This occurs because europium is [[Valence (chemistry)|divalent]] in the metallic state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.11.2836|title=Generalized phase diagram for the rare-earth elements: Calculations and correlations of bulk properties|date=1975|last1=Johansson|first1=Börje|last2=Rosengren|first2=Anders|journal=Physical Review B|volume=11|issue=8|pages=2836–2857|bibcode = 1975PhRvB..11.2836J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is converted into the trivalent state by the applied pressure. In the divalent state, the strong local [[magnetic moment]] (J = &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) suppresses the superconductivity, which is induced by eliminating this local moment (J = 0 in Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Pressure-Induced Superconducting State of Europium Metal at Low Temperatures| journal = Phys.

===Chemical properties===
Europium is the most reactive [[rare-earth element]]. It rapidly oxidizes in air, so that bulk oxidation of a centimeter-sized sample occurs within several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elementsales.com/re_exp/index.htm|author=Hamric, David |date=November 2007 |title = Rare-Earth Metal Long Term Air Exposure Test|work=elementsales.com|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reactivity with water is comparable to that of [[calcium]], and the reaction is
:2 Eu + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Eu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Because of the high reactivity, samples of solid europium rarely have the shiny appearance of the fresh metal, even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil. Europium ignites in air at 150 to 180&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[europium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Eu + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Europium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form pale pink solutions of the hydrated Eu(III), which exist as a nonahydrate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/europium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Europium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Eu + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 18 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 [Eu(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 {{chem|SO|4|2−}} + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Eu(II) vs. Eu(III)====
Although usually trivalent, europium readily forms divalent compounds. This behavior is unusual for most [[lanthanide]]s, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 state has an [[electron configuration]] 4''f''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; because the half-filled ''f''-shell provides more stability. In terms of size and [[coordination number]], europium(II) and [[barium]](II) are similar. The sulfates of both barium and europium(II) are also highly insoluble in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1002/9780470132333.ch19|chapter = Europium(II) Salts|title = Inorganic Syntheses|date = 1946|last1 = Cooley|first1 = Robert A.|last2 = Yost|first2 = Don M.|last3 = Stone|first3 = Hosmer W.|isbn = 978-0-470-13233-3|volume = 2|pages = 69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divalent europium is a mild reducing agent, oxidizing in air to form Eu(III) compounds. In anaerobic, and particularly geothermal conditions, the divalent form is sufficiently stable that it tends to be incorporated into minerals of calcium and the other alkaline earths. This ion-exchange process is the basis of the &quot;negative [[europium anomaly]]&quot;, the low europium content in many lanthanide minerals such as monazite, relative to the [[chondrite|chondritic]] abundance. Bastnäsite tends to show less of a negative europium anomaly than does monazite, and hence is the major source of europium today. The development of easy methods to separate divalent europium from the other (trivalent) lanthanides made europium accessible even when present in low concentration, as it usually is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann|volume=31|page=199|last1=McGill|first1=Ian|contribution=Rare Earth Elements|doi=10.1002/14356007.a22_607}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of europium}}
Naturally occurring europium is composed of 2 [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu and &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, which occur in almost equal proportions; &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is slightly more abundant (52.2% [[natural abundance]]). While &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is stable, &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu was found to be unstable to [[alpha decay]] with a [[half-life]] of {{val|5|+11|-3|e=18|ul=years}} in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Search for α decay of natural europium|author= Belli, P.|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2007.03.001|date=2007|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=789|issue= 1|pages=15–29|display-authors=1|last2=Bernabei|first2=R.|last3=Cappella|first3=F.|last4=Cerulli|first4=R.|last5=Dai|first5=C.|last6=Danevich|first6=F.|last7=Dangelo|first7=A.|last8=Incicchitti|first8=A.|last9=Kobychev|first9=V.|last10= Nagorny|first10= S.

S.|bibcode = 2007NuPhA.789...15B }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving about 1 alpha decay per two minutes in every kilogram of natural europium. This value is in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. Besides the natural radioisotope &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, 35 artificial radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years, &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu with a half-life of 13.516 years, and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu with a half-life of 8.593 years. All the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives shorter than 4.7612 years, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 12.2 seconds. This element also has 8 [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;150m&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=12.8 hours), &lt;sup&gt;152m1&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=9.3116 hours) and &lt;sup&gt;152m2&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;=96 minutes).&lt;ref name=&quot;nucleonica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx |title=Nucleonica: Universal Nuclide Chart |author=Nucleonica |date=2007–2011 |publisher=Nucleonica |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary [[decay mode]] for isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is [[electron capture]], and the primary mode for heavier isotopes is [[beta minus decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s before &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu are isotopes of [[samarium]] (Sm) and the primary products after are isotopes of [[gadolinium]] (Gd).&lt;ref name=&quot;nucleonica&quot; /&gt;

{{Medium-lived fission products}}
Europium is produced by nuclear fission, but the [[fission product yield]]s of europium isotopes are low near the top of the mass range for [[fission products]].

As with other [[lanthanide]]s, many isotopes of europium, especially those that have odd mass numbers or are neutron-poor like &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, have high [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]]s for [[neutron capture]], often high enough to be [[neutron poison]]s.

&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is the [[beta decay]] product of [[samarium-151]], but since this has a long decay half-life and short mean time to neutron absorption, most &lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;Sm instead ends up as &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm.

&lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (half-life 13.516 years) and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu (half-life 8.593 years) cannot be beta decay products because &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;Sm and &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Sm are non-radioactive, but &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is the only long-lived &quot;shielded&quot; [[nuclide]], other than [[Caesium-134|&lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]], to have a fission yield of more than 2.5 [[parts per million]] fissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/NuC/index.html Tables of Nuclear Data], Japan Atomic Energy Agency {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610213313/http://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/NuC/index.html |date=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger amount of &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu is produced by [[neutron activation]] of a significant portion of the non-radioactive &lt;sup&gt;153&lt;/sup&gt;Eu; however, much of this is further converted to &lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu.

[[Eu-155|&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu]] (half-life 4.7612 years) has a fission yield of 330 parts per million (ppm) for [[uranium-235]] and [[thermal neutron]]s; most of it is transmuted to non-radioactive and nonabsorptive gadolinium-156 by the end of fuel [[burnup]].

Overall, europium is overshadowed by [[caesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]] as a radiation hazard, and by samarium and others as a neutron poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.2172/759039|title = Neutron cross section evaluations of fission products below the fast energy region|date = 2000|last1 = Oh|first1 = S.

===Occurrence===
[[File:Monazit - Mosambik, O-Afrika.jpg|left|thumb|Monazite]]
Europium is not found in nature as a free element. Many minerals contain europium, with the most important sources being [[bastnäsite]], [[monazite]], [[xenotime]] and [[loparite-(Ce)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1002/0471238961.120114201901021|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|volume = 14|chapter = Lanthanides|first1 = Patrick|last1 =Maestro|isbn = 978-0-471-23896-6|pages = 1096–1120|year = 2004|doi-broken-date = 2020-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; No europium-dominant minerals are known yet, despite a single find of a tiny possible Eu–O or Eu–O–C system phase in the Moon's regolith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/ |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depletion or enrichment of europium in minerals relative to other rare-earth elements is known as the [[europium anomaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OmUXW8pqUe8C&amp;pg=PA550|chapter = The Europium anomaly| pages = 550–553|title = Systematics and the properties of the lanthanides|isbn = 978-90-277-1613-2|last = Sinha|first= Shyama P.|author2 = Scientific Affairs Division, North Atlantic Treaty Organization|date = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europium is commonly included in trace element studies in [[geochemistry]] and [[petrology]] to understand the processes that form [[igneous rocks]] (rocks that cooled from [[magma]] or [[lava]]). The nature of the europium anomaly found helps reconstruct the relationships within a suite of igneous rocks. The [[Abundances of the elements (data page)|average crustal abundance]] of europium is 2–2.2 ppm.

Divalent europium (Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in small amounts is the activator of the bright blue [[fluorescence]] of some samples of the mineral [[fluorite]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The reduction from Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is induced by irradiation with energetic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00308116|title = Color centers, associated rare-earth ions and the origin of coloration in natural fluorites|date = 1978|last1 = Bill|first1 = H.|last2 = Calas|first2 = G.|journal = Physics and Chemistry of Minerals|volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 117–131|bibcode=1978PCM.....3..117B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most outstanding examples of this originated around [[Weardale]] and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that [[fluorescence]] was named after in 1852, although it was not until much later that europium was determined to be the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Allen, Robert D. |url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM37/AM37_910.pdf|title=Variations in chemical and physical properties of fluorite|journal=Am.

In [[astrophysics]], the signature of europium in stellar [[spectroscopy|spectra]] can be used to [[Stellar classification|classify stars]] and inform theories of how or where a particular star was born. For instance, astronomers recently identified higher-than-expected levels of europium within the star [[J1124+4535]], hypothesizing that this star originated in a [[dwarf galaxy]] that collided with the Milky Way billions of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.space.com/weirdo-star-from-another-galaxy.html |title=A Star in the Big Dipper Is an Alien Invader |last=Weisberger |first=Mindy |date=12 May 2019 |website=[[Space.com]] |access-date=12 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xing |first1=Qian-Fan |last2=Zhao |first2=Gang |last3=Aoki |first3=Wako |last4=Honda |first4=Satoshi |last5=Li |first5=Hai-Ning |last6=Ishigaki |first6=Miho N. |last7=Matsuno |first7=Tadafumi |date=29 April 2019 |title=Evidence for the accretion origin of halo stars with an extreme r-process enhancement |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume= 3|issue= 7|pages= 631–635|doi=10.1038/s41550-019-0764-5 |bibcode=2019NatAs.tmp..311X |arxiv=1905.04141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Europium is associated with the other [[rare-earth elements]] and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements occurs during later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals [[bastnäsite]], [[loparite-(Ce)]], [[xenotime]], and [[monazite]] in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is a group of related fluorocarbonates, Ln(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(F,OH). Monazite is a group of related of orthophosphate minerals {{chem|Ln|P|O|4}} (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except [[promethium]]), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is an orthophosphate (Y,Yb,Er,...)PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Monazite also contains [[thorium]] and [[yttrium]], which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore, followed by acidic and basic leaching, is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by [[solvent extraction]]s or [[ion exchange chromatography]] yields a fraction which is enriched in europium.

[[File:Eu-sulfate-luminescence.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Europium sulfate fluorescing red under ultraviolet light]]
Europium compounds tend to exist trivalent oxidation state under most conditions. Commonly these compounds feature Eu(III) bound by 6–9 oxygenic ligands, typically water. These compounds, the chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, are soluble in water or polar organic solvent. Lipophilic europium complexes often feature acetylacetonate-like ligands, e.g., [[Eufod]].

===Halides===
Europium metal reacts with all the halogens:
:2 Eu + 3 X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 EuX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
This route gives white europium(III) fluoride (EuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), yellow [[europium(III) chloride]] (EuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), gray [[europium(III) bromide]] (EuBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and colorless europium(III) iodide (EuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Europium also forms the corresponding dihalides: yellow-green europium(II) fluoride (EuF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), colorless [[europium(II) chloride]] (EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), colorless [[europium(II) bromide]] (EuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and green europium(II) iodide (EuI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Holleman&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. &quot;Inorganic Chemistry&quot; Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chalcogenides and pnictides===
Europium forms stable compounds with all of the chalcogens, but the heavier chalcogens (S, Se, and Te) stabilize the lower oxidation state. Three [[oxide]]s are known: europium(II) oxide (EuO), [[europium(III) oxide]] (Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[mixed-valency|mixed-valence]] oxide Eu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, consisting of both Eu(II) and Eu(III).
Otherwise, the main chalcogenides are [[europium(II) sulfide]] (EuS), europium(II) selenide (EuSe) and europium(II) telluride (EuTe): all three of these are black solids. EuS is prepared by sulfiding the oxide at temperatures sufficiently high to decompose the Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi = 10.1002/9780470132418.ch15|chapter = Europium (II) Sulfide|title = Inorganic Syntheses|date = 1967|last1 = Archer|first1 = R.

:Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 2 EuS + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + S
The main [[nitride]] is europium(III) nitride (EuN).

==History==
Although europium is present in most of the minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was not until the late 1800s that the element was isolated. [[William Crookes]] observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare elements including those eventually assigned to europium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor = 92772|pages = 411–414|last1 = Crookes|first1 = W.|authorlink=William Crookes|title = On the Phosphorescent Spectra of S δ and Europium|volume = 76|issue = 511|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|date = 1905|bibcode = 1905RSPSA..76..411C|doi = 10.1098/rspa.1905.0043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europium was first found in 1892 by [[Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], who obtained basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not accounted for by samarium or [[gadolinium]]. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to [[France|French]] [[chemist]] [[Eugène-Anatole Demarçay]], who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able to isolate it in 1901; he then named it ''europium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30888/f1580.image| journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Comptes rendus]]| first = Eugène-Anatole|last = Demarçay|title = Sur un nouvel élément l'europium|volume = 132|pages = 1484–1486|date = 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;XVI&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1751|title = The discovery of the elements.

When the europium-doped [[yttrium orthovanadate]] red phosphor was discovered in the early 1960s, and understood to be about to cause a revolution in the color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum03/IF6-03-Pages48-51.pdf | journal = The Electrochemical Society Interface | date = 2003 | pages = 48–51 | title =Phosphors | first1 =A. M. | last1= Srivastava | first2 = C. R. | last2=Ronda }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp [[bastnäsite]] deposit at the [[Mountain Pass rare earth mine]], [[California]], whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri1&quot;/&gt; Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors. Californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from [[Bayan Obo]], China, with an even &quot;richer&quot; europium content of 0.2%.

[[Frank Spedding]], celebrated for his development of the ion-exchange technology that revolutionized the rare-earth industry in the mid-1950s, once related the story of how&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1039/DF9490700214|title = Large-scale separation of rare-earth salts and the preparation of the pure metals|date = 1949|last1 = Spedding|first1 = Frank H.|journal = Discussions of the Faraday Society|volume = 7|pages = 214 | authorlink = Frank Spedding}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was lecturing on the rare earths in the 1930s, when an elderly gentleman approached him with an offer of a gift of several pounds of europium oxide. This was an unheard-of quantity at the time, and Spedding did not take the man seriously. However, a package duly arrived in the mail, containing several pounds of genuine europium oxide. The elderly gentleman had turned out to be [[Herbert Newby McCoy]], who had developed a famous method of europium purification involving redox chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10269&amp;page=300–326|journal = Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume = 80|first = John D.|last = Corbett|title = Frank Harold Spedding|bibcode = 1986PhT....39e.106H|date = 1986|pages = 106–107|doi = 10.1063/1.2815016|issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Aperture Grille.jpg|left|thumb|Europium is one of the elements involved in emitting red light in CRT televisions.]]
Relative to most other elements, commercial applications for europium are few and rather specialized. Almost invariably, its phosphorescence is exploited, either in the +2 or +3 oxidation state.

It is a [[dopant]] in some types of [[glass]] in [[laser]]s and other optoelectronic devices. Europium oxide (Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is widely used as a red [[phosphor]] in [[Cathode ray tube|television sets]] and [[fluorescent lamps]], and as an activator for [[yttrium]]-based phosphors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=P4UCrfp_s0EC&amp;pg=PA323|pages = 323–325|chapter= Rare earths in luminescence|title =Rare earths|isbn =978-84-89784-33-8|last1 =Caro|first= Paul|date =1998-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aFbgmoyArYoC&amp;pg=PA159| pages = 159–171|chapter= Inorganic Phosphors|title = Chromic phenomena: technological applications of colour chemistry|isbn = 978-0-85404-474-0|author1 = Bamfield, Peter|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1&amp;nbsp;g of europium oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gupta&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ch. 1.7.10 Phosphors |chapter-url=http://vector.umd.edu/links_files/Extractive%20Metallurgy%20of%20Rare%20Earths%20(Gupta).pdf |title=Extractive metallurgy of rare earths |last1=Gupta |first1=C.
