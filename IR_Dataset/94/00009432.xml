Charles Boatman, an army veteran suddenly disappears and his daughter Ada and her younger brother Jon on finding some clues go looking out for him in [[Danang]], Vietnam. The novel mixes various stories from different timeframes narrating Charles's days in Washington when he was young. He married Sara and had daughter Ada while living in [[Fraser Valley]] of British Columbia. He gets posted in the war time era to Vietnam and serves there and upon arrival discovers his wife's infidelity. Sara dies early and by then they also had a son Jon. Charles keeps getting nightmares of his Vietnam days on how he killed an innocent civilian boy in one of the operations and this keeps haunting him.  On the other hand, Ada s on her mission to find her father and is helped by a local guy Yen who becomes her guide and guardian in the new country. She engages in a sexual relationship with an older man, Hoang Vu who is an artist by profession. Jon indulges in the nightlife of Vietnam and Ada keeps getting closer to her father as she travels across the country. Charles discovers author Dang Tho's novel chronicling wartime and this helps him find some peace.

== Reviews and reception ==
''[[Kirkus reviews]]'' called the novel a &quot;beautifully composed, unflinching and harrowing story&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;KR&quot;/&gt; Nicholas Dinka in their ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'' review mentions that the novel has &quot;much decency and intelligence&quot; and both the stories of the novel are &quot;entirely plausible&quot; but criticises for &quot;remarkable dourness of its prose&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;QnQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.quillandquire.com/review/the-time-in-between/|title=''The Time in Between''|work=Quill and Quire|author=Dinka, Nicholas|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Dennis Lythgoe of ''[[Deseret News]]'' noted that &quot;Bergen's book lives and breathes the Vietnam experience&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635167390/Time-is-brilliant-haunting-journey.html|title=Book review: 'Time' is brilliant, haunting journey|work=Deseret News|author=Lythgoe, Dennis|date=11 December 2005|accessdate= 29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ron Charles in his ''[[The Washington Post]]'' review mentioned that &quot;Bergen's ability to dramatize trauma-induced disaffection is undeniable; whether readers will want to sink down that hole with his characters is less clear&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/15/AR2005121501534.html|title=In Country|work=Washington Post|author=Charles, Ron|date=18 December 2005|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irene Wanner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' appreciated the novel for its writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ST&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/books/2002699748_timeinbetween25.html|title=&quot;The Time In Between&quot;: Probing the demons of war within one family|work=[[Seattle Times]]|author=Wanner, Irene|date=23 December 2005|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
