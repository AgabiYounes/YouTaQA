The '''European Central Bank''' ('''ECB''') is the [[central bank]] for the [[euro]] and administers [[monetary policy]] within the [[Eurozone]], which comprises 19 [[member states of the European Union]] and is one of the largest monetary areas in the world. Established by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], the ECB is one of the world's [[Big Four (banking)#International use|most important central banks]] and serves as one of seven [[institutions of the European Union]], being enshrined in the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU). The bank's capital stock is owned by all 27 central banks of each EU member state.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot; /&gt; The current [[President of the European Central Bank|President of the ECB]] is [[Christine Lagarde]]. [[Seat of the European Central Bank|Headquartered]] in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, the bank formerly occupied the [[Eurotower (Frankfurt am Main)|Eurotower]] prior to the construction of its new seat.

The primary objective of the ECB, mandated in Article 2 of the Statute of the ECB,&lt;ref name=ecbst&gt;[http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_statute_from_c_11520080509en02010328.pdf Statute of the ECB]&lt;/ref&gt; is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]]. Its basic tasks, set out in Article 3 of the Statute,&lt;ref name=ecbst/&gt; are to set and implement the [[monetary policy]] for the Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the [[foreign reserve]]s of the [[European System of Central Banks]] and operation of the financial market infrastructure under the [[TARGET2]] payments system and the technical platform (currently being developed) for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]). The ECB has, under Article 16 of its Statute,&lt;ref name=ecbst/&gt; the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]], but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand.

The ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is €11 billion held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;/&gt; The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the capital key has been adjusted.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;/&gt; Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.

==History==
{{Further|History of the euro}}
[[File:Wim Duisenberg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Wim Duisenberg]], first President of the ECB]]
The European Central Bank is the ''de facto'' successor of the [[European Monetary Institute]] (EMI).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union|publisher=ECB |accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EMI was established at the start of the second stage of the EU's [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) to handle the transitional issues of states adopting the euro and prepare for the creation of the ECB and [[European System of Central Banks]] (ESCB).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  The EMI itself took over from the earlier [[European Monetary Co-operation Fund]] (EMCF).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=European Central Bank |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_central_bank-en-fc8d2e17-cbde-4ec8-8f79-46f06c471540.html |accessdate=18 February 2014|date=2016-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ECB formally replaced the EMI on 1 June 1998 by virtue of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU, Treaty of Maastricht), however it did not exercise its full powers until the [[introduction of the euro]] on 1 January 1999, signalling the third stage of EMU.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The bank was the final institution needed for EMU, as outlined by the EMU reports of [[Pierre Werner]] and [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]]. It was established on 1 June 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/history/emu/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Economic and Monetary Union |publisher=Ecb.int |accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[List of Presidents of the European Central Bank|President of the Bank]] was [[Wim Duisenberg]], the former president of the [[De Nederlandsche Bank|Dutch central bank]] and the [[European Monetary Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI (taking over from [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]] of Belgium) just before the ECB came into existence,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; the French government wanted [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], former head of the [[Banque de France|French central bank]], to be the ECB's first president.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its president should be French. This was opposed by the German, Dutch and Belgian governments who saw Duisenberg as a guarantor of a strong euro.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA EMU3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The third stage of Economic and Monetary Union |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_third_stage_of_economic_and_monetary_union-en-e2e91dc0-3a6d-49fc-b3f8-f96fb5f3addb.html |accessdate=18 February 2014 |date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions were abated by a [[gentleman's agreement]] in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/uggboy/4417740330/ |title=The powerful European Central Bank [E C B] in the heart of Frankfurt/Main&amp;nbsp;– Germany&amp;nbsp;– The Europower in Mainhattan&amp;nbsp;– Enjoy the glances of euro and europe....03/2010....travel round the world....:)|work=UggBoy♥UggGirl [PHOTO // WORLD // TRAVEL] |publisher=Flickr |date=6 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trichet replaced Duisenberg as President in November 2003.

[[File:Mario Draghi World Economic Forum 2013 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Mario Draghi]], President of the ECB between 2011-2019]]
There had also been tension over the ECB's [[Executive Board of the European Central Bank|Executive Board]], with the former member  state United Kingdom demanding a seat even though it had not joined the Single Currency.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA EMU3&quot;/&gt; Under pressure from France, three seats were assigned to the largest members, France, Germany, and Italy; Spain also demanded and obtained a seat. Despite such a system of appointment the board asserted its independence early on in resisting calls for interest rates and future candidates to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA EMU3&quot;/&gt;

When the ECB was created, it covered a [[Eurozone]] of eleven members. Since then, Greece joined in January 2001, Slovenia in January 2007, Cyprus and Malta in January 2008, Slovakia in January 2009, Estonia in January 2011, Latvia in January 2014 and Lithuania in January 2015, enlarging the bank's scope and the membership of its Governing Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, ECB according to the article 13 of TEU, gained official status of an [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institution]].

In September 2011, when German appointee to the Governing Council and Executive board, [[Jürgen Stark]], resigned in protest of the ECB's &quot;Securities Market Programme&quot; which involved the purchase of sovereign bonds by the ECB, a move that was up until then considered as prohibited by the EU Treaty. The ''[[Financial Times Deutschland]]'' referred to this episode as &quot;the end of the ECB as we know it&quot;, referring to its hitherto perceived &quot;hawkish&quot; stance on inflation and its historical [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Proissl, von Wolfgang |url=http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/:stark-ruecktritt-das-ende-der-ezb-wie-wir-sie-kannten/60102214.html |title=Das Ende der EZB, wie wir sie kannten |trans-title=The end of the ECB, as we knew it |department=Kommentar |work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]] |date=9 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archivedate=15 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015235754/http://www.ftd.de/politik/europa/%3Astark-ruecktritt-das-ende-der-ezb-wie-wir-sie-kannten/60102214.html |language=de |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2011, [[Mario Draghi]] replaced Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the ECB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-13901139|title=Mario Draghi takes centre stage at ECB|last=|first=|date=1 November 2011|work=BBC|access-date=28 December 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the ECB raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 from 1% to 1.25%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecb-raises-interest-rates-2011-04-07 |title=ECB Raises Interest Rates&amp;nbsp;– MarketWatch|work=marketwatch.com |year=2011 |accessdate=14 July 2011|last1=Blackstone|first1=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further increase to 1.50% in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Key interest rates|year=2011 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2012–2013 the ECB sharply lowered interest rates to encourage economic growth, reaching the historically low 0.25% in November 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;rates&quot;/&gt; Soon after the rates were cut to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 the central bank reduced the rates by two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECBcuts&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Draghi slashes interest rates, unveils bond buying plan|url=http://www.europenews.net/index.php/sid/225407609|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=europenews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the interest rates were further reduced reaching 0.00%, the lowest rates on record.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/key_ecb_interest_rates/html/index.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response to the financial crisis ===
{{main|European debt crisis}}{{Cleanup reorganize|date=November 2017}}&lt;!-- We need a section here about the ECB's intervention in the early days of the GFC. --&gt;

From late 2009 a handful of mainly southern eurozone member states started being unable to repay their national Euro-denominated [[government debt]] or to finance the bail-out of troubled financial sectors under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties. This so-called ''[[European debt crisis]]'' began after Greece's new elected government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit and {{Citation needed span|text=openly communicated|date=September 2018|reason=}} the imminent danger of a Greek sovereign default.

Foreseeing a possible sovereign default in the eurozone, the general public, international and European institutions, and the financial community reassessed the economic situation and creditworthiness of some Eurozone member states, in particular Southern countries. Consequently, sovereign bonds yields of several Eurozone countries started to rise sharply. This provoked a self-fulfilling panic on financial markets: the more Greek bonds yields rose, the more likely a default became possible, the more bond yields increased in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE61F0W720100216|title=Peripheral euro zone government bond spreads widen|author=George Matlock|date=16 February 2010|accessdate=28 April 2010|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16009099|title=Acropolis now|date=29 April 2010|work=The Economist|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704041504575045743430262982|title=Global Markets Shudder: Doubts About U.S. Economy and a Debt Crunch in Europe Jolt Hopes for a Recovery|author1=Brian Blackstone|date=5 February 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 May 2010|author2=Tom Lauricella|author3=Neil Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/world/europe/geir-haarde-former-iceland-leader-goes-on-trial-for-role-in-financial-crisis.html &quot;Former Iceland Leader Tried Over Financial Crisis of 2008&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 5 March 2012.

This panic was also aggravated because of the inability of the ECB to react and intervene on sovereign bonds markets for two reasons. First, because the ECB's legal framework normally forbids the purchase of sovereign bonds (Article 123. TFEU),&lt;ref&gt;Bagus, ''The Tragedy of the Euro'', 2010, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; This prevented the ECB from implementing [[quantitative easing]] like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England did as soon as 2008, which played an important role in stabilizing markets. Secondly, a decision by the ECB made in 2005 introduced a minimum credit rating (BBB-) for all Eurozone sovereign bonds to be eligible as collateral to the ECB's open market operations. This meant that if a private rating agencies were to downgrade a sovereign bond below that threshold, many banks would suddenly become illiquid because they would lose access to ECB refinancing operations. According to former member of the governing council of the ECB [[Athanasios Orphanides]], this change in the ECB's collateral framework &quot;planted the seed&quot; of the euro crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/how-ecb-planted-seeds-euro-area-crisis|title=Monetary policy and fiscal discipline: How the ECB planted the seeds of the euro area crisis|last=Orphanides|first=Athanasios|date=2018-03-09|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with those regulatory constraints, the ECB led by Jean-Claude Trichet in 2010 was reluctant to intervene to calm down financial markets. Up until May 6, 2010, Trichet formally denied at several press conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2010/html/is100506.en.html|title=Introductory statement with Q&amp;A|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the possibility of the ECB to embark into sovereign bonds purchases, even though Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy faced waves of [[credit rating]] downgrades and increasing interest rate spreads.

==== Securities Market Programme ====
[[File:ECB SMP Bond Purchases.png|thumb|upright=0.9|ECB Securities Markets Programme (SMP) covering bond purchases since May 2010]]
On 10 May 2010, the ECB announced&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2010/html/pr100510.en.html|title=ECB decides on measures to address severe tensions in financial markets|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the launch of a &quot;Securities Market Programme&quot; (SMP) which involved the discretionary purchase of sovereign bonds in secondary markets. Extraordinarily, the decision was taken by the Governing Council during a teleconference call only three days after the ECB's usual meeting of May 6 (when Trichet still denied the possibility of purchasing sovereign bonds). The ECB justified this decision by the necessity to &quot;address severe tensions in financial markets.&quot; The decision also coincided with the EU leaders decision of May 10 to establish the European Financial Stabilisation mechanism, which would serve as a crisis fighting fund to safeguard the euro area from future sovereign debt crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/economic/30048|title=Mixed support for ECB bond purchases|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The's ECB bond buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=McManus |first2=Dan |last2=O'Brien |title=Market rout as Berlin rejects call for more EU action |journal=Irish Times |date=5 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were intended to dampen international speculation against those countries, and thus avoid a contagion of the Greek crisis towards other Eurozone countries. The assumption is that speculative activity will decrease over time and the value of the assets increase.

Although SMP did involve an injection of new money into financial markets, all ECB injections were &quot;sterilized&quot; through weekly liquidity absorption. So the operation was neutral for the overall money supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro debt working paper&quot; /&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Reference does not mention 'sterilized injections' or 'liquidity absorption'. Add page number, or different source.|date=April 2019}}

When the ECB buys bonds from other creditors such as European banks, the ECB does not disclose the transaction prices. Creditors profit of bargains with bonds sold at prices that exceed market's quotes.

As of 18 June 2012, the ECB in total had spent €212.1bn (equal to 2.2% of the Eurozone GDP) for bond purchases covering outright debt, as part of  the Securities Markets Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commbank.com.au/corporate/research/publications/economics/economic-issues/international/2012/180612-ECB.pdf|title=The ECB's Securities Market Programme (SMP) – about to restart bond purchases?|format=PDF|work=Global Markets Research – International Economics|publisher=Commonwealth Bank|date=18 June 2012|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the ECB made substantial profits out of SMP, which were largely redistributed to Eurozone countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.positivemoney.eu/2018/07/ecb-smp-profits-billions-lost-for-greece/|title=How Greece lost billions out of an obscure ECB programme|date=2018-07-25|work=Positive Money Europe|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guengl.eu/news/article/the-ecb-as-vulture-fund-how-central-banks-speculated-against-greece-and-won|title=The ECB as vulture fund: how central banks speculated against Greece and won big - GUE/NGL - Another Europe is possible|website=www.guengl.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Eurogroup decided to refund those profits to Greece, however the payments were suspended over 2014 until 2017 over the conflict between [[Yanis Varoufakis]] and ministers of the Eurogroup. In 2018, profits refunds were reinstalled by the Eurogroup. However, several NGOs complained that a substantial part of the ECB profits would never be refunded to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.positivemoney.eu/2018/10/petition-eurogroup-return-ecb-profits-to-greece/|title=Unfair ECB profits should be returned to Greece, 117,000 citizens demand|date=2018-10-19|work=Positive Money Europe|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction to the Irish banking crisis ====
In November 2010, it became clear that Ireland would not be able to afford to bail out its failing banks, and [[Anglo Irish Bank]] in particular which needed around 30 billion euros, a sum the government obviously neither could it borrow from financial markets when its bond yields were soaring to comparable levels with the Greek bonds. Instead, the governments issued a 31bn EUR &quot;promissory note&quot; (an IOU) to Anglo – which it had nationalized. In turn, the bank supplied the promissory note as collateral to the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] as collateral, so it could access emergency liquidity assistance (ELA). This way, Anglo was able to repay its bondholders. The operation became very controversial, as it basically shifted Anglo's private debts onto the government's balance sheet.

It became clear later that the ECB played a key role in making sure the Irish Government did not let Anglo default on its debts, in order to avoid a financial instability risks. On 15 October and 6 November 2010, the ECB President [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] sent two secret letters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/html/irish-letters.en.html|title=Irish letters|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Irish finance Minister which essentially informed the Irish government of the possible suspension of ELA's credit lines, unless the Government requested a financial assistance programme to the [[Eurogroup]] under condition of further reforms and fiscal consolidation. Over 2012 and 2013, the ECB repeatedly insisted that the promissory note should be repaid in full, and refused the Government's proposal to swap the notes with a long-term (and less costly) bond until February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/reuters-report-ecb-promissory-note-bond-770857-Jan2013/|title=Report: ECB rules out long-term bond to replace promissory note|last=Reilly|first=Gavan|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ECB insisted that no debt restructuring (or [[bail-in]]) should be applied to the nationalized banks' bondholders, a measure which could have saved Ireland 8 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/chopra-ecb-refusal-to-burn-bondholders-burdened-taxpayers-1.2347861|title=Chopra: ECB refusal to burn  bondholders burdened taxpayers|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, fearing a new financial panic, the ECB took extraordinary measures to avoid at all cost debt restructuring in Ireland, which resulted in higher public debt in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/anglo-promissory-notes-ecb-775366-Feb2013/|title=Everything you need to know about the promissory notes, but were afraid to ask|last=O'Connell|first=Hugh|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-term refinancing operation====

Soon after [[Mario Draghi]] took over the presidency of the ECB, the bank announced on 8 December 2011 a new round of 1% interest loans with a term of three years (36 months) – the '''Long-term Refinancing operations (LTRO)'''.

Thanks to this operation, 523 Banks tapped as much as €489.2 bn (US$640 bn). The loans were not offered to European states, but government securities issued by European states would be acceptable collateral as would [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] and other [[commercial paper]] that have a sufficient rating by credit agencies. Observers were surprised by the volume of the loans made when it was implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB82011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2011/html/is111208.en.html|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&amp;A)|author1=Mario Draghi|author2=President of the ECB|date=8 December 2011|publisher=European Central Bank|location=Frankfurt am Main|format=Press conference|accessdate=22 December 2011|author3=Vítor Constâncio|author4=Vice-President of the ECB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTloans&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/business/global/demand-for-ecb-loans-surpasses-expectations.html|title=European Bank in Strong Move to Loosen Credit|author=Nelson D.

On 29 February 2012, the ECB held a second 36-month auction, LTRO2, providing eurozone banks with further €529.5 billion in low-interest loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/29/eurozone-debt-crisis-ecb-loans-ltro#block-16|title=Eurozone crisis live: ECB to launch massive cash injection|last1=Wearden|first1=Graeme|date=29 February 2012|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=29 February 2012|last2=Fletcher|first2=Nick|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second long term refinancing operation auction saw 800 banks take part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euromoney&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/2987035/Category/1/ChannelPage/0/529-billion-LTRO-2-tapped-by-record-800-banks.html|title=€529 billion LTRO 2 tapped by record 800 banks|date=29 February 2012|accessdate=29 February 2012|publisher=Euromoney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Net new borrowing under the February auction was around €313 billion&amp;nbsp;– out of a total of €256bn existing ECB lending €215bn was rolled into LTRO2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euromoney&quot; /&gt;

====Outright Monetary Transactions====
In July 2012, in the midst of renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone, Draghi stated in a panel discussion in London that the ECB &quot;...is ready to do ''whatever it takes'' to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120726.en.html|title=Verbatim of the remarks made by Mario Draghi|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement led to a steady decline in bond yields for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/93b358ba-c1d4-11e0-bc71-00144feabdc0|title=Itay and Spain respond to ECB treatment|last=|first=|date=8 August 2011|work=Financial Times|access-date=28 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi's statement has been seen as a key turning point in the fortunes of the eurozone.

Following up on Draghi's speech, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) announced on 2 August 2012, that it &quot;may undertake outright open market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120802.en.html|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&amp;A)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to &quot;safeguarding an appropriate monetary policy transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy&quot;. The technical framework of these operations was formulated on 6 September 2012 when the ECB announced the launch of the '''[[Outright Monetary Transactions]] programme (OMT)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/business/global/european-central-bank-leaves-interest-rates-unchanged-at-0-75-percent.html?pagewanted=all|title=Europe's Central Bank Moves Aggressively to Ease Euro Crisis|last1=Ewing|first1=Jack|date=6 September 2012|work=The New York Times|last2=Erlanger|first2=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same date, the bank's [[European Central Bank#Bond purchase|Securities Markets Programme]] (SMP) was terminated.

While the duration of the previous SMP was temporary,&lt;ref&gt;European Central Bank [http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/l_12420100520en00080009.pdf Decision of the ECB of 14 May 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; OMT has no [[ex-ante]] time or size limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120906.en.html|title=ECB press conference, 6 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the activation of the purchases remains conditioned to the adherence by the benefitting country to an adjustment programme to the ESM. To date, OMT was never actually implemented by the ECB. However it is considered that its announcement (together with the &quot;whatever it takes&quot; speech) significantly contributed in stabilizing financial markets and ended the sovereign debt crisis.

==== Quantitative Easing ====
Although the sovereign debt crisis was almost solved by 2014, the ECB started to face a repeated decline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://calrev.org/2019/05/04/on-the-causes-of-european-political-instability/|title=On the Causes of European Political Instability|last=Henderson|first=Isaiah M.|date=2019-05-04|website=The California Review|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Eurozone inflation rate, indicating that the economy was going towards a deflation. Responding to this threat, the ECB announced on 4 September 2014 the launch of two bond buying purchases programmes: the Covered Bond Purchasing Programme (CBPP3) and Asset-Backed Securities Programme (ABSPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2014/html/is140904.en.html|title=Introductory statement to the press conference (with Q&amp;A)|last=European Central Bank|date=|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2015, the ECB announced an extension of those programmes within a full-fledge &quot;quantitative easing&quot; programme which also included sovereign bonds, to the tune of 60 billion euros per month up until at least September 2016. The programme was started on 9 March 2015. The program was repeatedly extended to reach about €2,500 billions and is currently expected to last until at least end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Draghi fends off German critics and keeps stimulus untouched |url=https://www.ft.com/content/efece562-2b30-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c |newspaper=Financial Times |date=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; . 

On 8 June 2016, the ECB added euro-denominated corporate bonds to its asset purchases portfolio with the launch of the corporate sector purchase  programme (CSPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/celex_32016d0016_en_txt.pdf?0240957ff3a5d0b909a9482628799777|title=DECISION (EU) 2016/948 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 1 June 2016 on the implementation of the corporate sector purchase programme (ECB/2016/16)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under this programme, it conducted net purchase of corporate bonds until January 2019 to reach about €177 billion. While the programme was halted for 11 months in January  2019, the ECB restarted net purchases in November 2019&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/omt/html/index.en.html#cspp|title=Corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) – Questions &amp; Answers|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Mandate and inflation target==
[[File:Zahlungsmittel.JPG|thumb|[[Euro banknotes]]]]
The primary objective of the European Central Bank, set out in Article 127(1) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], is to maintain [[price stability]] within the [[Eurozone]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title VIII: Economic and Monetary Policy#CHAPTER 2: MONETARY POLICY|wikisource consolidation]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Governing Council in October 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;HANSPETER K 2006, page 81&quot;&gt;THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HISTORY, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS BY HANSPETER K.

([[Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices]])&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Pow&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Powers and responsibilities of the European Central Bank |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html |accessdate=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archivedate=16 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216083913/http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/tasks/html/index.en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike for example the [[United States]] [[Federal Reserve System]], the ECB has only one primary objective—but this objective has never been defined in statutory law, and the HICP target can be termed ''ad hoc''.

The Governing Council confirmed this definition in May 2003 following a thorough evaluation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. On that occasion, the Governing Council clarified that “in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.&lt;ref name=&quot;HANSPETER K 2006, page 81&quot;/&gt; All lending to credit institutions must be collateralised as required by Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB.&lt;ref&gt;THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK HISTORY, ROLE AND FUNCTIONS BY HANSPETER K.

===Tasks===
{{one source|section|date=December 2015}}
To carry out its main mission, the ECB's tasks include:

* Defining and implementing '''monetary policy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/monetarypolicy2011en.pdf?4004e7099b3dcdbf58d0874f6eab650e|title=Monetary policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Managing '''foreign exchange operations'''
* '''Maintaining the payment system''' to promote smooth operation of the financial market infrastructure under the TARGET2 payments system&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC ECB&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/business_basics/86006.stm|title=The powers of the European Central Bank |last=Fairlamb |first=David |date=12 February 2003 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |work=BBC News |author2=Rossant, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being currently developed technical platform for settlement of securities in Europe ([[TARGET2 Securities]]).
* '''Consultative role:''' by law, the ECB's opinion is required on any national or EU legislation that falls within the ECB's competence.
* '''Collection and establishment of''' '''statistics'''
* '''International cooperation''' 
* '''Issuing banknotes:''' the ECB holds the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of [[euro banknotes]]. Member states can issue [[euro coins]], but the amount must be authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the introduction of the euro, the ECB also had exclusive right to issue coins).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC ECB&quot; /&gt; 
* '''Financial stability and prudential policy'''
* '''Banking supervision:''' since 2013, the ECB has been put in charge of supervising systemically relevant banks.

===Monetary policy tools===
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}

The principal monetary policy tool of the European central bank is collateralised borrowing or repo agreements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro debt crisis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-all-about-european-debt-crisis-in-simple-terms/20110819.htm |title=All about the European debt crisis: In SIMPLE terms|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=rediff business|publisher=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools are also used by the United States [[Federal Reserve Bank]], but the Fed does more direct purchasing of financial assets than its European counterpart.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Open Market operations&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html | title=Open Market Operation&amp;nbsp;– Fedpoints&amp;nbsp;– Federal Reserve Bank of New York | publisher=newyorkfed.org | work=Federal Reserve Bank of New York | date=August 2011 | accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collateral used by the ECB is typically high quality public and private sector debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro debt crisis&quot; /&gt;

The criteria for determining &quot;high quality&quot; for public debt have been preconditions for membership in the European Union: total debt must not be too large in relation to gross domestic product, for example, and deficits in any given year must not become too large.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro debt working paper&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/304/1/wp_2011_1_darvas.pdf |title=WOrking paper 2011 / 1 A Comprehensive approach to the EUro-area debt crisis|date=February 2011|accessdate=28 October 2011|work=Zsolt Darvas|publisher=Corvinus University of Budapest |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these criteria are fairly simple, a number of accounting techniques may hide the underlying reality of fiscal solvency—or the lack of same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Euro debt working paper&quot; /&gt;

In [[central banking]], the privileged status of the central bank is that it can make as much money as it deems needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernanke&quot; /&gt; In the [[Federal Reserve Bank|United States Federal Reserve Bank]], the Federal Reserve buys assets: typically, bonds issued by the Federal government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernanke&quot; /&gt; There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as [[commercial paper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernanke&quot; /&gt; The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for functioning of the financial system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernanke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Reserve Policies in the Financial Crisis|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Ben S. Bernanke|location=Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, Austin, Texas|format=Speech|date=1 December 2008|quote=To ensure that adequate liquidity is available, consistent with the central bank's traditional role as the liquidity provider of last resort, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of extraordinary steps.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory reliance on credit ratings===
Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council have also argued that European legislators have pushed somewhat dogmatically for the adoption of the [[Basel II]] recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the [[Capital Requirements Directive]] (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself (e.g. when gauging the [[solvency]] of financial institutions) to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of [[credit risk]] marketed by two non-European private agencies: Moody's and S&amp;P.

===Difference with US Federal Reserve===
In the United States, the [[Federal Reserve System]] purchases Treasury securities in order to inject liquidity into the economy. The [[Eurosystem]], on the other hand, uses a different method. There are about 1,500 eligible banks which may bid for short-term [[repurchase agreement|repo contracts]] of two weeks to three months duration.&lt;ref&gt;In practice, 400–500 banks participate regularly. &lt;br /&gt;{{citation|author=Samuel Cheun|title=The collateral frameworks of the Eurosystem, the Federal Reserve System and the Bank of England and the financial market turmoil|date=December 2009|url=http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp107.pdf|publisher=ECB|accessdate=24 August 2011|author2=Isabel von Köppen-Mertes|author3=Benedict Weller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again. An increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy. A decrease has the contrary effect. The contracts are carried on the asset side of the European Central Bank's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability. In layman terms, the liability of the central bank is money, and an increase in deposits in member banks, carried as a liability by the central bank, means that more money has been put into the economy.{{efn|The process is similar, though on a grand scale, to an individual who every month charges $10,000 on his or her credit card, pays it off every month, but also withdraws (and pays off) an additional $10,000 each succeeding month for transaction purposes. Such a person is operating &quot;net borrowed&quot; on a continual basis, and even though the borrowing from the credit card is short term, the effect is a stable increase in the money supply. If the person borrows less, less money circulates in the economy. If he or she borrows more, the money supply increases. An individual's ability to borrow from his or her credit card company is determined by the credit card company: it reflects the company's overall judgment of its ability to lend to all borrowers, and also its appraisal of the financial condition of that one particular borrower. The ability of member banks to borrow from the central bank is fundamentally similar.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} }}

To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;The ECB and the Eurosystem&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bertaut|first=Carol C.|year=2002|title=The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem|url=http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/neer/neer2002/neer202e.pdf|journal=New England Economic Review|issue=2nd quarter|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to [[sovereign debt]] as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to ensure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation.&lt;ref name=&quot;The ECB and the Eurosystem&quot; /&gt;

==Organization==
The ECB has four decision-making bodies, that take all the decisions with the objective of fulfilling the ECB's mandate:
* the Executive Board,
* the Governing Council,
* the General Council, and
* the Supervisory Board.

===Decision-making bodies===

====Governing Council====
The [[Governing Council of the European Central Bank|Governing Council]] is the main decision-making body of the [[Eurosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/educational/facts/orga/html/or_016.en.html |title=ECB: Decision-making bodies |accessdate=14 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206095156/http://www.ecb.int/ecb/educational/facts/orga/html/or_016.en.html |archive-date=6 February 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises the members of the Executive Board (six in total) and the governors of the National Central Banks of the euro area countries (19 as of 2015).

Since January 2015, the ECB has published on its website a summary of the Governing Council deliberations (&quot;accounts&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2016/html/index.en.html |title=Monetary policy accounts published in 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These publications came as a partial response to recurring criticism against the ECB's opacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7e58a3ea-d1bc-11e2-9336-00144feab7de?ftcamp=published_links/rss/comment/feed//product |title=Subscribe to read |work=Financial Times |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to other central banks, the ECB still does not disclose individual voting records of the governors seating in its Council.

====General Council====
The General Council is a body dealing with transitional issues of euro adoption, for example, fixing the exchange rates of currencies being replaced by the euro (continuing the tasks of the former EMI).&lt;ref name=&quot;Governing Council2&quot;/&gt; It will continue to exist until all EU member states adopt the euro, at which point it will be dissolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Governing Council2&quot;/&gt; It is composed of the President and vice-president together with the [[European System of Central Banks#Member banks|governors of all of the EU's national central banks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ENA Com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Composition of the European Central Bank |publisher=CVCE |url=http://www.cvce.eu/collections/unit-content/-/unit/en/d5906df5-4f83-4603-85f7-0cabc24b9fe1/ae7780e3-050b-4a5e-914e-e1599d6f04dc |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB GC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=ECB: General Council | publisher=European Central Bank | url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/genc/html/index.en.html | accessdate=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supervisory Board====
The Supervisory Board meets twice a month to discuss, plan and carry out the ECB's supervisory tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;SupBoard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/ssm/html/index.en.html|title=Supervisory Board|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes draft decisions to the Governing Council under the non-objection procedure. It is composed of Chair (appointed for a non-renewable term of five years), Vice-Chair (chosen from among the members of the ECB's Executive Board) four ECB representatives and representatives of national supervisors. If the national supervisory authority designated by a Member State is not a national central bank (NCB), the representative of the competent authority can be accompanied by a representative from their NCB. In such cases, the representatives are together considered as one member for the purposes of the voting procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;SupBoard&quot;/&gt;

It also includes the Steering Committee, which supports the activities of the Supervisory Board and prepares the Board's meetings. It is composed by the Chair of the Supervisory Board, Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board, one ECB representative and five representatives of national supervisors. The five representatives of national supervisors are appointed by the Supervisory Board for one year based on a rotation system that ensures a fair representation of countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;SupBoard&quot;/&gt;

===Capital subscription===
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its initial capital was supposed to be €5 billion&lt;ref&gt;Article 28.1 of the ESCB Statute&lt;/ref&gt; and the initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the member states' populations and GDP,&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 29 of the ESCB Statute&lt;/ref&gt; but the key is adjustable.&lt;ref&gt;Article 28.5 of the ESCB Statute&lt;/ref&gt; The euro area NCBs were required to pay their respective subscriptions to the ECB's capital in full. The NCBs of the non-participating countries have had to pay 7% of their respective subscriptions to the ECB's capital as a contribution to the operational costs of the ECB. As a result, the ECB was endowed with an initial capital of just under €4&amp;nbsp;billion.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The capital is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;Article 28.4 of the ESCB Statute&lt;/ref&gt; The NCBs are the sole subscribers to and holders of the capital of the ECB.

Today, ECB capital is about €11 billion, which is held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;/&gt; The NCBs’ shares in this capital are calculated using a capital key which reflects the respective member's share in the total population and gross domestic product of the EU. The ECB adjusts the shares every five years and whenever a new country joins the EU. The adjustment is made on the basis of data provided by the European Commission.

All national central banks (NCBs) that own a share of the ECB capital stock as of 1 February 2020 are listed below. Non-Euro area NCBs are required to pay up only a very small percentage of their subscribed capital, which accounts for the different magnitudes of Euro area and Non-Euro area total paid-up capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;capital&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Capital Subscription|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/capital/html/index.en.html|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=1 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reserves===
In addition to capital subscriptions, the NCBs of the member states participating in the euro area provided the ECB with foreign reserve assets equivalent to around €40&amp;nbsp;billion. The contributions of each NCB is in proportion to its share in the ECB's subscribed capital, while in return each NCB is credited by the ECB with a claim in euro equivalent to its contribution. 15% of the contributions was made in gold, and the remaining 85% in US dollars and UK pound Sterlings.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Languages===
The internal working language of the ECB is generally English, and press conferences are usually held in English. External communications are handled flexibly: English is preferred (though not exclusively) for communication within the ESCB (i.e. with other central banks) and with financial markets; communication with other national bodies and with EU citizens is normally in their respective language, but the ECB website is predominantly English; official documents such as the Annual Report are in the official languages of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Translation Adds Complexity to European Central Bank’s Supervisory Role: ECB Wants Communication in English, But EU Rules Allow Use of Any Official Language|first=Todd|last=Buell|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=11 October 2015|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/translation-adds-complexity-to-european-central-banks-supervisory-role-1414580925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=26|title=The Application of multilingualism in the European Union Context|publisher=ECB|date=February 2006|accessdate=11 October 2015|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp2.pdf|first=Phoebus|last= Athanassiou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
The European Central Bank (and by extension, the Eurosystem) is often considered as the &quot;most independent central bank in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/1997/html/sp970513.en.html|title=The European Central Bank: independent and accountable|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/1999/html/sp990504.en.html|title=The role of the Central Bank in the United Europe|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papadia|first=Francesco|last2=Ruggiero|first2=Gian Paolo|date=1999-02-01|title=Central Bank Independence and Budget Constraints for a Stable Euro|journal=Open Economies Review|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=63–90|doi=10.1023/A:1008305128157|issn=0923-7992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB902443500523452500|title=Is the ECB Too Independent?|last=Wood|first=Geoffrey|work=WSJ|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, this means that the Eurosystem tasks and policies can be discussed, designed, decided and implemented in full autonomy, without pressure or need for instructions from any external body. The main justification for the ECB's independence is that such an institutional setup assists the maintenance of price stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independence&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/independence/html/index.en.html |title=Independence |publisher=European Central Bank |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/explainers/tell-me-more/html/ecb_independent.en.html |title=Why is the ECB independent? |last=Bank |first=European Central |website=European Central Bank |language=en |access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the ECB's independence is pinned by four key principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transparency.eu/ecb|title=Transparency International EU - The global coalition against corruption in Brussels |last=EU |first=Transparency International |website=transparency.eu |language=en |access-date=2017-11-05 |date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Political independence''': The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the member states may not seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the NCBs in the performance of their tasks. Symmetrically, EU institutions and national governments are bound by the treaties to respect the ECB's independence.
* '''Operational and legal independence''': the ECB has all required competences to achieve its price stability mandate and thereby can steer monetary policy in full autonomy and by means of high level of discretion. The ECB's governing council deliberates with a high degree of secrecy, since individual voting records are not disclosed to the public (leading to suspicions that Governing Council members are voting along national lines.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heinemann and Felix Huefner (2004) 'Is the view from the Eurotower purely European? National divergence and ECB interest rate policy', ''Scottish Journal of Political Economy'' 51(4):544-558.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jose Ramon Cancelo, Diego Varela and Jose Manuel Sanchez-Santos (2011) 'Interest rate setting at the ECB: Individual preferences and collective decision making', ''Journal of Policy Modeling'' 33(6): 804-820. [[doi:10.1016/j.jpolmod.2011.08.017|DOI]].&lt;/ref&gt;) In addition to monetary policy decisions, the ECB has the right to issue legally binding regulations, within its competence and if the conditions laid down in Union law are fulfilled, it can sanction non-compliant actors if they violate legal requirements laid down in directly applicable Union regulations. The ECB's own legal personality also allows the ECB to enter into international legal agreements independently from other EU institutions, and be party of legal proceedings. Finally, the ECB can organise its internal structure as it sees fit. 
* '''Personal independence:''' the mandate of ECB board members is purposefully very long (8 years) and Governors of national central banks have a minimum renewable term of office of five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independence&quot; /&gt; In addition, ECB board members and are vastly immune from judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scplps/ecblwp4.pdf?581a2ecf674a6554f5af698f5bf54019|title=PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK|last=|first=|date=2007|website=European Central Bank|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, removals from office can only be decided by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] (CJEU), under the request of the ECB's Governing Council or the Executive Board (i.e. the ECB itself). Such decision is only possible in the event of incapacity or serious misconduct. National governors of the Eurosystem' national central banks can be dismissed under national law (with possibility to appeal) in case they can no longer fulfil their functions or are guilty of serious misconduct.
* '''Financial independence''': the ECB is the only body within the EU whose statute guarantees budgetary independence through its own resources and income. The ECB uses its own profits generated by its monetary policy operations and cannot be technically insolvent. The ECB's financial independence reinforces its political independence. Because the ECB does not require external financing and symmetrically is prohibited from direct financing to public institutions, this shields it from potential pressure from public authorities.

=== Transparency ===
In addition to its independence, the ECB is subject to limited transparency obligations in contrast to EU Institutions standards and other major central banks. Indeed, as pointed out by [[Transparency International]], &quot;The Treaties establish transparency and openness as principles of the EU and its institutions. They do, however, grant the ECB a partial exemption from these principles. According to Art. 15(3) TFEU, the ECB is bound by the EU’s transparency principles “only when exercising [its] administrative tasks” (the exemption – which leaves the term “administrative tasks” undefined – equally applies to the Court of Justice of the European Union and to the European Investment Bank).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transparency.eu/ecb/ |title=Transparency International EU - The global coalition against corruption in Brussels |last=EU |first=Transparency International |website=transparency.eu |language=en |access-date=2017-11-05|date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, there are several concrete examples where the ECB is less transparent than other institutions:
* '''Voting secrecy''': while other central banks publish the voting record of its decision makers, the ECB's Governing Council decisions are made in full discretion. Since 2014, the ECB has published &quot;accounts&quot; of its monetary policy meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2014/html/pr140703_1.en.html |title=ECB to adjust schedule of meetings and to publish regular accounts of monetary policy discussions in 2015 |last=Bank |first=European Central |website=European Central Bank |language=en |access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but those remain rather vague and do not include individual votes.
* '''Access to documents''': The obligation for EU bodies to make documents freely accessible after a 30-year embargo applies to the ECB. However, under the ECB's Rules of Procedure the Governing Council may decide to keep individual documents classified beyond the 30-year period.&lt;!-- Art. 23.3 Rules of Procedure. See also CJEU in joined cases T-3/00 and T-337/04 --&gt;
* '''Disclosure of securities:''' The ECB is less transparent than the Fed when it comes to disclosing the list of securities being held in its balance sheet under monetary policy operations such as QE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2017/11/the-eurosystem-too-opaque-and-costly/|title=The Eurosystem – Too opaque and costly? {{!}} Bruegel|website=bruegel.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic accountability===
In return to its high degree of independence and discretion, the ECB is accountable to the [[European Parliament]] (and to a lesser extent to the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU). Although no interinstitutional agreement exists between the European Parliament and the ECB to regulate the ECB's accountability framework, it has been inspired by a resolution of the European Parliament adopted in 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A4-1998-0110&amp;language=EN|title=Report  on democratic accountability in the third phase of European Monetary Union - Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy  - A4-0110/1998|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then informally agreed with the ECB and incorporated into the Parliament's rule of procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/articles/2018/html/ecb.ebart201805_01.en.html|title=The evolution of the ECB's accountability practices during the crisis|last=Bank|first=European Central|website=European Central Bank|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accountability framework involves five main mechanisms:

* '''Annual report:''' the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the [[European Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ECB Acc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/orga/accountability/html/index.en.html|title=Accountability|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the European Parliament evaluates the past activities to the ECB via its annual report on the European Central Bank (which is essentially a non legally-binding list of resolutions). 
* '''Quarterly hearings:''' the [[European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs|Economic and Monetary affairs Committee of the European Parliament]] organises a hearing (the &quot;Monetary Dialogue&quot;) with the ECB every quarter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/monetary-dialogue.html|title=Monetary dialogue {{!}} ECON Policies {{!}} ECON {{!}} Committees {{!}} European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing members of parliament to address oral questions to the ECB president.
* '''Parliamentary questions:''' all Members of the European Parliament have the right to address written questions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/econ/questions-ecb.html|title=Questions to the ECB {{!}} Documents {{!}} ECON {{!}} Committees {{!}} European Parliament|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the ECB president. The ECB president provides a written answer in about 6 weeks.
* '''Appointments:''' The European Parliament is consulted during the appointment process of executive board members of the ECB.&lt;ref name=&quot;BF EB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banque-france.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/banque_de_france/Eurosysteme_et_international/Directoire_GB.pdf|title=Executive Board|year=2005|publisher=[[Banque de France]]|format=PDF|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Legal proceedings:''' the ECB's own legal personality allows civil society or public institutions to file complaints against the ECB to the Court of Justice of the EU.

In 2013, an interinstitutional agreement was reached between the ECB and the European Parliament in the context of the establishment of the ECB's Banking Supervision. This agreement sets broader powers to the European Parliament then the established practice on the monetary policy side of the ECB's activities. For example, under the agreement, the Parliament can veto the appointment of the Chair and Vice-Chair of the ECB's supervisory board, and may approve removals if requested by the ECB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/legal/pdf/celex_32013q113001_en_txt.pdf |title=Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank on the practical modalities of the exercise of democratic accountability and oversight over the exercise of the tasks conferred on the ECB within the framework of the Single Supervisory Mechanism |last= |first= |date= |website= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank is based in [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] (East End), [[Frankfurt am Main]]. The city is the largest financial centre in the [[Eurozone]] and the bank's location in it is fixed by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |at=Protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of the European Union, Article 2, sole article, (i) |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:11997D/TXT |accessdate=4 January 2015 |title=Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts |date=11 October 1997 |publication-date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank moved to a new purpose-built headquarters in 2014, designed by a Vienna-based architectural office, [[Coop Himmelbau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Winning design by Coop Himmelb(l)au for the ECB's new headquarters in Frankfurt/Main |accessdate=2 August 2007 |publisher=European Central Bank |url=http://www.ecb.int/ecb/premises/html/image29.en.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070924213221/http://www.ecb.int/ecb/premises/html/image29.en.html |archivedate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} tall and is to be accompanied by other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the [[Großmarkthalle|former wholesale market]] in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main.
