'''Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin''' ([[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as '''Enya Patricia Brennan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|j|ə}}); born 17 May 1961), known professionally as '''Enya''', is an Irish singer, songwriter, record producer and musician. Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of [[Gweedore]] in County Donegal, Enya began her music career when she joined her family's [[Celtic music|Celtic]] band [[Clannad]] in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals. She left in 1982 with their manager and producer [[Nicky Ryan]] to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife [[Roma Ryan]] as her lyricist. Enya developed her sound over the following four years with multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements of [[New-age music|new age]], Celtic, classical, church, and folk music. She has sung in ten languages.

Enya's first projects as a solo artist included soundtrack work for ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1984) and the 1987 [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]'', which was released as her debut album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]'' (1987). She signed with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]], which granted her artistic freedom and minimal interference from the label. The commercial and critical success of ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'' (1988) propelled her to worldwide fame, helped by the international top-10 hit single &quot;[[Orinoco Flow]]&quot;. This was followed by the multi-million selling albums ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'' (1991), ''[[The Memory of Trees]]'' (1995) and ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'' (2000). Sales of the latter and its lead single, &quot;[[Only Time]]&quot;, surged in the United States following its use in the media coverage of the [[11 September attacks]]. Following ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]'' (2005) and ''[[And Winter Came...]]'' (2008), Enya took an extended break from music; she returned in 2012 and released ''[[Dark Sky Island]]'' (2015).

Enya is known for her privacy. She is Ireland's bestselling solo artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99190609 |title=Enya's New Alrates Winter |publisher=NPR |accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and second-bestselling artist behind [[U2]], with a [[Enya discography|discography]] that has sold 26.5&amp;nbsp;million [[Recording Industry Association of America|certified albums]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|title=RIAA: Top Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 75 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34614590|title=Enya says tour would be 'very possible'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 October 2015|first=Mark|last=Savage|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Day Without Rain'' (2000) remains the bestselling new-age album, with an estimated 16 million copies sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/charts-decade-end/new-age-albums?year=2009 |title=New Age Albums |work=Billboard |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enya has won awards including seven [[World Music Award]]s, four [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Album]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1858520.stm|title=Enrique triumphs at Monaco awards|publisher=BBC News|date=7 March 2002|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Ivor Novello Award]]. She was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for &quot;[[May It Be]]&quot;, written for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001).

== Career ==

=== 1976–1985: Clannad and early solo career ===
In the 1970s several members of Enya's family formed [[Clannad]], a [[Celtic music|Celtic]] band with [[Nicky Ryan]] as their manager, sound engineer and producer and his future wife [[Roma Ryan]] assisting with the tour management and administrative duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;verybestofenya-nicky&quot;&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|first=Nicky|last=Ryan|title=The Very Best of Enya (Collector's Edition)|year=2009|type=CD booklet notes (&quot;It's Been a Long Time&quot;|publisher=Warner Music|id=825646850051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musician1989&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Musician |date=May 1989 |title=Enya: Clannad's Little Sister Sails Away |first=Michael |last=Azerrad |url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-25.htm |accessdate=3 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092646/http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-25.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, after her year at college, Enya decided not to study music at university and instead accepted Ryan's invitation to join the group with the aim of expanding their sound by incorporating keyboards and another backup vocalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;verybestofenya-nicky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=hotpress2016/&gt; She toured across Europe and played an uncredited role on their sixth album, ''[[Crann Úll]]'' (1980), with a line-up of siblings [[Máire Brennan|Máire]], [[Pól Brennan|Pól]] and [[Ciarán Brennan]] and twin uncles, [[Noel Duggan|Noel]] and [[Pádraig Duggan]]. Enya became an official and credited member by the time of their next album ''[[Fuaim]]'' (1981), which features a front cover photograph of her with the band.&lt;ref name=billboard25Nov95&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pw0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|title=Enya: 'Memory,' Myth &amp; Mythology|first=Timothy|last=White|date=25 November 1995|magazine=Billboard|page=5|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicky maintains it was never his intention to make Enya a permanent member, and realised she was &quot;fiercely independent ... intent on playing her own music. She was just not sure of how to go about it&quot;. This sparked discussions between the two on the idea of using Enya's voice to form a &quot;choir of one&quot;, a concept based on the &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; technique by [[Phil Spector]] that interested them both.&lt;ref name=&quot;verybestofenya-nicky&quot;/&gt;

In 1982, during a Clannad tour of Switzerland, Nicky called for a band meeting as several issues had arisen and felt they needed to be addressed. He added, &quot;It was short and only required a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to stand back and say nothing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;verybestofenya-nicky&quot;/&gt; Enya chose to leave to pursue a solo career with the Ryans, which initially caused some friction between the three and her family but she preferred being independent and disliked being confined in the group as &quot;somebody in the background&quot;.&lt;ref name=musician1989/&gt; Nicky then suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore &quot;with no particular definite future&quot;, or live with him and Roma in their home, then located in the northern Dublin suburb of [[Artane, Dublin|Artane]], &quot;and see what happens, musically&quot;.&lt;ref name=hotpress1987/&gt; After their bank denied them a loan, Enya sold her saxophone and gave piano lessons and the Ryans used what they could afford from their savings to build a recording facility named Aigle Studio, named after the French word for &quot;eagle&quot;, in a shed in their back garden,&lt;ref name=hotpress2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;verybestofenya-nicky&quot;/&gt; and rented it out to other artists to cover its costs.&lt;ref name=londontimes2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/amaran_16.htm|work=The London Times|title=The invisible star|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=10 December 2005|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a musical partnership in the process with Nicky as Enya's producer and arranger and Roma her lyricist,&lt;ref name=musician1989/&gt; and became directors of their music company, Aigle Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://companycheck.co.uk/company/IE085184/AIGLE-MUSIC-COMPANY-LIMITED/companies-house-data|title=Aigle Music Company Limited|publisher=Company Check|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following two years, Enya developed her playing and composing by recording herself recite classical pieces on the piano and listening back to them. The process was repeated until she started to improvise sections and develop her own piano arrangements.&lt;ref name=geffenpress1989&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-32.htm |title=Watermark press release issued by Geffen Records |publisher=Geffen Records (USA) |date=January 1989 |accessdate=22 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102850/http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-32.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first composition was &quot;An Taibhse Uaighneach&quot;, Irish for &quot;The Lonely Ghost&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;verybestofenya-nicky&quot;/&gt; During this time, Enya played the synthesiser on ''[[Ceol Aduaidh]]'' (1983) by [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] and [[Frankie Kennedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Ceol Aduaidh|year=1983|publisher=Gael-Linn Records|id=CEF 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performed with the duo and Mhaonaigh's brother Gearóid in their short lived group, Ragairne.

Enya's first solo endeavour arrived in 1983 when she recorded two piano instrumentals, &quot;An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian&quot;, Irish for &quot;The Solar Wind&quot;, and &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot;, at [[Windmill Lane Studios]] in Dublin which were released on ''Touch Travel'' (1984), a limited release audio cassette of music from various artists on the Touch label. She is credited as &quot;Eithne Ní Bhraonáin&quot; on its liner notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Touch Travel|publisher=Touch|year=1984|id=T4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months of preparation, Enya's debut solo performance took place on 23 September 1983 at the [[National Stadium (Ireland)|National Stadium]] in Dublin that was televised for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s music show ''Festival Folk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stillslibrary.rte.ie/indexplus/image/2297/079.html|title=RTÉ Stills Library: Image ref no. 2297/079|publisher=RTÉ Archives|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nial Morris, a musician who worked with her during this time, recalled she &quot;was so nervous she could barely get on stage, and she cowered behind the piano until the gig was over.&quot;&lt;ref name=morris2007&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Deconstructing Enya|first=Niall|last=Morris|newspaper=The Sunday Independent|date=14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of Roma, who thought Enya's music would suit accompanying visual images, a [[demo tape]] of her compositions with Morris on additional keyboards&lt;ref name=morris2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grahamecurtis.com/irishconnectionsmag/archives/v3i3/tenors.htm|title=The Celtic Tenors|first=Colette|last=Sheriden|work=Irish Connections|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made and sent to various film producers. Among them was [[David Puttnam]], who liked the tape and chose Enya to compose the [[The Frog Prince (album)|soundtrack]] to the romantic comedy film ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1984), of which he served as executive producer.&lt;ref name=hotpress1987/&gt; Enya wrote nine tracks for the film but found her songs were rearranged and orchestrated against her wishes by Richard Myhill except two tracks she sang on, &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;, with the latter's lyrics penned by [[Charlie McGettigan]].&lt;ref name=frogprince/&gt; Film editor [[Jim Clark (film editor)|Jim Clark]] later claimed the rearrangements were necessary as Enya found it difficult to compose to picture.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=190}} Released in 1985 by [[Island Records|Island Visual Arts]], the album is the first commercial release that credits her as &quot;Enya&quot;.&lt;ref name=frogprince&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Frog Prince: The Original Movie Soundtrack|publisher=Island Visual Arts|year=1985|id=ISTA 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change from Eithne to Enya originated from Nicky Ryan, who thought her name would be too difficult for people outside Ireland to pronounce correctly, and suggested the phonetic spelling of her name.&lt;ref name=hotpress2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/Enya/music/interviews/An-Interview-With-Enya-She-Moves-In-Mysterious-Ways/16620990.html|title=An Interview With Enya: She Moves in Mysterious Ways|first=Niall|last=Stokes|work=Hot Press|date=25 January 2016|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enya looked back on the project as a good career move, but a disappointing one as &quot;we weren't part of it at the end&quot;.&lt;ref name=tracks1989&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Country Girl|journal=Tracks|first=Max|last=Bell|date=January 1989|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-16.htm|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hotpress1987/&gt; She then sang on three tracks on ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' (1985) by [[Christy Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Ordinary Man|year=1985|publisher=WEA|id=IR 0763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1985–1989: ''The Celts'' and ''Watermark'' ===
In 1985, producer [[Tony McAuley]] commissioned Enya to write a song for the six-part BBC2 television documentary series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT4|title=...Newsline...

Unlike ''The Frog Prince'', she worked with little interference which granted her freedom to establish her sound&lt;ref name=tracks1989/&gt; that she adopted throughout her career, using multi-tracked vocals, keyboards, and percussion with elements of Celtic, classical, church and folk music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warnermusic.com.au/enya |publisher=Warner Music Australia |title=Enya |accessdate=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703130406/http://www.warnermusic.com.au/enya |archivedate=3 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several weeks after the release of her debut album, Enya secured a recording contract with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]] after [[Rob Dickins]], the label's chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to ''Enya'' and found himself playing it &quot;every night before I went to bed&quot;.&lt;ref name=hotpressoctober1988&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Hot Press|date=6 October 1988|title=Going with the Flow|first=Niall|last=Stokes|accessdate=1 January 2016|url=http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] award ceremony in Dublin, and learned Enya was thinking about signing with a rival label.

In 1991, Warner Music released a collection of five Enya music videos as ''Moonshadows'' for home video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Moonshadows|year=1991|publisher=Warner Reprise Video|id=9031-76067-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Enya won her first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best New Age Album|Best New Age Album]] for ''Shepherd Moons''.

It surpassed its initial sale performance, reaching number 10 in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=UKchart/&gt; and reached platinum certification in the United States in 1996 for one million copies shipped.

After travelling worldwide to promote ''Shepherd Moons'', Enya started to write and record her fourth album, ''[[The Memory of Trees]]''. The album was released in November 1995. It peaked at number five in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=UKchart/&gt; and number nine in the United States,&lt;ref name=USalbumchart/&gt; where it sold over 3 million copies. Its lead single, &quot;[[Anywhere Is]]&quot;, reached number seven in the United Kingdom. The second, &quot;[[On My Way Home (song)|On My Way Home]]&quot;, reached number twenty-six in the same country.&lt;ref name=UKchart/&gt; In late 1994, Enya put out an [[extended play]] of [[Christmas music]] titled ''The Christmas EP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discography.enya.com/singles/14.html |title=The Christmas EP |accessdate=18 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903222422/http://discography.enya.com/singles/14.html |archivedate=3 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enya was offered to compose the score for ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', but declined. A recording of her singing &quot;Oíche Chiúin&quot;, an Irish language version of &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot;, appeared on the charity album ''[[A Very Special Christmas 3]]'', released in benefit of the [[Special Olympics]] in October 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.averyspecialchristmas.org/albums/a-very-special-christmas-vol-3|title=A Very Special Christmas, vol. 3|publisher=A Very Special Christmas|accessdate=3 July 2016}} Released by [[A&amp;M Records]] (31454-0764-2).&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1997, Enya began to select tracks for her first compilation album, &quot;trying to select the obvious ones, the hits, and others.&quot;&lt;ref name=dailynews1997/&gt; She chose to work on the collection following the promotional tour for ''The Memory of Trees'' as she felt it was the right time in her career, and that her contract with WEA required her to release a &quot;best of&quot; album.

=== 1998–2007: ''A Day Without Rain'' and ''Amarantine'' ===
Enya started work on her fifth studio album, titled ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'', in mid-1998. In a departure from her previous albums she incorporated the use of a [[string section]] into her compositions, something that was not a conscious decision at first, but Enya and Nicky Ryan agreed it complemented the songs that were being written. The album was released in November 2000, and reached number 6 in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=UKchart/&gt; and an initial peak of number 17 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2000-12-16|title=Billboard 200 for the week of December 16, 2000|work=Billboard|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]], sales of the album and its lead single, &quot;[[Only Time]]&quot;, surged after the song was widely used during radio and television coverage of the events,&lt;ref name=VH12001/&gt; leading to its description as &quot;a post-September 11 anthem&quot;.&lt;ref name=billboard2005&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Billboard|title=Enya Expands Lyrical Language|date=21 November 2005|accessdate=5 January 2016|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/amaran_13.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposure caused ''A Day Without Rain'' to outperform its original chart performance to peak at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200,&lt;ref name=VH12001/&gt; and the release of a [[maxi single]] containing the original and a pop remix of &quot;Only Time&quot; in November 2001. Enya donated its proceeds in aid of the [[International Association of Firefighters]].

''A Day Without Rain'' remains Enya's biggest seller, with 7 million copies sold in the US and the most sold new-age album of all time with an estimated 13&amp;nbsp;million copies sold worldwide.

Enya undertook additional studio projects in 2001 and 2002. The first was work on the soundtrack to the Japanese romantic film ''[[Calmi Cuori Appassionati]]'' (2001) which was subsequently released as ''[[Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati]]'' (2001). The album is formed of tracks spanning her career from ''Enya'' to ''A Day Without Rain'' with two B-sides. The album went to number 2 in Japan, and became Enya's second to sell one million copies in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABIEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q=Themes%20from%20Calmi%20Cuori%20Appassionati|journal=Billboard|date=10 November 2001|page=62|title=Hits of the World|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; November 2002 saw the release of ''[[Only Time – The Collection]]'', a box set of 51 tracks recorded through her career which received a limited release of 200,000 copies.

After numerous attempts to sing the song in English, Irish and Latin, Roma suggested a new language based on some of the sounds Enya would sing along to when developing her songs. It was a success, and Enya sang &quot;Less Than a Pearl&quot; and &quot;The River Sings&quot; in the same way. Roma worked on the language further, creating a &quot;culture and history&quot; behind it surrounding the Loxian people who are of another planet, questioning the existence of life on another.&lt;ref name=billboard2005/&gt; &quot;Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)&quot; is sung in Japanese.&lt;ref name=billboard2005/&gt; ''Amarantine'' was a global success, reaching number 6 on the ''Billboard'' 200&lt;ref name=USalbumchart/&gt; and number 8 in the UK.&lt;ref name=UKchart/&gt; It has sold over 1 million certified copies in the US, a considerable drop in sales in comparison to her previous albums.

=== 2008–present: ''And Winter Came...'' and ''Dark Sky Island'' ===
Enya continued to write music with a winter and Christmas theme for her seventh studio album, ''[[And Winter Came...]]''. Initially she intended to make an album of seasonal songs and hymns set for a release in late 2007, but decided to produce a winter-themed album instead. The track &quot;My! My!

After promoting ''And Winter Came...'', Enya took an extended break from writing and recording music. She spent her time resting, visiting family in Australia, and renovating her new home in the south of France. In March 2009, her first four studio albums were reissued in Japan in the Super High Material CD format with bonus tracks.&lt;ref name=watermark2009&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Watermark|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Celts|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=Shepherd Moons|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Memory of Trees|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her second compilation album and DVD, ''[[The Very Best of Enya]]'', was released in November 2009 and features songs from 1987 to 2008, including a previously unreleased version of &quot;Aníron&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Only Time&quot; was used in the &quot;[[Epic Split]]&quot; advertisement by [[Volvo Trucks]] starring [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] who does the splits while suspended between two lorries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Alex|title=Jean-Claude Van Damme Did A Crazy Split Standing on 2 Trucks for a Volvo Ad|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jean-claude-van-damme-epic-split-volvo-trucks-2013-11|website=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=27 November 2013|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video went [[viral video|viral]], leading to numerous parodies of the commercial uploaded to YouTube also using &quot;Only Time&quot;. The attention resulted in the song peaking at No. 43 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart.

In 2012, Enya returned to the studio to record her eighth album, ''[[Dark Sky Island]]''. Its name refers to the island of [[Sark]], where it became the first island to be designated a [[dark-sky preserve]], and a series of poems on islands by [[Roma Ryan]]. The new album was promoted with the premiere in October 2015 of its lead single, &quot;[[Echoes in Rain]]&quot;, on [[Ken Bruce]]'s radio show and with the release in the same month of the single as a digital download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruce|first1=Ken|title=BBC Radio 2|url=https://www.facebook.com/BBCR2/photos/pb.129044383774217.-2207520000.1444231478./1235941909751120/?type=3&amp;theater|website=Facebook|accessdate=7 October 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release on 20 November 2015, ''Dark Sky Island'' went to No. 4 in the UK, Enya's highest charting studio album there since ''Shepherd Moons'' went to No. 1,&lt;ref name=UKchart/&gt; and to No. 8 in the US.&lt;ref name=USalbumchart/&gt; A Deluxe Edition features three additional songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deluxe Edition + Cover – Enya.sk|url=http://enya.sk/2015/10/dark-sky-island-deluxe-edition-cover/|website=enya.sk|publisher=enya.sk|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enya completed a promotional tour of the UK and Europe, the US and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Singer Enya returns with new album |url=http://www.itv.com/lorraine/showbiz/singer-enya-returns-with-new-album-dark-sky-island|website=itv.com|publisher=ITV|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enya on Twitter:Enya will be on @BBCFrontRow from 19:15 GMT tonight on @BBCRadio4.|url=https://twitter.com/official_enya/status/667392652606836736|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=19 November 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 2 – The Chris Evans Breakfast Show, Enya, Darcy Bussel, Evgeny Lebedev and the Corrs.|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06ns2yd|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Radio Ulster – Gerry Kelly, Enya is Gerry's special guest today|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06pcy34|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Sky Island – Sukkiri Interview, 24 November 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUbha53UNl4|via=YouTube|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enya talks hiatus, new music and crossing generations|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4637856832001/enya-talks-hiatus-new-music-and-crossing-generations/?#sp=show-clips|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her visit to Japan, Enya performed &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; and &quot;Echoes in Rain&quot; at the [[Universal Studios Japan]] Christmas show in [[Osaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=エンヤが7年ぶりの来日、ＵＳＪで生ライブ|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnOrJ0jSnHo#t=94|via=YouTube|publisher=JIJI Press|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Enya appeared on the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] Christmas special ''Christmas Carols from Cork'', marking her first Irish television appearance in over seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enya appears on the Late Late Show on February 6 2009 in Dublin...News Photo |url=https://www.gettyimages.com/license/84677358|website=gettyimages|accessdate=21 April 2018|quote=DUBLIN, IRELAND – FEBRUARY 06: Enya appears on the Late Late Show on February 6, 2009 in Dublin, Ireland.

Numerous critics and reviewers classify Enya's albums as [[New-age music|new age music]] and she has won four Grammy Awards in the category. However, Enya does not classify her music as part of the genre. When asked what genre she would classify her music, her reply was &quot;Enya&quot;.&lt;ref name = Enyafaq/&gt; Nicky Ryan commented on the new age comments: &quot;Initially it was fine, but it's really not new age.

[[File:Enya logo.svg|thumb|left|Enya's logotype, first used in 1988 on the front cover of ''Watermark'']]
Enya has sung in ten languages in her career, including English, Irish, Latin, Welsh, Spanish, French and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldmusic.about.com/od/bandsartistsaz/p/Enya.htm |title=Enya Profile – Celtic New Age Music Star Enya |publisher=Worldmusic.about.com |date=17 May 1961 |accessdate=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713094248/http://worldmusic.about.com/od/bandsartistsaz/p/Enya.htm |archivedate=13 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has recorded music influenced by works from fantasy author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], including the instrumental &quot;Lothlórien&quot; from ''Shepherd Moons''. She sang &quot;May It Be&quot; in English and Tolkien's fictional language [[Quenya]], and &quot;[[Aníron]]&quot;, sang in Tolkien's other language [[Sindarin]], for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. Her albums ''Amarantine'' and ''Dark Sky Island'' include songs sung in [[Loxian]], a fictional language created by Roma, that has no official [[syntax]]. Its vocabulary was formed by Enya singing the song's notes to which Roma wrote their phonetic spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/amarantine.php#loxian |title=Loxian – Amarantine album |publisher=Enya.sk |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enya adopted a composing and songwriting method that has deviated little throughout her career. At the start of the recording process for an album she enters the studio, forgetting about her previous success, fame, and songs of hers that became hits. &quot;If I did that&quot;, she said, &quot;I'd have to call it a day&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian2000&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/nov/20/artsfeatures2|title=Interview: Enya – Queen of the castle|work=The Guardian|first=John|last=Aizlewood|date=20 November 2000|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then develops ideas on the piano, keeping note of any arrangement that can be worked on further.

Enya considered &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; from ''A Day Without Rain'' a perfect time when the lyrics reflect as to how she felt while writing the song.&lt;ref name=guardian2000/&gt; In 2008, she newly discovered her tendency to write &quot;two or three songs&quot; during the winter months, work on the arrangements and lyrics the following spring and summer, and then work on the next couple of songs when autumn arrives.&lt;ref name=elainepage2008/&gt;

== Live performances ==
Enya says that Warner Music and she &quot;did not see eye to eye&quot; initially as the label imagined her performing on stage &quot;with a piano ... maybe two or three synthesiser players and that's it&quot;.&lt;ref name=hotpress2016/&gt; Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums causes her to &quot;run overtime&quot;, leaving little time to plan for other such projects.&lt;ref name=enyabookofdays1997/&gt; She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Ryan said Enya had received an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform a concert in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/tmot-7.htm|title=The Musical Irish, from Oasis to Enya|first=Luke|last=Clancy|magazine=[[World of Hibernia]]|year=1996|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Enya spoke about the prospect of a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after ''And Winter Came...'' (2008) to perform a show at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City that would be [[simulcast]] to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enter a studio and record &quot;all the hits&quot; live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.&lt;ref name=hotpress2016/&gt;
