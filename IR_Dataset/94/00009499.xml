'''Ethernet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ər|n|ɛ|t}} is a family of [[computer network]]ing technologies commonly used in [[local area network]]s (LAN), [[metropolitan area network]]s (MAN) and [[wide area network]]s (WAN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.mef.net/Assets/White_Papers/Metro-Ethernet-Services.pdf | title = Metro Ethernet Services –  A Technical Overview | year = 2003 | access-date = 2016-01-09 | author = Ralph Santitoro | website = mef.net | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as [[IEEE 802.3]]. Ethernet has since retained a good deal of [[backward compatibility]] and has been refined to support higher [[bit rate]]s, a greater number of nodes, and longer link distances. Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as [[Token Ring]], [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]] and [[ARCNET]].

The original [[10BASE5]] Ethernet uses [[coaxial cable]] as a [[shared medium]], while the newer Ethernet variants use [[Ethernet over twisted pair|twisted pair]] and [[optical fiber|fiber optic]] links in conjunction with [[Network switch|switches]]. Over the course of its history, Ethernet data transfer rates have been increased from the original 2.94 [[Data rate units#Megabit per second|megabits per second]] (Mbit/s)&lt;ref name=Alto&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xerox|title=Alto: A Personal Computer System Hardware Manual|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/xerox/alto/Alto_Hardware_Manual_Aug76.pdf|publisher=Xerox|date=August 1976|access-date=25 August 2015 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the latest 400&amp;nbsp;[[Data rate units#Gigabit per second|gigabits per second]] (Gbit/s). The [[:Category:Ethernet standards|Ethernet standards]] comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the [[Physical layer|OSI physical layer]] in use with Ethernet.

Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called [[Frame (networking)|frames]]. Each frame contains source and destination addresses, and [[frame check sequence|error-checking data]] so that damaged frames can be detected and discarded; most often, higher-layer protocols trigger [[retransmission (data networks)|retransmission]] of lost frames. As per the [[OSI model]], Ethernet provides services up to and including the [[data link layer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 48-bit [[MAC address]] was adopted by other [[IEEE 802]] networking standards, including [[IEEE 802.11]] [[Wi-Fi]], as well as by [[FDDI]], and [[EtherType]] values are also used in [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) headers.

Ethernet is widely used in homes and industry. The [[Internet Protocol]] is commonly carried over Ethernet and so it is considered one of the key technologies that make up the [[Internet]].

Ethernet initially competed with [[Token Ring]] and other [[proprietary protocol]]s. Ethernet was able to adapt to market realities and shift to inexpensive [[10BASE2|thin coaxial cable]] and then ubiquitous [[twisted pair]] wiring. By the end of the 1980s, Ethernet was clearly the dominant network technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalfe video&quot; /&gt; In the process, 3Com became a major company. 3Com shipped its first 10&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s Ethernet 3C100 [[Network Interface Controller|NIC]] in March 1981, and that year started selling adapters for [[PDP-11]]s and [[VAX]]es, as well as [[Multibus]]-based Intel and [[Sun Microsystems]] computers.&lt;ref name=Breyer1999&gt;{{cite book |title=Switched, Fast, and Gigabit Ethernet |year=1999 |author1=Robert Breyer |author2=Sean Riley |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=1-57870-073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} This was followed quickly by DEC's [[Unibus]] to Ethernet adapter, which DEC sold and used internally to build its own corporate network, which reached over 10,000 nodes by 1986, making it one of the largest computer networks in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital at Work |author=Jamie Parker Pearson |year=1992 |publisher=Digital Press |isbn=1-55558-092-0 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Ethernet adapter card for the IBM PC was released in 1982, and, by 1985, 3Com had sold 100,000.&lt;ref name=VonBurg2003 /&gt; [[Parallel port]] based Ethernet adapters were produced for a time, with drivers for DOS and Windows. By the early 1990s, Ethernet became so prevalent that it was a must-have feature for modern computers, and Ethernet ports began to appear on some PCs and most [[workstation]]s. This process was greatly sped up with the introduction of 10BASE-T and its relatively small [[modular connector]], at which point Ethernet ports appeared even on low-end motherboards.

Since then, Ethernet technology has evolved to meet new bandwidth and market requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4211609/Shifts-growth-ahead-for-10G-Ethernet |title=Shifts, growth ahead for 10G Ethernet |publisher=E Times |date=December 20, 2010 |author=Rick Merritt |access-date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to computers, Ethernet is now used to interconnect appliances and other [[mobile device|personal devices]].&lt;ref name=&quot;metcalfe video&quot; /&gt; As [[Industrial Ethernet]] it is used in industrial applications and is quickly replacing legacy data transmission systems in the world's telecommunications networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.jaymiescotto.com/jsablog/2011/07/29/my-oh-my-ethernet-growth-continues-to-soar-surpasses-legacy/ |title=My oh My – Ethernet Growth Continues to Soar; Surpasses Legacy |date=July 29, 2011 |publisher=Telecom News Now |access-date=September 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118225710/http://www.jaymiescotto.com/jsablog/2011/07/29/my-oh-my-ethernet-growth-continues-to-soar-surpasses-legacy/ |archive-date=November 18, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the market for Ethernet equipment amounted to over $16&amp;nbsp;billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |title=Cisco, Juniper, HP drive Ethernet switch market in Q4 |url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2245430/cisco--juniper--hp-drive-ethernet-switch-market-in-q4.html |access-date=August 11, 2019 |date=February 22, 2010 |author=Jim Duffy |journal=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardization==
[[File:An Intel 82574L Gigabit Ethernet NIC, PCI Express x1 card.jpg|thumb|right|An Intel 82574L Gigabit Ethernet NIC, PCI Express ×1 card]]
In February 1980, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) started project [[IEEE 802|802]] to standardize local area networks (LAN).&lt;ref name=VonBurg2003 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeusa.org/policy/policy/2001/01aug27IEEE802.pdf |title=Letter to FCC |author=Vic Hayes |date=August 27, 2001 |quote=IEEE 802 has the basic charter to develop and maintain networking standards...

Competing proposals and broad interest in the initiative led to strong disagreement over which technology to standardize. In December 1980, the group was split into three subgroups, and standardization proceeded separately for each proposal.&lt;ref name=VonBurg2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Burg |first=Urs |last2=Kenney |first2=Martin |title=Sponsors, Communities, and Standards: Ethernet vs. Token Ring in the Local Area Networking Business |journal=Industry &amp; Innovation |date=December 2003 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=351–375 |doi=10.1080/1366271032000163621 |url=http://hcd.ucdavis.edu/faculty/webpages/kenney/articles_files/Sponsors,%20Communities,%20and%20Standards:%20Ethernet%20vs.%20Token%20Ring%20in%20the%20Local%20Area%20Networking%20Business.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206202221/http://hcd.ucdavis.edu/faculty/webpages/kenney/articles_files/Sponsors,%20Communities,%20and%20Standards:%20Ethernet%20vs.%20Token%20Ring%20in%20the%20Local%20Area%20Networking%20Business.pdf |archivedate=December 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=17 February 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delays in the standards process put at risk the market introduction of the [[Xerox Star]] workstation and 3Com's Ethernet LAN products. With such business implications in mind, [[David Liddle]] (General Manager, Xerox Office Systems) and Metcalfe (3Com) strongly supported a proposal of Fritz Röscheisen ([[Siemens]] Private Networks) for an alliance in the emerging office communication market, including Siemens' support for the international standardization of Ethernet (April 10, 1981). Ingrid Fromm, Siemens' representative to IEEE 802, quickly achieved broader support for Ethernet beyond IEEE by the establishment of a competing Task Group &quot;Local Networks&quot; within the European standards body ECMA TC24. On March 1982, ECMA TC24 with its corporate members reached an agreement on a standard for CSMA/CD based on the IEEE 802 draft.&lt;ref name=Breyer1999 /&gt;{{rp|8}} Because the DIX proposal was most technically complete and because of the speedy action taken by ECMA which decisively contributed to the conciliation of opinions within IEEE, the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard was approved in December 1982.&lt;ref name=VonBurg2003 /&gt; IEEE published the 802.3 standard as a draft in 1983 and as a standard in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3-2008, p.iv&lt;/ref&gt;

Approval of Ethernet on the international level was achieved by a similar, cross-[[partisan (political)|partisan]] action with Fromm as the [[liaison officer]] working to integrate with [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) Technical Committee 83 and [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) Technical Committee 97 Sub Committee 6. The ISO 8802-3 standard was published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=16235 |title=ISO 8802-3:1989 |publisher=[[ISO]] |access-date=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{IPstack}}
Ethernet has evolved to include higher bandwidth, improved [[medium access control]] methods, and different physical media. The coaxial cable was replaced with point-to-point links connected by [[Ethernet repeater]]s or [[Network switch|switches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2869883/lan-wan/evolution-of-ethernet.html |publisher=[[Network World]] |author=Jim Duffy |date=2009-04-20 |access-date=2016-01-01 |title=Evolution of Ethernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethernet stations communicate by sending each other [[data packet]]s: blocks of data individually sent and delivered. As with other IEEE 802 LANs, adapters come programmed with globally unique 48-bit [[MAC address]] so that each Ethernet station has a unique address{{Efn|In some cases, the factory-assigned address can be overridden, either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced or to use [[locally administered address]]es.}}. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}{{Efn|Of course bridges and switches will accept other addresses for forwarding the packet.}}

An EtherType field in each frame is used by the operating system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an [[Internet Protocol]] version such as [[IPv4]]). [[Ethernet frame]]s are said to be ''self-identifying'', because of the EtherType field. Self-identifying frames make it possible to intermix multiple protocols on the same physical network and allow a single computer to use multiple protocols together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Douglas E.

Due to the ubiquity of Ethernet, the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, and the reduced panel space needed by twisted pair Ethernet, most manufacturers now build Ethernet interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcquest.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle.asp?artid=63428 |title=Motherboard Chipsets Roundup |publisher=PCQuest |date=November 1, 2004 |author=Geetaj Channana |quote=While comparing motherboards in the last issue we found that all motherboards support Ethernet connection on board. |access-date=October 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708154855/http://pcquest.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle.asp?artid=63428 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethernet was originally based on the idea of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable acting as a broadcast transmission medium. The method used was similar to those used in radio systems,{{Efn|There are fundamental differences between wireless and wired shared-medium communication, such as the fact that it is much easier to detect collisions in a wired system than a wireless system.}} with the common cable providing the communication channel likened to the ''Luminiferous aether'' in 19th century physics, and it was from this reference that the name &quot;Ethernet&quot; was derived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurgeon 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethernet: The Definitive Guide |author=Charles E. Spurgeon |publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=978-1-56592-660-8 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original Ethernet's shared coaxial cable (the shared medium) traversed a building or campus to every attached machine. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision detection]] (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than competing Token Ring or [[Token Bus]] technologies.{{Efn|In a CSMA/CD system packets must be large enough to guarantee that the leading edge of the propagating wave of a message gets to all parts of the medium and back again before the transmitter stops transmitting, guaranteeing that [[collisions]] (two or more packets initiated within a window of time that forced them to overlap) are discovered. As a result, the minimum packet size and the physical medium's total length are closely linked.}} Computers are connected to an [[Attachment Unit Interface]] (AUI) [[transceiver]], which is in turn connected to the cable (with [[thin Ethernet]] the transceiver is integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire is highly reliable for small networks, it is not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, can make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.{{Efn|Multipoint systems are also prone to strange failure modes when an electrical discontinuity reflects the signal in such a manner that some nodes would work properly, while others work slowly because of excessive retries or not at all. See [[standing wave]] for an explanation. These could be much more difficult to diagnose than a complete failure of the segment.}}

Through the first half of the 1980s, Ethernet's [[10BASE5]] implementation used a coaxial cable {{convert|0.375|in}} in diameter, later called &quot;thick Ethernet&quot; or &quot;thicknet&quot;. Its successor, [[10BASE2]], called &quot;thin Ethernet&quot; or &quot;thinnet&quot;, used the [[RG-58]] coaxial cable. The emphasis was on making installation of the cable easier and less costly.&lt;ref name=Hegering&gt;{{cite book |author1=Heinz-Gerd Hegering |author2=Alfred Lapple |title=Ethernet: Building a Communications Infrastructure |publisher=Addison-Wesley |date=1993 |isbn=0-201-62405-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ethernetbuilding0000hege }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}}

Since all communication happens on the same wire, any information sent by one computer is received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This &quot;one speaks, all listen&quot; property is a security weakness of shared-medium Ethernet, since a node on an Ethernet network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of a single cable also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are simultaneously active.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.lantronix.com/resources/networking-tutorials/ethernet-tutorial-networking-basics/ |title=Ethernet Tutorial – Part I: Networking Basics |publisher=Lantronix |access-date=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduces throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. However, a [[Xerox]] report in 1980 studied performance of an existing Ethernet installation under both normal and artificially generated heavy load. The report claimed that 98% throughput on the LAN was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast with [[token passing]] LANs (Token Ring, Token Bus), all of which suffer throughput degradation as each new node comes into the LAN, due to token waits. This report was controversial, as modeling showed that collision-based networks theoretically became unstable under loads as low as 37% of nominal capacity. Many early researchers failed to understand these results. Performance on real networks is significantly better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In a modern Ethernet, the stations do not all share one channel through a shared cable or a simple [[Ethernet hub|repeater hub]]; instead, each station communicates with a switch, which in turn forwards that traffic to the destination station. In this topology, collisions are only possible if station and switch attempt to communicate with each other at the same time, and collisions are limited to this link. Furthermore, the [[10BASE-T]] standard introduced a [[full duplex]] mode of operation which became common with [[Fast Ethernet]] and the de facto standard with [[Gigabit Ethernet]]. In full duplex, switch and station can send and receive simultaneously, and therefore modern Ethernets are completely collision-free.

===Repeaters and hubs===

{{Main|Ethernet hub}}
For signal degradation and timing reasons, coaxial [[Ethernet segment]]s have a restricted size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kb.wisc.edu/ns/page.php?id=7829|title=Ethernet Media Standards and Distances|website=kb.wisc.edu|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat larger networks can be built by using an [[Ethernet repeater]]. Early repeaters had only two ports, allowing, at most, a doubling of network size. Once repeaters with more than two ports became available, it was possible to wire the network in a [[star network|star topology]]. Early experiments with star topologies (called &quot;Fibernet&quot;) using [[optical fiber]] were published by 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fibemet: Multimode Optical Fibers for Local Computer Networks |author1= Eric G. Rawson |author2= Robert M. Metcalfe |journal=IEEE Transactions on Communications |date= July 1978 |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages= 983–990 |url= http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/Fibernet.pdf |doi= 10.1109/TCOM.1978.1094189 |access-date= June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shared cable Ethernet is always hard to install in offices because its bus topology is in conflict with the star topology cable plans designed into buildings for telephony. Modifying Ethernet to conform to twisted pair telephone wiring already installed in commercial buildings provided another opportunity to lower costs, expand the installed base, and leverage building design, and, thus, twisted-pair Ethernet was the next logical development in the mid-1980s.

Ethernet on unshielded twisted-pair cables (UTP) began with [[StarLAN]] at 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in the mid-1980s. In 1987 [[SynOptics]] introduced the first twisted-pair Ethernet at 10&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in a star-wired cabling topology with a central hub, later called [[LattisNet]].&lt;ref name=VonBurg2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurgeon 2000&quot;/&gt;{{rp|29}}&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These evolved into 10BASE-T, which was designed for point-to-point links only, and all termination was built into the device. This changed repeaters from a specialist device used at the center of large networks to a device that every twisted pair-based network with more than two machines had to use. The tree structure that resulted from this made Ethernet networks easier to maintain by preventing most faults with one peer or its associated cable from affecting other devices on the network.

Despite the physical star topology and the presence of separate transmit and receive channels in the twisted pair and fiber media, repeater-based Ethernet networks still use half-duplex and CSMA/CD, with only minimal activity by the repeater, primarily generation of the [[jam signal]] in dealing with packet collisions. Every packet is sent to every other port on the repeater, so bandwidth and security problems are not addressed. The total throughput of the repeater is limited to that of a single link, and all links must operate at the same speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurgeon 2000&quot;/&gt;{{rp|278}}

=== {{Visible anchor|Bridging and switching}} ===&lt;!--[[Full-duplex Ethernet]] links here--&gt;
[[File:Network switches.jpg|thumb|[[Patch cable]]s with [[patch field]]s of two Ethernet switches]]
{{Main|Bridging (networking)|Network switch}}
While repeaters can isolate some aspects of [[Ethernet segment]]s, such as cable breakages, they still forward all traffic to all Ethernet devices. The entire network is one [[collision domain]], and all hosts have to be able to detect collisions anywhere on the network. This limits the number of repeaters between the farthest nodes and creates practical limits on how many machines can communicate on an Ethernet network. Segments joined by repeaters have to all operate at the same speed, making phased-in upgrades impossible.

To alleviate these problems, bridging was created to communicate at the data link layer while isolating the physical layer. With bridging, only well-formed Ethernet packets are forwarded from one Ethernet segment to another; collisions and packet errors are isolated. At initial startup, Ethernet bridges work somewhat like Ethernet repeaters, passing all traffic between segments. By observing the source addresses of incoming frames, the bridge then builds an address table associating addresses to segments. Once an address is learned, the bridge forwards network traffic destined for that address only to the associated segment, improving overall performance. [[Broadcasting (networking)|Broadcast]] traffic is still forwarded to all network segments. Bridges also overcome the limits on total segments between two hosts and allow the mixing of speeds, both of which are critical to the incremental deployment of faster Ethernet variants.

In 1989, the networking company [[Kalpana (company)|Kalpana]] introduced their EtherSwitch, the first Ethernet switch.{{Efn|The term ''switch'' was invented by device manufacturers and does not appear in the IEEE 802.3 standard.}} Early switches such as this used [[cut-through switching]] where only the header of the incoming packet is examined before it is either dropped or forwarded to another segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;networkcomputing_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 Most Important Products of the Decade |author=Robert J. Kohlhepp |date=2000-10-02 |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Network Computing |url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/1119/1119f1products_5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152318/http://www.networkcomputing.com/1119/1119f1products_5.html |archivedate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduces the forwarding latency. One drawback of this method is that it does not readily allow a mixture of different link speeds. Another is that packets that have been corrupted are still propagated through the network.  The eventual remedy for this was a return to the original [[store and forward]] approach of bridging, where the packet is read into a buffer on the switch in its entirety, its [[frame check sequence]] verified and only then the packet is forwarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;networkcomputing_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The 10 Most Important Products of the Decade |author=Robert J. Kohlhepp |date=2000-10-02 |accessdate=2008-02-25 |publisher=Network Computing |url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/1119/1119f1products_5.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105152318/http://www.networkcomputing.com/1119/1119f1products_5.html |archivedate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern network equipment, this process is typically done using [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s allowing packets to be forwarded at [[wire speed]].

When a twisted pair or fiber link segment is used and neither end is connected to a repeater, [[full-duplex]] Ethernet becomes possible over that segment.  In full-duplex mode, both devices can transmit and receive to and from each other at the same time, and there is no collision domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Pidgeon |work=How Stuff Works |url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/ethernet15.htm |title=Full-duplex Ethernet |access-date=2020-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doubles the aggregate bandwidth of the link and is sometimes advertised as double the link speed (for example, 200&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for Fast Ethernet).{{Efn|This is misleading, as performance will double only if traffic patterns are symmetrical.}} The elimination of the collision domain for these connections also means that all the link's bandwidth can be used by the two devices on that segment and that segment length is not limited by the constraints of collision detection.

Since packets are typically delivered only to the port they are intended for, traffic on a switched Ethernet is less public than on shared-medium Ethernet. &lt;span id=&quot;switch_vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Despite this, switched Ethernet should still be regarded as an insecure network technology, because it is easy to subvert switched Ethernet systems by means such as [[ARP spoofing]] and [[MAC flooding]].&lt;/span&gt;

The bandwidth advantages, the improved isolation of devices from each other, the ability to easily mix different speeds of devices and the elimination of the chaining limits inherent in non-switched Ethernet have made switched Ethernet the dominant network technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns394/ns74/ns149/net_business_benefit09186a00800c92b9_ps6600_Products_White_Paper.html |quote=Respondents were first asked about their current and planned desktop LAN attachment standards.

===Advanced networking===
[[File:Coreswitch (2634205113).jpg|thumb|A core Ethernet switch]]
Simple switched Ethernet networks, while a great improvement over repeater-based Ethernet, suffer from single points of failure, attacks that trick switches or hosts into sending data to a machine even if it is not intended for it, scalability and security issues with regard to [[switching loop]]s, [[broadcast radiation]] and [[multicast]] traffic, and bandwidth choke points where a lot of traffic is forced down a single link.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Advanced networking features in switches use [[shortest path bridging]] (SPB) or the [[spanning-tree protocol]] (STP) to maintain a loop-free, meshed network, allowing physical loops for redundancy (STP) or load-balancing (SPB). Advanced networking features also ensure port security, provide protection features such as MAC lockdown and broadcast radiation filtering, use [[virtual LAN]]s to keep different classes of users separate while using the same physical infrastructure, employ [[multilayer switch]]ing to route between different classes, and use [[link aggregation]] to add bandwidth to overloaded links and to provide some redundancy.

Shortest path bridging includes the use of the [[link-state routing protocol]] [[IS-IS]] to allow larger networks with shortest path routes between devices.  In 2012, it was stated by David Allan and Nigel Bragg, in ''802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution: The Architect's Perspective'' that shortest path bridging is one of the most significant enhancements in Ethernet's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=David|title=802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution : The Architects' Perspective|date=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-14866-2|first2=Nigel|last2=Bragg|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118148665.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
{{Main|Ethernet physical layer|Ethernet over twisted pair}}
The Ethernet physical layer evolved over a considerable time span and encompasses coaxial, twisted pair and fiber-optic physical media interfaces, with speeds from {{nowrap|10 Mbit/s}} to {{nowrap|100 Gbit/s}}, with [[Terabit Ethernet|400 Gbit/s]] expected by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adopted Timeline |publisher=IEEE 802.3bs Task Force |url=http://www.ieee802.org/3/bs/timeline_3bs_0915.pdf |date=2015-09-18 |access-date=2017-01-08 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first introduction of twisted-pair CSMA/CD was [[StarLAN]], standardized as 802.3 1BASE5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = 1BASE5 Medium Specification (StarLAN)
| date = 1996-12-28 | access-date = 2014-11-11
| website = cs.nthu.edu.tw
}}&lt;/ref&gt; While 1BASE5 had little market penetration, it defined the physical apparatus (wire, plug/jack, pin-out, and wiring plan) that would be carried over to 10BASE-T.

The most common forms used are [[Ethernet over twisted pair|10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T]]. All three use twisted pair cables and [[8P8C modular connector]]s. They run at {{nowrap|10 Mbit/s}}, {{nowrap|100 Mbit/s}}, and {{nowrap|1 Gbit/s}}, respectively.

[[Optical fiber|Fiber optic]] variants of Ethernet (that use [[Small form-factor pluggable transceiver|SFP]]) are also very common in larger networks, offering high performance, better electrical isolation and longer distance (tens of kilometers with some versions). In general, network [[protocol stack]] software will work similarly on all varieties.

==Frame structure==
[[File:SMSC LAN91C110 ethernet chip.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the SMSC LAN91C110 (SMSC 91x) chip, an embedded Ethernet chip]]
{{Main|Ethernet frame}}
In IEEE 802.3, a [[datagram]] is called a ''packet'' or ''frame''. ''Packet'' is used to describe the overall transmission unit and includes the [[preamble (communication)|preamble]], [[start frame delimiter]] (SFD) and carrier extension (if present).{{Efn|The carrier extension is defined to assist collision detection on shared-media gigabit Ethernet.}} The ''frame'' begins after the start frame delimiter with a frame header featuring source and destination MAC addresses and the EtherType field giving either the protocol type for the payload protocol or the length of the payload. The middle section of the frame consists of payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, Internet Protocol) carried in the frame. The frame ends with a 32-bit [[cyclic redundancy check]], which is used to detect corruption of [[data in transit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| format = PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sections 3.1.1 and 3.2}} Notably, Ethernet packets have no [[hop count|time-to-live field]], leading to possible problems in the presence of a switching loop.

==Autonegotiation==
{{Main|Autonegotiation}}
Autonegotiation is the procedure by which two connected devices choose common transmission parameters, e.g. speed and duplex mode. Autonegotiation was initially an optional feature, first introduced with 100BASE-TX, while it is also backward compatible with 10BASE-T. Autonegotiation is mandatory for 1000BASE-T and faster.

==Error conditions==
===Switching loop===
{{main|Switching loop}}
A switching loop or bridge loop occurs in [[computer network]]s when there is more than one [[Layer 2]] ([[OSI model]]) path between two endpoints (e.g. multiple connections between two [[network switch]]es or two ports on the same switch connected to each other). The loop creates [[broadcast radiation|broadcast storms]] as broadcasts and [[multicast]]s are forwarded by switches out every [[Computer port (hardware)|port]], the switch or switches will repeatedly rebroadcast the broadcast messages flooding the network. Since the Layer 2 header does not support a ''[[time to live]]'' (TTL) value, if a frame is sent into a looped topology, it can loop forever.

A physical topology that contains switching or bridge loops is attractive for redundancy reasons, yet a switched network must not have loops.  The solution is to allow physical loops, but create a loop-free logical topology using the [[shortest path bridging]] (SPB) protocol or the older [[spanning tree protocol]]s (STP) on the network switches.

===Jabber===
A node that is sending longer than the maximum transmission window for an Ethernet packet is considered to be ''jabbering''. Depending on the physical topology, jabber detection and remedy differ somewhat.
* An [[Medium Attachment Unit|MAU]] is required to detect and stop abnormally long transmission from the [[Data terminal equipment|DTE]] (longer than 20–150&amp;nbsp;ms) in order to prevent permanent network disruption.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''8.2 MAU functional specifications''&lt;/ref&gt;
* On an electrically shared medium (10BASE5, 10BASE2, 1BASE5), jabber can only be detected by each end node, stopping reception. No further remedy is possible.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''8.2.1.5 Jabber function requirements''&lt;/ref&gt;
* A repeater/repeater hub uses a jabber timer that ends retransmission to the other ports when it expires. The timer runs for 25,000 to 50,000 bit times for 1 Mbit/s,&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''12.4.3.2.3 Jabber function''&lt;/ref&gt; 40,000 to 75,000 bit times for 10 and 100 Mbit/s,&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''9.6.5 MAU Jabber Lockup Protection''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''27.3.2.1.4 Timers''&lt;/ref&gt; and 80,000 to 150,000 bit times for 1 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''41.2.2.1.4 Timers''&lt;/ref&gt; Jabbering ports are partitioned off the network until a carrier is no longer detected.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.3 ''27.3.1.7 Receive jabber functional requirements''&lt;/ref&gt;
* End nodes utilizing a MAC layer will usually detect an oversized Ethernet frame and cease receiving. A bridge/switch will not forward the frame.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 802.1 ''Table C-1—Largest frame base values''&lt;/ref&gt;
* A non-uniform frame size configuration in the network using [[jumbo frame]]s may be detected as jabber by end nodes.
* A packet detected as jabber by an upstream repeater and subsequently cut off has an invalid [[frame check sequence]] and is dropped.

===Runt frames===
* ''[[Ethernet frame#Runt frames|Runts]]'' are packets or frames smaller than the minimum allowed size. They are dropped and not propagated.
