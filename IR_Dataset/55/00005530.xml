== Etymology and definition ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''conspiracy theory'' as &quot;the theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; ''spec.'' a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event&quot;.  It cites a 1909 article in ''[[The American Historical Review]]'' as the earliest usage example,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM'' (v. 4.0), Oxford University Press, 2009, s.v. '''4'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Allen | title = Reviewed Work: ''The Repeal of the Missouri Compromise: Its Origin and Authorship'' by P.

Psychological News&quot;, ''The Journal of Mental Science'', Volume 16, publ. Longman, Green, Longman &amp; Roberts, 1871 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=VsRMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA141 141])&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;conspiracy&quot; derives from the Latin ''con-'' (&quot;with, together&quot;) and ''spirare'' (&quot;to breathe&quot;).

Robert Blaskiewicz notes examples of the term were used as early as the nineteenth century and states that its usage has always been derogatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/nope_it_was_always_already_wrong|title=Nope, It Was Always Already Wrong|last1=Blaskiewicz|first1=Robert|website=The Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=11 December 2015|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Andrew McKenzie-McHarg, in contrast, in the nineteenth century the term ''conspiracy theory'' simply &quot;suggests a plausible postulate of a conspiracy&quot; and &quot;did not, at this stage, carry any connotations, either negative or positive&quot;, though sometimes a postulate so-labeled was criticized.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie-McHarg, Andrew (2019) &quot;Conspiracy Theory: The Nineteenth-Century Prehistory of a Twentieth-Century Concept,&quot; pp. 78, 76. In Joseph E. Uscinski (ed) ''Conspiracy Theories &amp; the People Who Believe Them''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lance deHaven-Smith suggested that the term entered everyday language in the United States after 1964, the year in which the [[Warren Commission]] shared its findings, with ''The New York Times'' running five stories that year using the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TilCeCKDujQC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Conspiracy Theory in America|last1=deHaven-Smith|first1=Lance|date=15 April 2013|isbn=9780292743793|pages=3|quote=The term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; did not exist as a phrase in everyday American conversation before 1964. ...

A conspiracy theory is not simply a [[conspiracy]]. Barkun writes that conspiracies are &quot;actual covert plots planned and/or carried out by two or more persons&quot;. A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is &quot;an intellectual construct&quot;, a &quot;template imposed upon the world to give the appearance of order to events&quot;. Positing that &quot;some small and hidden group&quot; has manipulated events, a conspiracy theory can be local or international, focused on single events or covering multiple incidents and entire countries, regions and periods of history. Conspiracy theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge or a special mode of thought that separates them from the masses who believe the official account.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barkun2016&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1177/0392192116669288|title=Conspiracy Theories as Stigmatized Knowledge|journal=Diogenes|pages=039219211666928|year=2016|last1=Barkun|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{See|List of conspiracy theories}}
A conspiracy theory may take any matter as its subject, but certain subjects attract greater interest than others. Favored subjects include famous deaths and assassinations, morally dubious government activities, suppressed technologies, and “[[false flag]]” terrorism. Among the longest-standing and most widely recognized conspiracy theories are notions concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the 1969 Apollo moon landings, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as numerous theories pertaining to alleged plots for world domination by various groups both real and imaginary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=History's greatest conspiracy theories|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/16/historys-greatest-conspiracy-theories/|date=12 November 2008|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
Scholars argue that conspiracy theories once limited to fringe audiences have become commonplace in [[mass media]], contributing to conspiracism emerging as a [[cultural phenomenon]] in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=58}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Camp 1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia|author=Camp, Gregory S.|publisher=Commish Walsh|year=1997|asin=B000J0N8NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg 2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/enemieswithincul00gold_0|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|author=Goldberg, Robert Alan|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-300-09000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenster 2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture|author=Fenster, Mark|publisher=University of Minnesota Press; 2nd edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8166-5494-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general predisposition to believe conspiracy theories cuts across partisan and ideological lines.  Conspiratorial thinking is correlated with antigovernmental orientations and a low sense of political efficacy, with conspiracy believers perceiving a governmental threat to individual rights and displaying a deep skepticism that who one votes for really matters.&lt;ref&gt;Adam M. Enders, &quot;Conspiratorial Thinking and Political Constraint.&quot; ''Public Opinion Quarterly'' 83.3 (2019): 510–533.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to anthropologists Todd Sanders and Harry G. West, a broad cross-section of Americans today gives credence to at least some conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West |first=Harry G. |last2=Sanders |first2=Todd |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeMdeV_LvAMC&amp;pg=PP9 |title= Transparency and conspiracy: ethnographies of suspicion in the new world order |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=978-0-8223-3024-0 |page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a study conducted in 2016 found that 10% of Americans think the [[chemtrail conspiracy theory]] is &quot;completely true&quot; and 20-30% think it is &quot;somewhat true&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gizearth /&gt; This puts &quot;the equivalent of 120 million Americans in the &quot;chemtrails are real&quot; camp.&lt;ref name=Gizearth&gt;{{cite news |last= Kahn|first= Brian|date= 2 November 2017|title= There's a Damn Good Chance Your Neighbor Thinks Chemtrails Are Real|url= https://earther.gizmodo.com/theres-a-damn-good-chance-your-neighbor-thinks-chemtrai-1820077077|work= Gizmodo Earther|access-date= 5 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in conspiracy theories has therefore become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists and experts in [[folklore]].

Conspiracy theories are widely present on the [[World Wide Web|Web]] in the form of [[blog]]s and [[YouTube]] videos, as well as on [[social media]]. Whether the Web has increased the prevalence of conspiracy theories or not is an open research question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wood, M. |title= Has the Internet been good for conspiracy theorising? | journal=Psychology Postgraduate Affairs Group (PsyPAG) Quarterly |year= 2015 | number=88|pages= 31–33|url=http://www.psypag.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Issue-88.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence and representation of conspiracy theories in [[search engine]] results has been monitored and studied, showing significant variation across different topics, and a general absence of reputable, high-quality links in the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ballatore, A. |title= Google chemtrails: A methodology to analyze topic representation in search engine results |journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |year= 2015 | volume=20 | number=7 | url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5597 | doi=10.5210/fm.v20i7.5597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
===Walker's five kinds===
[[Jesse Walker]] (2013) has identified five kinds of conspiracy theories:
* The &quot;Enemy Outside&quot; refers to theories based on figures alleged to be scheming against a community from without.
* The &quot;Enemy Within&quot; finds the conspirators lurking inside the nation, indistinguishable from ordinary citizens.
* The &quot;Enemy Above&quot; involves powerful people manipulating events for their own gain.
* The &quot;Enemy Below&quot; features the lower classes working to overturn the social order.
* The &quot;Benevolent Conspiracies&quot; are angelic forces that work behind the scenes to improve the world and help people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesse Walker]], ''The United States of Paranoia: A Conspiracy Theory'' (2013) [https://www.amazon.com/United-States-Paranoia-Conspiracy-Theory/dp/0062135554/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barkun's three types===
[[Michael Barkun]] has identified three classifications of conspiracy theory:
* ''Event conspiracy theories''.  This refers to limited and well-defined events.  Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the [[Kennedy assassination conspiracies|Kennedy assassination]], [[9/11]], and the [[discredited AIDS origins theories|spread of AIDS]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}
* ''Systemic conspiracy theories''.  The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jews]], [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Red Scare|Communism]], or the [[Vatican conspiracy theories|Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}
* ''Superconspiracy theories''. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically.  At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force.  His cited examples are the ideas of [[David Icke]] and [[Milton William Cooper]].{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=6}}

=== Rothbard: shallow vs. deep ===
[[Murray Rothbard]] argues in favor of a model that contrasts &quot;deep&quot; conspiracy theories to &quot;shallow&quot; ones. According to Rothbard, a &quot;shallow&quot; theorist observes an event and asks ''[[Cui bono]]''? (&quot;Who benefits?&quot;), jumping to the conclusion that a posited beneficiary is responsible for covertly influencing events.  On the other hand, the &quot;deep&quot; conspiracy theorist begins with a hunch and then seeks out evidence. Rothbard describes this latter activity as a matter of confirming with certain facts one's initial paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by B.K. Marcus in &quot;[https://mises.org/journals/jls/20_2/20_2_2.pdf Radio Free Rothbard],&quot; ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol 20, No 2. (SPRING 2006): pp 17–51. Retrieved 16 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence vs. conspiracy theory==

Belief in conspiracy theories is generally based not on evidence, but in the faith of the believer.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=7}} [[Noam Chomsky]] contrasts conspiracy theory to [[institutional analysis]] which focuses mostly on the public, long-term behavior of publicly known institutions, as recorded in, for example, scholarly documents or [[mainstream media]] reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;WintonickQuébec)1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Achbar |editor-first=Mark |year=1994 |title=Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media |url=https://archive.org/details/manufacturingcon00achb |url-access=registration |publisher=Black Rose Books Ltd. |isbn=978-1-55164-002-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/manufacturingcon00achb/page/131 131]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theory conversely posits the existence of secretive coalitions of individuals and speculates on their alleged activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Conspiracy Panics: Political Rationality and Popular Culture | author = Jack Z.

[[Clare Birchall]] at [[King's College London]] describes conspiracy theory as a &quot;form of popular knowledge or interpretation&quot;.{{efn|Birchall 2006: &quot;[W]e can appreciate conspiracy theory as a unique form of popular knowledge or interpretation, ''and'' address what this might mean for any knowledge we produce about it or how we interpret it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Birchall2006&gt;{{cite book | last = Birchall | first = Clare | contribution = Cultural studies on/as conspiracy theory | editor-last = Birchall | editor-first = Clare | title = Knowledge goes pop from conspiracy theory to gossip | publisher = Berg | location = Oxford, New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-84520-143-2 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}}}} The use of the word 'knowledge' here suggests ways in which conspiracy theory may be considered in relation to legitimate modes of knowing.{{efn|Birchall 2006: &quot;What we quickly discover&amp;nbsp;... is that it becomes impossible to map conspiracy theory and academic discourse onto a clear illegitimate/legitimate divide.&quot;&lt;ref name=Birchall2006/&gt;{{rp|72}}}} The relationship between legitimate and illegitimate knowledge, Birchall claims, is closer than common dismissals of conspiracy theory contend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Birchall | first = Clare | title = Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you | journal = Culture Machine, Deconstruction Is/In Cultural Studies | volume = 6 | year = 2004 | url = http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/view/12/11 | ref = harv | access-date = 11 March 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211857/http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/article/view/12/11 | archive-date = 23 September 2015 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories involving multiple conspirators that are proven to be correct, such as the [[Watergate scandal]], are usually referred to as &quot;investigative journalism&quot; or &quot;historical analysis&quot; rather than conspiracy theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;knight-2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Knight|title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA730|date=1 January 2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-812-9|pages=730–}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the term &quot;Watergate conspiracy theory&quot; is used to refer to a variety of hypotheses in which those convicted in the conspiracy were in fact the victims of a deeper conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Ron Rosenbaum|title=Ah, Watergate|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/104169/ah-watergate|year=2012|magazine=New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Conspiracism}} Conspiracism as a world view ==
The historian [[Richard Hofstadter]] addressed the role of [[paranoia]] and conspiracism throughout [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] in his 1964 essay &quot;[[The Paranoid Style in American Politics]]&quot;. [[Bernard Bailyn|Bernard Bailyn's]] classic ''[[The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution]]'' (1967) notes that a similar phenomenon could be found in North America during the time preceding the [[American Revolution]]. Conspiracism labels people's attitudes as well as the type of conspiracy theories that are more global and historical in proportion.&lt;ref&gt;

The term &quot;conspiracism&quot; was further popularized by academic Frank P. Mintz in the 1980s. According to Mintz, conspiracism denotes &quot;belief in the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history&quot;:&lt;ref name=Mintz1985&gt;

{{quote|Conspiracism serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in America and elsewhere. It identifies elites, blames them for economic and social catastrophes, and assumes that things will be better once popular action can remove them from positions of power.

Justin Fox of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine is of the opinion that Wall Street traders are among the most conspiracy-minded group of people, and ascribes this to the reality of some financial market conspiracies, and to the ability of conspiracy theories to provide necessary orientation in the market's day-to-day movements.

=== United States ===
[[Harry G. West]] and others have noted that while conspiracy theorists may often be dismissed as a fringe minority, certain evidence suggests that a wide range of the U.S. maintains a belief in conspiracy theories. West also compares those theories to [[hypernationalism]] and [[religious fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Transparency and Conspiracy: Ethnographies of Suspicion in the New World Order | author = Harry G. West|publisher=Duke University Press Books|pages=4, 207–08|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shermer|Shermer, Michael]], and Pat Linse.  ''Conspiracy Theories''.  Altadena, CA: Skeptics Society, n.d.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologian [[Robert Jewett]] and philosopher [[John Shelton Lawrence]] attribute the enduring popularity of conspiracy theories in the U.S. to the [[Cold War]], [[McCarthyism]], and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] rejection of authority. They state that among both the left-wing and right-wing, there remains a willingness to use real events, such as Soviet plots, inconsistencies in the [[Warren Commission|Warren Report]], and the [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks, to support the existence of unverified and ongoing large-scale conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;Jewett, Robert; John Shelton Lawrence (2004) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VE2k18ScPnQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22conspiracy%20theories%22 Captain America and the crusade against evil: the dilemma of zealous nationalism]'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Watergate scandal]] has also been used to bestow legitimacy to other conspiracy theories, with [[Richard Nixon]] himself commenting that it served as a &quot;[[Rorschach test|Rorschach ink blot]]&quot; which invited others to fill in the underlying pattern.&lt;ref name=&quot;knight-2003&quot; /&gt;

Historian [[Kathryn S. Olmsted]] cites three reasons why Americans are prone to believing in government conspiracies theories: 
#Genuine government overreach and secrecy during the Cold War, such as [[Watergate]], the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], [[Project MKUltra]], and the CIA's [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|collaboration with mobsters in attempting to assassinate Fidel Castro]].
#Precedent set by official government-sanctioned conspiracy theories for propaganda, such as claims of German infiltration of the U.S. during World War II or the debunked claim that [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|Saddam Hussein played a role in the 9/11 attacks]].
#Distrust fostered by the government's spying on and harassment of dissenters, such as the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], [[COINTELPRO]], and as part of various [[Red Scare]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Olmsted, Kathryn S. (2011) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=u7Sd5vyOOtEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories and American Democracy, World War I to 9/11]'', Oxford University Press, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological interpretations ==
The widespread belief in conspiracy theories has become a topic of interest for sociologists, psychologists, and experts in folklore since at least the 1960s, when [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|a number of conspiracy theories]] arose regarding the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]. [[Sociologist]] Türkay Salim Nefes underlines the political nature of conspiracy theories. He suggests that one of the most important characteristics of these accounts is their attempt to unveil the &quot;real but hidden&quot; power relations in social groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkay Nefes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nefes&quot;/&gt;

Research suggests, on a psychological level, '''conspiracist ideation'''—belief in conspiracy theories—can be harmful or pathological,&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman 595–604&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barron 156–159&quot;/&gt; and is highly correlated with [[psychological projection]], as well as with [[paranoia]], which is predicted by the degree of a person's [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Douglas|first1=Karen M.|last2=Sutton|first2=Robbie M.|date=12 April 2011|title=Does it take one to know one?

===The attractions of conspiracy theory===

The political scientist [[Michael Barkun]], discussing the usage of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; in contemporary American culture, holds that this term is used for a belief that explains an event as the result of a secret plot by exceptionally powerful and cunning conspirators to achieve a malevolent end.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=3}}&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist 1 2004&quot;/&gt; According to Barkun, the appeal of conspiracism is threefold:

* &quot;First, conspiracy theories claim to explain what [[institutional analysis]] cannot. They appear to make sense out of a world that is otherwise confusing. 
* Second, they do so in an appealingly simple way, by dividing the world sharply between [[Manichaeism|the forces of light, and the forces of darkness]]. They trace all evil back to a single source, the conspirators and their agents. 
* Third, conspiracy theories are often presented as special, [[esotericism|secret knowledge]] unknown or unappreciated by others. For conspiracy theorists, the masses are a [[sheeple|brainwashed herd]], while the conspiracy theorists in the know can congratulate themselves on penetrating the plotters' deceptions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist 1 2004&quot;/&gt;

This third point is supported by research of Roland Imhoff, professor in [[Social Psychology]] at the [[Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz]]. The research suggests that the smaller the minority believing in a specific theory, the more attractive it is to conspiracy theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Imhoff |first1=Roland |title=Conspiracy Theorists Just Want to Feel Special |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kg8j3/conspiracy-theorists-just-want-to-feel-special |website=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=6 July 2018|date=17 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic psychologists]] argue that even if a posited cabal behind an alleged conspiracy is almost always perceived as hostile, there often remains an element of reassurance for theorists. This is because it is a consolation to imagine that difficulties in human affairs are created by humans, and remain within human control.  If a cabal can be implicated, there may be a hope of breaking its power or of joining it.  Belief in the power of a cabal is an implicit assertion of human dignity—an unconscious affirmation that man is responsible for his own destiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baigent, Michael |author2=Leigh, Richard |author3=Lincoln, Henry | title = The Messianic Legacy | publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-8050-0568-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People formulate conspiracy theories to explain, for example, power relations in social groups and the perceived existence of evil forces.{{efn|[[Michael Barkun|Barkun]] 2003: &quot;The essence of conspiracy beliefs lies in attempts to delineate and explain evil. At their broadest, conspiracy theories 'view history as controlled by massive, demonic forces.'&amp;nbsp;... For our purposes, a ''conspiracy belief'' is the belief that an organization made up of individuals or groups was or is acting covertly to achieve a malevolent end.&quot;{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=3}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;New Internationalist 1 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Berlet, Chip| author-link = Chip Berlet|title= Interview: Michael Barkun |date= September 2004 |url= http://www.publiceye.org/antisemitism/nw_barkun.html |quote= The issue of conspiracism versus rational criticism is a tough one, and some people (Jodi Dean, for example) argue that the former is simply a variety of the latter.

According to Berlet and Lyons, &quot;Conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against the common good, while it valorizes the scapegoater as a hero for sounding the alarm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

===Psychological origins===
Some psychologists believe that a search for meaning is common in conspiracism. Once cognized, [[confirmation bias]] and avoidance of [[cognitive dissonance]] may reinforce the belief. In a context where a conspiracy theory has become embedded within a social group, [[communal reinforcement]] may also play a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren|last2=Coles|first2=Rebecca|last3=Stieger|first3=Stefan|last4=Pietschnig|first4=Jakob|last5=Furnham|first5=Adrian|last6=Rehim|first6=Sherry|last7=Voracek|first7=Martin|date=2011|title=Conspiracist ideation in Britain and Austria: Evidence of a monological belief system and associations between individual psychological differences and real-world and fictitious conspiracy theories|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=102|issue=3|pages=443–463|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.2010.02004.x|pmid=21751999|issn=2044-8295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Projection====
Some historians have argued that there is an element of [[psychological projection]] in conspiracism. This projection, according to the argument, is manifested in the form of attribution of undesirable characteristics of the self to the conspirators. Historian Richard Hofstadter stated that:

{{quote|This enemy seems on many counts a projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. A fundamental paradox of the paranoid style is the imitation of the enemy. The enemy, for example, may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The [[John Birch Society]] emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through &quot;front&quot; groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist &quot;crusades&quot; openly express their admiration for the dedication, discipline, and strategic ingenuity the Communist cause calls forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;harpers=1964&quot;/&gt;}}

Hofstadter also noted that &quot;sexual freedom&quot; is a vice frequently attributed to the conspiracist's target group, noting that &quot;very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;harpers=1964&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hofstadter, Richard|author-link=Richard Hofstadter|year=1965|title=The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|isbn=978-0-674-65461-7|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XcLSoljnmBcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=0674654617#v=onepage&amp;q=This%20enemy%20seems%20to%20be%20on%20many%20counts%20a%20projection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological interpretations==
In addition to psychological factors such as conspiracist ideation, sociological factors also help account for who believes in which conspiracy theories. Such theories tend to get more traction among losers in society, for example, and the emphasis of conspiracy theories by elites and leaders tends to increase belief among followers who have higher levels of conspiracy thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Uscinski |first1=Joseph E. |authorlink1=Joseph Uscinski |title=Conspiring for the Common Good |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2019/07/conspiring-for-the-common-good/ |website=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |accessdate=9 February 2020|date=2 July 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] described conspiracy theory as the &quot;exhaust fumes of democracy&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodapp 2008&quot;/&gt; the unavoidable result of a large amount of information circulating among a large number of people.

Conspiracy theories may be emotionally satisfying, by assigning blame to a group to which the theorist does not belong and so absolving the theorist of moral or political responsibility in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Shankar
|last=Vedantam |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/04/AR2006060400618.html |title=Born With the Desire to Know the Unknown |work=The Washington Post |page=A02 |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=7 June 2006}} Sociologist Theodore Sasson has remarked, &quot;Conspiracy theories explain disturbing events or social phenomena in terms of the actions of specific, powerful individuals&quot;. By providing simple explanations of distressing events—the conspiracy theory in the Arab world, for example, that the [[11 September attacks]] were planned by the Israeli Mossad—they deflect responsibility or keep people from acknowledging that tragic events sometimes happen inexplicably.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Roger Cohen]] writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' has said that, &quot;captive minds; ... resort to conspiracy theory because it is the ultimate refuge of the powerless. If you cannot change your own life, it must be that some greater force controls the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;/&gt;

Sociological historian Holger Herwig found in studying German explanations for the origins of [[World War I]], &quot;Those events that are most important are hardest to understand because they attract the greatest attention from myth makers and charlatans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Keith|title=Forging the Collective Memory: Government and International Historians through Two World Wars|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-78238-828-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojipBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89|date=1 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence of critical theory===
French sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] suggests that the widespread popularity of conspiracy theories in mass culture may be due, in part, to the pervasive presence of [[Marxist]]-inspired [[critical theory]] and similar ideas in academia since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;critiquesteam&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Latour | first = Bruno | author-link = Bruno Latour | title = Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern. | journal = Critical Inquiry | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–48 | date = Winter 2004 | url = http://www.bruno-latour.fr:80/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120916045752/http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf | archive-date = 16 September 2012 | accessdate = 16 September 2012 | doi = 10.1086/421123 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour notes that about 90% of contemporary social criticism in academia displays one of two approaches, which he terms &quot;the ''fact position'' and the ''fairy position''&quot;.{{r|critiquesteam|page1=237}} The fairy position is anti-fetishist, arguing that &quot;objects of belief&quot; (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts onto which power is projected; Latour contends that those who use this approach show biases towards confirming their own dogmatic suspicions as most &quot;scientifically supported&quot;. While the complete facts of the situation and correct methodology are ostensibly important to them, Latour proposes that the scientific process is instead laid on as a patina to one's pet theories to lend a sort of reputation high ground. The &quot;fact position&quot; argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender).{{r|critiquesteam|page2=238}} Latour concludes that each of these two approaches in Academia has led to a polarized, inefficient atmosphere highlighted (in both approaches) by its causticness. &quot;Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?&quot; asks Latour: no matter which position you take, &quot;You're always right!&quot;{{r|critiquesteam|page3=238–39}}

Latour notes that such social criticism has been appropriated by those he describes as conspiracy theorists, including [[climate change denial]]ists and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: &quot;Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique.&quot;{{r|critiquesteam|page4=230}}

===Fusion paranoia===
[[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist and critic of [[anti-war]] movements on both the left and right, coined the term &quot;fusion paranoia&quot; to refer to a political convergence of left-wing and right-wing activists around anti-war issues and [[civil liberties]], which he said were motivated by a shared belief in conspiracism or shared [[Anti-statism|anti-government]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/19/the-road-to-paranoia|title=THE ROAD TO PARANOIA|last=Kelly|first=Michael|date=12 June 1995|work=The New Yorker|access-date=9 April 2018|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkun has adopted this term to refer to how the synthesis of paranoid conspiracy theories, which were once limited to American fringe audiences, has given them mass appeal and enabled them to become commonplace in [[mass media]],{{sfn|Barkun|2003|p=230}} thereby inaugurating an unrivaled period of people actively preparing for [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] or [[millenarianism|millenarian]] scenarios in the United States of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=207, 210, 211}} Barkun notes the occurrence of lone-wolf conflicts with law enforcement acting as proxy for threatening the established political powers.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=193, 197}}

==Viability of conspiracies==
The physicist [[David Robert Grimes]] estimated the time it would take for a conspiracy to be exposed based on the number of people involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs_plos_one&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barajas|first1=Joshua|title=How many people does it take to keep a conspiracy alive?|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/math-formula-charts-the-lifespan-of-hoaxes/|website=PBS NEWSHOUR|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grimes_PLOS_ONE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=David R|authorlink1=David Robert Grimes|title=On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs|journal=PLOS ONE|date=26 January 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905|pmid=26812482|volume=11|issue=1|pmc=4728076|pages=e0147905|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1147905G}}&lt;/ref&gt; His calculations used data from the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM surveillance program]], the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], and the [[FBI Laboratory#Controversy|FBI forensic scandal]]. Grimes estimated that:

* a [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|Moon landing hoax]] would require the involvement of 411,000 people and would be exposed within 3.68 years;
* [[Global warming conspiracy theory|climate-change fraud]] would require 405,000 people and would be exposed within 3.70 years;
* a [[Vaccine controversies|vaccination conspiracy]] would require a minimum of 22,000 people (without drug companies) and would be exposed within at least 3.15 years and at most 34.78 years depending on the number involved;
* a conspiracy to [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory|suppress a cure for cancer]] would require 714,000 people and would be exposed within 3.17 years.

==Political use==
In his book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] used the term &quot;the conspiracy theory of society&quot; to denote a conception of social phenomena that he found to be defective—namely, that social phenomena such as &quot;war, unemployment, poverty, shortages ... [are] the result of direct design by some powerful individuals and groups.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|authorlink=Karl Popper|title=Open Society and Its Enemies, Book II|year=1945|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|chapter=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper argued that [[totalitarianism]] was founded on &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; which drew on imaginary plots driven by paranoid scenarios predicated on tribalism, chauvinism, or racism.  Popper acknowledged that genuine conspiracies do exist,&lt;ref name=&quot;dohloo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/books/popper_open_society.html |title=Extracts from &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies Volume 2: The High Tide of Prophecy: Hegel, Marx and the Aftermath&quot; by Karl Raimund Popper (Originally published 1945) |publisher=Lachlan Cranswick, quoting Karl Raimund Popper}}&lt;/ref&gt; but noted how infrequently conspirators have been able to achieve their goal.&lt;ref name = &quot;dohloo&quot;/&gt;

The historian [[Bruce Cumings]] similarly rejects the notion that history is controlled by conspiracies, stating that where real conspiracies have appeared they have usually had little effect on history and have had unforeseen consequences for the conspirators.  Cumings concludes that history is instead &quot;moved by the broad forces and large structures of human collectivities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cumings|first = Bruce|title = The Origins of the Korean War, Vol. II, The Roaring of the Cataract, 1947–1950|publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]|location = Princeton, NJ|year = 1999|nopp=yes
}}{{page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 article, the legal scholars [[Cass Sunstein]] and [[Adrian Vermeule]] considered a number of possible government responses to conspiracy theories, including censorship and taxation. They concluded that the authorities ought to engage in counter-speech and dialogue, which they termed &quot;cognitive infiltration&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9760.2008.00325.x| title = Conspiracy Theories: Causes and Cures| year = 2009| last1 = Sunstein | first1 = C.

[[Alex Jones]] referenced numerous conspiracy theories for convincing his supporters to endorse [[Ron Paul]] over [[Mitt Romney]] and [[Donald Trump]] over [[Hillary Clinton]].[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/12/ron-paul-conspiracy-theories-and-the-right/250638/][https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?destination=%2flifestyle%2fstyle%2fhow-alex-jones-conspiracy-theorist-extraordinaire-got-donald-trumps-ear%2f2016%2f11%2f17%2f583dc190-ab3e-11e6-8b45-f8e493f06fcd_story.html%3f]
