'''Transportation in Cuba''' is the system of railways, roads, airports, waterways, ports and harbours in [[Cuba]]:

==Railways==
{{Main|Ferrocarriles de Cuba}}
[[File:Ferrocarriles de cuba map.gif|250px|right|thumb|Railway network in Cuba]]
* ''total:'' 8,285&amp;nbsp;km
* ''[[standard gauge]]:'' 8,125&amp;nbsp;km {{RailGauge|sg}} gauge (105&amp;nbsp;km electrified)
* ''[[Narrow gauge railway#Gauges between 2 ft and 2 ft 6 in|narrow gauge]]:'' 160&amp;nbsp;km of {{TrackGauge|2ft3.5in}} gauge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zelmeroz.com/album_rail/ctn/ctn_08.pdf] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba built the first railway system in the Spanish empire, before [[History of rail transport in Spain|the 1848 start in the Iberian peninsula]]. While the [[Ferrocarriles de Cuba#Colonial Cuba|rail infrastructure dates]] from colonial and early republican times, passenger service along the principal Havana to Santiago corridor is increasingly reliable and popular with tourists who can purchase tickets in [[Cuban convertible peso]]s. As with most public transport in Cuba, many of the vehicles used are second hand.

With the order of 12 new Chinese locomotives in 2006, built specially for Cuban Railways at [[China Northern Locomotives and Rolling Stock Works]], services have been improving in reliability{{citation needed|date = February 2020}}. Those benefiting the most are long distance freight services with the French train Havana-Santiago being the only passenger train using one of the new Chinese locomotives regularly.  Various orders are in place for 100 locomotives from China and various freight wagons and passenger coaches.{{citation needed|date = February 2020}}

In 2019, the Cuban railways received the first delivery of new Chinese-built coaches, and new services with these began in July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-trains/cuba-takes-first-step-in-railways-upgrade-with-chinese-russian-help-idUSKCN1U900D|title=Cuba takes first step in railways upgrade with Chinese, Russian help|journal=Reuters|date=July 13, 2019|access-date=January 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://oncubanews.com/en/cuba/new-trains-will-start-operating-in-cuba-with-lower-prices-than-for-buses/

&lt;/ref&gt;

Metro systems are not present in the island, although a [[Havana Suburban Railway|suburban rail network]] exists in [[Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [[:es:Red del ferrocarril suburbano de La Habana]] and [[:File:Esquema ferrocarril habana.png]]&lt;/ref&gt; Urban tramways were in operation between 1858 and 1954, initially as horse drawn systems. In the early 20th century electric trolley or storage battery powered tramways were introduced in seven cities. Of these overhead wire systems were adopted in Havana, [[Guanabacoa]], [[Matanzas]], [[Cienfuegos]], [[Camagüey]] and [[Santiago de Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tramz.com/cu/tto.html &quot;The tramways of Cuba&quot; by Allen Morrison]: Infos, maps, pictures.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roads==
{{see also|Roads in Cuba}}
[[File:Via Blanca-Matanzas.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Via Blanca highway near [[Matanzas, Cuba|Matanzas]]]]
The total length of Cuba's highways is 60,858&amp;nbsp;km, including
*''paved:'' 29,820&amp;nbsp;km (including 915&amp;nbsp;km of expressways)&lt;ref name=a&gt;Source: ''Mapa de Carreteras de Cuba'' (Road map of Cuba, including the roads officially classified as ''Autopistas''). Ediciones GEO, [[Havana]] 2011 - {{ISBN|959-7049-21-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''unpaved:'' 31,038&amp;nbsp;km (1999 est.)

Expressways ([[Controlled-access highway|autopistas]]) include:
*the Autopista Nacional (A1) from Havana to [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] and [[Sancti Spiritus, Cuba|Sancti Spiritus]], with additional short sections near [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and [[Guantanamo]]
*the Autopista Este-Oeste (A4) from Havana to [[Pinar del Río]]
*the Autopista del Mediodia from Havana to [[San Antonio de los Baños]]
*an autopista from Havana to [[Melena del Sur]]
*an autopista from Havana to [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]]
*the Havana ring road ({{lang-es|1er anillo de La Habana|links=no}}), which starts at a [[:es:Túnel de La Habana|tunnel]] under the entrance to [[Havana Harbor]]
*the section of the [[Via Blanca (Cuba)|Via Blanca]] from [[Matanzas]] to [[Varadero]] (toll road)
*an autopista from [[Nueva Gerona]] to [[Santa Fe, Isle of Youth|Santa Fe]], in the [[Isla de la Juventud]]

Older roads include the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]], and the Via Blanca from Havana to Matanzas.

==Long-distance and inter-municipality buses in Cuba==
[[File:Cuba Ford Camion 2014.jpg|thumb|Private owned truck-bus (&quot;Camion&quot;) Ford in 2014]]
There are several national bus companies in Cuba. Viazul operate a fleet of modern and comfortable coaches on longer distance routes designed principally for tourists. Schedules, prices and ticket booking can be done on line, at any of the major international airports or National Terminals across Cuba. There are also other bus lines operated by tourism companies.

AstroBus, a bus service in Cuban National Pesos, designed to bring comfortable air conditioned coaches to Cuban locals at an affordable price.  The AstroBus lines operate with modern Chinese YUTONG buses, and are accessible to Cuban Residents of Cuba with their ID Card, and is payable in Cuba Pesos.  Routes that have benefited most so far are those from Havana to each of the 13 provincial capitals of the country.

==Urban buses==

[[File:Ferro bus.jpg|thumb|Ferro Bus in Levisa near [[Mayarí]] in [[Holguín Province]]]]
[[File:Autobus de TUSSAM en La Habana.jpg|thumb|A decommissioned bus from [[Seville]], now operating in Havana]]
In Havana, urban transportation used to be provided by a colourful selection of buses imported from the Soviet Union or Canada. Many of these vehicles were second hand, such as the 1500 decommissioned Dutch buses that the Netherlands donated to Cuba in the mid-1990s as well as [[GM fishbowl bus]]es from Montreal. Despite the United States trade embargo, American-style [[yellow school bus]]es (imported second-hand from Canada) are also increasingly common sights. Since 2008, service on seven key lines in and out of the city is provided by Chinese [[Zhengzhou Yutong Bus]]es.  These replaced the famous ''camellos'' (&quot;camels&quot; or &quot;dromedaries&quot;, after their &quot;humps&quot;) [[trailer bus]]es that hauled as many as two hundred passengers in a passenger carrying trailer.

After the upgrading of [[Seville#Bus|Seville's]] public bus fleet to [[Compressed natural gas|CNG-powered]] vehicles, many of the [[IVECO|decommissioned ones]] were donated to the city of Havana. These bright orange buses still display the name of ''Transportes Urbanos de Sevilla, S.A.M.'', their former owner, and Seville's coat of arms as a sign of gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;The last lot was delivered in 2006: [http://www.sevilla.org/impe/sevilla/contenido?pag=/contenidos/centro_prensa/noticias_2006/Julio/28_07_2006_m&amp;vE=D4268,9,15 &quot;Entrega de 16 autobuses de TUSSAM a la Habana como gesto solidario&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234250/http://www.sevilla.org/impe/sevilla/contenido?pag=%2Fcontenidos%2Fcentro_prensa%2Fnoticias_2006%2FJulio%2F28_07_2006_m&amp;vE=D4268%2C9%2C15 |date=2007-09-26 }}, nota de prensa del Ayuntamiento de Sevilla&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seville#Transportation|Seville]]
{{clear|left}}

In recent years (2016), urban transport in Havana consists entirely of modern Yutong diesel buses. Seville and Ikarus buses are gone.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

== Automobiles ==
[[File:Cuban car.JPG|thumbnail|A Cuban [[Pontiac]] car in 2011.]]
Since 2009, Cuba has imported sedans from Chinese automaker [[Geely]] to serve as police cars, taxis and rental vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://caristas.blogspot.com/2011/01/geely-prounced-jee-lee-or-in-cuba-heely.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the Soviet Union supplied [[GAZ Volga|Volgas]], [[Moskvich]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[LADA|Ladas]], as well as heavy trucks like the [[ZiL|ZIL]] and the [[KrAZ]];&lt;ref&gt;http://caristas.blogspot.com/2010/12/kraz-king-kong-of-trucks.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Cuba also bought cars from European and Asian companies. In 2004, it was estimated that there were some 173,000 cars in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;16. Marcus Enoch, et al. &quot;The Effect of Economic Restrictions on Transport Practices in Cuba&quot;. ''Transport Policy'' 11 (2004): 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old American cars in Cuba===
Most new vehicles came to Cuba from the United States until the 1960 [[United States embargo against Cuba]] ended importation of both cars and their parts. As many as 60,000 American vehicles are in use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweid|first1=Richard|title=Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile : on the road in Cuba|date=2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-0807828922|page=9|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|ref=schweid}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly all in private hands. Of Cuba's vintage American cars, many have been modified with newer engines, disc brakes and other parts, often scavenged from Soviet cars, and most bear the marks of decades of use.&lt;ref&gt;Schweid, Richard. ''Che's Chevrolet, Fidel's Oldsmobile (On the Road in Cuba)''. Chapel Hill, London. University of North Carolina Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-8078-2892-0}}  p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-1960 vehicles remain the property of their original owners and descendants, and can be sold to other Cubans providing the proper ''traspaso'' certificate is in place.

However, the old American cars on the road today have &quot;relatively high inefficiencies&quot; due in large part to the lack of modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;12. James P. Warren, Marcus P. Enoch, &quot;Mobility, energy, and emissions in Cuba and Florida&quot;. ''Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment'' 11 (2006): 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in increased fuel consumption as well as adding to the economic plight of its owners. With these inefficiencies, noticeable drop in travel occurred from an &quot;average of nearly 3000 km/year in the mid-1980s to less than 800 km/year in 2000–2001&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;13. Warren and Enoch, &quot;Mobility, energy, and emissions in Cuba and Florida&quot;, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Cuban people try to save as much money as possible, when traveling is done, the cars are usually loaded past the maximum allowable weight and travel on the decaying roads, resulting in even more abuse to the already under maintained vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;14. Warren and Enoch, &quot;Mobility, energy, and emissions in Cuba and Florida&quot;, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hitchhiking and carpooling ===
[[File:Cuba, official hitchhiking and carpooling point.jpg|thumb|Official hitchhiking and carpooling point, Santiago de Cuba. The man in the yellow uniform stops a state-owned car to take passengers for a small fee]]
As a result of the &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot; in 1991 (a period of food and energy shortages caused by the loss of the Soviet Union as a trading partner), hitchhiking and carpooling became important parts of Cuba's transportation system and society in general.  In 1999, an article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine claimed &quot;In Cuba[...] hitchhiking is custom. Hitchhiking is essential. Hitchhiking is what makes Cuba move.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,36287,00.html#ixzz1Ch67vm4p&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes in the 2000s ===
For many years, Cubans could only acquire new cars with special permission.

In 2011, the Cuban government legalized the purchase and sale of used post-1959 autos. In December 2013, Cubans were allowed to buy new cars from state-run dealerships - previously this had not been permitted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-15115004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25450026&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, this was further extended with cars being sold in convertible currencies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-cars/cash-starved-cuban-state-sells-used-cars-for-dollars-for-first-time-idUSKBN20J2E6&lt;/ref&gt;
