The '''economy of Cyprus''' is a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]] as classified by the [[World Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups#High_income|title=Country and Lending Groups|publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was included by the [[International Monetary Fund]] in its list of [[developed country|advanced economies]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2001/01/data/index.htm#changes|title=World Economic Outlook Database May 2001|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflected the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals, caused by political instability on the island and fluctuations in economic conditions in Western Europe.

[[Cyprus]] adopted the [[euro]] as its official currency on 1 January 2008, replacing the [[Cypriot pound]] at an irrevocable fixed [[exchange rate]] of CYP 0.585274 per EUR 1.00.

The [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis]], part of the wider [[European debt crisis]], has dominated the country's economic affairs in recent times. In March 2013, the Cypriot government reached an agreement with its [[eurozone]] partners to split the country's second biggest bank, the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]] (also known as Laiki Bank), into a &quot;bad&quot; bank which would be wound down over time and a &quot;good&quot; bank which would be absorbed by the larger [[Bank of Cyprus]]. In return for a €10 billion [[bailout]] from the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the International Monetary Fund, the Cypriot government would be required to impose a significant [[haircut (finance)|haircut]] on [[deposit insurance|uninsured deposits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Banks in Cyprus Falter, Other Tax Havens Step In|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/business/global/as-banks-in-cyprus-falter-other-tax-havens-step-in.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 March 2013|first=Andrew|last=Higgins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insured deposits of €100,000 or less would not be affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurogroup Statement on Cyprus|url=http://eurozone.europa.eu/newsroom/news/2013/03/eg-statement-cyprus-25-03-13/|publisher=[[Eurogroup]]|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=25 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171011040449/http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/splash/?requested=%2fcouncil-eu%2feurogroup%2f|archivedate=11 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReutersNewdeal&gt;{{cite news |author=Jan Strupczewski |author2=Annika Breidthardt |title=Last-minute Cyprus deal to close bank, force losses |work=Reuters |date=25 March 2013 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/25/us-cyprus-parliament-idUSBRE92G03I20130325 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ekathimerini&gt;{{cite news |title=Eurogroup signs off on bailout agreement reached by Cyprus and troika |newspaper=Ekathimerini |location=Greece |date=25 March 2013 |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_25/03/2013_489702 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a three-and-a-half-year [[recession]], Cyprus returned to growth in the first quarter of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyprus growth welcome but fragile – finmin|url=http://in-cyprus.com/cyprus-growth-welcome-but-fragile-finmin/|accessdate=13 May 2015|work=[[Cyprus Weekly]]|date=13 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518080146/http://in-cyprus.com/cyprus-growth-welcome-but-fragile-finmin/|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyprus successfully concluded its three-year financial assistance programme at the end of March 2016, having borrowed a total of €6.3 billion from the [[European Stability Mechanism]] and €1 billion from the IMF.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyprus successfully exits ESM programme|url=http://esm.europa.eu/press/releases/cyprus-successfully-exits-esm-programme.htm|publisher=[[European Stability Mechanism]]|accessdate=31 March 2016|location=Luxembourg|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorandum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Επισήμως εκτός μνημονίου η Κύπρος|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/855021/article/oikonomia/ellhnikh-oikonomia/epishmws-ektos-mnhmonioy-h-kypros|accessdate=31 March 2016|work=[[Kathimerini]]|date=31 March 2016|location=Athens|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining €2.7 billion of the ESM bailout was never dispensed, due to the Cypriot government's better than expected finances over the course of the programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Memorandum&quot; /&gt;

Cyprus has an [[open economy|open]], [[market economy|free-market]], [[service economy|service-based]] economy with some light [[manufacturing]]. Internationally, Cyprus promotes its geographical location as a &quot;bridge&quot; between [[Eastern world|East]] and West, along with its educated English-speaking population, moderate local costs, good airline connections, and telecommunications.

Since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1960, Cyprus has had a record of successful economic performance, reflected in strong growth, full employment conditions and relative stability. The underdeveloped agrarian economy inherited from colonial rule has been transformed into a modern economy, with dynamic services, industrial and agricultural sectors and an advanced physical and social infrastructure. The Cypriots are among the most prosperous people in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region, with nominal GDP per capita exceeding $28,000 in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMF GDP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=57&amp;pr.y=6&amp;sy=2017&amp;ey=2024&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=423&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH%2CNGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CNGDPRPPPPC%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|work=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2019|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|accessdate=15 October 2019|location=Washington, D.C.|date=11 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[standard of living]] is reflected in the country's &quot;very high&quot; [[Human Development Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Index (HDI) - 2011 Rankings|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cyprus is ranked 23rd in the world in terms of the [[Where-to-be-born Index|Quality-of-life Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Economist Intelligence Unit's quality-of-life index|url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf|publisher=[[Economist Intelligence Unit]]|accessdate=2 August 2011|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, after more than three decades of unbroken growth, the Cypriot economy contracted in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=78&amp;pr.y=10&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2019&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=423&amp;s=NGDP_RPCH&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|work=World Economic Outlook Database, April 2014|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=16 April 2014|location=Washington, D.C.|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected the exposure of Cyprus to the [[Great Recession]] and [[European debt crisis]]. In recent times, concerns have been raised about the state of public finances and spiralling borrowing costs. Furthermore, Cyprus was dealt a severe blow by the [[Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion]] in July 2011, with the cost to the economy estimated at €1–3&amp;nbsp;billion, or up to 17% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kambas|first=Michele|title=Cyprus too slow in making cuts|url=http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/cyprus-too-slow-making-cuts/20110730|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]]|date=30 July 2011|location=Nicosia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901030437/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/cyprus-too-slow-making-cuts/20110730|archivedate=1 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic achievements of Cyprus during the preceding decades have been significant, bearing in mind the severe economic and social dislocation created by the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] of 1974 and the continuing occupation of the northern part of the island by [[Turkey]]. The Turkish invasion inflicted a serious blow to the Cyprus economy and in particular to agriculture, [[Tourism in Cyprus|tourism]], [[Mining industry of Cyprus|mining]] and quarrying: 70 percent of the island's wealth-producing resources were lost, the tourist industry lost 65 percent of its hotels and tourist accommodation, the industrial sector lost 46 percent, and mining and quarrying lost 56 percent of production. The loss of the port of [[Famagusta]], which handled 83 percent of the general cargo, and the closure of [[Nicosia International Airport]], in the [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|buffer zone]], were additional setbacks.

The success of Cyprus in the economic sphere has been attributed, ''inter alia'', to the adoption of a market-oriented economic system, the pursuance of sound macroeconomic policies by the government as well as the existence of a dynamic and flexible entrepreneurship and a highly educated labor force. Moreover, the economy benefited from the close cooperation between the public and private sectors.

In the past 30 years, the economy has shifted from agriculture to light manufacturing and services. The services sector, including tourism, contributes almost 80% to GDP and employs more than 70% of the labor force. Industry and construction account for approximately one-fifth of GDP and labor, while agriculture is responsible for 2.1% of GDP and 8.5% of the labor force. Potatoes and citrus are the principal export crops. After robust growth rates in the 1980s (average annual growth was 6.1%), economic performance in the 1990s was mixed: real GDP growth was 9.7% in 1992, 1.7% in 1993, 6.0% in 1994, 6.0% in 1995, 1.9% in 1996 and 2.3% in 1997. This pattern underlined the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (i.e., to economic and political conditions in Cyprus, Western Europe, and the Middle East) and the need to diversify the economy. Declining competitiveness in tourism and especially in manufacturing are expected to act as a drag on growth until structural changes are effected. Overvaluation of the Cypriot pound prior to the adoption of the euro in 2008 had kept inflation in check.

Trade is vital to the Cypriot economy — the island is not self-sufficient in food and until the recent [[Aphrodite gas field|offshore gas discoveries]] had few known natural resources — and the trade deficit continues to grow. Cyprus must import fuels, most raw materials, heavy machinery, and transportation equipment. More than 50% of its trade is with the rest of the European Union, especially [[Greece]] and the United Kingdom, while the Middle East receives 20% of exports. In 1991, Cyprus introduced a [[value-added tax]] (VAT), which is at 19% as of 2014-01-13. Cyprus ratified the new world trade agreement ([[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]], GATT) in 1995 and began implementing it fully on 1 January 1996. EU accession negotiations started on 31 March 1998, and concluded when Cyprus joined the organization as a full member in 2004.

===Investment climate===
The Cyprus [[legal system]] is founded on [[English law]], and is therefore familiar to most [[international financiers]]. Cyprus's [[legislation]] was aligned with EU norms in the period leading up to [[EU accession]] in 2004. Restrictions on foreign direct investment were removed, permitting 100% foreign ownership in many cases. Foreign portfolio investment in the [[Cyprus Stock Exchange]] was also liberalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e2899694-4eb4-11dc-85e7-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz2A6usbMmz Cyprus will continue to fight against money laundering] FT.com 20 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a modern, business-friendly tax system was put in place with a 12.5% corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the EU. Cyprus has concluded treaties on [[double taxation]] with more than 40 countries, and, as a member of the [[Eurozone]], has no exchange restrictions. Non-residents and foreign investors may freely repatriate proceeds from investments in Cyprus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft.com&quot;/&gt;

==Role as a financial hub==

In the years following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] it gained great popularity as a portal for investment from the West into [[Russia]] and [[Eastern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21525458 | title=The midget and the mighty | work=Economist | date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, becoming for companies of that origin the most common tax haven. More recently, there have been increasing investment flows from the West through Cyprus into [[Asia]] (particularly [[China]] and [[India]]), [[South America]] and the [[Middle East]]. In addition, businesses from outside the EU use Cyprus as their entry-point for investment into Europe. The [[Business service provider|business services]] sector remains the fastest growing sector of the economy, and had overtaken all other sectors in importance. [[Cyprus Investment Promotion Agency|CIPA]] has been fundamental towards this trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/investments/investments-worth-billions-pipeline/20120913 Investments worth Billions in the Pipeline] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121062155/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/investments/investments-worth-billions-pipeline/20120913 |date=21 November 2012 }} Cyprus-Mail - 13 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, [[Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission|CySEC]] (the Financial Regulator), regulates many of the world's biggest brands in [[retail forex]] as they generally see it as an efficient way to get an [[EU]] operating license and industry know-how.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fxempire.com/forex-brokers/cysec-regulated-brokers FX Empire: CySEC Regulated Brokers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/EN/Standardartikel/Topics/Europe/Articles/2015-02-20-cyprus-reforms.html?__act=renderPdf&amp;__iDocId=337404 The Current State of the Reform Process in Cyprus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role as a shipping hub==

Cyprus constitutes one of the largest [[ship management]] centers in the world; around 50 ship management companies and marine-related foreign enterprises are conducting their international activities in the country while the majority of the largest ship management companies in the world have established fully fledged offices on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprusshipping.com/limassol-shipping-companies.html Limassol Based Shipping Companies] CyprusShipping.com&lt;/ref&gt; Its geographical position at the crossroads of three continents and its proximity to the [[Suez Canal]] has promoted [[Cyprus Merchant Marine|merchant shipping]] as an important industry for the island nation.

==Tourism==
{{main|Tourism in Cyprus}}
Tourism is an important factor of the island state's economy, culture, and overall brand development. With over 2 million tourist arrivals per year, it is the 40th most popular destination in the world. However, per capita of local population, it ranks 17th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_tou_arr_percap-economy-tourist-arrivals-per-capita |title=Economy Statistics - Tourist arrivals (per capita) (most recent) by country |accessdate=2018-01-17 |work=Nationmaster }}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry has been honored with various international awards, spanning from the Sustainable Destinations Global Top 100, VISION on Sustainable Tourism, Totem Tourism and Green Destination titles bestowed to [[Limassol]] and [[Paphos]] in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpmg.com/CY/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesAndPublications/Documents/2015-documents/Cyprus-Tourism-Market-Report.pdf KPMG: Cyprus Tourism Market Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucy.ac.cy/erc/documents/Full_Text_Clerides.pdf Tourism in Cyprus: Recent Trends and Lessons from the Tourist Satisfaction Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldtravelguide.net/cyprus World Travel Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The island beaches have been awarded with 57 [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flags]].

===Trade===
In 2008 fiscal aggregate value of goods and services exported by Cyprus was in the region of $1.53 billion. It primarily exported goods and services such as citrus fruits, cement, potatoes, clothing and pharmaceuticals. At that same period total financial value of goods and services imported by Cyprus was about $8.689 billion. Prominent goods and services imported by Cyprus in 2008 were consumer goods, machinery, petroleum and other lubricants, transport equipment and intermediate goods.

====Cypriot trade partners====
Traditionally Greece has been a major export and import partner of Cyprus. In fiscal 2007, it amounted for 21.1 percent of total exports of Cyprus. At that same period it was responsible for 17.7 percent of goods and services imported by Cyprus. Some other important names in this regard are UK and Italy.

==Eurozone crisis==
{{Main|2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis}}

In 2012, Cyprus became affected by the [[European sovereign-debt crisis|Eurozone financial and banking crisis]]. In June 2012, the Cypriot government announced it would need €{{Nowrap|1.8 billion}} of foreign aid to support the [[Cyprus Popular Bank]], and this was followed by [[Fitch Group|Fitch]] down-grading Cyprus's credit rating to [[junk status]].&lt;ref name=BBCJune&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18577983 |title=Cyprus's credit rating cut to junk status by Fitch |date=25 June 2012 |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitch said Cyprus would need an additional €{{Nowrap|4 billion}} to support its banks and the downgrade was mainly due to the exposure of [[Bank of Cyprus]], Cyprus Popular Bank and [[Hellenic Bank]] (Cyprus's 3 largest banks) to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=BBCJune/&gt;

In June 2012 the Cypriot finance minister, [[Vassos Shiarly]], stated that the [[European Central Bank]], [[European commission]] and [[IMF]] officials are to carry out an in-depth investigation into Cyprus' economy and banking sector to assess the level of funding it requires. The Ministry of Finance rejected the possibility that Cyprus would be forced to undergo the sweeping austerity measures that have caused turbulence in Greece, but admitted that there would be &quot;some negative repercussion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/cyprus-says-eu-imf-officials-to-start-assessing-next-week-how-much-bailout-money-needed/2012/06/27/gJQAArGD7V_story.html|title= Cyprus says EU, IMF officials to start assessing next week how much bailout money needed - from Associated Press |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 international lenders negotiating a bailout with the Cypriot government have agreed on a key capital ratio for banks and a system for the sector's supervision. Both commercial banks and cooperatives will be overseen by the [[Central Bank of Cyprus|Central Bank]] and the Ministry of Finance. They also set a core Tier 1 ratio - a measure of financial strength - of 9% by the end of 2013 for banks, which could then rise to 10% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/17/cyprus-troika-idUSL5E8MH46120121117 Cyprus, troika agree on bank supervision, capital ratio] Reuters 17/11/12&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Harris Georgiades]] pointed that exiting the Memorandum with the [[European troika]] required a return to the [[Market (economics)|markets]]. This he said, required “timely, effective and full implementation of the program.” The Finance Minister stressed the need to implement the [[Memorandum of understanding]] without an additional loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://financialmirror.com/news-details.php?nid=31276 Financial Mirror: Bank restrictions to be lifted by Spring 2014, says Cyprus Finance Minister]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cyprus was praised by the [[President of the European Commission]] for adopting the austerity measures and not hesitating to follow a tough reform program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-eus-juncker-praises-cyprus-recovery-after-bailout-2015-7 Business Insider: EU's Juncker praises Cyprus recovery after bailout]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/01/14/eurogroup-full-of-praise-for-cyprus-but-obligations-remain/ Cyprus Mail: Eurogroup full of praise for Cyprus but some obligations remain]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Moody's Investors Service]] changed its outlook on the Cypriot banking system to positive from stable, reflecting the view that the recovery will restore banks to profitability and improve asset quality. The quick economic recovery was driven by tourism, business services and increased consumer spending. Creditor confidence was also strengthened, allowing Bank of Cyprus to reduce its Emergency Liquidity Assistance to €2.0 billion (from €9.4 billion in 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldnews.com.cy/en/economy/moody%60s-changes-outlook-on-cypriot-banking-system-to-positive-from-stable Gold Magazine: Moody`s Changes Outlook on Cypriot Banking System to Positive from Stable]&lt;/ref&gt; Within the same period, Bank of Cyprus Chairman [[Josef Ackermann]] urged the [[European Union]] to pledge financial support for a permanent solution to the [[Cyprus dispute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/08/03/bocs-ackermann-urges-eu-pledge-financial-support-solution/ BoC’s Ackermann urges EU to pledge financial support for solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy of Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus ==
{{main|Economy of Northern Cyprus}}
The economy of Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus is about one-fifth the size of the economy of the government-controlled area, while GDP per capita is around half. Because the ''de facto'' administration is recognized only by [[Turkey]], it has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to invest there. The economy mainly revolves around the agricultural sector and government service, which together employ about half of the work force.

The tourism sector also contributes substantially into the economy. Moreover, the small economy has seen some downfalls because the [[Turkish lira]] is [[legal tender]]. To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey has been known to provide significant financial aid. In both parts of the island, water shortage is a growing problem, and several [[desalination]] plants are planned.

The economic disparity between the two communities is pronounced. Although the economy operates on a free-market basis, the lack of private and government investment, shortages of skilled labor and experienced managers, and inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish lira continue to plague the economy.

=== Trade with Turkey ===

Turkey is by far the main trading partner of Northern Cyprus, supplying 55% of imports and absorbing 48% of exports. In a landmark case, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994 against the British practice of importing produce from Northern Cyprus based on certificates of origin and [[phytosanitary certificate]]s granted by the ''de facto'' authorities. The ECJ decided that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4&amp;nbsp;million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7&amp;nbsp;million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of Northern Cyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.

The most important exports of Northern Cyprus are [[citrus]] and [[dairy products]]. These are followed by [[rakı]], [[scrap]] and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;TRNC Ministry of Economy and Energy, Department of Trade. ''Dış Ticaret İthalat ve İhracat İstatistikleri 2010'', p. VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistance from Turkey is the mainstay of the Turkish Cypriot economy. Under the latest economic protocol (signed 3 January 1997), Turkey has undertaken to provide loans totalling $250&amp;nbsp;million for the purpose of implementing projects included in the protocol related to public finance, tourism, banking, and privatization. Fluctuation in the Turkish lira, which suffered from [[hyperinflation]] every year until its replacement by the [[Turkish new lira]] in 2005, exerted downward pressure on the Turkish Cypriot standard of living for many years.

The ''de facto'' authorities have instituted a free market in foreign exchange and permit residents to hold foreign-currency denominated bank accounts. This encourages transfers from Turkish Cypriots living abroad.

Another finding was that the young people in the capital are unhappier than the rest of Cyprus; the old are not.
