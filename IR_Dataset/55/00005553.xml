'''[[Costa Rica]]''' is located on the [[Central American Isthmus]], surrounding the point 10° north of the [[equator]] and 84° west of the [[prime meridian]]. It has 212&amp;nbsp;km of [[Caribbean Sea]] coastline and 1,016 on the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]].

The area is 51,100&amp;nbsp;km² of which 40&amp;nbsp;km² is water. It is slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]].

== Geology ==
{{Main|Geology of Costa Rica}}
Costa Rica on the [[Caribbean Plate]]. It borders the [[Cocos Plate]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] which is being [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath it. This forms the [[List of volcanoes in Costa Rica|volcanoes in Costa Rica]], also known as the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica, Volcán Arenal, Map, Eruptions |url=https://geology.com/volcanoes/arenal/ |website=geology.com |accessdate=10 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caribbean Plate began its eastward migration during the [[Late Cretaceous]]. During the [[Late Paleocene]], a local sea-level low-stand assisted by the continental uplift of the western margin of South America, resulted in a land bridge over which several groups of mammals apparently took part in an interchange.

Many [[List of earthquakes in Costa Rica|earthquakes in Costa Rica]] have occurred.

==Political and human geography==

Costa Rica shares a 313&amp;nbsp;km border border with [[Nicaragua]] to the north, and a 348&amp;nbsp;km with [[Panama]] to the south.

Costa Rica claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|574,725|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} with {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}} and a [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}.

Land use: Arable land: 4.8%. Permanent crops: 6.66%. Other: 88.54%.

[[Administrative divisions of Costa Rica]] include 7 [[provinces of Costa Rica|provinces]], 82 [[cantons of Costa Rica|cantons]],and 478 [[List of districts of Costa Rica|districts]]. There are also 24 [[Indigenous territories of Costa Rica|indigenous territories]].

==Physical geography==

=== Islands ===
There are many [[List of islands of Costa Rica|islands of Costa Rica]], the most remote being [[Cocos Island]] and the largest being [[Isla Calero]].

===Mountain ranges===
The nation's coastal plain separated by the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], which form the spine of the country and separate the Pacific and Caribbean [[drainage divide]]s.

The [[Cordillera de Guanacaste]] is in the north near the border with [[Nicaragua]] and forms part of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]].

Much of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] is included in the [[La Amistad International Park]], which is shared between Costa Rica and Panama. It contains the country's highest peaks: the [[Cerro Chirripó]] and the [[Cerro Kamuk]]. Much of the region is covered by the [[Talamancan montane forests]]. It also includes the [[Cerros de Escazú]] which borders the [[Costa Rican Central Valley]] to the south.

=== Hydrology ===
[[File:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|right|thumbnail|Extent of Costa Rica's western [[EEZ]] in the Pacific]]
Irrigated land covers 1,031&amp;nbsp;km².

[[List of rivers of Costa Rica|Rivers of Costa Rica]] all drain into the Caribbean or the Pacific.

=== Extreme points ===
[[Cocos Island]] is the southwestern extreme of the country. Otherwise to the north it's Peñas Blancas, to the south and east the Panama border, and to the west the Santa Elena Peninsula.

The lowest point is sea level, and the highest is [[Cerro Chirripo]]: at 3810 m.

== Climate ==
The climate is tropical and subtropical. Dry season (December to April); rainy season (May to November); cooler in highlands.

Because Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the [[Equator]], the climate is [[Tropical climate|tropical]] year round. However, the country has many [[microclimate]]s depending on elevation, rainfall, topography, and by the geography of each particular region.

Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls during a particular period. The year can be split into two periods, the dry season known to the residents as summer ({{lang|es|verano}}), and the rainy season, known locally as winter ({{lang|es|invierno}}). The &quot;summer&quot; or dry season goes from December to April, and &quot;winter&quot; or rainy season goes from May to November, which almost coincides with the [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane season]], and during this time, it rains constantly in some regions.

The location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean slopes of the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] mountains, with an annual rainfall of over {{convert|5000|mm|1|abbr=on}}. Humidity is also higher on the Caribbean side than on the Pacific side. The mean annual temperature on the coastal lowlands is around {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the main populated areas of the Cordillera Central, and below {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the summits of the highest mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eggar |first=Marc |title=Climate/Weather |url=http://www.worldheadquarters.com/cr/climate/ |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Costa Rica]] is a [[biodiversity hotspot]].

The diversity of [[Wildlife of Costa Rica|wildlife in Costa Rica]] is very high; there are 441 species of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s, 838 species of [[bird]]s, 232 species of [[mammal]]s and 181 species of fresh water fish. Costa Rica has high levels of [[endemism]]; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are [[endangered]]. According to the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ Home]. Unep-Wcmc.

There 29 [[List of national parks of Costa Rica|national parks of Costa Rica]] many [[List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica|conservation areas of Costa Rica]].

[[Tortuguero National Park]] is home to monkeys, sloths, birds; and a variety of reptiles.

The [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] is home to about 2,000 plant species,&lt;ref name=&quot;karttv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govisitcostarica.com/region/city.asp?cID=402|title=Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve|publisher=Govisitcostarica.com|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including numerous orchids. Over 400 types of birds and more than 100 species of mammals can be found there.&lt;ref name=&quot;karttv&quot; /&gt;

Over 840 species of birds have been identified in Costa Rica. As is the case in much of Central America, the avian species in Costa Rica are a mix of North and South American species. The country's abundant fruit trees, many of which bear fruit year round, are hugely important to the birds, some of whom survive on diets that consist only of one or two types of fruit. Some of the country's most notable avian species include the [[resplendent quetzal]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[three-wattled bellbird]], [[bare-necked umbrellabird]], and the [[keel-billed toucan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/flora-fauna/bird|title=Birds of Costa Rica|last=Stater|first=Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad]] is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance. Costa Rica is a center of biological diversity for reptiles and [[amphibians]], including the world's fastest running lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (''[[Ctenosaura similis]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Garland1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garland|first=T., Jr.|year=1984|title=Physiological correlates of locomotory performance in a lizard: an allometric approach|url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Garl1984.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physiology|volume=247|issue=5 Pt 2|pages=R806–R815|doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1984.247.5.R806|pmid=6238543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural resources==

[[Hydropower]] from [[Lake Arenal]], the largest lake in Costa Rica. Total renewable water resources is 112.4&amp;nbsp;km³.

Freshwater withdrawal is 5.77&amp;nbsp;km³/year (15%/9%/77%), or per capita: 1,582 m³/year. Agriculture is the largest water user demanding around 53% of total supplies while the sector contributes 6.5% to the Costa Rica GDP. Both total and per capita water usage is very high in comparison to other Central American countries but when measured against available freshwater sources, Costa Rica uses only 5% of its available supply.

Increasing urbanization will put pressure on [[water resources management in Costa Rica]].
