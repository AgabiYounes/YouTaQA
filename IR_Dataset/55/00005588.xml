The '''economy of Cuba''' is a largely [[planned economy]] dominated by [[State-owned enterprise|state-run enterprises]]. The government of [[Cuba]] owns and operates most industries and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the ruling [[Communist Party of Cuba]] encouraged the formation of [[worker co-operative]]s and [[self-employment]]. However, greater private property and free market rights were granted by the [[2019 Cuban constitutional referendum|2019 Cuba Constitution]].&lt;ref name=freerereconomy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/cuban-constitution-of-2019/|title=Cuban Constitution of 2019|first=James A.|last=Baer|publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|date=April 11, 2019|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=somefreerereconomy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-constitution-explainer/explainer-what-is-old-and-new-in-cubas-proposed-constitution-idUSKCN1QA273|title=Explainer: What is old and new in Cuba's proposed constitution|author=Marc Frank|work=Reuters|date=February 21, 2019|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been acknowledged that foreign market investment in various Cuban economic sectors increased before 2019 as well.&lt;ref name=foreigninvestors /&gt;&lt;ref name=foreigninvest&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.granma.cu/cuba/2019-11-12/foreign-investment-in-cuba-obstacles-cleared-incentives-in-place|{{Dead{{Dead{{Dead{{Dead{{Dead{{Dead{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2000}}, public-sector employment was 76% and private-sector employment (mainly composed of self-employment) was 23% - compared to the 1981 ratio of 91% to 8%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/pdfs/social_policy.pdf Social Policy at the Crossroads] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060524031450/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/pdfs/social_policy.pdf |date= 2006-05-24 }} Oxfam America Report&lt;/ref&gt; Investment is restricted and requires approval by the government.

Housing and transportation costs are low. Cubans receive government-subsidized education, healthcare and food subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://upsidedownworld.org/main/content/view/42/43/|title= Talking with Cubans about the State of the Nation (3/5/04)|author= Upside Down World|website= Upsidedownworld.org|accessdate= 11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country achieved a more even distribution of income after the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1953-1959,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} which was followed by an economic [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo by the United States]] (1960- ). During the [[Cold War]] period, the Cuban economy was heavily dependent on subsidies from the Soviet Union, valued at $65 billion in total from 1960 to 1990 (over three times as [[Alliance for Progress|the entirety of U.S. economic aid to Latin America]]), an average of $2.17 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mesa-Logo, Carmelo.

World Bank national accounts data. Accessed October 11, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; While the massive Soviet subsidies did enable Cuba's enormous state budget, they did not lead to a more advanced or sustainable Cuban economy; although described by economists as &quot;a relatively highly developed Latin American export economy&quot; in 1959 and the early 1960s, Cuba's basic economic structure changed very little between then and 1990. Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports, and even these were produced by a preindustrial process. The Cuban economy remained inefficient and over-specialized in a few highly subsidized commodities provided by the Soviet bloc countries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economic Impact of U.S. Sanctions With Respect to Cuba''. United States International Trade Commission, Publication 3398. Washington D.C., February 2001.

''[[Latin American Perspectives]]'' Vol. 36 No. 2, March 2009, pp. 31-48.]&lt;/ref&gt; and a crash in [[sugar]] prices in the early 1990s. It rebounded in the early 2000s due to a combination of marginal liberalization of the economy and heavy subsidies from the friendly government of [[Venezuela]], which provided Cuba with low-cost oil and other subsidies worth up to 12% of Cuban GDP annually.&lt;ref&gt;Mesa-Lago, Carmelo.

==History==
=== Before the Revolution ===
Although Cuba belonged to the high-income countries of [[Latin America]] since the 1870s, [[income inequality]] was high, accompanied by capital outflows to foreign investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=137|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's economy had grown rapidly in the early part of the century, fueled by the sale of sugar to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[Mehrotra, Santosh. (1997) Human Development in Cuba: Growing Risk of Reversal in Development with a Human Face: Experience in Social Achievement and Economic Growth Ed. Santosh Mehrotra and Richard Jolly, Clarendon Press, Oxford]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Cuban Revolution]], Cuba ranked fifth in the hemisphere in per capita income, third in life expectancy, second in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, first in the number of television sets per inhabitant.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_precastro.html|title=American Experience – Fidel Castro  |publisher=PBS|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its income per capita in 1929 was reportedly 41% of the U.S., thus higher than in [[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://econweb.umd.edu/~davis/eventpapers/CUBA.pdf Marianne Ward (Loyola College) and John Devereux (Queens College CUNY), ''The Road not taken: Pre-Revolutionary Cuban Living Standards in Comparative Perspective''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217122436/http://econweb.umd.edu/~davis/eventpapers/CUBA.pdf |date=2012-12-17 }} pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism magazine ''Cabaret Quarterly'' described [[Havana]] as &quot;a mistress of pleasure, the lush and opulent goddess of delights.&quot; According to Perez, &quot;Havana was then what [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] has become.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;smithsonianmag.com&quot; /&gt; Cuban dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] had plans to line the [[Malecón, Havana|Malecon]], Havana's famous walkway by the water, with hotels and casinos to attract even more tourists.

Cuba had a one-crop economy ([[sugar cane]]) whose domestic market was constricted. Its population was characterized by chronic unemployment and deep poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/cuban-revolution-fidel-castro-casinos-batista/|title=Cuba Before the Revolution|website=Jacobinmag.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States monopolies like [[Bethlehem Steel Corporation]] and [[Speyer]] gained control over valuable national resources. The banks and the country's entire financial system, all electric power production and the majority of the industry was dominated by U.S. companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25660|title=John F.

The gains from these investments were reaped by American businessmen leading to discontent among the Cuban people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Leland L.|date=1965-01-01|title=U.S. Business Interests in Cuba and the Rise of Castro|journal=World Politics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=440–459|doi=10.2307/2009288|jstor=2009288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, most Cuban children were not in school. 87 percent of urban homes had electricity, but only 10 percent of rural homes did. Only 15 percent of rural homes had running water. Nearly half the rural population was illiterate as was about 25 percent of the total population.

===Cuban Revolution===
On March 3, 1959, Fidel Castro seized control of the Cuban Telephone Company, which was a subsidiary of the [[ITT Corporation|International Telephone and Telecommunications Corporation.]] This was the first of many nationalizations made by the new government, the assets seized totaled US$9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1223316,00.html|title=Cuba After Castro: Can Exiles Reclaim Their Stake?|date=5 August 2006|work=TIME.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1959 Revolution, citizens were not required to pay a personal [[income tax]] (their salaries being regarded as net of any taxes).&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EEDA1039F935A15752C1A963958260 |author=New York Times |date=November 1995 |title= Well-to-Do in Cuba to Pay an Income Tax |accessdate=29 January 2007 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also began to subsidize [[Healthcare in Cuba|healthcare]] and education for all citizens; this action created strong national support for the new revolutionary government.

After the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and Cuba reestablished their diplomatic relations in May 1960, the USSR began to buy Cuban sugar in exchange for oil. When oil refineries like, Shell, Texaco, and Esso refused to refine Soviet oil, Castro nationalized that industry as well, taking over the refineries on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuba and the U.S. Empire&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt1b3h9jn.8|title=Cuba and the U.S. Empire|date=2016-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781583676066|editor-last=FRANKLIN|editor-first=JANE|series=A Chronological History|pages=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later in response, the United States cut the Cuban Sugar Quota completely, Eisenhower was quoted saying &quot;This action amounts to economic sanctions against, Cuba. Now we must look ahead to other moves - economic, diplomatic, and strategic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cuba and the U.S. Empire&quot;/&gt;

On February 7, 1962, Kennedy expanded the United States' embargo to cover almost all U.S. imports.

In 1970, Fidel Castro attempted to motivate the Cuban people to harvest 10 million tons of sugar, in Spanish known as [[Zafra (agriculture)|La Zafra]], in order to increase their exports and grow their economy.  With the help of the majority of the Cuban population, the country was able to produce 7.56 million tons of sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amgQBMT0UjkC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=7.56+million+tons+of+sugar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nsFvHr7hjq&amp;sig=gFGjH-W70I5Yq5-TPCRmYprWt4I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdwa6N2_vSAhVJ7YMKHUcACjEQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=7.56%20million%20tons%20of%20sugar&amp;f=false|title=The International Sugar Trade|last=Hannah|first=A.

But it was proven, first, that they did not know how to do it and, second, that they exploited the rest of the economy by receiving large amounts of resources . . . while there are factories that could have improved with a better distribution of those resources that were allocated to the Ten-Million-Ton plan”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-castro-failed/|title=How Castro Failed - Commentary Magazine|work=Commentary Magazine|access-date=2017-03-29|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Revolutionary period, Cuba was one of the few developing countries to provide [[foreign aid]] to other countries. Foreign aid began with the construction of six hospitals in Peru in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1989/04/eckstein.html|title=CUBA TODAY|website=Multinationalmonitor.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded later in the 1970s to the point where some 8000 Cubans worked in overseas assignments. Cubans built housing, roads, airports, schools and other facilities in [[Angola]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Laos]], [[Guinea]], [[Tanzania]] and other countries. By the end of 1985, 35,000 Cuban workers had helped build projects in some 20 Asian, African and Latin American countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor2&quot;/&gt;

For [[Nicaragua]] in 1982, Cuba pledged to provide over $130 million worth of agricultural and machinery equipment, as well as some 4000 technicians, doctors and teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor2&quot;/&gt;

In 1986, Cuba defaulted on its $10.9 billion debt to the [[Paris Club]]. In 1987, Cuba stopped making payments on that debt. In 2002, Cuba defaulted on $750 million in Japanese loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.investors.com/123008-455491-communist-cuba-50-years-of-failure.htm?p=2|title=Investor's Business Daily|website=Investor's Business Daily|language=English|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Period===
{{Main|Special Period}}
The Cuban [[gross domestic product]] declined at least 35% between 1989 and 1993 due to the loss of 80% of its trading partners{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[subsidy|subsidies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/cuba/economy.htm|title=Cuba's Economy|author=John Pike|website=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss of subsidies coincided with a collapse in world sugar prices. Sugar had done well from 1985–90 and crashed precipitously in 1990–91 and did not recover for five years. Cuba had been insulated from world sugar prices by Soviet price guarantees. However, the Cuban economy began to boost again following a rapid improvement in trade and diplomatic relations between Cuba and Venezuela following the election of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela in 1998, who became Cuba's most important trading partner and diplomatic ally.

This era was referred to as the &quot;Special Period in Peacetime&quot; later shortened to &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot;. A ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' paper claimed that &quot;The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a [[famine in North Korea]] in the mid-1990s, on the grounds that both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled to when the public food distribution collapsed and priority was given to the elite classes and the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cmaj&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2474886|title=Health Consequences of Cuba's Special Period|work=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports painted an equally dismal picture, describing Cubans having to resort to eating anything they could find, from Havana Zoo animals to domestic cats.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrotdiplomacy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|work=The Economist|date=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But although the collapse of centrally planned economies in the Soviet Union and other countries of the Eastern bloc subjected Cuba to severe economic difficulties, which led to a drop in calories per day from 3052 in 1989 to 2600 in 2006, mortality rates were not strongly affected thanks to the priority given on maintaining a [[social safety net]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/cubas_organic_r.php|title=Cuba's Organic Revolution|work=TreeHugger|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government undertook several  [[Cuban economic reforms|reforms]] to stem excess [[liquidity]], increase labor incentives and alleviate serious shortages of food, [[consumer good]]s and services. To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.

Government efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, &quot;The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270631&amp;area=/insight/insight__international%252|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 June 2015|accessdate=23 August 2018}}{{dead link|date=January 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Living conditions]] in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.

As of 2012, the government lists 181 official jobs no longer under their control—such as taxi driver, construction worker and shopkeeper. Workers must purchase licenses to work for some roles, such as a mule driver, palm tree trimmer, or well-digger. Despite these openings, Cuba maintains nationalized companies for the distribution of all essential amenities (water, power, ...) and other essential services to ensure a healthy population (education, health care).

Around 2000, half the country's sugar mills closed. Prior to reforms, imports were double exports, doctors earned £15 per month and families supplemented incomes with extra jobs. After reforms, more than 150,000 farmers could lease land from the government for surplus crop production. Before reforms, the only real-estate transactions were home-owners were swapping properties; post-reform legalized buying and selling then created a real-estate boom in the country. In 2012, a Havana fast-food burger/pizza restaurant, La Pachanga, started in the owner's home; it now serves 1,000 meals on a Saturday at £3 each. Tourists can now ride factory steam locomotives through closed sugar mills&lt;ref name=BBCSimonReeve2012&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Simon Reeve 2012 documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVRlhgPF2U4|accessdate=23 September 2013|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Fidel Castro, in agreement with Raúl Castro's reformist sentiment, admitted that the Cuban model based on the old Soviet model of centralized planning was no longer sustainable. They encouraged the creation of a co-operative variant of socialism where the state plays a less active role in the economy and the formation of worker-owned co-operatives and self-employment enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/sep/10/fidel-castro-cuba-communist |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=Cuba: from communist to co-operative? |author1=Stephen Wilkinson |date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2011 a new credit policy allowed Cuban banks to finance entrepreneurs and individuals wishing to make major purchases to do home improvements in addition to farmers. &quot;Cuban banks have long provided loans to farm cooperatives, they have offered credit to new recipients of farmland in usufruct since 2008 and in 2011 they began making loans to individuals for business and other purposes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Philip|first=Peters|title=A Viewers Guide to Cuba's Economic Reforms|journal=Lexington Institute|date=23 May 2012|page=21|url=http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievements of the radical social policy of socialist Cuba, which enabled social advancement for the formerly underprivileged classes, were curbed by the economic crisis and the low wages of recent decades. The socialist leadership is reluctant to tackle this problem because it touches a core aspect of its revolutionary legitimacy. As a result, Cuba's National Bureau of Statistics (ONE) publishes little data on the growing socio-economic divide. A nationwide scientific survey shows that social inequalities have become increasingly visible in everyday life and that the Afro-Cuban population is structurally disadvantaged. The report notes that while 58 percent of white Cubans have incomes of less than $3,000 a year, among Afro-Cubans that proportion reaches 95 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansing|first=Katrin|author2=Hoffmann Bert|title=Cuba’s New Social Structure: Assessing the Re-Stratification of Cuban Society 60 Years after Revolution|journal=GIGA Working Paper Series|year=2019|volume=315|url=https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/system/files/publications/wp315_hansing-hoffmann.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afro-Cubans, moreover, receive a very limited portion of family remittances from the Cuban-American community in South Florida, which is mostly white. Remittances from family members from abroad serve often as starting capital for the emerging private sector.

===Energy production===
As of 2011, 96% of electricity was produced from fossil fuels. Solar panels were introduced in some rural areas to reduce blackouts, brownouts and use of kerosene. Citizens were encouraged to swap inefficient lamps with newer models to reduce consumption. A power tariff reduced inefficient use &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/la-revolucion-energetica-cubas-energy-revolution &quot;La Revolucion Energetica: Cuba's Energy Revolution&quot;], Renewable Energy World International Magazine, 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2012, off-shore petroleum exploration of [[Oil reserves in Cuba|promising formations in the Gulf of Mexico]] had been unproductive with two failures reported.

====Energy sector====
The Energy Revolution is a program executed by Cuba in 2006. This program focused on developing the country's socio-economic status and transition Cuba into an energy-efficient economy with diverse energy resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrastía-Avila|first1=Mario Alberto|last2=Glidden|first2=Lisa|title=CUBA’S ENERGY REVOLUTION AND 2030 POLICY GOALS: MORE PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN ELECTRICITY GENERATION|journal=The International Journal of Cuban Studies|date=2017|volume=9|issue=1|pages=73–90|url=|doi=10.13169/intejcubastud.9.1.0073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba's energy sector lacks the resources to produce optimal amounts of power.

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Cuba}}
Cuba produces sugarcane, tobacco, citrus, coffee, rice, potatoes, beans and livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;The World Factbook&quot; /&gt; As of 2015, Cuba imported about 70–80% of its food.&lt;ref name=&quot;WFP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wfp.org/countries/cuba | title=WFP Cuba page|website=Wfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 80–84% of the food it rations to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/04/16/cuba.farming/index.html|title=Cuban leader looks to boost food production|website=Cnn.com| date=17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raúl Castro ridiculed the bureaucracy that shackled the agriculture sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfood&quot;/&gt;

===Industry===
[[File:Oljepumpe cuba.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pumpjack]]s in Cuba]]
In total, industrial production accounted for almost 37% of Cuban GDP, or US$6.9 billion and employed 24% of the population, or 2,671,000 people, in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} A rally in sugar prices in 2009 stimulated investment and development of sugar processing.

===Services===
====Tourism ====
{{Main|Tourism in Cuba}}
[[File:Varaderobeach.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A white sand beach in [[Varadero|Varadero, Cuba]]]]
In the mid-1990s tourism surpassed [[sugar]], long the mainstay of the Cuban economy, as the primary source of foreign exchange. Havana devotes significant resources to building tourist facilities and renovating historic structures. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 yielding about $1.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in gross revenues. In 2000, 1,773,986 foreign visitors arrived in Cuba. Revenue from tourism reached US$1.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Cuba-TOURISM-TRAVEL-AND-RECREATION.html|title=Tourism, travel, and recreation – Cuba|website=Mationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, some 3 million visitors brought nearly £2 billion yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=3LoFX3uhctI |title=BBC 2012 SimonReeve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of tourism has had social and economic repercussions. This led to speculation of the emergence of a two-tier economy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |date=2010-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fostering of a state of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]]. This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods – and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] – could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gulf between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term socialist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |title=Lessons From Cuba |date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628061024/http://www.traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2017}} Travel Outward&lt;/ref&gt;

====Retail====
Cuba has a small retail sector. A few large shopping centers operated in Havana  as of September 2012 but charged US prices. Pre-Revolutionary commercial districts were largely shut down. The majority of stores are small dollar stores, bodegas, agro-mercados (farmers' markets) and street stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Cuba.html|title=Cuba|website=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance===
The financial sector remains heavily regulated and access to credit for entrepreneurial activity is seriously impeded by the shallowness of the financial market.

===Foreign investment and trade===
The Netherlands receives the largest share of Cuban exports (24%), 70 to 80% of which go through Indiana Finance BV, a company owned by the [[Van 't Wout]] family, who have close personal ties with Fidel Castro. Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. Cuba's primary import partner is Venezuela. The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba began courting foreign investment in the Special Period. Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the [[Helms–Burton Act|U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act]] that provides sanctions for those who traffic in property expropriated from U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/cuba/35715.htm|title=Cuba (11/03)|newspaper=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba's average tariff rate is 10 percent. As of 2014, the country's planned economy deterred foreign trade and investment. At this point, the state maintained strict capital and exchange controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 Index of Economic Freedom&quot; /&gt; In 2017, however, the country reported a record 2 billion in foreign investment.&lt;ref name=foreigninvestors&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-investment/cuba-reports-record-2-billion-in-foreign-investment-deals-idUSKBN1D02NL|title=Cuba reports record $2 billion in foreign investment deals|first=Marc|last=Frank|publisher=Reuters|date=October 31, 2019|accessdate=December 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that foreign investment in Cuba had increased dramatically since 2014.&lt;ref name=foreigninvestors /&gt; In September 2019, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini stated during a three-day visit to Cuba that the European Union is committed to helping Cuba develop its economy &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-eu-idUSKCN1VU2BY|title=EU stresses support for Cuba even as U.S. hikes sanctions|date=2019-09-10|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Tobacco field cuba1.jpg|thumb|right|270px|A [[tobacco]] plantation in [[Pinar del Río]]]]

===Currencies===
Cuba has two official currencies, both of which are called [[Cuban peso|peso]]. One is sometimes called the &quot;national currency&quot; (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called &quot;dollar&quot; in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.

In 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] – estimated at $500–800 million annually – the government set up state-run &quot;dollar stores&quot; throughout Cuba that sold &quot;luxury&quot; food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.

However, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. An increasing number of tourist zones accept Euros.

===Private businesses===

Owners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') originally could seat no more than 12 people&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Rourke2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=P.  J. O'Rourke|title=Eat the Rich: A Treatise on Economics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YzTauHNa4FIC}}|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-55584-710-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can only employ family members. Set monthly fees must be paid regardless of income earned and frequent inspections yield stiff fines when any of the many self-employment regulations are violated.

As of 2012, more than 150,000 farmers had signed up to lease land from the government for bonus crops. Before, home-owners were only allowed to swap;  once buying and selling were allowed, prices rose.&lt;ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve/&gt;

In cities, &quot;[[urban agriculture]]&quot; farms small parcels. Growing [[organopónicos]] (organic gardens) in the private sector has been attractive to city-dwelling small producers who sell their products where they produce them, avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) in the form of seed houses and advisers.

==Wages, Development, and Pensions==
Typical wages range from 400 non-convertible Cuban pesos a month, for a factory worker, to 700 per month for a doctor, or a range of around 17–30 US dollars per month. However, the Human Development Index of Cuba still ranks much higher than the vast majority of Latin American nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;comandate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|date=21 February 2008|work=The Economist|title=Cuba – The comandante's last move|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=10727899}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cuba lost Soviet subsidies in 1991, [[malnutrition]] resulted in an outbreak of diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;cordova&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The situation of Cuban workers during the &quot;Special Period in peacetime&quot;|author=Efrén Córdova|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba6/45Cordova.fm.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318041650/http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/asce/cuba6/45Cordova.fm.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the poverty level reported by the government is one of the lowest in the developing world, ranking 6th out of 108 countries, 4th in Latin America and 48th among all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by Human Development Index#Complete list of countries]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pensions are among the smallest in the Americas at $9.50/month. In 2009, Raúl Castro increased minimum pensions by 2 dollars, which he said was to recompense for those who have &quot;dedicated a great part of their lives to working... and who remain firm in defense of socialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7370304.stm|title=Raul Castro raises state pension|publisher=BBC | date=27 April 2008 | accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Cuba is known for its system of food distribution, the Libreta de Abastecimiento (&quot;Supplies booklet&quot;). The system establishes the rations each person is allowed to buy through that system, and the frequency of supplies. Despite rumors of ending, the system still exists.

==Connection with Venezuela==

The relationship cultivated between Cuba and [[Venezuela]] in recent years resulted in agreements in which Venezuela provides cheap oil in exchange for Cuban &quot;missions&quot; of doctors to bolster the Venezuelan health care system. As of 2015, Cuba had the third-highest number of physicians per capita worldwide (behind [[Monaco]] and [[Qatar]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/911246910|title=World Health Statistics 2015.|last=Organization, World Health.|date=2015|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789240694439|oclc=911246910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country sends tens of thousands of doctors to other countries as aid, as well as to obtain favorable trade terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article1947916.html|title=How will the Venezuela-Cuba link fare after Chávez’s death?|last=Tamayo|first=Juan O.|website=miamiherald|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nominal terms, the Venezuelan subsidy is higher than whatever subsidy the Soviet Union gave to Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=345051&amp;CategoryId=10717|publisher=Latin American Herald Tribune|author=Jeremy Morgan|title=Venezuela's Chávez Fills $9.4 Billion Yearly Post-Soviet Gap in Cuba's Accounts |accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Cuban state receiving cheap oil and the Cuban economy receiving around $6 billion annually. According to Mesa-Lago, a Cuban-born US economist. &quot;If this help stops, industry is paralysed, transportation is paralysed and you'll see the effects in everything from electricity to sugar mills,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/venezuela/9797530/As-Hugo-Chavez-fights-for-his-life-Cuba-fears-for-its-future.html|title=As Hugo Chavez fights for his life, Cuba fears for its future|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an economic standpoint, Cuba relies much more on Venezuela than Venezuela does on Cuba. As of 2012, Venezuela accounted for 20.8% of Cuba's GDP while Cuba only accounted for roughly 4% of Venezuela's.&lt;ref&gt;Piccone,Ted and Harold Trinkunas &quot;The Cuba-Venezuela Alliance: The Beginning of the End?&quot; Latin America Initiative on Foreign Policy at Brookings (2014): 1-12..&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this reliance, the most recent economic [[Crisis in Venezuela (2012-present)]], with inflation nearing 800% and GDP shrinking by 19% in 2016, Cuba is not receiving their amount of payment and heavily subsidized oil. Further budget cuts are in the plans for 2018 marking a third straight year.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Marc. &quot;Cuba warns of further belt tightening as Venezuelan crisis deepens.&quot; Reuters. N.p., 28 Apr. 2017. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic freedom==
In 2014 Cuba's economic freedom score was 28.7, making its economy one of the world's least free. Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America/Caribbean region and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the “repressed” category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.

Despite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion. A watered-down reform package endorsed by the Party trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions, but many details of the reform remained obscure.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 Index of Economic Freedom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Index of Economic Freedom|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/cuba|website=Heritage.org|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxes and revenues ==
As of 2009, Cuba had $47.08 billion in revenues and $50.34 billion in expenditures with 34.6% of GDP in public debt, an account balance of $513 million and $4.647 billion in reserves of foreign exchange and gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;The World Factbook&quot; /&gt; Government spending is around 67 percent of GDP and public debt is around 35 percent of the domestic economy. Despite reforms, the government continues to play a large role in the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 Index of Economic Freedom&quot; /&gt;

The top individual income tax rate is 50 percent. The top corporate tax rate is 30 percent (35 percent for wholly foreign-owned companies). Other taxes include a tax on property transfers and a sales tax. The overall tax burden is 24.4 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 Index of Economic Freedom&quot; /&gt;
