The '''Geography of Croatia''' is defined by its location—it is described as a part of [[Central Europe]] and [[Southeast Europe]], a part of the [[Balkans]] and [[Mitteleuropa]]. Croatia's territory covers {{convert|56594|km2|abbr=on}}, making it the 127th largest country in the world. Bordered by [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Serbia]] in the east, [[Slovenia]] in the west, [[Hungary]] in the north and [[Montenegro]] and the Adriatic Sea in the south, it lies mostly between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]] and longitudes [[13th meridian east|13°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]]. [[Croatia]]'s [[territorial waters]] encompass {{convert|18981|km2}} in a {{convert|12|nmi}} wide zone, and its [[internal waters]] located within the [[Baseline (sea)|baseline]] cover an additional {{convert|12498|km2}}.

The [[Pannonian Basin]] and the [[Dinaric Alps]], along with the Adriatic Basin, represent major [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] parts of Croatia. Lowlands make up the bulk of Croatia, with elevations of less than {{convert|200|m}} above sea level recorded in 53.42% of the country. Most of the lowlands are found in the northern regions, especially in [[Slavonia]], itself a part of the Pannonian Basin plain. The plains are interspersed with [[Horst (geology)|horst]] and [[graben]] structures, believed to have broken the [[Pliocene]] [[Pannonian Sea]]'s surface as [[Pannonian island mountains|islands]]. The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in the [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] areas in the Dinaric Alps, but high areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent. The Dinaric Alps contain the highest mountain in Croatia—{{convert|1831|m|adj=on}} Dinara—as well as all other mountains in Croatia higher than {{convert|1500|m}}. Croatia's Adriatic Sea mainland coast is {{convert|1777.3|km}} long, while its [[List of islands of Croatia|1,246&amp;nbsp;islands]] and islets encompass a further {{convert|4058|km}} of coastline—the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean. [[Karst topography]] makes up [[List of notable karst areas#Croatia|about half of Croatia]] and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps, as well as throughout the coastal areas and the islands.

62% of Croatia's territory is encompassed by the [[Black Sea]] [[drainage basin]]. The area includes the largest rivers flowing in the country: the [[Danube]], Sava, [[Drava]], [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Kupa]]. The remainder belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin, where the largest river by far is the [[Neretva]]. Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy [[continental climate]] as defined by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|-3|°C|°F}} and {{convert|18|°C|°F}}. Croatia has a number of [[ecoregion]]s because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently among the most biodiverse in Europe. There are four types of [[biogeographical]] regions in Croatia: Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland; Alpine in the [[altitudinal zonation|elevated]] Lika and Gorski Kotar; Pannonian along the Drava and Danube; and Continental in the remaining areas. There are 444&amp;nbsp;[[protected areas of Croatia|protected natural areas in Croatia]], encompassing 8.5% of the country; there are about 37,000 known species in Croatia, and the total number of species is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.

The permanent population of Croatia by the 2011 census reached 4.29&amp;nbsp;million. The [[population density]] was 75.8&amp;nbsp;inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall [[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy in Croatia]] at birth was 75.7&amp;nbsp;years. The country is inhabited mostly by [[Croats]] (89.6%), while [[Ethnic minorities in Croatia|minorities]] include [[Serbs]] (4.5%), and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each) recognised by the [[Constitution of Croatia|constitution]]. Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 [[Counties of Croatia|counties]] and the capital [[city of Zagreb]]. The counties subdivide into 127 [[List of cities in Croatia|cities]] and 429 [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]]. The average [[urbanisation]] rate in Croatia stands at 56%, with a growing urban population and shrinking rural population. The largest city and the nation's [[capital city|capital]] is [[Zagreb]], with an urban population of 686,568 in the city itself and a [[metropolitan area]] population of 978,161. The populations of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Rijeka]] exceed 100,000, and five more cities in Croatia have populations over 50,000.

Croatia's {{convert|348|km|adj=on}} border with Hungary was inherited from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Much of the border with Hungary follows the [[Drava]] River or its former river bed; that part of the border dates from the [[Middle Ages]]. The border in [[Međimurje]] and [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] was defined as a border between the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, pursuant to the [[Treaty of Trianon#Borders of Hungary|Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trianon, Treaty of|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-TrianonTr.html|encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia of ww1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World War I|last=Tucker|first=Spencer|year=2005|edition=1|page=1183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C&amp;pg=PA1183|quote=Virtually the entire population of what remained of Hungary regarded the Treaty of Trianon as manifestly unfair, and agitation for revision began immediately.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-420-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present outline of the {{convert|956|km|adj=on}} border with Bosnia–Herzegovina and {{convert|19|km|adj=on}} border with Montenegro is largely the result of the [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]] and subsequent recapture of territories in the [[Great Turkish War]] of 1667–1698 formally ending with the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]],{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=422}} as well as the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Fifth]] and [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–1718)|Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederic Chapin|last=Lane|title=Venice, a Maritime Republic|publisher=JHU Press|year=1973|isbn=978-0-8018-1460-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PQpU2JGJCMwC|accessdate=18 October 2011|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; This border had minor modifications in 1947 when all borders of the former Yugoslav constituent republics were defined by demarcation commissions implementing the [[AVNOJ]] decisions of 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organisation of Yugoslavia. The commissions also defined Baranya and Međimurje as Croatian territories, and moreover set up the present-day {{convert|314|km|adj=on}} border between Serbia and Croatia in [[Syrmia]] and along the [[Danube]] River between [[Ilok]] and the Drava river's mouth and further north to the Hungarian border; the Ilok/Drava section matched the border between the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] and [[Bács-Bodrog County]] that existed until 1918 (the end of [[World War I]]). Most of the {{convert|600|km|adj=on}} border with Slovenia was also defined by the commissions, matching the northwestern border of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Geoadria|publisher=University of Zadar&amp;nbsp;– Croatian Geographic Society|issn=1331-2294|volume=15|issue=1|date=June 2010|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=84078|title=Povijesni razvoj i političko-geografska obilježja granice i pograničja Republike Hrvatske s Republikom Slovenijom na Žumberku i Kupsko-čabranskoj dolini|language=Croatian|trans-title=Historical development and politico-geographical characteristics of the border and borderland between the Republic of Croatia and Republic of Slovenia on Žumberak and in the Rivers Kupa and Čabranka Valley|first1=Helena Ilona|last1=Bognar|first2=Andrija|last2=Bognar|pages=187–224|accessdate=7 March 2012|doi=10.15291/geoadria.549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing a new section of Croatian border north of the [[Istria]]n peninsula according to the ethnic composition of the territory previously belonging to the [[Kingdom of Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraljević-Razgraničenje-1947&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Egon|last=Kraljević|publisher=Croatian State Archives|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=41791 |language=Croatian|title=Prilog za povijest uprave: Komisija za razgraničenje pri Predsjedništvu Vlade Narodne Republike Hrvatske 1945–1946|trans-title=A part of history of public administration: Boundary demarcation commission of the government presidency of the People's Republic of Croatia, 1945–1946|date=November 2007|journal=Arhivski Vjesnik |volume=50|issue=50|issn=0570-9008|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[Austria-Hungary]] established a [[geodetic network]], for which the [[Metres above the Adriatic|elevation benchmark]] was determined by the Adriatic Sea's average level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste.

Italy and Yugoslavia defined their delineation of the [[continental shelf]] in the Adriatic Sea in 1968,{{sfn|Blake|Topalović|Schofield|1996|pp=11–13}} with an additional agreement on the boundary in the Gulf of Trieste signed in 1975 in accordance with the Treaty of Osimo. All the successor states of former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements. Prior to Yugoslavia's break-up, Albania, Italy and Yugoslavia initially proclaimed {{convert|15|nmi|km mi|adj=on}} [[territorial waters]], subsequently reduced to the international-standard {{convert|12|nmi|km mi}}; all sides adopted [[Baseline (sea)|baseline]] systems. Croatia also declared its [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]] (ZERP)—a part of its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]—as extending to the continental shelf boundary. Croatia's territorial waters encompass {{convert|18981|km2}}; its [[internal waters]] located within the baseline cover an additional {{convert|12498|km2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA-Land-Use&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Environment Agency|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/hr/land-use-state-and-impacts-croatia|title=Land use&amp;nbsp;– State and impacts (Croatia)|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border disputes===
{{see also|Croatia–Slovenia border disputes|Island of Šarengrad|Island of Vukovar}}

====Maritime border disputes====
Croatia and Slovenia started negotiations to define maritime borders in the [[Gulf of Piran]] in 1992 but failed to agree, resulting in a dispute. Both countries also declared their economic zones, which partially overlap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoadria-Borders&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukom.gov.si/fileadmin/ukom.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti/dogodki/Kronologije_arhiv/chronology05.pdf |title=Chronology of Events 2005 |publisher=Government Communication Office, Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=25 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719011408/http://www.ukom.gov.si/fileadmin/ukom.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti/dogodki/Kronologije_arhiv/chronology05.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia's application to become an [[Member state of the European Union|EU member state]] was initially suspended pending resolution of its border disputes with Slovenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoadria-Borders&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Geoadria|publisher=University of Zadar|issn=1331-2294|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=71443|title=The maritime boundaries of the Adriatic Sea|first1=Mladen|last1=Klemenčić|first2=Duško|last2=Topalović|pages=311–324|volume=14|issue=2|date=December 2009|accessdate=1 February 2012|doi=10.15291/geoadria.555}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an [[international arbitration]] commission set up via the [[United Nations|UN]], enabling Croatia to [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|progress towards EU membership]].&lt;ref name=BBC2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8250441.stm|title=Slovenia unblocks Croatian EU bid |work=BBC News|accessdate=12 September 2009| date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2010&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10248037|title=Slovenia backs Croatia border deal in referendum vote |work=BBC News|accessdate=7 June 2010 | date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Durham /&gt; The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress, even before the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoadria-Borders&quot;/&gt;

The maritime boundary between Bosnia–Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999, but a few issues are still contested—the [[Klek (peninsula)|Klek peninsula]] and two islets in the border area. The Croatia–Montenegro maritime boundary is disputed in the [[Bay of Kotor]], at the Prevlaka peninsula. The situation was exacerbated by the peninsula's occupation by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] and later by the [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Serbian-Montenegrin army]], which in turn was replaced by a [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|United Nations observer mission]] that lasted until 2002. Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay, and the dispute has become far less contentious since the independence of Montenegro in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoadria-Borders&quot;/&gt;

====Land border disputes====
The land border disputes pertain to comparatively small strips of land. The [[Croatia–Slovenia border disputes]] are: along the [[Dragonja]] River's lower course where Slovenia claims three [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]] on the river's left bank; the [[Sveta Gera]] peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made and appear to be limited to a military barracks on the peak itself; and along the [[Mur (river)|Mura River]] where Slovenia wants the border to be along the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a (largely if not completely uninhabited) piece of land near [[Hotiza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Večernji list|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/zaljevski-rat-na-piranski-nacin/197290/|language=Croatian|title=Zaljevski rat na piranski način|trans-title=Gulf War in the Bay of Piran|date=7 March 2009|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Vjesnik|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=F352D8B7-0206-40C4-9C36-D419147EEFE1|archivedate=14 June 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120614103345/http://www.vjesnik.hr/Article.aspx?ID=F352D8B7-0206-40C4-9C36-D419147EEFE1|language=Croatian|title=Zasad četiri sporne točke zbog granice na moru i kopnu|trans-title=Four contested points of the land and sea borders so far|date=22 January 2012|accessdate=1 March 2012|first=Marko|last=Barišić|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are likewise in the process of being settled by binding arbitration.&lt;ref name=BBC2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Durham&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/ibru/news/boundary_news/?itemno=12176|accessdate=14 March 2012|title=Croatia and Slovenia submit arbitration agreement to UN|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also land [[Croatia-Serbia border dispute|border disputes between Croatia and Serbia]]. The two countries presently control one bank of the present-day river each, but Croatia claims that the border line should follow the [[cadastral]] borders between the former municipalities of [[SR Croatia]] and [[SR Serbia]] along the Danube, as defined by a Yugoslav commission in 1947 (effectively following a former river bed); borders claimed by Croatia also include the [[Island of Vukovar|Vukovar]] and [[Island of Šarengrad|Šarengrad]] islands in the Danube as its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Večernji list|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/granicni-spor-hrvatskom-usporit-ce-put-srbije-eu-clanak-154535|language=Croatian|title=Granični spor s Hrvatskom usporit će put Srbije u EU|trans-title=Border dispute with Croatia will slow down Serbia's accession to the EU|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a border dispute with Bosnia–Herzegovina,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Dnevni avaz|language=Bosnian|url=http://www.dnevniavaz.ba/vijesti/teme/78512-sastanak-celnika-bih-hrvatske-i-srbije-protekao-mirno-i-bez-rezultata-tadic-odbio-priznati-da-je-rs-nastala-na-genocidu.html|title=Sastanak na Jahorini bez rezultata: Tadić odbio priznati da je RS nastala na genocidu|trans-title=Meeting on Jahorina without any results: Tadić refuses to admit that the Republika Srpska was created through genocide|date=4 February 2012|accessdate=1 March 2012|first=A|last=Dučić|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308141750/http://www.dnevniavaz.ba/vijesti/teme/78512-sastanak-celnika-bih-hrvatske-i-srbije-protekao-mirno-i-bez-rezultata-tadic-odbio-priznati-da-je-rs-nastala-na-genocidu.html|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically Croatia claims Unčica [[meander|channel]] on the right bank of [[Una (Sava)|Una]] as the border at [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|url=http://sisacko-moslavacka.policija.hr/MainPu.aspx?id=14556|title=Policijska postaja Hrvatska Kostajnica|trans-title=Hrvatska Kostajnica police station|accessdate=29 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917022310/http://sisacko-moslavacka.policija.hr/MainPu.aspx?id=14556|archive-date=17 September 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bosnia and Herzegovina claims Una River course as the border there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Glas Srpske|language=Serbian|title=Granični sporovi sa Srbijom i Hrvatskom ostaju na čekanju|trans-title=Border dispute with Serbia and Croatia remain on hold|url=http://www.glassrpske.com/novosti/vijesti_dana/Granicni-sporovi-sa-Srbijom-i-Hrvatskom-ostaju-na-cekanju/lat/58204.html|date=23 May 2011|author=Svjetlana Tadić|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pannonian Basin====
[[File:Tree in the sun.jpg|thumb|right|A plain in [[Slavonia]]|alt=Plain with a tree in the middle]]
{{main|Pannonian Basin}}
The Pannonian Basin took shape through Miocenian thinning and [[subsidence]] of crust structures formed during the Late [[Paleozoic]] [[Variscan orogeny]]. The Paleozoic and [[Mesozoic]] structures are visible in [[Papuk]] and other Slavonian mountains. The processes also led to the formation of a [[Stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] chain in the basin 12–17&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]]; intensified subsidence was observed until 5&amp;nbsp;Mya as well as [[flood basalt]]s at about 7.5&amp;nbsp;Mya. The contemporary [[tectonic uplift]] of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] severed water flow to the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Pannonian Sea]] formed in the basin. [[Sedimentation#Geology|Sediments]] were transported to the basin from the uplifting Carpathian and Dinaric mountains, with particularly deep [[fluvial]] sediments being deposited in the [[Pleistocene]] epoch during the [[Transdanubian Mountains]]' formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GClF-4rtvoIC|title=Recent Landform Evolution: The Carpatho-Balkan-Dinaric Region|isbn=978-94-007-2447-1|publisher=Springer|year=2012|accessdate=2 March 2012|pages=14–18|first1=Milos|last1=Stankoviansky|first2=Adam|last2=Kotarba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, up to {{convert|3000|m}} of sediment was deposited in the basin, and the sea eventually drained through the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJNODA_0IOgC|title=The Nature Guide to the Hortobagy and Tisza River Floodplain, Hungary|first=Dirk|last=Hilbers|publisher=[[Crossbill Guides Foundation]]|year=2008|isbn=978-90-5011-276-5|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results are large plains in eastern Slavonia's [[Baranya (region)#Geography|Baranya]] and [[Syrmia#Geography|Syrmia]] regions, as well as in river valleys, especially along the [[Sava]], Drava and [[Kupa]]. The plains are interspersed by [[Horst (geology)|horst]] and [[graben]] structures, believed to have broken the Pannonian Sea's surface as [[Pannonian island mountains|islands]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  The tallest among such landforms are {{convert|1059|m|adj=on}} [[Ivanšćica]] and {{convert|1035|m|adj=on}} [[Medvednica]] north of [[Zagreb#Surroundings|Zagreb]]—both are also at least partially in [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]—as well as {{convert|984|m|adj=on}} [[Psunj]] and {{convert|953|m|adj=on}} Papuk that are the tallest among the Slavonian mountains surrounding [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Yearbook-2011&quot;/&gt; Psunj, Papuk and adjacent [[Krndija]] consist mostly of Paleozoic rocks from 300–350&amp;nbsp;Mya.

A smaller piece of igneous terrain is also present on Papuk, near [[Voćin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Papuk Geopark|url=http://www.papukgeopark.com/publikacije/geo_vodic1_30.pdf|title=Geološki vodič kroz park prirode Papuk|language=Croatian|trans-title=Geological guide to the Papuk Nature Park|accessdate=2 March 2012|first1=Jakob|last1=Pamić|first2=Goran|last2=Radonić|first3=Goran|last3=Pavić}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two, as well as the [[Moslavačka gora]] mountains, are possibly remnants of a [[volcanic arc]] from the same [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] collision that caused the Dinaric Alps.&lt;ref name=&quot;EGU&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map HRV present.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types of Croatia]]
Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy [[Oceanic climate|oceanic climate (Cfb)]] as defined by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Mean monthly temperatures range between {{convert|-3|°C|°F}} (in January) and {{convert|18|°C|°F}} (in July). The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where a snowy forested climate is found at elevations above {{convert|1200|m|ft}}. The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland, which are characterised by a [[Mediterranean climate]] since temperatures are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas: the lowest temperature of {{convert|-36.0|°C|°F}} was recorded on 4 February 1929 in [[Gospić]], and the highest temperature of {{convert|42.8|°C|°F}} was recorded on 5 August 1981 in [[Ploče]].

The mean annual precipitation is {{convert|600|to|3500|mm|in}} depending on the geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands (Vis, [[Lastovo#Climate|Lastovo]], [[Biševo]], and [[Svetac]]) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia; however, in the latter case it is mostly during the [[growing season]]. The most precipitation is observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski Kotar, where some of the highest annual precipitation totals in Europe occur.

The prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest; in the coastal area, the prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as cool northeasterly [[Bora (wind)|buras]] or, less frequently, as warm southerly [[jugo]]s. The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2,700&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;DZS-Stat2010&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Protected areas of Croatia}}
Croatia can be subdivided between a number of [[ecoregion]]s because of its climate and geomorphology, and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of [[biogeography|biogeographical]] regions in Croatia: Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along the Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzzp.hr/dokumenti_upload/20100311/dzzp201003111404160.pdf|language=Croatian|publisher=State Institute for Nature Protection|title=Distribution of Emerald/NATURA 2000 species and habitat types by biogeographical regions|date=23 October 2006|first=Ivana|last=Plavac|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most significant are [[karst]] habitats; these include submerged karst, such as [[Zrmanja]] and [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] canyons and [[tufa]] barriers, as well as underground habitats. The karst geology has produced approximately 7,000 caves and pits, many of which are inhabited by [[troglobite|troglobitic]] (exclusively cave-dwelling) animals such as the [[olm]], a [[cave salamander]] and the only European troglobitic [[vertebrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?rel-common_name=like&amp;where-scientific_name=anguinus|title=Proteus anguinus|work=AmphibiaWeb|accessdate=15 March 2012|first1=Boris|last1=Bulog|first2=Arie|last2=van der Meijden|first3=Kellie|last3=Whittaker|date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forests are also significant in the country, as they cover {{convert|26487.6|km2}} representing 46.8% of Croatia's land surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA-Land-Use&quot;/&gt; The other habitat types include wetlands, grasslands, bogs, fens, scrub habitats, coastal and marine habitats.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher=State Institute for Nature Protection, [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)]]|url=http://www.dzzp.hr/dokumenti_upload/20120515/dzzp201205151608230.pdf|title=Biodiversity of Croatia|year= 2006|editor1-first=Jasminka|editor1-last=Radović|editor2-first=Kristijan|editor2-last=Čivić|editor3-first=Ramona|editor3-last=Topić|isbn=953-7169-20-0|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[phytogeography]], Croatia is part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]]; specifically, it is part of the Illyrian and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and the Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]].

Croatia has 38,226 known [[Taxon|taxa]], 2.8% of which are [[endemism|endemic]]; the actual number (including undiscovered [[species]]) is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt; The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of [[invertebrate]]s discovered in Croatia in 2000–2005 alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt; There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt; Indigenous [[cultivar]]s of plants and [[breed]]s of domesticated animals are also numerous; they include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed.

There are 444 [[Croatian protected areas]], encompassing 8.5% of the country. These include 8 [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks]], 2 strict [[Nature reserve|reserves]] and 11 [[nature park]]s, accounting for 78% of the total protected area.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA-Land-Use&quot;/&gt; The most famous protected area and the oldest [[national park]] in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]]. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up as the first step in preparation for EU membership and joining the [[Natura 2000]] network.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt;

[[Habitat destruction]] represents a threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural [[habitat]]s, while [[habitat fragmentation]] occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of [[invasive species]], with ''[[Caulerpa racemosa]]'' and ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia|C. taxifolia]]'' identified as especially problematic ones.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2008 /&gt; The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the [[Benthic zone|benthic habitat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MCult-Biodiversity&quot;/&gt; Agricultural [[monoculture]]s have also been identified as a threat to biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/229899/2005_12_doc02.pdf |title=Environmental and macroeconomic impact assessment of different development scenarios to organic and low-input farming in Croatia |first1=Darko |last1=Znaor |first2=Jules |last2=Pretty |first3=James |last3=Morrison |first4=Sonja Karoglan |last4=Todorović |date=November 2005 |publisher=University of Essex |location=Colchester, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The European Corn Borer (''Ostrinia nubilalis'' Hűbner) Review of Results From Croatia |first1=Marija |last1=Ivezić |first2=Emilija |last2=Raspudić |issn=1330-7142 |url=http://www.pfos.hr/~poljo/sites/default/data/2001_1/3_IVEZIC.pdf |journal=Poljoprivreda (Osijek) |year=2001 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |access-date=31 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831201120/http://www.pfos.hr/~poljo/sites/default/data/2001_1/3_IVEZIC.pdf |archive-date=31 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ecological footprint]] of Croatia's population and industry varies significantly between the country's regions since 50% of the population resides in 26.8% of the nation's territory, with a particularly high impact made by the city of Zagreb and Zagreb County areas—their combined area comprises 6.6% of Croatia's territory while encompassing 25% of the population.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azo.hr/IzvjesceOStanjuOkolisaU|language=Croatian|date=11 November 2011|title=Izvješće o stanju okoliša u Republici Hrvatskoj, 2007|trans-title=Report on environmental conditions in the Republic of Croatia, 2007|publisher=Croatian Environment Agency|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological footprint is most notably from the increased development of settlements and the sea coast leading to [[habitat fragmentation]]. Between 1998 and 2008, the greatest changes of [[land use]] pertained to artificially developed areas, but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azo.hr/lgs.axd?t=16&amp;id=4207|language=Croatian|title=Konačni nacrt izvješća o stanju okoliša u Republici Hrvatskoj za razdoblje 2005.&amp;nbsp;– 2008|trans-title=Final draft report on environmental conditions in the Republic of Croatia in the 2005–2008 period|publisher=Croatian Environment Agency|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croatian Environment Agency (CEA), a public institution established by the [[Government of Croatia]] to collect and analyse information on the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Croatian Environment Agency|url=http://www.azo.hr/AboutUs|title=About us|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has identified further ecological problems as well as various degrees of progress in terms of curbing their environmental impact. These problems include inadequate legal [[landfill]]s as well as the presence of illegal landfills; between 2005 and 2008, 62 authorised and 423 illegal landfills were [[Land rehabilitation|rehabilitated]]. In the same period, the number of issued [[waste management]] licences doubled, while the annual [[municipal solid waste]] volume increased by 23%, reaching {{convert|403|kg|abbr=off}} per capita. The processes of [[soil acidification]] and [[soil organic matter|organic matter]] degradation are present throughout Croatia, with increasing [[soil salinity]] levels in the [[Neretva]] river plain and spreading areas of [[alkali soil]] in [[Slavonia]].&lt;ref name=EnvRep2008/&gt;

Croatian [[air pollution]] levels reflect the drop in industrial production recorded in 1991 at the onset of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of [[Hydrodesulfurization|desulfurised]] fuels has led to a 25% reduction of [[sulphur dioxide]] emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2008/&gt; The use of [[unleaded petrol]] reduced emissions of [[lead]] into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. [[Air quality]] measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2007/&gt; The most significant sources of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions in Croatia are [[energy production]] (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the [[Kyoto Protocol]] limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting substances]] was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2008/&gt;

Even though Croatia has sufficient [[water resources]] at its disposal, these are not uniformly distributed and public [[water supply network]] losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface [[water pollution]] increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time [[organic waste]] pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new [[sewage treatment]] plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]]s are top [[water quality|quality]], unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] and [[bacteriological water analysis]] results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public [[water supply]] system, but only 44% of the population have access to the public [[sewerage]] network, with [[septic system]]s in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, [[oligotroph]]ic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased [[eutrophication]] were identified in the [[Bay of Bakar]], the Bay of [[Kaštela]], the Port of [[Šibenik]] and near [[Ploče]]; other areas of localised pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of [[marine pollution]] (including 128 [[ship pollution|from vessels]]), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report,&lt;ref name=EnvRep2008/&gt; 1997 to August 2005.&lt;ref name=EnvRep2007/&gt;

===Land use===
[[File:Papuk from air.jpg|thumb|right|Forest-covered [[Papuk]]|alt=View from the air of a forest-covered mountain]]
As of 2006, 46.8% of Croatia was occupied by {{convert|26487.6|km2}} of forest and shrub, while a further {{convert|22841|km2}} or 40.4% of the land was used for diverse agricultural uses including {{convert|4389.1|km2}}, or 7.8% of the total, for [[permanent crop]]s. Bush and grass cover was present on {{convert|4742.1|km2}} or 8.4% of the territory, inland waters took up {{convert|539.3|km2}} or 1.0% and marshes covered {{convert|200|km2}} or 0.4% of the country. Artificial surfaces (primarily consisting of urban areas, roads, non-agricultural vegetation, sports areas and other recreational facilities) took up {{convert|1774.5|km2}} or 3.1% of the country's area. The greatest impetus for land use changes is the expansion of settlements and road construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA-Land-Use&quot;/&gt;

Because of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], there are numerous leftover [[minefields in Croatia]], largely tracing former front lines. As of 2006, suspected minefields covered {{convert|954.5|km2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEA-Land-Use&quot;/&gt; As of 2012, 62% of the remaining minefields are situated in forests, 26% of them are found in agricultural land, and 12% are found in other land; it is expected that [[Demining|mine clearance]] will be complete by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Glas Slavonije|url=http://www.glas-slavonije.hr/mvijest.asp?rub=3&amp;ID_VIJESTI=12624|language=Croatian|title=Smrtonosna ostavština rata|trans-title=Deadly legacy of war|date=18 February 2012|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regions===
{{main|List of regions of Croatia}}
Croatia is traditionally divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders are not always clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognisable ones throughout the country are [[Central Croatia]] (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and [[Mountainous Croatia]] (Lika and Gorski Kotar; to the west of Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of [[Zadar]] and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the [[Croatian Littoral]] and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Geoadria|issn=1331-2294|publisher=University of Zadar, Croatian Geographic Society|location=Zadar|volume=5|issue=1|date=June 2000|title=Razmještaj stanovništva u Republici Hrvatskoj&amp;nbsp;– dio općih demogrfskih i društveno-gospodarskih procesa|trans-title=Population Distribution in the Republic of Croatia&amp;nbsp;– A Part of General Demographic and Socio-Economic Processes|language=Croatian|pages=93–104|first1=Ivo|last1=Nejašmić|first2=Aleksandar|last2=Toskić|doi=10.15291/geoadria.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29&amp;nbsp;million. The [[population density]] was 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall [[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy in Croatia]] at birth is 75.7 years. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1&amp;nbsp;million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7&amp;nbsp;million. Since 1991, Croatia's [[death rate]] has continuously exceeded its [[birth rate]]; the natural growth rate of the population is thus currently negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=14991|journal=Geoadria|publisher=University of Zadar, Croatian Geographic Society|location=Zadar|issn=1331-2294|volume=3|issue=1|date=June 1998|first1=Snježana|last1=Mrđen|first2=Mladen|last2=Friganović|pages=29–56|title=The Demographic Situation in Croatia|accessdate=16 March 2012|doi=10.15291/geoadria.45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatia is currently in the [[demographic transition]]'s fourth or fifth stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GG833 Geography: 2002 External Examination Report|url=http://www.tqa.tas.gov.au/4DCGI/_WWW_doc/006107/RND01/GG833_report_02.pdf|author=Tasmainian Secondary Assessment Board|year=2002|accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment.

The EU [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) [[NUTS of Croatia|division of Croatia]] is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions; these are Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia, Northwest Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The last encompasses all counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb and Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci, Međimurje and Zagreb counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds (Croatia)|url=http://www.mrrfeu.hr/UserDocsImages/EU%20fondovi/OP_za_regionalnu_konkurentnost_hr.pdf|title=Operativni program za regionalnu konkurentnost 2007–2009; Dodatak XIX|language=Croatian|trans-title=Operative programme for regional competitiveness 2007–2009; Annex XIX|page=235|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual counties and the city of Zagreb represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS [[Local administrative unit]] divisions are two-tiered.

===Urbanisation===
{{see also|List of cities in Croatia|List of inhabited islands of Croatia}}
The average urbanisation rate in Croatia stands at 56%, with a growing urban population and shrinking rural population. The largest city and the nation's capital is Zagreb, with an urban population of 686,568 in the city itself. Zagreb's [[metropolitan area]] encompasses 341 additional settlements and, by the year 2001, the population of the area had reached 978,161; approximately 60% of Zagreb County's residents live in Zagreb's metropolitan area, as does about 41% of Croatia's urban population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hrvatski Geografski Glasnik|publisher=Croatian Geographic Society|issn=1331-5854|volume=67|issue=1|date=July 2005|title=Apsolutna decentralizacija u populacijskom razvoju Zagrebačke aglomeracije|language=Croatian|trans-title=Absolute Decentralization in Population Development of Zagreb Agglomeration|first=Ksenija|last=Bašić|pages=63–80|doi=10.21861/HGG.2005.67.01.04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of Split and Rijeka are the largest settlements on the Croatian Adriatic coast, with each city's population being over 100,000. There are four other Croatian cities exceeding 50,000&amp;nbsp;people: Osijek, Zadar, [[Pula]] and Slavonski Brod; the Zagreb [[Zagreb#City districts|district]] of [[Sesvete]], which has the status of a [[naselje|standalone settlement]] but not a city, also has such a large population. A further eleven cities are populated by more than 20,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs-2011-settle&quot;/&gt;
