'''Clipperton Island''' ({{lang-fr|Île de Clipperton}} or {{lang-fr|Île de la Passion|label=none}}; {{lang-es|Isla de la Pasión}}) is an uninhabited {{cvt|6|km2|sqmi}} coral [[atoll]] in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]] off the coast of [[Central America]]. It is {{convert|10677|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Paris]], France, {{convert|5400|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Papeete]], Tahiti, and {{convert|1080|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Mexico]].

The atoll is {{cvt|1080|km|0}} south-west of [[Mexico]], {{cvt|2424|km|0}} west of [[Nicaragua]], {{cvt|2545|km|0}} west of [[Costa Rica]] and {{cvt|2260|km|0}} north-west of the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Ecuador]], at {{Coord|10|18|N|109|13|W|name=Clipperton Island|type:isle_region:FR-CP|display=inline}}. Clipperton is about {{cvt|945|km|mi nmi}} south-east of [[Socorro Island]] in the [[Revillagigedo Islands|Revillagigedo Archipelago]], which is the nearest land.

It is low-lying and largely barren, with some scattered grasses and a few clumps of [[Cocos nucifera|coconut palms (''Cocos nucifera'')]]. Land elevations average {{cvt|2|m|ft}}, though a small [[volcano|volcanic]] outcrop rising to {{cvt|29|m|ft}} on its south-east side is considerably higher and is referred to as &quot;Clipperton Rock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/history.html |website=2000 DXpedition to Clipperton Island |title=Clipperton Island Pictures and History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding reef is exposed at low tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot;&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0705 |name=Eastern Pacific Ocean, southeast of Mexico |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of this rock means that technically Clipperton is not an atoll but an island with a barrier reef.

Clipperton has had no permanent inhabitants since 1945. It is visited on occasion by fishermen, [[French Navy]] patrols, scientific researchers, film crews, and shipwreck survivors. It has become a popular site for transmissions by [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/index.html |website=2000 DXpedition to Clipperton Island |title=QSLs and Stories from Previous DXpeditions |access-date=2018-01-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==

===Lagoon and climate===

Clipperton has a ring-shaped atoll which completely encloses a [[water stagnation|stagnant]] [[freshwater]] [[lagoon]], and is {{cvt|12|km|mi}} in circumference. The lagoon is devoid of fish, and contains some deep basins with depths of {{cvt|43|and|72|m|ft}}, including a spot known as Trou-Sans-Fond, or &quot;the bottomless hole&quot;, with acidic water at its base. The water is described as being almost fresh at the surface, and highly [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]]. Seaweed beds cover approximately 45&amp;nbsp;percent of the lagoon's surface. The rim averages {{cvt|150|m|ft}} in width, reaching {{cvt|400|m|ft}} in the west and narrows to {{cvt|45|m|ft}} in the north-east, where sea waves occasionally spill over into the lagoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot;/&gt;

While some sources have rated the lagoon water as [[potable|non-potable]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm |title=Clipperton Island |website=Travel Tips&amp;nbsp;24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102070144/http://www.traveltips24.com/Clipperton_Island.htm |archive-date=2010-01-02 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clipperton Journal: The daily record of life on a Pacific atoll |website=National Geographic News |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0828_030829_milbrandjournal1.html |author=Lance Milbrand |date=August 29, 2003 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; testimony from the crew of the tuna clipper M/V ''Monarch,'' stranded for 23&amp;nbsp;days in 1962 after their boat sank, indicates otherwise. Their report reveals that the lagoon water, while not tasting very good, was drinkable, though &quot;muddy and dirty&quot;. Several of the castaways drank it, with no apparent ill effects.&lt;ref name=No94&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00094.pdf |title=Atoll Research Bulletin No.&amp;nbsp;94 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |location=Washington, D.C. |date=December 15, 1962 |pages=8–10 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors of an ill-fated Mexican military colony in 1917 (see below) indicated that they were dependent upon [[rain]] for their water supply, catching it in old boats they used for this purpose.&lt;ref name=No94/&gt; Aside from the lagoon and water caught from rain, no other freshwater sources are known to exist.

It has a tropical oceanic climate, with average temperatures of {{convert|20|–|32|C|F}}. The rainy season occurs from May to October, when it is subject to tropical storms and hurricanes. Surrounding ocean waters are warm, pushed by equatorial and counter-equatorial currents. It has no known natural resources (its [[guano]] having been depleted early in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century). Although 115&amp;nbsp;species of fish have been identified in nearby waters the only economic activity in the area is tuna fishing.

===Flora and fauna===
[[File:Clippertonisland.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut]] palms on Clipperton. The lagoon is visible beyond the trees.]]
When Snodgrass and Heller visited in 1898, they reported that &quot;no land plant is native to the island&quot;.{{sfnp|Snodgrass|Heller|1902}} Historical accounts from 1711, 1825, and 1839 show a low grassy or suffrutescent (partially woody) flora. During Sachet's visit in 1958, the vegetation was found to consist of a sparse cover of spiny grass and low thickets, a creeping plant (''[[Ipomoea]]'' spp.), and stands of coconut palm. This low-lying herbaceous flora seems to be a pioneer in nature, and most of it is believed to be composed of recently introduced species. Sachet suspected that ''[[Heliotropium curassavicum]]'' and possibly ''[[Portulaca oleracea]]'' were native. [[Coconut|Coconut palm]]s and pigs were introduced in the 1890s by [[guano]] miners. The pigs reduced the crab population, which in turn allowed [[grassland]] to gradually cover about 80 percent of the land surface.{{sfnp|Sachet|1962}} The elimination of these pigs in 1958 — the result of a personal project by [[Kenneth E. Stager]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitman et al. 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pitman |first1=Robert L. |first2=Lisa T. |last2=Ballance |first3=Charly |last3=Bost |year=2005 |title=Clipperton Island: pigsty, rat hole and booby prize |journal=Marine Ornithology |url=http://mundo.cabrillo.edu/~ncrane/Clipperton/ratsandpigs.pdf |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=193–194 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; — has caused most of this vegetation to disappear, as the population of land crabs (''[[Johngarthia planata]]'') has returned to millions.&lt;ref name=WoRMS&gt;{{cite WoRMS |author=Davie, P. |year=2015 |title=''Johngarthia planata'' (Stimpson, 1860) |id=444454 |accessdate=22 February 2017 |db=Marine Mollusca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is virtually a sandy desert, with only 674&amp;nbsp;palms counted by [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] during the &quot;Passion 2001&quot; French mission, and five islets in the lagoon with grass that the terrestrial crabs cannot reach.

[[File:Jielbeaumadier crabe de clipperton mjp paris 2014.jpeg|thumb|left|A bright-orange Clipperton crab (''[[Johngarthia planata]]'')]]
On the north-west side the most abundant plant species are ''[[Cenchrus echinatus]]'', ''[[Sida rhombifolia]]'', and ''[[Corchorus aestuans]]''. These plants compose a shrub cover up to 30&amp;nbsp;cm in height and are intermixed with ''[[Eclipta]]'', ''[[Phyllanthus]]'', and ''[[Solanum]]'', as well as a taller plant, ''[[Brassica juncea]]''. A unique feature is that the vegetation is arranged in parallel rows of species, with dense rows of taller species alternating with lower, more open vegetation. This was assumed to be a result of the [[phosphate]] mining method of trench-digging.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Brown booby.jpg|thumb|A [[brown booby]]]]
The only land animals known to exist are two species of reptiles (''[[Gehyra insulensis]]'', a gecko, and ''[[Emoia cyanura]],'' a skink),&lt;ref name=&quot;Zug2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Zug |first=George R. |title=Reptiles and Amphibians of the Pacific Islands: A Comprehensive Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpts77fVJ94C&amp;pg=PP45 |year=2013 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-95540-0 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; bright-orange land crabs (''[[Johngarthia planata]]'', sometimes known as the 'Clipperton Crab', although it is also found on other islands in the eastern Pacific), birds, and rats. The rats probably arrived on large fishing boats that were wrecked on the island in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitman et al. 2005&quot;/&gt; Bird species include [[white tern]]s, [[masked booby|masked boobies]], [[sooty tern]]s, [[brown booby|brown boobies]], [[brown noddy|brown noddies]], [[black noddy|black noddies]], [[greater frigatebird|great frigatebirds]], [[coot]]s, [[Swallow|martins]] (swallows), [[cuckoo]]s and [[yellow warbler]]s. [[Duck]]s have been reported in the lagoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClippertonIsland&quot;/&gt; The island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]] because of the large breeding colony of masked boobies, with 110,000&amp;nbsp;individual birds recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=BirdLife International |title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Clipperton |website=BirdLife International |year=2018 |url=http://datazone.birdlife.org/site/factsheet/clipperton-iba-french-polynesia/details |accessdate=2018-01-11 |df=dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lagoon harbors millions of [[isopod]]s, which are said to deliver an especially painful sting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Goode |url=http://www.qsl.net/clipperton2000/previous/n9ns-1992.html |title=1992 Clipperton Island Expedition |website=2000 DXpedition to Clipperton Island |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 report by the [[NOAA]]'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center indicated that the increased rat presence had led to a decline in both crab and bird populations, causing a corresponding increase in both vegetation and coconut palms. This report urgently recommended eradication of rats so that vegetation might be reduced and the island might return to its &quot;pre-human&quot; state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitman et al. 2005&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Discovery and early claims===
[[File:$1 stamp of Clipperton Island.jpg|thumb|1895 $1 stamp of Clipperton Island, issued as part of the US claim to the island]]
The island was discovered by Alvaro Saavedra Cedrón on 15 November 1528.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vargas, 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vargas |first1=Jorge A. Vargas |title=Mexico and the Law of the Sea: Contributions and Compromises |volume=69 |series=Publications on Ocean Development |date=2011 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=9789004206205 |pages=470 |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=MuN7xR6wR-4C&amp;pg=PA470&amp;lpg=PA470&amp;dq=alvaro+de+saavedra+ceron+clipperton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D4uCjwA35h&amp;sig=ACfU3U3SyHC-SIKQFi_Vya0lKLkQkLbZVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi78oPmy7_kAhW1ILcAHfo0CUgQ6AEwDXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=alvaro%20de%20saavedra%20ceron%20clipperton&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ione Stuessy Wright. Voyages of Alvaro de Saavedra Cerón 1527-1529|year=1953|publisherUniversity of Miami Press&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was commissioned by [[Hernán Cortés]], the Spanish Conquistador in Mexico, to find a route to the Philippines.

The island was rediscovered on [[Good Friday]], 3&amp;nbsp;April 1711  by Frenchmen [[Martin de Chassiron]] and [[Michel Du Bocage]], commanding the French ships ''[[La Princesse]]'' and ''[[La Découverte]]''. It was given the name ''Île de la Passion'' ({{lang-en|Passion Island}}). They drew up the first map and claimed the island for France. The first scientific expedition took place in 1725 under Frenchman [[M Bocage]], who lived on the island for several months{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. In 1858, France formally laid claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/oceania/cp.htm |title=Clipperton / Ile de la Passion |last=Pike |first=John |access-date=2018-02-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current name comes from [[John Clipperton]], an English [[pirate]] and [[privateer]] who fought the Spanish during the early 18th century, and who is said to have passed by the island. Some sources claim that he used it as a base for his raids on shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Büch, Boudewijn |title=Eilanden |language=nl |trans-title=Islands |year=2003 |location=Netherlands |publisher=Singel Pockets |isbn=978-9-04-133086-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other claimants included the United States, whose [[American Guano Mining Company]] claimed it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856; Mexico also claimed it due to activities undertaken there as early as 1848–1849. On 17&amp;nbsp;November 1858 Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon&amp;nbsp;III]] annexed it as part of the French colony of [[Tahiti]]. This did not settle the ownership question. On 24&amp;nbsp;November 1897, French naval authorities found three Americans working for the [[American Guano Company]], who had raised the [[American flag]]. U.S. authorities denounced their act, assuring the French that they did not intend to assert American sovereignty.&lt;ref name=AJIL26&gt;{{cite journal |author=Emmanuel, V. |year=1932 |url=https://www.ilsa.org/Jessup/Jessup10/basicmats/clipperton.pdf |title=Arbitral Award on the Subject of the Difference Relative to the Sovereignty over Clipperton Island |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=390–394 |jstor=2189369 |doi=10.2307/2189369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico reasserted its claim late in the 19th century, and on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1897 sent the gunboat ''[[La Demócrata]]'' to occupy and annex it. A colony was established, and a series of military governors was posted, the last one being [[Ramón Arnaud]] (1906–1916).

===Final arbitration of ownership===

France insisted on its ownership, and a lengthy diplomatic correspondence between Mexico and France led to the conclusion of a treaty on March 2, 1909, to seek binding [[international arbitration]] by King [[Victor Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;III of Italy]], with each nation promising to abide by his determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Original treaty between Mexico and France |language=fr |work=French Foreign Ministry Archives |url=https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725105321/https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/choiseul/ressource/pdf/D19090019.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-25 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dickinson, E. |date=1933 |title=The Clipperton Island Case |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=130–133 |jstor=2189797 |doi=10.2307/2189797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Victor Emanuel issued his arbitral decision in the ''Clipperton Island Case'', declaring Clipperton to be a French possession.&lt;ref name=AJIL26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=Reports of International Arbitral Awards |title=Recueil des Sentences Arbitrales |chapter=Affaire de l’île de Clipperton (Mexique contre France) |chapter-url=http://legal.un.org/riaa/cases/vol_II/1105-1111.pdf |trans-chapter=Case of Clipperton Island (Mexico v.

The French rebuilt the [[lighthouse]] and settled a military outpost, which remained for seven years before being abandoned.

===Guano mining, Mexican colony, and evacuation of 1917===
[[File:SobrevivientesClipperton.jpg|thumb|Mexican survivors from Clipperton Island, 1917]]

The [[British Pacific Island Company]] acquired the rights to guano deposits in 1906 and built a mining settlement in conjunction with the Mexican government. That same year, a lighthouse was erected under the orders of [[List of Presidents of Mexico|President]] [[Porfirio Díaz]]. By 1914 around 100 people&amp;mdash;men, women, and children&amp;mdash;were living there, resupplied every two months by a ship from [[Acapulco]]. With the escalation of fighting in the [[Mexican Revolution]], the regular resupply visits ceased and the inhabitants were left to their own devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;clippertonproject&quot;&gt;{{cite web |website=The Clipperton Project |date=2014 |access-date=2018-01-11 |url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/expeditions/clipperton-island-2012/about-clipperton-island/ |title=About Clipperton Island |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117040649/http://www.clippertonproject.com/expeditions/clipperton-island-2012/about-clipperton-island/ |archive-date=2014-01-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1917 all but one of the male inhabitants had died. Many had perished from [[scurvy]], while others (including Captain Arnaud) died during an attempt to sail after a passing ship to fetch help. Lighthouse keeper Victoriano Álvarez was the last man on the island, together with 15 women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elainejobin.com/Elsewhere/Pacific/Clipperton_2010/000.html |title=Trip Report and Photos: Clipperton Island – April 10–25, 2010 |author=Elaine Jobin |website=ElaineJobin.com |accessdate=2012-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427135659/http://elainejobin.com/Elsewhere/Pacific/Clipperton_2010/000.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-27 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Álvarez proclaimed himself &quot;king&quot; and began a campaign of rape and murder, before being killed by Tirza Rendon, who was the recipient of his unwanted attention. Almost immediately after Álvarez's death four women and seven children, the last survivors, were picked up by the US Navy gunship {{USS|Yorktown|PG-1|2}} on 18 July 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;clippertonproject&quot; /&gt; No more attempts were made to colonize it, though it was briefly occupied during the 1930s and 1940s.

The story of the Mexican colony has been the subject of several novels, including [[Ivo Mansmann]]'s ''Clipperton, Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel'' (&quot;Clipperton, Destinies on a Forgotten Island&quot;) in German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansmann |first=Ivo |title=Clipperton: Schicksale auf einer vergessenen Insel: Roman |language=de |trans-title=Clipperton: Destinies on a forgotten island: A novel |year=1990 |publisher=Mitteldeutscher Verlag |location=Halle |isbn=978-3-35-400709-3|oclc=31495383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombian writer [[Laura Restrepo]]'s ''La Isla de la Pasión'' (&quot;Passion Island&quot;) in Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Restrepo |first=Laura |title=La Isla de la Pasión |language=es |trans-title=Passion Island |year=1989 |publisher=Planeta |location=Bogotá, Colombia |isbn=978-0-06-081620-9 |oclc=21335043 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/laisladelapasiac00rest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ana Garcia Bergua]]'s ''Isla de Bobos'' (&quot;Island of Fools&quot;), also in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergua |first=Ana Garcia |title=Isla de Bobos |language=es |trans-title=Booby Island |year=2007 |publisher=Planeta Editorial |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-9-70-749064-2 |oclc=180756453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II developments===
The island was abandoned by the end of World War&amp;nbsp;II after being briefly occupied by the US from 1944–1945. Since then it has been visited by sports fishermen, patrols of the French Navy, and by Mexican tuna and shark fishermen. There have been infrequent scientific and amateur radio expeditions, and in 1978 [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] visited with his team of divers and a survivor from the 1917 evacuation to film a [[television]] special called ''Clipperton: The Island that Time Forgot.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Simon Rogerson |url=http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&amp;v=5&amp;sp=332382698484330872538 |title=Cousteau and the Pit |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415195236/http://www.divemagazine.co.uk/news/article.asp?UAN=2934&amp;v=5&amp;sp=332382698484330872538 |archive-date=2009-04-15 |magazine=Dive magazine |date=July 19, 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was visited by ornithologist [[Kenneth E. Stager|Ken Stager]] of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles County Museum]] in 1958. Appalled at the depredations visited by feral pigs upon the island's [[brown booby]] and [[masked booby]] colonies (reduced to 500 and 150&amp;nbsp;birds, respectively), Stager procured a [[shotgun]] and killed all 58&amp;nbsp;pigs. By 2003, the booby colonies had 25,000&amp;nbsp;brown boobies and 112,000&amp;nbsp;masked boobies, the world's second-largest brown booby colony and its largest masked booby colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitman et al. 2005&quot;/&gt;

When the [[independence of Algeria]] in 1962 threatened [[French nuclear testing]] sites in Algeria, the French Ministry of Defense thusly considered Clipperton Island as a possible replacement. This was eventually ruled out due to the island's hostile climate and remote location. The French explored reopening the lagoon and developing a harbor for trade and tourism during the 1970s, but this too was abandoned. An automatic weather installation was completed on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1980, with data collected by this station transmitted directly by satellite to [[Brittany]].

In 1981, the [[Academy of Sciences for Overseas Territories]] recommended that the island have its own economic infrastructure, with an airstrip and a fishing port in the [[lagoon]]. This would mean opening up the lagoon by creating a passage in the atoll rim. For this purpose, an agreement was signed with the French government, represented by the High Commissioner for French Polynesia, whereby the island became French state property. In 1986 a meeting took place regarding the establishment of a permanent base for fishing, between the High Commissioner and the survey firm for the development and exploitation of the island (SEDEIC). Taking into account the economic constraints, the distance from markets, and the small size of the atoll, nothing apart from preliminary studies was undertaken. All plans for development were abandoned.

===Castaways===
In early 1962 the island provided a home to nine crewmen of the sunken tuna clipper MV ''Monarch'', stranded for 23 days from 6 February to 1 March. They reported that the lagoon water was drinkable, though they preferred to drink water from the coconuts they found. Unable to use any of the dilapidated buildings, they constructed a crude shelter from cement bags and tin salvaged from [[Quonset hut]]s built by the American military 20 years earlier. Wood from the huts was used for firewood, and fish caught off the fringing reef combined with some potatoes and onions they had saved from their sinking vessel augmented the island's meager supply of coconuts. The crewmen reported that they tried eating bird's eggs, but found them to be rancid, and they decided after trying to cook a &quot;little black bird&quot; that it did not have enough meat to make the effort worthwhile. Pigs had been eradicated, though the crewmen reported seeing their skeletons around the atoll. The crewmen were eventually discovered by another fishing boat and rescued by the United States Navy destroyer [[USS Robison (DDG-12)|USS ''Robison'']].&lt;ref name=No94/&gt;

In 1988, five Mexican fishermen became lost at sea after a storm during their trip along the coast of [[Costa Rica]]. They drifted within sight of the island but were unable to reach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Arias, Ron |title=Five against the sea: A true story of courage and survival |date=1990 |publisher=Viking |isbn=978-0-67-083092-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Longbaugh and David Heritage, two American deckhands from a [[fishing boat]] based in [[California]], were stranded for three weeks in 1998. They were rescued after rebuilding a survival radio and using distress flares to signal for help.&lt;ref&gt;LaJoie, John. ''American Maritime Accident Report'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn |date=January 2018}}

===21st century===
[[File:Clipperton Waves.jpg|thumb|Surf on Clipperton Island]]

The Mexican and French oceanographic expedition SURPACLIP (UNAM Mexico and UNC Nouméa) made extensive studies in 1997. In 2001, French geographer [[Christian Jost (geographer)|Christian Jost]] extended the 1997 studies through his French &quot;Passion 2001&quot; expedition, explaining the evolution of the ecosystem, and releasing several papers, a video film, and a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=C. Jost |date=2014 |url=http://clipperton.fr |title=Bienvenue sur l'île de La Passion ... Clipperton! |language=fr |trans-title=Welcome to Passion Island ... Clipperton! |access-date=2018-01-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Lance Milbrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Milbrand Cinema |url=http://www.milbrandcinema.com/ |title=Lance Milbrand |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; stayed for 41&amp;nbsp;days on a [[National Geographic Society]] expedition, recording his adventure in video, photos, and a written diary (see links below).

In 2005, the [[ecosystem]] was extensively studied for four months by a scientific mission organized by Jean-Louis Étienne, which made a complete inventory of mineral, plant, and animal species, studied algae as deep as 100&amp;nbsp;m (330&amp;nbsp;ft) below sea level, and examined the effects of pollution. A 2008 expedition from the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography collected sediment cores from the lagoon to study climate change over the last millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Dan |last1=Nelson |first2=Julian |last2=Sachs |date=April 2, 2008 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/jsachs/lab/www/Research/Clipperton_2008/Clipperton_2008.html |title=Clipperton Atoll Expedition – 2008 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21&amp;nbsp;February 2007, administration was transferred from the [[High Commissioner]] of the Republic in [[French Polynesia]] to the Minister of Overseas France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Cahoon |website=World Statesmen.org |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Fr_minor.html |title=French Minor Dependencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a recreational scuba diving expedition explored the reefs surrounding Clipperton and compared the marine life with the reports of the Connie Limbaugh (Scripps) expeditions in 1956 and 1958. Recreational scuba diving expeditions are now made every spring.

During the night of 10&amp;nbsp;February 2010, the ''Sichem Osprey'', a [[Malta|Maltese]] [[chemical tanker]], ran aground on its way from the [[Panama Canal]] to [[South Korea]]. The {{convert|170|m|adj=on|sp=us}} ship contained [[xylene]], a clear, flammable volatile liquid. All 19&amp;nbsp;crew members were reported safe, and the vessel reported no leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diver.net/bbs/posts002/81342.shtml |title=Re: Probe into Sichem Osprey grounding |website=Diver.net |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Xylene Tanker Runs Aground on Clipperton Island |url=http://reeftools.com/news/xylene-tanker-runs-aground-on-clipperton-island/ |website=Reeftools |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel was refloated on 6&amp;nbsp;March&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL105629/Eitzen-tanker-Sichem-Osprey-refloated |title=Eitzen tanker Sichem Osprey refloated |publisher=Lloydslist.com |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214709/https://lloydslist.maritimeintelligence.informa.com/LL105629/Eitzen-tanker-Sichem-Osprey-refloated |archive-date=2018-01-12 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/shipdetails.aspx?MMSI=249534000 |title=Sichem Osprey |website=MarineTraffic |date=2012-06-13 |accessdate=2012-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-March 2012, the crew from The Clipperton Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |website=The Clipperton Project |date=2012-03-12 |title=Plastic Surveying and Collection |accessdate=2012-06-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502053953/http://www.clippertonproject.com/plastic-surveying-and-collection/ |archive-date=2012-05-02 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted the widespread presence of refuse, particularly on the northeast shore and around the Rock. Debris including plastic bottles and containers create a potentially harmful environment to its flora and fauna. This trash is common to only two beaches (North East and South West) and the rest of the island is fairly clean. Other refuse has been left over after the occupation by the Americans in 1944–1945, the French in 1966–1969 and the 2008 scientific expedition.

===Amateur radio DX-peditions===
The island has long been an attractive destination for amateur radio groups, due to its remoteness, the difficulty of landing, permit requirements, garish history, and interesting environment. While some radio operation was done ancillary to other expeditions, major DX-peditions include FO0XB (1978), FO0XX (1985), FO0CI (1992), FO0AAA (2000), and TX5C (2008).

One [[DX-pedition]] was the Cordell Expedition in March&amp;nbsp;2013 using the callsign TX5K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tx5k.org |title=Clipperton Island |series=The 2013 Cordell Expedition |website=TX5K.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized and led by [[Robert Schmieder]]. The project combined radio operations with selected scientific investigations. The team of 24&amp;nbsp;radio operators made more than 114,000&amp;nbsp;contacts, breaking the previous record of 75,000. The activity included extensive operation at 6&amp;nbsp;meters, including EME ([[Earth–Moon–Earth communication]] or 'moonbounce') contacts. A notable accomplishment was the use of DXA, a real-time satellite-based online graphic radio log web page that allowed anyone anywhere with a browser to see the radio activity. Scientific work carried out during the expedition included the first collection and identification of [[foraminifera]], and extensive aerial imaging of the island using kite-borne cameras. The team included two scientists from the French-Polynesian [[University of Tahiti]] and a TV crew from the French documentary television series [[Thalassa (TV series)|Thalassa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cordell.org/CI/CI_Documents/TX5K_Project_Report_1.0.pdf |title=Report of the Expedition Leader |series=The 2013 Cordell Expedition to Clipperton Island |first=Robert W. |last=Schmieder |website=cordell.org |date=15 June 2013 |access-date=2018-01-11 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April&amp;nbsp;2015 DX-pedition using callsign TX5P was conducted by Alain Duchauchoy, F6BFH, concurrent with the Passion 2015 scientific expedition to Clipperton Island, and engaging in research of Mexican use of the island during the early 1900s.
