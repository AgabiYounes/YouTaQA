The '''Republic of Croatia Armed Forces''' ({{lang-hr|Oružane snage Republike Hrvatske}} – OSRH) is the military service of [[Croatia]]. 

The [[President of Croatia|President]] is the Armed Forces [[Commander-in-Chief]], and exercises administrative powers in times of war by giving orders to the chief of staff, while administration and defence policy execution in peacetime is carried out by the [[Government of Croatia|Government]] through the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Ministry of Defence]]. This unified institution consists of land, sea, and air branches referred to as:

* [[Croatian Army]] (''Hrvatska kopnena vojska'' - ''HKoV'')
* [[Croatian Navy]] (''Hrvatska ratna mornarica'' - ''HRM'')
* [[Croatian Air Force]] (''Hrvatsko ratno zrakoplovstvo'' - ''HRZ'' )

The Croatian Armed Forces are charged with protecting the Republic as well as supporting international [[peacekeeping]] efforts, when mandated by the [[NATO]], [[United Nations]] and/or [[European Union]].

The Army has 650 [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]], around 150 pieces of [[artillery]], 100 [[Multiple rocket launcher|MLRSs]], around 70 tanks, and 20 [[Self-propelled gun|SPGs]]. The Air Force has 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] jet fighters, 10 combat-transport [[Mil Mi-17|Mi-171]] and 16 [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58]] attack helicopters. The Navy has 29 ships, out of which five 60-80 metre fast attack craft are used in offensive capabilities.

==Strength==
The total number of active military personnel in the Croatian Armed Forces stands at 14,506 and 6,000 reserves working in various service branches of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe&quot;&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/04597222.2011.559835&quot;Military Balance in Europe 2011&quot;.], March 07, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Armed Forces had 16,019 members, of which 14,506 were active military personnel and 1,513 civil servants. Of the 14,506 active military personnel, 3,183 were officers, 5,389 non-commissioned officers, 5,393 soldiers, 520 military specialists, 337 civil servants and 1,176 other employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Total available male manpower aged 16–49 numbers 1,035,712, of which 771,323 are technically fit for military service. Male citizens are now no longer subject to [[compulsory military service]] since January 1, 2008. However, the last generation of 2007 [[Soldier|servicemen]] was also absolved of compulsory service by an act from then Minister of Defence [[Berislav Rončević]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/39029 |title=Nema više obveznog vojnog roka |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]] |language=Croatian |trans-title=Compulsory military service abolished |author=Martina Čizmić |date=19 October 2007 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |archivedate=17 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717004234/http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/39029/nema-vise-obveznog-vojnog-roka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Budget==
The Croatian [[military budget]] for the past 6–7 years was kept below 2% of GDP, a vast difference from the 1990s when defence expenditure represented a major stake in Croatian budgetary expenditure due to the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. For example, 1995 Croatian defence budget stood at 12.4 billion [[Croatian Kuna]] or just over 10% of GDP, which was also the highest defence expenditure rate ever. In late 2019, Croatian Government issued revised defence expenditure which will see country increase defence expenditure to meet 2% NATO target by 2020, with 2019 and 2020 defence budgets seeing immediate revisions and increases to meet new spending plan. Defence expenditure in 2024 therefore based on current projections could reach 9.4 billion kuna or around 2% NATO requirement.

Although the budget has been decreased from year to year, the Croatian Armed Forces were able to maintain military readiness and to participate in major NATO exercises in Croatia and overseas. This downsizing of the armed forces has allowed for more funds to be allocated to modernisation over the past few years with an average of 1.6 billion kuna spent on modernisation, infrastructure and construction of new facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrvatski-vojnik.hr&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/Hrv_pages/plannabave.asp |title=PREDSTAVLJEN PLAN JAVNE NABAVE MORH-a ZA IDUĆU GODINU |issue=434 |magazine=[[Hrvatski vojnik]] |accessdate=2013-11-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131127153012/http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/Hrv_pages/plannabave.asp |archivedate=2013-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hrvatska radiotelevizija&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=vijesti-clanak&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=225542&amp;cHash=f515b515a6|title=HRT: MORH predstavio ostvarenje plana nabave za 2013. i plan za 2014.|date=6 November 2013|work=Hrvatska radiotelevizija|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A $3 billion modernisation plan was proposed by the then Prime Minister [[Ivica Račan]] of the SDP led government in 2003, with planned modernisation starting in 2006 and ending in 2015. However it has been delayed in part due to the subsequent economic recession, but also due to serious corruption that has cost the Croatian MOD several billion kuna since 2006. A new plan under former Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanović]] should define exactly how and what the Croatian armed forces should look like by 2023. A defence white paper was published in 2015 with emphasis placed on modernisation of the Army.

==Dr. Franjo Tuđman Military Academy==

The [[Franjo Tuđman|Dr. Franjo Tuđman]] Military Academy acts as a school of higher learning responsible for training and educating future generations of military personnel. 
The academy consists of several schools including &quot;[[Josip Jelačić|Ban Josip Jelačić]]&quot;, &quot;[[Blago Zadro]]&quot;, &quot;[[Katarina Zrinska]]&quot;, the Officers Academy, and a school for non commissioned officers. The academy has 300 full-time staff and is the only military academy in Croatia. Each year also 100–120 foreign nationals attend the academy.

==Commander==
The [[Commander-in-Chief]] of all Croatian armed forces in peace and war is the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]]. The Commander-in-Chief prescribes the organisation of the Croatian Armed Forces at the proposal of the Chief of General Staff, with consent of the Minister of Defence.

The Armed Forces consist of peacetime and wartime components. The peacetime component is composed of the active military [[officer (military)|officers]], [[civil servant]]s and employees in the Croatian Armed Forces, cadets, and [[conscription|conscripts]] serving a 6-month national service and reservists when on military exercise. The wartime component of the Armed Forces includes all other reservists.

[[Croatian General Staff|The General Staff]] is part of the [[Ministry of Defence (Croatia)|Ministry of Defence]] in charge of commanding, training and use of the Armed Forces. It also has a number of units under its direct command, including the [[Special Operations Battalion (Croatia)|Special Operations Battalion]], [[Honor Guard Battalion|Honour Guard Battalion]] and several others.

In peace, the Commander-in-Chief exercises his command through the Minister of Defence. In war and in cases where the Minister of Defence is not fulfilling his orders, the Commander-in-Chief exercises his command directly through the General Staff Commander.

The [[Croatian Parliament]] exercises democratic control over the Armed Forces by adopting defence strategy, defence budget, and defence laws.

==Special Forces Command==

[[Special Operations Command (Croatia)|Special Forces Command]] (''Zapovjedništvo specijalnih snaga'', ''ZSS'') was established in February 2015, succeeding the [[Special Operations Battalion (Croatia)]], in accordance with the Long-term Development Plan of the Croatian Armed Forces in the period 2015–2024. The command staff is composed of the members who served in the special units, guards brigades and reconnaissance units of the Croatian Armed Forces. The main mission of the Special Forces Command is to ensure combat readiness of the special forces in the protection of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Croatia, as well as for the participation in NATO-led operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morh.hr/en/news/press-releases/12486-minister-buljevi%C4%87-visits-croatian-army-and-special-operations-command.html |title=Minister Buljević visits Croatian Army and Special Operations Command - Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Croatia |publisher=Morh.hr |date=2016-12-09 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.morh.hr/en/news/12095-special-forces-command-marks-1st-anniversary.html |title=Special Forces Command marks 1st Anniversary - Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Croatia |publisher=Morh.hr |date=2015-09-28 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Perica Turalija is the current commanding officer of the command.

The [[Croatian General Staff]] exercises direct command over the battalion which thus elevates the unit to strategic level deployment for quicker reaction and overall better and faster response to tactical and strategic situations. Also, this means that members of all three branches of the Croatian armed forces can apply for selection.

Other special operations units are the [[Military Intelligence Battalion (Croatia)|Military Intelligence Battalion]] (''Vojno-obavještajna bojna'', ''VOB'') and Special [[Military Police]] Company (''Satnija specijalne vojne policije'', ''SS VP'').

The duties of an Honour Guard are performed by the [[Honor Guard Battalion (Croatia)|Honor Guard Battalion]] (''Počasno zaštitna bojna''), located at [[Zagreb]] in the Tuškanac military base.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morh.hr/katalog/documents/dpr_final.pdf |title=Request Rejected |publisher=Morh.hr |accessdate=2016-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306115903/http://www.morh.hr/katalog/documents/dpr_final.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
A long term modernisation plan for 2015–2024 has been published outlining overall goals and is available for download (102 pages) at the Ministry of Defence of Croatia website. According to earlier reports from the government, the Croatian Armed Forces are set to receive vitally needed new equipment.

===Army===

* Modernisation of [[M-84]]A and [[M-84|M-84A4 Snajper]] MBTs and upgrade to [[M-84D]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/february_2018_global_defense_security_army_news_industry/croatia_plans_to_upgrade_its_m-84_main_battle_tanks_fleet.html|website=www.armyrecognition.com|access-date=2018-12-23|title=Croatia plans to upgrade its M-84 Main Battle Tanks' fleet &amp;#124; February 2018 Global Defense Security army news industry &amp;#124; Defense Security global news industry army 2018 &amp;#124; Archive News year}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is at a standstill and is unlikely to receive further funding due to high costs involved of nearly 20 million kuna per tank, but overhaul of existing fleet might be completed by the end of 2017 at cost of 120 million kuna (24 vehicles already overhauled at cost of 60 million kuna).
*The [[Croatian Army]] is looking at replacing 128 [[BVP M-80|M80A IFV]] in its inventory, Croatian Army requires 108 Vehicles, 88 Infantry combat vehicles, 4 Driver training vehicles, 8 Armoured Ambulance vehicles and 8 command vehicles. It's announced that [[M2 Bradley]] in M2A2 ODS variant was chosen, 60 + 24 vehicles for spare parts will be delivered in 2020 as a donation from United States and modernised in Croatia by [[BAE Systems]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/foto-video-uskoro-stizu-oklopna-vozila-koja-ce-povecati-vatrenu-moc-hv-a-krsticevic-otkrio-amerikanci-nam-salju-84-bradleyja/9673192/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Talks are being held with US and German governments on possible purchase of [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|M270]] Multiple Launch Rocket System,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armyrecognition.com/january_2016_global_defense_security_news_industry/croatia_has_asked_united_states_to_donate_16_m270_multiple_launch_rocket_systems_from_us_surplus_11201162.html|website=www.armyrecognition.com|access-date=2018-12-23|title=Croatia has asked United States to donate 16 M270 Multiple launch Rocket Systems from US surplus 11201162 &amp;#124; January 2016 Global Defense Security news industry &amp;#124; Defense Security global news industry army 2016 &amp;#124; Archive News year}}&lt;/ref&gt; Croatian requirements call for initially 8 systems to form a two battery teams at independent Artillery regiment, with potential for further 16 systems to equip 2 active brigades for total of 24 systems + simulators and training aids. Number of systems Croatian Army might purchase will solely depend on price of the entire purchase and delivery dates, Croatian Defence budget has set aside some 200 million kuna or $32 million for this programme, although it is likely said systems might be donated by the US for symbolic price in turn Croatian MOD paying only VAT.
*The initial order of 8 [[Elbit Systems|Elbit]] UT30Mk2 CRO unmanned turrets for [[Patria AMV]], armed with 30mm gun and [[Spike (ATGM)|Spike]] launchers in 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defensenews.com/land/2017/08/25/rafael-to-benefit-from-elbit-win-in-croatia-weapons-tender/|title=Rafael to benefit from Elbit win in Croatia weapons tender|last=Adamowski|first=Jaroslaw|date=2017-08-25|website=Defense News|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; value of the contract: $14.9 million.
*Scores of smaller programmes, communication equipment, night vision capability, electronic sensors, NBC equipment, battlefield management systems and modernisation of artillery systems with new sights and electronic fire control systems are planned.
*Procurement of advanced short to medium range [[NATO]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] system. As of now no real funding has been mentioned other than the statement that this project is a priority and current requirements call for one battery. Estimated value – $50–70 million for new system. Alternately a second-hand system might be obtained as a donation by the United States, in which case only the VAT cost will be incurred.
* Procurement of short range SAM systems – no indication of what system or specifications other than a requirement for a range of up to 10&amp;nbsp;km. Intent is for up to 3 batteries with one battery being ready by 2015/6. Total funding for this programme has not been made public yet, but similar western systems tend to be in range of $17–20 million per battery.

===Air Force===

* Croatia has a requirement for a small number of fighter aircraft (6-12) to replace the MiG-21. A plan to acquire ex-Israeli F-16C/Ds was cancelled in January 2019 after the United States refused to allow Israel to sell the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://hr.n1info.com/English/NEWS/a361583/Israel-Croatia-F-16-deal-officially-pronounced-dead.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian interdepartmental commission for the procurement of multi-purpose combat aircraft has sent requests for proposals (RFP) for two new fighter types (F-16 Block 70/72 and JAS-39C/D) and five second hand fighters types (F-16AM/BM, F-16C/D, F-16 Barak, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale). Croatia’s government said it expects to receive the new offers by May and make the decision by August 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/zahtjev-za-ponudu-vba-upucen-je-prema-sedam-drzava/28562|title=Vlada Republike Hrvatske - Zahtjev za ponudu VBA upućen je prema sedam država|website=vlada.gov.hr|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Purchase of up to 10–12 transport helicopters (after 2020) – replacing older [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]]. With the Government indicating that purchase of 10 new helicopters might be the only option after 2020. Most likely candidate is the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60M]] since the United States donated two new helicopters&lt;ref&gt;https://www.janes.com/article/83844/us-donates-uh-60m-helicopters-to-croatia&lt;/ref&gt; and Croatia decided to purchase additional two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.janes.com/article/92278/croatia-cleared-to-buy-black-hawks|title=Croatia cleared to buy Black Hawks {{!}} Jane's 360|website=www.janes.com|access-date=2020-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programme cost: 2.5 billion kuna.

===Navy===
Navy plans are still being worked on but present plans call for a moderate expansion of the naval force.

* 5 new [[patrol boat]]s, locally built, 42 metres in length. Cost of programme 750 million kuna, or 375 million for first 5 ships, first to enter service in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://navaltoday.com/2018/12/07/croatia-takes-delivery-of-first-locally-built-inshore-patrol-vessel-omis/|title=Croatia takes delivery of first locally-built inshore patrol vessel 'Omiš'|website=Naval Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2 new [[corvettes]] – 80–125 metres in length. Cost of programme 3.0 billion kuna. Programme is at standstill due to lack of funds, feasible only after 2020. 
* Overhaul of existing 2 [[Kralj-class missile boat|''Kralj'' class]] [[fast attack craft]]s, including new engines. Cost of programme – 40 million kuna.
* Overhaul of sea radar Falcon 2 Enhanced Peregrine – programme is being financed by US government at estimated cost of $8 million.
* Possible purchase of 2nd minesweeper before 2020; although there are only indications that this might happen if funds can be allocated. Programme cost – 80 million kuna.

==Arms exports==

As a small country, Croatia has a relatively well developed arms industry that is highly competitive internationally with significant annual arms exports. In 2012, Croatia managed to export nearly €120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Hrvatska-medu-25-najvecih-izvoznika-vojne-opreme-na-svijetu-lanjski-izvoz-880-milijuna-kuna |title=Hrvatska među 25 najvećih izvoznika vojne opreme na svijetu: lanjski izvoz 880 milijuna kuna / Novi list |publisher=Novilist.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it has been reported in [[The New York Times]] that [[Croatia]] has been arming Syrian rebels with Croatian manufactured arms used during the [[Croatian War of Independence|Homeland War]], arms Croatia no longer uses due to their obsolescence. Nevertheless, these arms played a crucial role in some significant rebel gains during 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/middleeast/in-shift-saudis-are-said-to-arm-rebels-in-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=In Shift, Saudis Are Said to Arm Rebels in Syria|author=C. J. CHIVERS;ERIC SCHMITT|date=25 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By C. J. CHIVERS and ERIC SCHMITTFEB. 25, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/world/middleeast/in-shift-saudis-are-said-to-arm-rebels-in-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=In Shift, Saudis Are Said to Arm Rebels in Syria - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these arms sales into this volatile region the Croatian government ordered the immediate withdrawal of the Croatian [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force|UN Golan Heights]] contingent to avoid their being targeted in retaliation.

In 2013 Croatia exported €143 million worth of arms,&lt;ref&gt;http://bosnian.irib.ir/vijesti/bih-i-region/item/160013-hrvatski-izvoz-oružja-blizu-143-miliona-eura&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/39039/croatian-military-output-approaches-usd1-billion|title=Croatian military output approaches USD1 billion|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is not clear if this also includes $36.5 million worth of arms Croatia exported to Jordan for Syrian rebels. Croatia was the top supplier of arms to Syrian rebels in 2013, but much of it through illicit channels without Croatian government approval or knowledge. Most of these arms were exported via Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Hrvatska-trgovala-preko-Jordana-Siriji-prodano-oruzje-vrijedno-200-milijuna-kuna|title=Hrvatska trgovala preko Jordana: Siriji prodano oružje vrijedno 200 milijuna kuna|work=Novi list online portal|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Croatian arms exports reached 1.5 bn HRK ([[Croatian kuna]]) or €200 million or $257 million, the majority of exports being to NATO allies and Australia. In late 2014 the Croatian Defence Minister announced a major export deal to Iraq including the State of Kurdistan. This agreement includes the sale of 20,000 VHS Rifles, 150,000 complete sets of uniforms, helmets and associated equipment valued at €100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Novosti/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/273055/Default.aspx |title=Kotromanović: Lani izvezeno 25 posto više vojne opreme i oružja &gt; Slobodna Dalmacija |publisher=Slobodnadalmacija.hr |date=2015-01-30 |accessdate=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Croatian arms exports are growing steadily at 10–15% year-on-year and were expected to reach 1.75 billion HRK in 2015 or around €230 million, although much of the equipment exported is non-lethal. Croatian firms are well positioned on some major arms tenders in the Middle East, supplying complex military hardware such as the Patria AMV incorporating a newly developed 30mm overhead weapon station (valued at €1.25 million each) and said vehicles valued at €1.75 million. Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia have been mentioned as potential customers, although no concrete contracts have been signed so far. Croatian firms are participating in Kuwaiti and UAE tenders for next-generation APC programmes, each valued at billions of euros.

Croatian arms exports have grown steadily for the better part of this decade and have reached €325 million per year, placing Croatia in the top 10 arms exporters within NATO, behind the US, Germany, UK, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Poland and Norway. The vast majority of these exports are to NATO partners such as the US, Norway, Australia, Canada, France. Croatia granted €5.75 billion in export licenses in 2016 and 2017; however, only a fraction of this sum has materialised in actual arms exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/vojna-industrija-izvoz-oruzje-1230353|title=Izvezli oružja za 200 mil. eura, SAD ostaje najveći kupac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International cooperation==
On April 1, 2009 [[Croatia]] joined [[NATO]] and on July 1, 2013 it became the 28th member of the [[European Union]]. The Croatian Armed Forces participate in many of the ([[military]]) aspects of both organisations as well as actively participating in many [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]] operations worldwide.
