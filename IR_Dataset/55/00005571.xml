The '''Republican Forces of Côte d'Ivoire''' ({{lang-fr|Forces Republicaines de Cote d'Ivoire}}; &quot;FRCI&quot;) is the current name of the [[armed forces]] of [[Ivory Coast]].

== History ==
The Ivorian military has its roots in the colonial armed forces of [[French West Africa]], which were headquartered in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] but possessed bases in several distinct military regions. Most Ivorian recruits who joined the colonial army were assigned to Senegalese units during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Cote d'Ivoire, a Country Study | edition = Third | editor-last = Handloff | editor-first = Robert | year = 1988 | publisher = Department of the Army, [[American University]] | location = Washington, D.C. | series = Area Handbook Series | isbn = 978-0160309786 | pages = 184–201}}&lt;/ref&gt; They served with distinction during both world wars, with 20,000 Ivorian soldiers fighting for the French during [[World War I]] and another 30,000 during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; In 1950, the French government began the process of setting up a specific defence force for the colony, consisting of four infantry companies and a light armoured unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;

The Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August 1960. In April 1961, the new government signed the Franco-Ivorian Technical Military Assistance Accord with France, which compelled the latter to assist with the formation of a new national military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; It also authorised the continued presence of French troops based in [[Port-Bouët]], and permitted the government to call on French military assistance in the event of external aggression or major internal unrest.&lt;ref name=Charbonneau&gt;{{cite book|last=Charbonneau|first=Bruno|title=France and the New Imperialism: Security Policy in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2008|pages=60–61|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-0754672852}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1962, the fledgling Ivorian armed forces had expanded rapidly into 5,000 soldiers attached to four battalions. Most of the initial recruits were drawn from the defunct colonial military establishment and had served in various French units, particularly the marine regiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; They were armed with old equipment donated by France, including two [[Max Holste Broussard]] monoplanes, a single [[Douglas DC-3]] cargo aircraft, fifteen [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars, and even a [[SC-497-class submarine chaser]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php |title=Trade Registers |publisher=Armstrade.sipri.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription was instituted, although the large number of volunteers and low manpower requirements ensured it was only applied selectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; Some of the senior positions in the officer corps and Ministry of Defence continued to be held by French nationals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;

Since the Ivory Coast could ill afford to divert funds from its economic development programmes into the armed forces, and was already dependent on France for its external defence, the military establishment remained quite modest from 1961 to 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; Defence spending spiralled upwards between 1974 and 1987, and the number of personnel serving with the armed forces increased to 14,920 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; During this period, the air force and navy embarked on a significant modernisation campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;trade&quot;/&gt; An international merchant marine training academy was built in Abidjan and trained personnel from several [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;

In 1997, a collapse in civil-military relations became evident when President [[Henri Konan Bédié]] dismissed popular general [[Robert Guéï]] on suspicion of disloyalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;N'Diaye&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=N'Diaye|first=Boubacar|title=The Challenge of Institutionalizing Civilian Control: Botswana, Ivory Coast, and Kenya in comparative perspective|date=1997|pages=159–161|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0739102398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, an army mutiny led by disgruntled recruits and junior officers escalated into a major [[1999 Ivorian coup d'état|coup d'état]] which ousted Bédié and installed Guéï in his place.&lt;ref name=&quot;N'Diaye&quot;/&gt; Guéï subsequently stood for office during a subsequent [[Ivorian presidential election, 2000|presidential election]], although he attempted to annul the election results when [[Laurent Gbagbo]] secured the popular vote.&lt;ref name=Ayittey&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayittey|first=George|title=Africa Unchained: The Blueprint for Africa's Future|url=https://archive.org/details/africaunchainedb00ayit|url-access=registration|date=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/africaunchainedb00ayit/page/444 444–445]|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1403973863}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triggered a civil revolt in Abidjan and two days of street battles between Gbagbo supporters and soldiers loyal to Guéï.&lt;ref name=Ayittey/&gt; Most of the armed forces remained neutral until the third day, when the army's elite units and the gendarmerie announced they would recognise Gbagbo as president of the republic.&lt;ref name=Ayittey/&gt; Guéï conceded defeat, going into exile on October 29, 2000.&lt;ref name=Ayittey/&gt;

In September 2002, the Ivory Coast endured a second army mutiny, this time by 750 Muslim soldiers who seized [[Bouaké]], citing religious discrimination and grievances against the predominantly Christian government.&lt;ref name=Economics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brauer|first1=Jurgen|last2=Goldsmith|first2=Benjamin|title=Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives|date=2010|pages=81–82|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|location=Bingley|isbn=978-0857240040}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mutineers later took control of most of the northern administrative regions, carrying out a brutal campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] and plunging the country into [[First Ivorian Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rimanelli|first=Marco|title=Historical Dictionary of NATO and Other International Security Organizations|date=2008|pages=617–618|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0810853294}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a number of years, troops dispatched by France, ECOWAS, and a [[United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire]] (ONUCI) effort enforced a buffer zone between the south and the rebel-held north.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:FNCI.JPG|thumb|right| General [[Soumaila Bakayoko]], Chief of Staff of the Army, conducts a review of his troops in [[Odienné]]]]
President Gbagbo repeatedly demanded France assist him in crushing the rebel forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Besada&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Besada|first=Hany|title=From Civil Strife to Peace Building: Examining Private Sector Involvement in West African Reconstruction|date=2009|page=75|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, Ontario|isbn=978-1554580521}}&lt;/ref&gt; France maintained it would not take sides in the civil war, but allowed Ivorian military aircraft to cross the buffer zone and attack rebel positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Besada&quot;/&gt; In November 2004, an Ivorian pilot targeted a French base during an air strike on Bouaké, killing nine French soldiers. The French retaliated by launching a follow-up operation to destroy the Ivorian Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Besada&quot;/&gt;

In March 2011, a rebel coalition, the ''[[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire]]'', launched a renewed offensive on the south with French support, sparking a [[Second Ivorian Civil War|second civil war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amoah&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Nationalism, Globalization, and Africa|last=Amoah|first=Michael|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-00216-7|location=Basingstoke|pages=94–95|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ivorian army was quickly overwhelmed, and Gbagbo deposed by the rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amoah&quot;/&gt; The ''Forces Nouvelles'' established a new national military, known as the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast (FRCI).&lt;ref name=&quot;Amoah&quot;/&gt;

Integration problems arising from the incorporation of various rebel factions into the FRCI, as well as former Gbagbo loyalists, continue to persist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutiny2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ivory Coast minister freed after troops mutiny deal|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;

The crisis ended when the Ivorian political leadership agreed to a new financial settlement with the FRCI.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutiny2017&quot;/&gt; [[2017 Ivory Coast mutiny|A second mutiny]] occurred on January 7, 2017, with troops in Bouaké demanding higher salaries and improved living conditions; this resulted in a second financial settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutiny2017&quot;/&gt;

The Ivorian army had three infantry battalions, an armoured battalion, an artillery battery, and seven specialist companies in 1993.&lt;ref name=WDA1993&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Bonsignore|editor-first=Ezio|title=World Defence Almanac 1992-93: The Balance of Military Power|date=1993|pages=169–170|publisher=Monch Publishing Group|location=Bonn|issn=0722-3226}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effective strength of the army was about 3,000 troops for the first ten years of Ivorian independence, increasing to over 8,000 in the mid-1980s before declining steadily to about 5,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; It has always remained the largest branch of the armed forces.&lt;ref name=Cultures&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheehan|first1=Patricia|last2=Ong|first2=Jacqueline|title=Cultures of the world: Côte D'Ivoire|date=2010|pages=34–35|publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-0761448549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the army was responsible for the country's five military regions, each of which was supervised by a colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; The First Military Region controlled the concentration of forces in and around [[Abidjan]], its principal units there being a rapid intervention [[battalion]] (airborne), an [[infantry]] battalion, an armored battalion, and an air defense [[artillery]] battalion. The Second Military Region was located in [[Daloa]] and comprised one infantry battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; The Third Military Region was headquartered in [[Bouaké]] and was home to an artillery, an infantry, and an engineer battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; The Fourth Military Region maintained only a Territorial Defense Company headquartered in [[Korhogo]] The Fifth Military Region was formerly known as the Western Operational Zone, a temporary command created to respond to the security threat caused by the [[First Liberian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;

By 2010, the system of military regions had been abolished.&lt;ref name=Cultures/&gt;

As of July 2011, General Soumaïla Bakayoko is the chief of staff of the army, and colonel-major Gervais Kouakou Kouassi is the Chief of the Gendarmerie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abidjan.net/h/409489.html news.abidjan.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2011, previously active units around Abidjan reportedly included the:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.connectionivoirienne.net/?p=62574, accessed November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
*1st Infantry Battalion – (1er Bataillon d’infanterie des forces armées terrestres ivoiriennes), at [[Akouédo]] (new camp)
*Armoured Battalion – (Battaillon Blinde), at [[Akouédo]] (new camp). The new camp at Akouedo had reportedly been almost completely destroyed. {{Interlanguage link|Akouedo|fr|vertical-align=sup}} appears to be at 5' 21'' 7 N, 3' 26'' 30 W.
*1st Parachute Commando Battalion – [[1er Bataillon des Commandos Parachutistes]] (1er BCP), old camp at Akouedo, on the route to the village Ébrié.

The 2nd Infantry Battalion appears to have been based at [[Daloa]] for some time. A 2003 change of command ushered in the 16th commander of the unit,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news225.net/201604.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071350/http://www.news225.net/201604.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, accessed 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and there are also reports from 2009 and 2011.

Reported special forces units include:
*[[Group des Forces Speciales]] (GFS)
*[[Fusiliers Commandos d Air]] (FUSCOA)
*[[Détachement d' Intervention Rapide]]
*[[Fusiliers Marins Commandos]] (FUMACO/ naval commandos)

===Current army equipment===
The Ivorian army has traditionally been equipped with French weapons, most of which were delivered in the 1980s under generous military grants from Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; During Laurent Ghagbo's administration, large quantities of second-hand Soviet arms were acquired from [[Angola]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Belarus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trade&quot;/&gt;

After achieving independence from France in 1960, Ivory Coast maintained strong links with France through bilateral defence agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''World Aircraft Information Files. Brightstar Publishing, London. File 338 Sheet 02
&lt;/ref&gt; French training and operating techniques has been used since the establishment of the air force. The first equipment supplied included three Douglas C-47's and seven MH.1521 Broussard STOL utility aircraft in 1961. The first jet aircraft to enter service in October 1980 were six Alpha Jet CI light attack and advanced training aircraft; six more were ordered, but were subsequently cancelled. However, another was purchased in 1983.

The 1979 air force had only transport and liaison aircraft.  In 1987, the [[Library of Congress Country Study]] said that the Air Force's official name, Ivoirian Air Transport and Liaison Group (''Groupement Aérien de Transport et de Liaison''—GATL), 'reflects an original mission focused more on logistics and transport rather than a combat force.'

In 2004, following an [[2004 French–Ivorian clashes|air strikes on French peacekeepers]] by Ivorian forces, the French military destroyed all aircraft in the Air Force of Ivory Coast. Gbagbo had ordered air strikes on Ivorian rebels. On 6 November 2004, at least one Ivorian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] [[bomber]] attacked a French peacekeeping position in the rebel town of [[Bouaké]] at 1&amp;nbsp;pm, killing nine French soldiers and wounding 31.&lt;ref name=Seethes&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3989127.stm &quot;Ivory Coast seethes after attack&quot;], BBC News, 7 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; An American development worker, reported to have been a [[missionary]], was also killed. The Ivorian government claimed the attack on the French was unintentional, but the French insisted that the attack had been deliberate.&lt;ref name=WSWS&gt;Ann Talbot, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/nov2004/ivor-n09.shtml &quot;Ivory Coast: protests erupt vs. French military strikes&quot;], World Socialist Web Site, 9 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hours after the attack [[President of the French Republic|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] ordered the destruction of the Ivorian air force and the seizure of [[Yamoussoukro]] airport. The French military performed an overland attack on the airport, destroying two [[Sukhoi Su-25]] ground attack aircraft and three Mi-24 [[helicopter gunship]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC2004&gt;{{cite news| title = Ivory Coast seethes after attack| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3989127.stm

France then flew in 300 troops and put three [[Dassault Mirage F1]] jet fighters based in nearby [[Gabon]] on standby.&lt;ref name=WSWS/&gt;

Since then, the Air Force of Ivory Coast has been rebuilt.&lt;ref name=BBC2004 /&gt; In 2007, [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] reported a total of six aircraft in service: one [[Antonov An-32]] tactical transport, one [[Cessna 421|Cessna 421 Golden Eagle]] utility aircraft, two [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Eurocopter SA 365 Dauphin]] helicopters, one [[Gulfstream IV]] VIP aircraft, and one [[Mil Mi-24]] attack helicopter.&lt;ref name=&quot;awst_20070115&quot;&gt;&quot;World Military Aircraft Inventory&quot;, Aerospace Source Book 2007, ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'', January 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether any of these aircraft were truly operational. In addition, Deagel.com reported two [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]] attack aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deagel.com/search.aspx?cat=Procurement&amp;key=Bulgaria&amp;pag=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy==
Ivory Coast has a [[brown-water navy]] whose mission is [[coast]]al surveillance and security for the nation's 340-mile coastline.&lt;ref name=Cultures/&gt; The operational capability of the navy was severely degraded due to the diversion of resources to the army and air force during the civil wars, and it remains incapable of conducting operations beyond the general vicinity of Abidjan.&lt;ref name=Cultures/&gt;

===Fleet===

Up to the 1990s the navy had 5 known vessels:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/africa/iv-navy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hazegray.org/worldnav/africa/africa.htm#9&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2014 the navy was delivered the first of three coastal defence vessels.&lt;ref&gt;http://mapleleafnavy.com/2018/03/29/exchange-officer-from-the-ivory-coast-navy-gains-a-new-rcn-family/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 it was reported the navy was purchasing more vessels from French builder [[Raidco Marine]] (30 inflatable boats and 10 patrol craft), but for use by police and gendarmerie.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ivorycoast-navy-idUSBREA0R1GH20140128&lt;/ref&gt;

== International forces ==
A mutual defense accord signed with [[France]] in April 1961 provides for the stationing of [[French Armed Forces]] troops in Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Boubacar N'Diaye, 'Ivory Coast's Civilian Control Strategies 1961–68: A Critical Assessment,' Journal of Political and Military Sociology Special Issue on West Africa, Vol. 28, No. 2, Winter 2000, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; The 43rd Marine Infantry Battalion of the French Army's [[Troupes de Marine]] ({{Interlanguage link|43e bataillon d'infanterie de marine|fr|vertical-align=sup}}) was based in [[Port Bouet]] adjacent to the [[Abidjan Airport]] from 1979 and had more than 500 troops assigned until 2011, when it appears to have been disbanded. The French military also maintains a force as part of [[Operation Unicorn|Operation Licorne]].

From summer 2011, Operation Licorne, the French force, previously over 5,000 strong, is roughly 700, and consists of Licorne headquarters, Battalion Licorne (BATLIC), seemingly made up of elements of the [[2nd Marine Infantry Regiment]] and the [[Régiment d'infanterie-chars de marine]], and a helicopter detachment.&lt;ref name=Licorne11&gt;{{in lang|fr}} French Ministry of Defence, [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/operations/cote-d-ivoire/dossier/les-forces-francaises-en-cote-d-ivoire Les forces françaises en Côte d'Ivoire], 28 September 2011, accessed November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] has maintained the peacekeeping mission [[ONUCI]] in the country since 2004. On 28 February 2011 ONUCI consisted of 7,568 troops, 177 military observers, and numerous international civilians and Police; the mission had received helicopter and infantry reinforcement from [[UNMIL]] during the stand-off since the late 2010 elections which had been won by [[Alassane Ouattara]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1967]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1968]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Gendarmerie==

Since independence, the Ivory Coast has maintained a paramilitary [[gendarmerie]] force with a mandate to assist the police with law enforcement duties in the country's rural districts.&lt;ref name=Cultures/&gt; However, it may also be deployed alongside the army to quell internal unrest.&lt;ref name=Cultures/&gt; For a number of decades, the size of the Ivorian National Gendarmerie remained consistent at around 4,000 to 5,000 personnel, supervised by a commandant.&lt;ref name=WDA1993/&gt; It underwent a massive expansion following the outbreak of the First Ivorian Civil War, increasing to about 12,000 personnel commanded by a major general.&lt;ref name=Cultures/&gt; Gendarmes undergo training as cadets at a National Gendarmerie Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;

The National Gendarmerie maintains an investigative branch, the ''Brigades de Recherches'', which has been accused of various human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and unlawful detention.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW1&quot;&gt;{{cite web
