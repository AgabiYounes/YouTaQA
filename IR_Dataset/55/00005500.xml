The '''Territory of Christmas Island'''&lt;!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD OR REVERT OFFICIAL LANGUAGES. AN INFOBOX IS ATTACHED ABOVE--&gt; is an [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]] comprising the island of the same name. Christmas Island is located in the [[Indian Ocean]], around {{convert|350|km|mi}} south of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] and around {{Convert|1550|km|mi}} north-west of the closest point on the Australian mainland. It has an area of {{convert|135|km2|sqmi}}.

Christmas Island had a population of 1,843&amp;nbsp;residents {{as of|2016|lc=y}},&lt;ref name=Census2016/&gt; the majority of whom live in settlements on the northern tip of the island. The main settlement is [[Flying Fish Cove]]. Historically, [[Asian Australians]] of [[Chinese Australians|Chinese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], and [[Indian Australians|Indian]] descent collectively formed the vast majority of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/travel/article/2124098/christmas-island-next-big-thing-travel-home-chinese |title=Christmas Island – the next big thing in travel?

Several languages are in use, including [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and various Chinese dialects. [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]] are major religions on the island, though a vast majority of the population does not declare a formal religious affiliation and may be involved in ethnic [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religion]].{{original research inline|date=February 2019}}

The first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the ''Thomas'' in 1615. The island was later named on Christmas Day (25&amp;nbsp;December) 1643 by Captain [[William Mynors]] but only settled in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=&quot;lus19&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Luscombe |url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/christmasisland.htm |title=Christmas Island |website=The British Empire |year=2019 |access-date=2019-03-16 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104153136/https://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/christmasisland.htm|archive-date=4 January 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its geographic isolation and history of minimal human disturbance has led to a high level of [[endemism]] among its flora and fauna, which is of interest to scientists and naturalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilderness society&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/marine/christmas_island/save_ci/ |title=Save Christmas Island – Introduction |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=14 April 2007 |date=19 September 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609110000/http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/marine/christmas_island/save_ci/ |archive-date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority (63&amp;nbsp;percent) of the island is included in the [[Christmas Island National Park]], which features several areas of primary [[monsoon]]al forest. [[Phosphate]], deposited originally as [[guano]], has been mined on the island since 1899.

==History==
===First visits by Europeans, 1643===
The first European to sight the island was Richard Rowe of the ''Thomas'' in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=David J. |last2=Mcallan |first2=Ian A.W. |title=The birds of Christmas Island, Indian Ocean: A review |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274639116 |website=ResearchGate |publisher=Australian Field Ornithology |accessdate=20 January 2017 |date=August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202000221/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274639116_The_birds_of_Christmas_Island_Indian_Ocean_A_review |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain [[William Mynors]] of the ''Royal Mary'', an [[English East India Company]] vessel, named the island when he sailed past it on Christmas Day, in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/christmas/culture-history/island-history.html |title=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts – Christmas Island History |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=26 April 2009 |date=8 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304001240/http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/christmas/culture-history/island-history.html |archivedate=4 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was included on English and Dutch navigation charts as early as the beginning of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, but it was not until 1666 that a map published by Dutch cartographer [[Pieter Goos]] included the island. Goos labelled the island &quot;Mony&quot; or &quot;Moni&quot;,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Christmas Island |volume=6 |pages=294–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meaning of which is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.map-nk1574-sd&amp;rgn=0.5309855310%2C0.5141004862%2C0.6401856402%2C0.6437601297&amp;cmd=zoomin&amp;width=400&amp;x=200&amp;y=199 |title=Digital Collections – Maps – Goos, Pieter, ca. 1616–1675.

English navigator [[William Dampier]], aboard the English ship ''Cygnet'', made the earliest recorded visit to the sea around the island in March&amp;nbsp;1688.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He found it uninhabited.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carney |first= Gerard |title=The constitutional systems of the Australian states and territories |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-521-86305-8 |page=477 |quote=The uninhabited island was named on Christmas Day, 1643, by Captain William Mynors as he sailed past, leaving to William Dampier the honour of first landing ashore in 1688.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dampier wrote an account of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A New Voyage Round the World |last=Dampier |first=William, Captain |author-link=William Dampier |year=1703 |publisher=James Knapton |location=The Crown in St.&amp;nbsp;Paul's Church-yard, London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dampier was trying to reach [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos]] from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. His ship was blown off course in an easterly direction, arriving at Christmas Island twenty-eight days later. Dampier landed on the west coast, at &quot;the [[The Dales (Christmas Island)|Dales]]&quot;. Two of his crewmen became the first Europeans to set foot on Christmas Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where is Christmas Island? |url=http://www.hamiltonstampclub.com/christmas-islands.html |website=Hamilton Stamp Club |access-date=2016-09-18 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820120024/http://www.hamiltonstampclub.com/christmas-islands.html |archive-date=20 August 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Daniel Beeckman of the ''Eagle'' passed the island on 5&amp;nbsp;April 1714, chronicled in his 1718 book, ''A Voyage to and from the Island of Borneo, in the East-Indies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The early history of Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean |journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |year=1949 |volume=22 |pages=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploration and annexation===
[[File:Poonsaan1v2.jpg|thumb|[[Poon Saan]] in the evening]]
[[File:Poonsaan2.jpg|thumb|[[Poon Saan]] shops]]
The first attempt at exploring the island was in 1857 by the crew of the ''Amethyst''. They tried to reach the summit of the island but found the cliffs impassable.

During the [[Challenger expedition|1872–1876 ''Challenger'' expedition]] to Indonesia, naturalist [[John Murray (oceanographer)|John Murray]] carried out extensive surveys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.christmas.net.au/about/history.html |publisher=Christmas Island Tourism Association |accessdate=2016-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208180546/http://www.christmas.net.au/about/history.html |archivedate=8 December 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Captain [[John Maclear]] of {{HMS|Flying Fish|1873|6}}, having discovered an anchorage in a bay that he named &quot;Flying Fish Cove&quot;, landed a party and made a small collection of the [[flora]] and [[fauna]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; In the next year, [[Pelham Aldrich]], on board [[HMS Egeria (1873)|HMS ''Egeria'']], visited the island for ten days, accompanied by [[Joseph Jackson Lister (naturalist)|J.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Lister]], who gathered a larger biological and mineralogical collection.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Among the rocks then obtained and submitted to Murray for examination were many of nearly pure [[phosphate of lime]]. This discovery led to [[annexation]] of the island by the British Crown on 6&amp;nbsp;June 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourism&quot; /&gt;

===Settlement and exploitation===
Soon afterwards, a small settlement was established in Flying Fish Cove by [[Clunies-Ross Family|G. Clunies Ross]], the owner of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands some {{convert|900|km}} to the southwest, to collect [[timber]] and supplies for the growing industry on Cocos.
&lt;!--[[File:Christmas island 76.svg|thumb|Enlargeable relief map of Christmas Island]]--&gt;

In 1897 the island was visited by [[Charles William Andrews|Charles W. Andrews]], who did extensive research on the natural history of the island, on behalf of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite book |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=5316016&amp;jid=GEO&amp;volumeId=7&amp;issueId=07&amp;aid=5316008 |volume=II |title=A Monograph of Christmas Island |series=Indian Ocean: Physical Features and Geology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805060407/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=5316016&amp;jid=GEO&amp;volumeId=7&amp;issueId=07&amp;aid=5316008 |archive-date=5 August 2011 |first=Charles W. |last=Andrews |quote=With descriptions of the fauna and flora by numerous contributors.

Phosphate mining began in 1899 using [[Indentured servant|indentured]] workers from [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and [[China]]. John Davis Murray, a mechanical engineer and recent graduate of [[Purdue University]], was sent to supervise the operation on behalf of the Phosphate Mining and Shipping Company. Murray was known as the &quot;King of Christmas Island&quot; until 1910, when he married and settled in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Handy Book of Curious Information |url=https://archive.org/details/ahandybookcurio00walsgoog |first=William |last=Walsh |year=1913 |page=447 |publisher=Lippincott |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jupp |first1=James |title=The Australian People: An encyclopedia of the nation, its people, and their origins |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9780521807890 |page=225 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&amp;pg=PA225 |access-date=2 January 2017 |chapter=Christmas Islanders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103165431/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&amp;pg=PA225|archive-date=3 January 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island was administered jointly by the British Phosphate commissioners and district officers from the United Kingdom [[Colonial Office]] through the [[Straits Settlements]], and later the [[Colony of Singapore|Crown Colony of Singapore]]. Hunt (2011) provides a detailed history of Chinese indentured labor on the island during those years. In 1922, scientists attempted unsuccessfully to view a [[solar eclipse]] from the island to test [[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]].&lt;ref name=Hunt2012&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hunt |title=Eclipse on Christmas Island |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese invasion===
{{main|Battle of Christmas Island}}
From the outbreak of the South-East Asian theatre of [[World War II]] in December&amp;nbsp;1941, Christmas Island was a target for Japanese occupation because of its rich [[phosphate]] deposits.&lt;ref name=Klemen/&gt; A naval gun was installed under a British officer and four NCOs and 27&amp;nbsp;Indian soldiers.&lt;ref name=Klemen&gt;{{cite web |last=Klemen |first=L. |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/christmas.html |title=The Mystery of Christmas Island, March&amp;nbsp;1942 |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942 |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121080434/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/christmas.html |archive-date=21 January 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first attack was carried out on 20&amp;nbsp;January 1942, by {{Jsub|I-59}}, which torpedoed a Norwegian freighter, the ''Eidsvold''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Klemen |last=L. |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/allied_losses.html |title=Allied Merchant Ship Losses in the Pacific and Southeast Asia |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942 |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514072436/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/allied_losses.html |archive-date=14 May 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vessel drifted and eventually sank off West White Beach. Most of the European and Asian staff and their families were evacuated to Perth.

In late February and early March&amp;nbsp;1942, there were two aerial bombing raids. Shelling from a Japanese naval group on 7&amp;nbsp;March led the [[District Officer]] to hoist the white flag.&lt;ref name=Klemen/&gt; But after the Japanese naval group sailed away, the British officer raised the [[Union Flag]] once more.&lt;ref name=Klemen/&gt; During the night of 10–11&amp;nbsp;March, a mutiny of the Indian troops, abetted by [[Sikh]] policemen, led to the killing of the five British officers in the garrison, and the imprisonment of the remaining 21&amp;nbsp;Europeans.&lt;ref name=Klemen/&gt;

At dawn on 31&amp;nbsp;March 1942, a dozen Japanese bombers launched the attack, destroying the radio station. The same day, a Japanese fleet of nine vessels arrived, and the island was surrendered. About 850&amp;nbsp;men of the Japanese 21st and 24th&amp;nbsp;[[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Special Base Forces]] and 102nd&amp;nbsp;Construction Unit came ashore at [[Flying Fish Cove]] and occupied the island.&lt;ref name=Klemen/&gt; They rounded up the workforce, most of whom had fled to the jungle. Sabotaged equipment was repaired and preparations were made to resume the mining and export of phosphate. Only twenty men from the 21st&amp;nbsp;Special Base Force were left as a garrison.&lt;ref name=Klemen/&gt;

Isolated acts of sabotage and the torpedoing of the ''[[Nissei Maru]]'' at the wharf on 17 November 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cressman |first=Robert J. |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1942.html |series=The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War&amp;nbsp;II |title=Chapter IV: 1942 |website=Hyperwar |access-date=16 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820205155/http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/USN-Chron/USN-Chron-1942.html |archive-date=20 August 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant that only small amounts of phosphate were exported to Japan during the occupation. In November&amp;nbsp;1943, over 60% of the island's population was evacuated to [[Surabaya]] prison camps, leaving a total population of just under 500&amp;nbsp;Chinese and Malays and 15&amp;nbsp;Japanese to survive as best they could. In October&amp;nbsp;1945, {{HMS|Rother|K224|6}} re-occupied Christmas Island.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office, England War Office and Colonial Office Correspondence/Straits Settlements.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.

After the war, seven mutineers were traced and prosecuted by the Military Court in Singapore. In 1947, five of them were [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]].

[[John William Stokes]] succeeded him and served from 1 October 1960, to 12 June 1966. On his departure, he was lauded by all sectors of the island community. In 1968, the official secretary was retitled an administrator and, since 1997, Christmas Island and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] together are called the [[Australian Indian Ocean Territories]] and share a single administrator resident on Christmas Island.

===Refugee and immigration detention===
{{see also|Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre}}
[[File:Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre and the Lilac compound (5775019842).jpg|thumb|left|Immigration Detention Centre]]From the late 1980s and early 1990s, boats carrying [[asylum seekers]], mainly departing from Indonesia, began landing on the island. In 2001, Christmas Island was the site of the [[Tampa affair|''Tampa'' controversy]], in which the Australian government stopped a Norwegian ship, [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']], from disembarking 438&amp;nbsp;rescued asylum-seekers. The ensuing standoff and the associated political reactions in Australia were a major issue in the [[2001 Australian federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fowler |first=Connie |url=http://diemperdidi.info/nordicnotes/vol07/articles/thetampacrisis.html |title=Karsten Klepsuik, John Howard, and the Tampa Crisis: Good Luck or Good Management? |publisher=Celsius Centre for Scandinavian Studies ([[Flinders University]]) |work=Nordic Notes |issn=1442-5165 |volume=7 |year=2003 |accessdate=19 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425120631/http://diemperdidi.info/nordicnotes/vol07/articles/thetampacrisis.html |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Howard government]] operated the &quot;[[Pacific Solution]]&quot; from 2001 to 2007, excising Christmas Island from [[Australian migration zone|Australia's migration zone]] so that asylum seekers on the island could not apply for [[refugee status]]. Asylum seekers were relocated from Christmas Island to [[Manus Island]] and [[Nauru]]. In 2006, an [[Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre|immigration detention centre]], containing approximately 800 beds, was constructed on the island for the [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2006–07)|Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs]].

The mountain was originally a [[volcano]], and some [[basalt]] is exposed in places such as [[The Dales (Christmas Island)|The Dales]] and Dolly Beach, but most of the surface rock is [[limestone]] accumulated from [[coral]] growth. The [[karst]] terrain supports numerous [[anchialine cave]]s.&lt;ref name=IliffeADM2016&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iliffe, T. |author2=Humphreys, W. |title=Christmas Islands Hidden Secret |year=2016 |journal=Advanced Diver Magazine |url=http://www.advanceddivermagazine.com/articles/christmasisland.html |accessdate=2016-01-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110101547/http://www.advanceddivermagazine.com/articles/christmasisland.html |archive-date=10 January 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summit of this mountain peak is formed by a succession of [[Tertiary]] [[limestone]]s ranging in age from the [[Eocene]] or [[Oligocene]] up to recent reef deposits, with intercalations of volcanic rock in the older beds.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

Steep cliffs along much of the coast rise abruptly to a central plateau. Elevation ranges from sea level to {{convert|361|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at [[Murray Hill, Christmas Island|Murray Hill]]. The island is mainly [[tropical rainforest]], 63% of which is national parkland. The narrow fringing [[reef]] surrounding the island poses a maritime hazard.

Christmas Island lies {{convert|2600|km|mi}} northwest of [[Perth]], Western Australia, {{convert|350|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Indonesia, {{convert|975|km|mi|abbr=on}} ENE of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and {{convert|2748|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory.

=== Beaches ===
Christmas Island has {{convert|80|km}} of shoreline but only small parts of the shoreline are easily accessible. The island's perimeter is embodied by sharp cliff faces, making many of the island's beaches difficult to get to. Some of the easily accessible beaches include Flying Fish Cove (main beach), Lily Beach, Ethel Beach, and Isabel Beach, while the more difficult beaches to access include Greta Beach, Dolly Beach, Winifred Beach, Merrial Beach, and West White Beach, which all require a vehicle with four wheel drive and a difficult walk through dense rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christmas Island Beaches |url=https://www.christmas.net.au/experiences/beaches.html |website=Christmas Island – A Natural Wonder |publisher=Christmas Island Tourism Association |access-date=2 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113054713/https://www.christmas.net.au/experiences/beaches.html |archive-date=13 January 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Christmas Island is located towards the southern edge of the equatorial region. Climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and temperatures vary little throughout the year. The highest temperature is usually around {{convert|29|C|F}} in March and April, while the lowest temperature is {{convert|23|C|F}} and occurs in August. There is a dry season from July to October with only occasional showers. The wet season is between November and June, and includes [[monsoons]], with downpours of rain at random times of the day. [[Tropical cyclones]] also occur in the wet season, bringing very strong winds, rain and enormous seas.

{{More citations needed section|date=September 2013}}
Christmas Island is a non-self-governing [[States and territories of Australia|external territory]] of Australia, {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} administered by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (from 29&amp;nbsp;November 2007 until 14&amp;nbsp;September 2010, administration was carried out by the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AussieAG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |department=First Assistant Secretary, Territories Division |place=Australia |title=Territories of Australia |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/territories |publisher=Attorney-General's Department |date=30 January 2008 |access-date=7 February 2008 |quote=The Federal Government, through the Attorney-General's Department administers Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Jervis Bay, and Norfolk Island as Territories. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131100911/http://ag.gov.au/territories |archive-date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |department=First Assistant Secretary, Access to Justice Division |title=Territories of Australia |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/territories |publisher=Attorney-General's Department |date=2 February 2011 |access-date=28 August 2011 |quote=Under the Administrative Arrangements Order made on 14&amp;nbsp;September 2010, responsibility for services to Territories was transferred to the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814065328/http://www.ag.gov.au/territories |archive-date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to this by the [[Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government (Australia)|Department of Transport and Regional Services]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;DOTARS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |department=Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government |title=Territories of Australia |url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx |access-date=7 February 2008 |quote=As part of the Machinery of Government Changes following the Federal Election on 29&amp;nbsp;November 2007, administrative responsibility for Territories has been transferred to the Attorney General's Department. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216154140/http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/territories/index.aspx |archive-date=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal system is under the authority of the [[Governor-General of Australia]] and Australian law. An [[Administrator (Australia)|administrator]] appointed by the Governor-General represents the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]] and Australia and lives on the island. The territory falls under no formal state jurisdiction, but the [[Western Australia]]n Government provides many services through agreements with Canberra.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The Australian government provides services through the Christmas Island Administration and the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. Under the federal government's [[Christmas Island Act 1958]], Western Australian laws are applied to Christmas Island; non-application or partial application of such laws is at the discretion of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christmas Island Act 1958 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1958A00041 |website=www.legislation.gov.au |access-date=29 April 2019 |department=Federal Register of Legislation |publisher=Australian Government |place=Australia |year=2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110074853/https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C1958A00041 |archive-date=10 January 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also gives Western Australian courts judicial power over Christmas Island. Christmas Island remains constitutionally distinct from Western Australia, however; the power of the state to legislate for the territory is delegated by the federal government. The kind of services typically provided by a state government elsewhere in Australia are provided by departments of the Western Australian government, and by contractors, with the costs met by the federal government. A&amp;nbsp;unicameral [[Shire of Christmas Island]] with nine seats provides local government services and is elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. Elections are held every two years, with four or five of the members standing for election.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Residents' views===
Residents find the system of administration frustrating, with the island run by bureaucrats in the federal government, but subject to the laws of Western Australia and enforced by federal police. There is a feeling of resignation that any progress on local issues is prolongated by the confusing governance system. A number of islanders support self-governance, including shire president Gordon Thompson, who also believes that a lack of news media to cover local affairs had contributed to political apathy among residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-07/apathy-and-disillusionment-on-christmas-island-ahead-of-election/10666454 |accessdate=7 March 2019 |title=Apathy and disillusionment on Christmas Island as residents prepare for federal election |first=Tom |last=Joyner |date=7 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307053634/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-07/apathy-and-disillusionment-on-christmas-island-ahead-of-election/10666454 |archive-date=7 March 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flag===
[[Image:Flag of Christmas Island.svg|thumb|right|200px|Flag of Christmas Island]]
{{Main|Flag of Christmas Island}}
In early 1986, the Christmas Island Assembly held a design competition for an island flag; the winning design was adopted as the informal flag of the territory for over a decade, and in 2002 it was made the official [[flag of Christmas Island]].

==Economy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
Phosphate mining had been the only significant economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian government closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened by a consortium which included many of the former mine workers as shareholders. With the support of the government, the $34&amp;nbsp;million [[Christmas Island Resort|Christmas Island Casino and Resort]] opened in 1993 but was closed in 1998. {{As of|2011}}, the resort has re-opened without the casino.

The Australian government in 2001 agreed to support the creation of a commercial [[spaceport]] on the island; however, this has not yet been constructed and appears that it will not proceed. The Howard government built a temporary immigration detention centre on the island in 2001 and planned to replace it with a larger, modern facility at North West Point until Howard's defeat in the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 elections]].

==Culture==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2013}}
The culture of Christmas Island is unique, for people of many different ethnicities inhabit the area. Historically, the majority of Christmas Islanders were those of Chinese, Malay, and Indian origins, the initial permanent settlers; as a result, they have significantly influenced the local culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCMP&quot;/&gt; Today, the majority of residents are [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]], with significant numbers of European Australians and [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] as well as smaller [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] communities too. The main languages of Christmas Island are English and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. Dress is usually modest, and tourists should keep a wrap, such as a [[sarong]] or [[pareo]], on hand to cover shorts, bathing suits, and tank tops. It is common to remove shoes when entering a house and to also avoid touching anyone's head.

===Religion===
Religious beliefs are diverse, but people are very tolerant of each other's religions. The religions practised include [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]], and [[Christianity]]. There is a Mosque in Flying Fish Cove. With all of these religions, there are many religious festivals, such as [[Spring (season)#Cultural events|Spring Festival]], [[Hari Raya]], [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Destination Specialist: South Pacific including Micronesia |year=2001 |publisher=Institute of Certified Travel Agents}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there is a [[Bahá'í]] centre on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christmas.net.au/about/culture.html |title=Christmas Island Tourism – Culture |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124014735/http://christmas.net.au/about/culture.html |archive-date=24 January 2014 |website=Christmas.net.au |access-date=2014-05-25 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christmas Island (5775114458).jpg|thumb|Car moving across the backroads of Christmas Island]]
Christmas Island is well known for its biological diversity. There are many rare species of animals and plants on the island, making nature-walking a popular activity. Along with the diversity of species, many different types of caves exist, such as plateau caves, coastal caves, raised coastal caves and alcoves, sea caves, fissure caves, collapse caves, and basalt caves; most of these are near the sea and have been formed by the action of water. Altogether, there are approximately 30&amp;nbsp;caves on the island,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The History of Christmas Island and the Management of its Karst Features |last=Meek |first=Paul D. |journal=Helictite |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=31–36 |url=http://helictite.caves.org.au/pdf1/37.2.Meek.pdf |access-date=17 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315004023/http://helictite.caves.org.au/pdf1/37.2.Meek.pdf |archive-date=15 March 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Lost Lake Cave, Daniel Roux Cave, and Full Frontal Cave being the most well-known. The many freshwater springs include Hosnies Spring Ramsar, which also has a mangrove stand.

The Dales is a [[rainforest]] in the western part of the island and consists of seven deep valleys, all of which were formed by spring streams. Hugh's Dale waterfall is part of this area and is a popular attraction. The annual breeding migration of the [[Christmas Island red crab]]s is a popular event.

Fishing is another common activity. There are many distinct species of fish in the oceans surrounding Christmas Island. Snorkeling and swimming in the ocean are two other activities that are extremely popular. Walking trails are also very popular, for there are many beautiful trails surrounded by extravagant [[flora]] and [[fauna]]. 63% of the island is [[Christmas Island National Park|national park]] making it one of the main attractions to experience when visiting.

Christmas Island was uninhabited until the late 19th century, allowing many species to evolve without human interference. Two-thirds of the island has been declared a [[National Park]], which is managed by the Australian Department of Environment and Heritage through Parks Australia. Christmas Island contains unique species, both of flora and fauna, some of which are threatened with, or have become, [[Extinct species|extinct]].

===Flora===
The dense [[rainforest]] has grown in the deep soils of the [[plateau]] and on the terraces. The forests are dominated by 25 tree species. [[Fern]]s, [[orchid]]s and [[vine]]s grow on the branches in the humid atmosphere beneath the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. The 135 plant species include at least 18 that are found nowhere else. The rainforest is in great condition despite the mining activities over the last 100 years. Areas that have been damaged by [[mining]] are now a part of an ongoing rehabilitation project. The island is small and covers 135 square kilometres of land which 63% of that land has been declared [[National park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essential Christmas Island Travel Guide|last=Tierney|first=Beth|publisher=Christmas Island Tourism Association|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas Island's [[endemism|endemic]] plants include the trees ''[[Arenga listeri]]'', ''[[Pandanus elatus]]'' and ''[[Dendrocnide peltata]]'' var. ''murrayana''; the [[shrub]]s ''[[Abutilon listeri]]'', ''[[Colubrina pedunculata]]'', ''[[Grewia insularis]]'' and ''[[Pandanus christmatensis]]''; the vines ''[[Hoya aldrichii]]'' and ''[[Zehneria alba]]''; the [[herbaceous plant|herb]]s ''[[Asystasia alba]]'', ''[[Dicliptera maclearii]]'' and ''[[Peperomia rossii]]''; the grass ''[[Ischaemum nativitatis]]''; the fern ''[[Asplenium listeri]]''; and the orchids ''[[Brachypeza archytas]]'', ''[[Flickingeria nativitatis]]'', ''[[Phreatia listeri]]'' and ''[[Zeuxine exilis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christmas Island National Park: Flora.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
Two species of native rats, the [[Maclear's rat|Maclear's]] and [[bulldog rat]]s, have become extinct since the island was settled, while the [[Javan rusa]] deer has been introduced. The [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[Christmas Island shrew]] has not been seen since the mid-1980s and may be already extinct, while the [[Christmas Island pipistrelle]] (a small bat) is presumed to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.gov.au/parks/index.html |title=Parks Australia |access-date=3 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912013529/http://environment.gov.au/parks/index.html |archive-date=12 September 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fruit bat (flying fox) species ''[[Pteropus natalis]]'' is only found on Christmas Island, its epithet ''natalis'' is a reference to that name. The species is probably the last native mammal, and an important pollinator and rainforest seed-disperser; the population is also in decline and under increasing pressure from land clearing and introduced pest species. The flying fox's low rate of reproduction (one pup each year) and high infant mortality rate makes it especially vulnerable and the conservation status is as [[critically endangered]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SPRAT2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Pteropus natalis – Christmas Island Flying-fox, Christmas Island Fruit-bat |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64801 |website=Species Profile and Threats Database |accessdate=24 December 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707234104/http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64801 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying foxes are an 'umbrella' species helping forests regenerate and other species survive in stressed environments.

The land crabs and seabirds are the most noticeable fauna on the island. Christmas Island has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as both an [[Endemic Bird Area]] and an [[Important Bird Area]] because it supports five endemic species and five subspecies as well as over one percent of the world populations of five other seabirds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2011 |title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Christmas Island |website=www.birdlife.org |url=http://www.birdlife.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011128211428/http://www.birdlife.org/ |archive-date=28 November 2001 |df=dmy-all |access-date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty terrestrial and intertidal species of crab have been described here, of which thirteen are regarded as true land crabs, being dependent on the ocean only for larval development. Robber crabs, known elsewhere as [[coconut crab]]s, also exist in large numbers on the island. The annual [[Christmas Island red crab|red crab]] mass migration (around 100&amp;nbsp;million animals) to the sea to spawn has been called one of the wonders of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/externalterr/christma.htm |title=Geoscience Australia on Christmas Island |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205053513/http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/externalterr/christma.htm |archivedate=5 February 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This takes place each year around November – after the start of the [[wet season]] and in synchronisation with the cycle of the [[moon]]. Once at the ocean, the mothers release the embryos where they can survive and grow until they are able to live on land.

The island is a focal point for seabirds of various species. Eight species or [[subspecies]] of seabirds nest on it. The most numerous is the [[red-footed booby]], which nests in colonies, using trees on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread [[brown booby]] nests on the ground near the edge of the seacliff and inland cliffs. [[Abbott's booby]] (listed as [[endangered]]) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest, the only remaining nesting habitat for this bird in the world.

Another endangered and endemic bird, the [[Christmas frigatebird]], has nesting areas on the northeastern shore terraces. The more widespread [[great frigatebird]]s nest in semi-[[deciduous]] trees on the shore terrace, with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The [[common noddy]] and two species of bosun or [[tropicbird]]s, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.

Of the ten native land birds and shorebirds, seven are endemic species or subspecies. This includes the [[Christmas thrush]] and the [[Christmas imperial pigeon]]. Some 86 migrant bird species have been recorded as visitors to the island.

Six species of [[butterfly]] are known to occur on Christmas Island. These are the Christmas swallowtail (''[[Papilio memnon]]''), striped albatross (''[[Appias olferna]]''), Christmas emperor (''[[Polyura andrewsi]]''), king cerulean (''[[Jamides bochus]]''), lesser grass-blue (''[[Zizina otis]]''), and Papuan grass-yellow (''[[Eurema blanda]]'').&lt;ref name=butterflies&gt;{{cite book|last=Braby|first=Michael F.|title=The Complete Field Guide to Butterflies of Australia|url=https://archive.org/details/The_Complete_Field_Guide_to_Butterflies_of_Australia|year=2008|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09027-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insect species include the [[yellow crazy ant]] (''Anoplolepis gracilipes''), introduced to the island and since subjected to attempts to destroy the [[supercolony|supercolonies]] that emerged with aerial spraying of the insecticide [[Fipronil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EWG2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Beeton |first1=Prof. Bob |last2=Burbidge |first2=Dr. Andrew |title=Final report : Christmas Island Expert Working Group |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/final-report-christmas-island-expert-working-group |website=National Parks |publisher=Department of the Environment and Energy |accessdate=24 December 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224170540/http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/final-report-christmas-island-expert-working-group |archive-date=24 December 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Christmas Island has access to a range of modern communication services.

Radio broadcasts from Australia include [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], [[ABC Kimberley]], [[Triple J]] and [[Red FM (Australia)|Red&amp;nbsp;FM]]. All services are provided by satellite links from the mainland. [[Broadband internet]] became available to subscribers in urban areas in mid-2005 through the local internet service provider, [[Christmas Island Internet Administration|CIIA]] (formerly&amp;nbsp;dotCX).

Christmas Island, due to its close proximity to Australia's northern neighbors, falls within many of the satellite footprints throughout the region. This results in ideal conditions for receiving various Asian broadcasts, which locals sometimes prefer to those emanating from Western Australia. Additionally, ionospheric conditions are conducive to terrestrial radio transmissions, from [[High frequency|HF]] through [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and sometimes into [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]. The island plays home to a small array of radio equipment that spans a good chunk of the usable spectrum. A variety of government-owned and operated antenna systems are employed on the island to take advantage of this.

===Telecommunications===
Telephone services are provided by [[Telstra]] and are a part of the Australian network with the same prefix as Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory&amp;nbsp;(08). A [[GSM]] mobile telephone system on the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz band&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://regional.gov.au/territories/Christmas/traveller_info.aspx |title=Christmas Island traveller information |website=Infrastructure and Regional Development |access-date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627170331/http://regional.gov.au/territories/Christmas/traveller_info.aspx |archive-date=27 June 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the old analogue network in February 2005.

===Postage stamps===
{{Main|Postage stamps and postal history of Christmas Island}}
[[File:Stamp Christmas Island 1958 2c.jpg|thumb|150px|Postage stamp with portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]], 1958]]

A postal agency was opened on the island in 1901 and sold [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Straits Settlements|stamps of the Strait Settlements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSM 102008&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Richard |last=Breckon |title=Christmas Island's stamps and postal history: 50&amp;nbsp;years of Australian administration |magazine=Gibbons Stamp Monthly |date=October 2008 |pages=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), postage stamps of the [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] were in use, then stamps of Singapore.&lt;ref name=&quot;StG Aus&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Commonwealth Stamp Catalogue Australia |first=Stanley |last=Gibbons |edition=4th |year=2007 |pages=104–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the island received its own postage stamps after being put under Australian custody. It had a large philatelic and postal independence, managed first by the Phosphate Commission (1958–1969) and then by the island's administration (1969–1993).&lt;ref name=&quot;GSM 102008&quot;/&gt; This ended on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1993 when [[Australia Post]] became the island's postal operator; Christmas Island stamps may be used in Australia and Australian stamps may be used on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;StG Aus&quot; /&gt;

==Transport==
A container port exists at Flying Fish Cove with an uncompleted alternative container-unloading point to the east of the island at Norris Point, intended for use during the December-to-March &quot;swell season&quot; of rough seas.

The [[standard gauge]] {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} [[Christmas Island Phosphate Co.'s Railway]] from Flying Fish Cove to the phosphate mine was constructed in 1914. It was closed in December&amp;nbsp;1987, when the Australian government closed the mine, and since has been recovered as scrap, leaving only earthworks in places.

[[Virgin Australia Regional Airlines]] provides two weekly flights to [[Christmas Island Airport]] from Perth, Western Australia, [[Garuda Indonesia]] conduct weekly open-charter flights from/to Jakarta with bookings done through Christmas Island Travel Exchange and [[Malindo Air]] operate fortnightly open-charter flights from/to Kuala Lumpur with bookings done through Evercrown Air Services.

Hire cars are available from the airport however no franchised companies are represented. CI Taxi Service also operates most days.
Due to the lack of 3G or 4G, the island's sole taxi operator couldn't meet the requirement issued by WA Department of Transport to install electronic meters, and the operator was forced to close at the end of June&amp;nbsp;2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Parish |first1=Rebecca |title=Christmas Island's sole taxi operator gets red-tape run-around over WA Government legislation |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-10/christmas-island-taxi-operator-gets-red-tape-run-around/11588172 |accessdate=20 October 2019 |work=ABC News |date=10 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road network covers most of the island and is of generally good quality, although four-wheel drive vehicles are needed to reach some of the more distant parts of the rainforest or the more isolated beaches on the rough dirt roads.

==Education==
The island-operated [[Day care|crèche]] is in the Recreation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shire.gov.cx/Recreation_Centre/crechemain.html |title=Recreation Centre |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915191041/http://shire.gov.cx///Recreation_Centre/crechemain.html |archive-date=15 September 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christmas Island District High School]], catering to students in grades [[K-12#P–12|P-12]], is run by the [[Western Australian Education Department]]. There are no universities on Christmas Island.

The island has one public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shire.gov.cx/Community_Services/library.html |title=Public library |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915190947/http://shire.gov.cx///Community_Services/library.html |archivedate=15 September 2009 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport ==
[[Rugby league]] is growing in the island: the first game was played in 2016, and a local committee, with the support of [[National Rugby League|NRL]] Western Australia, is willing to organize matches with nearby [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Islands]] and to create a Rugby League Competition in the Indian Ocean area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hope |first=Ash |date=December 2018 |title=Christmas Time |journal=Rugby League World |issue=453|pages=74–75 |issn=1466-0105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
