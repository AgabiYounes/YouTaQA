{{History of Cuba}}
The island of [[Cuba]] was inhabited by various [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures prior to the arrival of the Spanish in 1492. After the arrival, Spain conquered Cuba and appointed [[List of colonial governors of Cuba|Spanish governors]] to rule in [[Havana]]. In 1762, Havana was briefly occupied by Great Britain, before being returned to Spain in [[Florida]]. A series of rebellions during the 19th century failed to end the Spanish rule. However, the [[Spanish–American War]] resulted in a Spanish withdrawal from the island in 1898, and following three-and-a-half years of subsequent US military rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?fieldkey=2028&amp;term=Background|title=CIA World Factbook: Cuba: Introduction: Background|access-date=27 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107002111/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?fieldkey=2028&amp;term=Background|archive-date=7 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba gained formal independence in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/cuba|title=A guide to the United States' history of recognition, diplomatic, and consular relations, by country, since 1776: Cuba|publisher=US State Department – Office of the Historian|accessdate=24 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221140619/http://history.state.gov/countries/cuba|archive-date=21 February 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following its independence, the Cuban republic saw significant economic development, but also political corruption and a succession of despotic leaders, culminating in the overthrow of the dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] by the [[26th of July Movement]], led by [[Fidel Castro]], [[Che Guevara]] and [[Raúl Castro]] Ruz, during the 1953–59 [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rumbaut |first1=Luis E. |last2=Rumbaut |first2=Rubén G. |year=2009 |title=Cuba: The Cuban Revolution at 50 |journal=[[Latin American Perspectives]] |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=84–98 |jstor=27648162 |doi=10.1177/0094582x08329137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Castro, Cuba was heavily involved in wars in [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Syria]], [[Angola]], [[Algeria]], [[South Yemen]], [[North Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Somalia]], [[Congo-Brazzaville]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Parameters: Journal of the US Army War College |date=1977 |publisher=U.S. Army War College |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMdLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Columbian history==
Cuba's earliest known human inhabitants colonized the island in the [[4th&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BC]].&lt;ref&gt;Allaire, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known Cuban archeological site, [[Nicaro-Levisa|Levisa]], dates from approximately 3100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Allaire, p. 686&lt;/ref&gt; A wider distribution of sites date from after 2000&amp;nbsp;BC, most notably represented by the Cayo Redondo and Guayabo Blanco cultures of western Cuba. These [[neolithic]] cultures used [[ground stone]] and [[Seashell|shell]] tools and ornaments, including the [[dagger]]-like ''gladiolitos'', which are believed to have had a ceremonial role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allaire688&quot;&gt;Allaire, p. 688&lt;/ref&gt; The Cayo Redondo and Guayabo Blanco cultures lived a subsistence lifestyle based on [[hunter-gatherer|fishing, hunting and collecting wild plants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allaire688&quot;/&gt;

Prior to Columbus' arrival, the indigenous [[Guanajatabey]], who had inhabited Cuba for centuries, were driven to the far west of the island by the arrival of subsequent waves of migrants, including the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and [[Ciboney]]. These people had migrated north along the [[Caribbean|Caribbean island chain]].

The Taíno and Siboney were part of a cultural group commonly called the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], who inhabited parts of northeastern South America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Initially, they settled at the eastern end of Cuba, before expanding westward across the island. The Spanish [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] clergyman and writer [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] estimated that the Taíno population of Cuba had reached 350,000 by the end of the 15th century. The Taíno cultivated the [[cassava|yuca]] root, harvested it and baked it to produce [[cassava bread]]. They also grew [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]], and ate [[maize]] and [[sweet potato]]es. According to History of the Indians, they had &quot;everything they needed for living; they had many crops, well arranged&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia de las Indias'' (vol. 3). Biblioteca Ayacucho: [[Caracas]] (1986). pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish conquest and early colonization==
[[File:Havana 1639b.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A [[watercolor]] painting of Havana Bay, {{circa|1639}}]]
Christopher Columbus, on [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|his first Spanish-sponsored voyage to the Americas]] in 1492, sailed south from what is now the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] to explore the northeast coast of Cuba and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]]. Columbus, who was searching for a route to India, believed the island to be a peninsula of the Asian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Worlds of Christopher Columbus|author=Carla Rahn Phillips|edition=reprint, illustrated|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-44652-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVAxgY0sUpEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA205 205]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVAxgY0sUpEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Mapping of Southeast Asia|author=Thomas Suarez|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=1999|isbn=978-962-593-470-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7ZMAbv_jAC&amp;pg=PA109 109]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZG7ZMAbv_jAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first sighting of a Spanish ship approaching the island was on 28 October 1492, probably at Bariay, [[Holguín Province]], on the eastern point of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;&gt;[[Richard Gott|Gott, Richard]] (2004). ''Cuba: A new history''. Yale University Press. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a second voyage in 1494, Columbus passed along the south coast of the island, landing at various inlets including what was to become [[Guantánamo Bay]]. With the [[Inter caetera|Papal Bull of 1493]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] commanded Spain to conquer, colonize and convert the [[Paganism|pagans]] of the [[New World]] to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. Blackwell Publishers. pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival, Columbus observed the Taíno dwellings, describing them as &quot;looking like tents in a camp. All were of palm branches, beautifully constructed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Fletcher Johnson (1920). ''The History of Cuba'' (Volume 1). New York. p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish began to create permanent settlements on the island of [[Hispaniola]], east of Cuba, soon after Columbus' arrival in the Caribbean, but the coast of Cuba was not fully mapped by Europeans until 1509, when [[Sebastián de Ocampo]] completed this task.&lt;ref name=&quot;historia_naval&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipen.org.br/webpages/noticiasS.htm |title=Historia de la Construcción Naval en Cuba |access-date=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508202135/http://www.ipen.org.br/webpages/noticiasS.htm |archive-date=8 May 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1511, [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] set out from Hispaniola to form the first Spanish settlement in Cuba, with orders from Spain to conquer the island. The settlement was at Baracoa, but the new settlers were greeted with stiff resistance from the local Taíno population. The Taínos were initially organized by ''[[cacique]]'' (chieftain) [[Hatuey]], who had himself relocated from Hispaniola to escape the brutalities of Spanish rule on that island. After a prolonged [[guerrilla]] campaign, Hatuey and successive chieftains were captured and burnt alive, and within three years the Spanish had gained control of the island. In 1514, a settlement was founded in what was to become [[Havana]].

Clergyman [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] observed a number of massacres initiated by the invaders as the Spanish swept over the island, notably the massacre near [[Camagüey]] of the inhabitants of Caonao. According to his account, some three thousand villagers had traveled to Manzanillo to greet the Spanish with loaves, fishes and other foodstuffs, and were &quot;without provocation, butchered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Las Casas, ''A Short Account'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving indigenous groups fled to the mountains or the small surrounding islands before being captured and forced into reservations. One such reservation was [[Guanabacoa]], which is today a suburb of Havana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1&quot;&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom'' (2nd edition). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hatuey monument, Baracoa, Cuba.JPG|thumb|200px|A monument to the Taíno chieftain Hatuey in [[Baracoa]], Cuba]]
In 1513, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] issued a decree establishing the ''[[encomienda]]'' land settlement system that was to be incorporated throughout the Spanish Americas. Velázquez, who had become Governor of Cuba relocating from Baracoa to [[Santiago de Cuba]], was given the task of apportioning both the land and the indigenous peoples to groups throughout the new colony. The scheme was not a success, however, as the natives either succumbed to diseases brought from Spain such as [[measles]] and [[smallpox]], or simply refused to work, preferring to slip away into the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;/&gt; Desperate for labor to toil the new agricultural settlements, the Conquistadors sought slaves from surrounding islands and the continental mainland. However, these new arrivals followed the indigenous peoples by also dispersing into the wilderness or dying of disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gott&quot;/&gt;

Despite the difficult relations between the natives and the new Europeans, some cooperation was in evidence. The Spanish were shown by the natives how to nurture [[tobacco]] and consume it in the form of [[cigar]]s. There were also many unions between the largely male Spanish colonists and indigenous women. Modern-day studies have revealed traces of DNA that renders physical traits similar to Amazonian tribes in individuals throughout Cuba,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/41/310.html &quot;Cuban Site Casts Light on an Extinct People&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905230020/http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/41/310.html |date=5 September 2006 }}. Anthony DePalma. ''The New York Times''. 5 July 1998. Retrieved 8 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; although the native population was largely destroyed as a culture and civilization after 1550. Under the Spanish New Laws of 1552, indigenous Cuban were freed from ''encomienda'', and seven towns for indigenous peoples were set up. There are indigenous descendant Cuban ([[Taíno]]) families in several places, mostly in eastern Cuba. The indigenous community at Caridad de los Indios, Guantánamo, is one such nucleus. An association of indigenous families in Jiguani, near Santiago, is also active. The local indigenous population also left their mark on the language, with some 400 Taíno terms and place-names surviving to the present day. The name of ''Cuba'' itself, ''Havana'', ''Camagüey'', and many others were derived from Classic Taíno, and indigenous words such as ''tobacco'', ''hurricane'' and ''canoe'' were transferred to English and are used today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas1&quot;/&gt;

==Arrival of African slaves==

{{Main|Slavery in Cuba}}
The Spanish established [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]] as Cuba's primary products, and the island soon supplanted Hispaniola as the prime Spanish base in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bakewell. ''A History of Latin America''. Bakewell Books. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Further field labor was required. African [[Slavery in Latin America|slaves]] were then imported to work the plantations as field labor. However, restrictive Spanish trade laws made it difficult for Cubans to keep up with the 17th and 18th century advances in processing [[sugar cane]] pioneered in British [[History of Barbados|Barbados]] and French [[Saint-Domingue]] ([[Haiti]]). Spain also restricted Cuba's access to the [[slave trade]], which was dominated by the British, French, and Dutch. One important turning point came in the [[Seven Years' War]], when the British conquered the port of Havana and introduced thousands of slaves in a ten-month period. Another key event was the [[Haitian Revolution]] in nearby Saint-Domingue, from 1791 to 1804. Thousands of French refugees, fleeing the slave rebellion in Saint Domingue, brought slaves and expertise in sugar refining and [[coffee]] growing into eastern Cuba in the 1790s and early 19th century.

In the 19th century, Cuban sugar plantations became the most important world producer of sugar, thanks to the expansion of slavery and a relentless focus on improving the island's sugar technology. Use of modern refining techniques was especially important because the British [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] abolished the slave trade in the [[British Empire]] (but slavery itself remained legal until the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]). Cubans were torn between desire for the profits generated by sugar and a repugnance for slavery, which they saw as morally, politically, and racially dangerous to their society. By the end of the 19th century, slavery was abolished.

However, prior to the abolition of slavery, Cuba gained great prosperity from its [[sugar trade]]. Originally, the Spanish had ordered regulations on trade with Cuba, which kept the island from becoming a dominant sugar producer. The Spanish were interested in keeping their trade routes and slave trade routes protected. Nevertheless, Cuba's vast size and abundance of natural resources made it an ideal place for becoming a booming sugar producer. When Spain opened the Cuban trade ports, it quickly became a popular place. New technology allowed a much more effective and efficient means of producing sugar. They began to use water mills, enclosed furnaces, and steam engines to produce higher-quality sugar at a much more efficient pace than elsewhere in the Caribbean.

The boom in Cuba's sugar industry in the 19th century made it necessary for the country to improve its transportation infrastructure. Planters needed safe and efficient ways to transport the sugar from the plantations to the ports, in order to maximize their returns. Many new roads were built, and old roads were quickly repaired. Railroads were built relatively early, easing the collection and transportation of perishable sugar cane. It was now possible for plantations all over this large island to have their sugar shipped quickly and easily.

===Sugar plantations===
Cuba failed to prosper before the 1760s, due to Spanish trade regulations. Spain had set up a trade [[monopoly]] in the Caribbean, and their primary objective was to protect this, which they did by barring the islands from trading with any foreign ships. The resultant stagnation of economic growth was particularly pronounced in Cuba because of its great strategic importance in the Caribbean, and the stranglehold that Spain kept on it as a result.

As soon as Spain opened Cuba's ports up to foreign ships, a great sugar boom began that lasted until the 1880s. The island was perfect for growing sugar, being dominated by rolling plains, with rich soil and adequate rainfall. By 1860, Cuba was devoted to growing sugar, having to import all other necessary goods. Cuba was particularly dependent on the United States, which bought 82 percent of its sugar. In 1820, Spain abolished the slave trade, hurting the Cuban economy even more and forcing planters to buy more expensive, illegal, and troublesome slaves (as demonstrated by the slave rebellion on the Spanish ship ''[[Amistad (case)|Amistad]]'' in 1839).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amistad.mysticseaport.org/discovery/story/havana.html|title=The Cuban Slave Market|publisher=MysticSeaport.org|accessdate=24 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408140417/http://amistad.mysticseaport.org/discovery/story/havana.html|archive-date=8 April 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 16th–18th centuries: Cuba under attack==
[[File:El Morro.jpg|250px|thumb|The fortress of [[Morro Castle (Havana)|El Morro]] in Havana, built in 1589]]
[[File:British fleet entering Havana.jpg|thumb|250px|''The British Fleet Entering Havana, 21 August 1762'', a 1775 painting by [[Dominic Serres]] ]]
Colonial Cuba was a frequent target of [[buccaneer]]s, [[pirate]]s and [[French corsairs]] seeking Spain's [[New World]] riches. In response to repeated raids, defenses were bolstered throughout the island during the 16th century. In Havana, the fortress of [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro]] was built to deter potential invaders, which included the English [[privateer]] [[Francis Drake]], who sailed within sight of Havana harbor but did not disembark on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drake&quot;&gt;Gott, Richard (2004). ''Cuba: A new history''. Yale University Press. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Havana's inability to resist invaders was dramatically exposed in 1628, when a Dutch fleet led by [[Piet Heyn]] plundered the Spanish ships in the city's harbor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyn and Myngs&quot;&gt;Gott, Richard (2004). ''Cuba: A new history''. Yale University Press. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1662, English admiral and pirate [[Christopher Myngs]] captured and briefly occupied [[Santiago de Cuba]] on the eastern part of the island, in an effort to open up Cuba's protected trade with neighboring [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heyn and Myngs&quot;/&gt;

Nearly a century later, the English were to invade in earnest, taking [[Guantánamo Bay]] in 1741 during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] with Spain. [[Edward Vernon]], the British admiral who devised the scheme, saw his 4,000 occupying troops capitulate to local [[guerrilla]] resistance, and more critically, an epidemic, forcing him to withdraw his fleet to British-owned Jamaica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vernon&quot;&gt;Gott, Richard (2004). ''Cuba: A new history''. Yale University Press. pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], the British carried out unsuccessful attacks against Santiago de Cuba [[Invasion of Cuba (1741)|in 1741]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba (1748)|again in 1748]]. Additionally, a skirmish between British and Spanish naval squadrons occurred [[Battle of Havana (1748)|near Havana in 1748]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vernon&quot;/&gt;

The [[Seven Years' War]], which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege&quot;&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The arrival of the British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Food, horses and other goods flooded into the city, and thousands of slaves from West Africa were transported to the island to work on the undermanned sugar plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege&quot;/&gt;

Though Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and closening ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants fearing a decline in sugar prices forced a series of negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba on France's recommendation to Spain, The French advised that declining the offer could result in Spain losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siege&quot;/&gt; This led to disappointment in Britain, as many believed that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].

==The 19th century: Years of upheaval==
{{See also|History of Cuban nationality}}
In the early 19th century, three major political currents took shape in Cuba: '''reformism''', '''annexation''' and '''independence'''. In addition, there were spontaneous and isolated actions carried out from time to time, adding a current of '''abolitionism'''. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by the [[Thirteen Colonies|13 British colonies]] of North America, and the victory of the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, influenced early Cuban liberation movements, as did the [[Haitian Revolution|successful revolt]] of black slaves in [[Haiti]] in 1791. One of the first, headed by a free [[Black people|black]], Nicolás Morales, was aimed at gaining equality between &quot;mulatto and whites&quot; and the abolition of sales taxes and other fiscal burdens. Morales' plot was discovered in 1795 in [[Bayamo]], and the conspirators were jailed.

===Reform, autonomy and separatist movements===
As a result of the political upheavals caused by the [[Peninsular War|Iberian Peninsular War]] and the removal of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] from the Spanish throne, a western separatist rebellion emerged among the Cuban Creole aristocracy in 1809 and 1810. One of its leaders, Joaquín Infante, drafted Cuba's first [[constitution]], declaring the island a sovereign state, presuming the rule of the country's wealthy, maintaining slavery as long as it was necessary for agriculture, establishing a social classification based on skin color and declaring [[Catholicism]] the official religion. This conspiracy also failed and the main leaders were sentenced to prison and deported to Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;xrhsoz&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José and Juan Jacobin (1998). ''History of Cuba: The Challenge of the Yoke and the Star: Biography of a People''. Havana: Editoral SI-MAR. {{ISBN|959-7054-19-1}}. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1812, a mixed-race abolitionist conspiracy arose, organized by [[José Antonio Aponte]], a free black carpenter in Havana. He and others were executed.

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], and the legislation passed by the [[Cádiz Cortes]] after it was set up in 1808, created a number of liberal political and commercial policies, which were welcomed in Cuba but also curtailed a number of older liberties. Between 1810 and 1814, the island elected six representatives to the Cortes, in addition to forming a locally elected Provincial Deputation.&lt;ref&gt;Rieu-Millan, Marie Laure (1990). ''Los diputados americanos en las Cortes de Cádiz: Igualdad o independencia.'' Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas. p. 41. {{ISBN|978-84-00-07091-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the liberal regime and the Constitution proved to be ephemeral: they were suppressed by Ferdinand VII when he returned to the throne in 1814. Therefore, by the end of the decade, some Cubans were inspired by the successes of [[Simón Bolívar]] in South America, despite the fact that the Spanish Constitution was restored in 1820. Numerous secret societies emerged, of which the most important was the so-called &quot;[[:es:Soles y Rayos de Bolívar|Soles y Rayos de Bolívar]]&quot;, founded in 1821 and led by [[José Francisco Lemus]]. Its aim was to establish the free [[Republic of Cubanacán]], and it had branches in five districts of the island. In 1823, the society's leaders were arrested and condemned to exile. In the same year, Ferdinand VII, with French help and the approval of the [[Quintuple Alliance]], managed to abolish constitutional rule in Spain yet again and re-establish [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. As a result, the national militia of Cuba, established by the Constitution and a potential instrument for liberal agitation, was dissolved, a permanent executive military commission under the orders of the governor was created, newspapers were closed, elected provincial representatives were removed and other liberties suppressed.

This suppression, and the success of independence movements in the former Spanish colonies on the North American mainland, led to a notable rise of Cuban nationalism. A number of independence conspiracies took place during the 1820s and 1830s, but all failed. Among these were the &quot;Expedición de los Trece&quot; (Expedition of the 13) in 1826, the &quot;Gran Legión del Aguila Negra&quot; (Great Legion of the Black Eagle) in 1829, the &quot;Cadena Triangular&quot; (Triangular Chain) and the &quot;Soles de la Libertad&quot; (Suns of Liberty) in 1837. Leading national figures in these years included [[Félix Varela]] and Cuba's first revolutionary poet, [[José María Heredia]].&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, José Cantón (1998). ''History of Cuba''. La Habana. pp. 36–38. {{ISBN|959-7054-19-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antislavery and independence movements===
In 1826, the first armed uprising for independence took place in Puerto Príncipe ([[Camagüey Province]]), led by Francisco de Agüero and Andrés Manuel Sánchez. Agüero, a white man, and Sánchez, a [[mulatto]], were both executed, becoming the first popular martyrs of the Cuban independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Geoff: Cuba. From Conquistador to Castro, London 1996, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1830s also saw a surge of activity from the reformist movement, whose main leader was José Antonio Saco, standing out for his criticism of Spanish despotism and the slave trade. Nevertheless, this surge bore no fruit; Cubans remained deprived of the right to send representatives to the Spanish parliament, and [[Madrid]] stepped up repression.

Nonetheless, Spain had long been under pressure to end the slave trade. In 1817, it signed a first treaty, to which it did not adhere. With the abolition of slavery altogether in their colonies, the British forced Spain to sign another treaty in 1835. In this context, black revolts in Cuba increased, and were put down with mass executions. One of the most significant was the ''Conspiración de La Escalera'' (Ladder Conspiracy), which started in March 1843 and continued until 1844. The conspiracy took its name from a torture method, in which blacks were tied to a ladder and whipped until they confessed or died. The Ladder Conspiracy involved free blacks and slaves, as well as white intellectuals and professionals. It is estimated that 300 blacks and mulattos died from torture, 78 were executed, over 600 were imprisoned and over 400 expelled from the island.&lt;ref name = &quot;kotrhz&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José (1998).

Following the 1868–1878 rebellion of the [[Ten Years' War]], all slavery was abolished by 1886, making Cuba the second-to-last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, with Brazil being the last. Instead of blacks, slave traders looked for others sources of cheap labour, such as Chinese colonists and Indians from [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]]. Another feature of the population was the number of Spanish-born colonists, known as ''peninsulares'', who were mostly adult males; they constituted between ten and twenty per cent of the population between the middle of the 19th century and the [[Great Depression|great depression of the 1930s]].

===The possibility of annexation by the United States===
{{also|Ostend manifesto}}
Black unrest and attempts by the Spanish metropolis to abolish slavery motivated many Creoles to advocate Cuba's annexation by the United States, where slavery was still legal. Other Cubans supported the idea due to their desire for American-style economic development and democratic freedom. The annexation of Cuba was repeatedly proposed by government officials in the United States. In 1805, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] considered annexing Cuba for strategic reasons, sending secret agents to the island to negotiate with [[Salvador José de Muro, 2nd Marquis of Someruelos|Captain General Someruelos]].

In April 1823, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] discussed the rules of political gravitation, in a theory often referred to as the &quot;ripe fruit theory&quot;. Adams wrote, &quot;There are laws of political as well as physical gravitation; and if an apple severed by its native tree cannot choose but fall to the ground, Cuba, forcibly disjoined from its own unnatural connection with Spain, and incapable of self-support, can gravitate only towards the North American Union which by the same law of nature, cannot cast her off its bosom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, Chauncey Ford (2001). ''Writings of John Quincy Adams'' (vol. VII). Boston, Massachusetts. p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore warned that &quot;the transfer of Cuba to Great Britain would be an event unpropitious to the interest of this Union&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, Chauncey Ford (2001). ''Writings of John Quincy Adams'' (vol. VII). Boston, Massachusetts. p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams voiced concern that a country outside of North America would attempt to occupy Cuba upon its separation from Spain. He wrote, &quot;The question both of our right and our power to prevent it, if necessary, by force, already obtrudes itself upon our councils, and the administration is called upon, in the performance of its duties to the nation, at least to use all the means with the competency to guard against and forfend it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, Chauncey Ford (2001). ''Writings of John Quincy Adams'' (vol. VII). Boston, Massachusetts. p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 1823, U.S. President [[James Monroe]] specifically addressed Cuba and other European colonies in his proclamation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. Cuba, located just {{convert|94|mi}} from [[Key West]], Florida, was of interest to the doctrine's founders, as they warned European forces to leave &quot;America for the Americans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Díez de Medina, Raúl (1934). ''Autopsy of the Monroe doctrine: The strange story of inter-American relations''. New York. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most outstanding attempts in support of annexation were made by the [[Venezuela]]n [[filibuster (military)|filibuster]] General [[Narciso López]], who prepared four expeditions to Cuba in the US. The first two, in 1848 and 1849, failed before departure due to U.S. opposition. The third, made up of some 600 men, managed to land in Cuba and take the central city of [[Cárdenas, Cuba|Cárdenas]], but failed eventually due to a lack of popular support. López's fourth expedition landed in [[Pinar del Río]] province with around 400 men in August 1851; the invaders were defeated by Spanish troops and López was executed.

===Resumption of independence struggle===
{{See also|Little War (Cuba)}}
In the 1860s, Cuba had two more liberal-minded governors, Serrano and Dulce, who encouraged the creation of a Reformist Party, despite the fact that political parties were forbidden. But they were followed by a reactionary governor, Francisco Lersundi, who suppressed all liberties granted by the previous governors and maintained a pro-slavery regime.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 October 1868, the landowner [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]] declared Cuban independence and freedom for his slaves. This began the [[Ten Years' War]], which lasted from 1868 to 1878, and eventually contributed to the abolition of slavery in 1886.

==1895–98: War of Independence==
{{Main|Cuban War of Independence}}

===Build-up to the war===

====Social, political, and economic change====
During the time of the so-called &quot;Rewarding Truce&quot;, which encompassed the 17&amp;nbsp;years from the end of the Ten Years' War in 1878, fundamental changes took place in Cuban society. With the abolition of slavery in October 1886, former slaves joined the ranks of farmers and urban working class. Most wealthy Cubans lost their rural properties, and many of them joined the urban middle class. The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased, with only companies and the most powerful plantation owners owning them. The numbers of [[Peasant|campesinos]] and tenant farmers rose considerably. Furthermore, American [[capital (economics)|capital]] began flowing into Cuba, mostly into the sugar and tobacco businesses and mining. By 1895, these investments totalled $50&amp;nbsp;million. Although Cuba remained Spanish politically, economically it became increasingly dependent on the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes also entailed the rise of labour movements. The first Cuban labour organization, the Cigar Makers Guild, was created in 1878, followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879, and many more across the island.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad, a new trend of aggressive American influence emerged, evident in Secretary of State [[James G. Blaine]]'s expressed belief that all of Central and South America would some day fall to the US. Blaine placed particular importance on the control of Cuba. &quot;That rich island&quot;, he wrote on 1 December 1881, &quot;the key to the Gulf of Mexico, is, though in the hands of Spain, a part of the American commercial system…If ever ceasing to be Spanish, Cuba must necessarily become American and not fall under any other European domination&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/scaw/scaw1.htm |title=Spanish-Cuban-American War - History of Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416011747/http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/scaw/scaw1.htm |archive-date=16 April 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaine's vision did not allow the existence of an independent Cuba.&lt;ref name = &quot;wfbftj&quot;/&gt;

====Martí's insurrection and the start of the war====
After his second deportation to Spain in 1878, the pro-independence Cuban activist [[José Martí]] moved to the United States in 1881, where he began mobilizing the support of the Cuban exile community in Florida, especially in [[Ybor City]] in Tampa and [[Key West]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald E. Poyo, ''With All, and for the Good of All: The Emergence of Popular Nationalism in the Cuban Communities of the United States, 1848–1898'' (Duke University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; He sought a revolution and Cuban independence from Spain, but also lobbied to oppose U.S. annexation of Cuba, which some American and Cuban politicians desired. Propaganda efforts continued for years and intensified starting in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Auxier, &quot;The propaganda activities of the Cuban Junta in precipitating the Spanish–American War, 1895–1898.&quot; ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 19.3 (1939): 286-305. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2507259 in JSTOR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720165657/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2507259 |date=20 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schellings, William J. &quot;Florida and the Cuban Revolution, 1895–1898.&quot; ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (1960): 175-186.

After deliberations with patriotic clubs across the United States, the Antilles and Latin America, the ''Partido Revolucionario Cubano'' (Cuban Revolutionary Party) was officially proclaimed on 10 April 1892, with the purpose of gaining independence for both Cuba and Puerto Rico. Martí was elected delegate, the highest party position. By the end of 1894, the basic conditions for launching the revolution were set.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In Foner's words, &quot;Martí's impatience to start the revolution for independence was affected by his growing fear that the United States would succeed in annexing Cuba before the revolution could liberate the island from Spain&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;wfbftj&quot;&gt;Foner, Philip: ''The Spanish-Cuban-American War and the Birth of American Imperialism''. Quoted in: [http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/scaw/scaw1.htm &quot;The War for Cuban Independence&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416011747/http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/scaw/scaw1.htm |date=16 April 2008 }}. HistoryofCuba.com. Retrieved 27 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 1894, three ships, the ''Lagonda'', the ''Almadis'' and the ''Baracoa'', set sail for Cuba from Fernandina Beach, Florida, loaded with armed men and supplies. Two of the ships were seized by U.S. authorities in early January, who also alerted the Spanish government, but the proceedings went ahead. The insurrection began on 24 February 1895, with uprisings all across the island. In Oriente the most important ones took place in Santiago, Guantánamo, Jiguaní, San Luis, El Cobre, El Caney, Alto Songo, Bayate and Baire. The uprisings in the central part of the island, such as Ibarra, Jagüey Grande and Aguada, suffered from poor co-ordination and failed; the leaders were captured, some of them deported and some executed. In the province of Havana the insurrection was discovered before it got off and the leaders detained. Thus, the insurgents further west in Pinar del Río were ordered to wait.

Martí, on his way to Cuba, gave the Proclamation of Montecristi in [[Santo Domingo]], outlining the policy for Cuba's war of independence: the war was to be waged by blacks and whites alike; participation of all blacks was crucial for victory; Spaniards who did not object to the war effort should be spared, private rural properties should not be damaged; and the revolution should bring new economic life to Cuba.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 and 11 April 1895, the main rebel leaders landed on two expeditions in Oriente: Major Antonio Maceo and 22 members near [[Baracoa]] and Martí, [[Máximo Gomez]] and four other members in Playitas. Around that time, Spanish forces in Cuba numbered about 80,000, of which 20,000 were regular troops, and 60,000 were Spanish and Cuban volunteers. The latter were a locally enlisted force that took care of most of the ''guard and police'' duties on the island. Wealthy landowners would ''volunteer'' a number of their slaves to serve in this force, which was under local control and not under official military command. By December, 98,412 regular troops had been sent to the island and the number of volunteers had increased to 63,000 men. By the end of 1897, there were 240,000 regulars and 60,000 irregulars on the island. The revolutionaries were far outnumbered.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;

The rebels came to be nicknamed &quot;Mambis&quot; after a black Spanish officer, Juan Ethninius Mamby, who joined the Dominicans in the fight for independence in 1846. The Spanish soldiers referred to the Dominican insurgents as &quot;the men of Mamby&quot; and &quot;Mambis&quot;. When the Ten Years' War broke out in 1868, some of the same soldiers were assigned to Cuba, importing what had by then become a derogatory Spanish slur. The Cubans adopted the name with pride.

After the Ten Years' War, possession of weapons by private individuals was prohibited in Cuba. Thus, one of the most serious and persistent problems for the rebels was a shortage of suitable weapons. This lack of arms forced them to utilise [[guerrilla]] tactics, using the environment, the element of surprise, fast horses and simple weapons such as machetes. Most of their firearms were acquired in raids on the Spaniards. Between 11 June 1895 and 30 November 1897, 60 attempts were made to bring weapons and supplies to the rebels from outside Cuba, but only one succeeded, largely due to British naval protection. 28 of these resupply attempts were halted within U.S. territory, five were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, four by the Spanish Navy, two were wrecked, one was driven back to port by a storm, and the fate of another is unknown.&lt;ref name = &quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;

===Escalation of the war===

Martí was killed shortly after his landing at Dos Rios on 19 May 1895, but Máximo Gomez and Antonio Maceo fought on, taking the war to all parts of Oriente. By the end of June all of Camagüey was at war. Continuing west, Gomez and Maceo joined up with veterans of the 1868 war, Polish internationalists, General [[Carlos Roloff]] and Serafín Sánchez in Las Villas, swelling their ranks and boosting their arsenal. In mid-September, representatives of the five Liberation Army Corps assembled in [[Jimaguayú]], Camagüey, to approve the Jimaguayú Constitution. This constitution established a central government, which grouped the executive and legislative powers into one entity, the Government Council, which was headed by [[Salvador Cisneros]] and [[Bartolomé Masó]].

After a period of consolidation in the three eastern provinces, the liberation armies headed for Camagüey and then for [[Matanzas]], outmanoeuvring and deceiving the Spanish Army several times. The revolutionaries defeated the Spanish general [[Arsenio Martínez Campos]], himself the victor of the Ten Years' War, and killed his most trusted general at [[Peralejo]]. Campos tried the same strategy he had employed in the Ten Years' War, constructing a broad defensive belt across the island, about {{convert|80|km}} long and {{convert|200|m}} wide. This line, called the ''trocha'', was intended to limit rebel activities to the eastern provinces, and consisted of a [[railroad]], from Jucaro in the south to Moron in the north, on which armored railcars could travel. At various points along this railroad there were fortifications, at intervals of {{convert|12|m}} there were posts and at intervals of {{convert|400|m}} there was barbed wire. In addition, [[booby trap]]s were placed at the locations most likely to be attacked.

For the rebels, it was essential to bring the war to the western provinces of Matanzas, Havana and Pinar del Río, where the island's government and wealth was located. The Ten Years' War failed because it had not managed to proceed beyond the eastern provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt; In a successful cavalry campaign, overcoming the ''trochas'', the rebels invaded every province. Surrounding all the larger cities and well-fortified towns, they arrived at the westernmost tip of the island on 22 January 1896, exactly three months after the invasion near Baraguá.&lt;ref name=spanamwar-timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/timeline.htm|title=Spanish American War Chronology|publisher=SpanAmWar.com|accessdate=30 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023061035/http://www.spanamwar.com/timeline.htm|archive-date=23 October 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weyler reconcentrados.png|thumb|Cuban victims of Spanish reconcentration policies]]
Campos was replaced by Gen. [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí|Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau]] (nicknamed ''The Butcher''), who reacted to these rebel successes by introducing terror methods: periodic executions, mass exiles, and the destruction of farms and crops. These methods reached their height on 21 October 1896, when he ordered all countryside residents and their livestock to gather in various fortified areas and towns occupied by his troops within eight days. Hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their homes, creating appalling conditions of overcrowding in the towns and cities. This was the first recorded and recognized use of Concentration Camps where non-combatants were removed from their land to deprive the enemy of succor and then the internees were subjected to appalling conditions. Spain carried out similar action is the Philippines shortly after, again resulting in massive non combatant fatalities.  It is estimated that this measure caused the death of at least one-third of Cuba's rural population.&lt;ref&gt;Canalejas, José in Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The forced relocation policy was maintained until March 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;wqswxw&quot;/&gt;

Since the early 1880s, Spain had also been suppressing an independence movement in the [[Philippines]], which was intensifying; Spain was thus now fighting two wars, which placed a heavy burden on its economy. In secret negotiations in 1896, Spain turned down the United States' offers to buy Cuba.

Maceo was killed on 7 December 1896, in Havana province, while returning from the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/maceodeath.htm|title=The Death Of Cuban General Antonio Maceo|publisher=SpanAmWar.com|accessdate=2 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108015028/http://www.spanamwar.com/maceodeath.htm|archive-date=8 November 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued, the major obstacle to Cuban success was weapons supply. Although weapons and funding came from within the United States, the supply operation violated American laws, which were enforced by the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]]; of 71 resupply missions, only 27 got through, with 5 being stopped by the Spanish and 33 by the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/chadwickcoastguard.htm|title=The Role of US Coast Guard 1895–1898 before entry of US in the war|author=French Ensor Chadwick|publisher=SpanAmWar.com|accessdate=2 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108014338/http://www.spanamwar.com/chadwickcoastguard.htm|archive-date=8 November 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the liberation army maintained a privileged position in Camagüey and Oriente, where the Spanish only controlled a few cities. Spanish liberal leader Praxedes Sagasta admitted in May 1897: &quot;After having sent 200,000 men and shed so much blood, we don't own more land on the island than what our soldiers are stepping on&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel force of 3,000 defeated the Spanish in various encounters, such as the battle of La Reforma and the surrender of Las Tunas on 30 August, and the Spaniards were kept on the defensive. Las Tunas had been guarded by over 1,000 well-armed and well-supplied men.

As stipulated at the Jimaguayú Assembly two years earlier, a second Constituent Assembly met in La Yaya, Camagüey, on 10 October 1897. The newly adopted constitution decreed that a military command be subordinated to civilian rule. The government was confirmed, naming Bartolomé Masó as president and Domingo Méndez Capote as vice president. Thereafter, [[Madrid]] decided to change its policy toward Cuba, replacing Weyler, drawing up a colonial constitution for Cuba and [[Puerto Rico]], and installing a new government in Havana. But with half the country out of its control, and the other half in arms, the new government was powerless and rejected by the rebels.

===The ''Maine'' incident===
[[File:USSMaine.jpg|thumb|285px|right|The wreckage of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']], photographed in 1898]]
The Cuban struggle for independence had captured the North American imagination for years and newspapers had been agitating for intervention with sensational stories of Spanish atrocities against the native Cuban population. Americans came to believe that Cuba's battle with Spain resembled United States's Revolutionary War. This continued even after Spain replaced Weyler and said it changed its policies, and the North American public opinion was very much in favor of intervening in favor of the Cubans.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1898, a riot by Cuban-Spanish loyalists against the new autonomous government broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which published articles critical of the Spanish Army. The U.S. Consul-General cabled Washington, fearing for the lives of Americans living in Havana. In response, the battleship {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} was sent to [[Havana]] in the last week of January. On 15 February 1898, the ''Maine'' was destroyed by an explosion, killing 268 crewmembers. The cause of the explosion has not been clearly established to this day, but the incident focused American attention on Cuba, and President [[William McKinley]] and his supporters could not stop Congress from declaring war to &quot;liberate&quot; Cuba.

In an attempt to appease the United States, the colonial government took two steps that had been demanded by President McKinley: it ended the forced relocation policy and offered negotiations with the independence fighters. However, the truce was rejected by the rebels and the concessions proved too late and too ineffective. Madrid asked other European powers for help; they refused and said Spain should back down.

On 11 April 1898, McKinley asked Congress for authority to send U.S. troops to Cuba for the purpose of ending the civil war there. On 19 April, Congress passed [[joint resolution]]s (by a vote of 311 to 6 in the House and 42 to 35 in the Senate) supporting Cuban independence and disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba, demanding Spanish withdrawal, and authorizing the president to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuban patriots gain independence from Spain. This was adopted by resolution of Congress and included from Senator [[Henry Teller]] the [[Teller Amendment]], which passed unanimously, stipulating that &quot;the island of Cuba is, and by right should be, free and independent&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;webhmz&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment disclaimed any intention on the part of the United States to exercise jurisdiction or control over Cuba for other than pacification reasons, and confirmed that the armed forces would be removed once the war is over. Senate and Congress passed the amendment on 19 April, McKinley signed the joint resolution on 20 April and the ultimatum was forwarded to Spain. War was declared on 20/21 April 1898.

&quot;It's been suggested that a major reason for the U.S. war against Spain was the fierce competition emerging between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal&quot;, Joseph E.

==The Cuban theatre of the Spanish–American War==
{{Main|Spanish–American War}}

Hostilities started hours after the declaration of war when a U.S. contingent under Admiral William T. Sampson blockaded several Cuban ports. The Americans decided to invade Cuba and to start in Oriente where the Cubans had almost absolute control and were able to co-operate, for example, by establishing a [[beachhead]] and protecting the U.S. landing in Daiquiri. The first U.S. objective was to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba in order to destroy Linares' army and Cervera's fleet. To reach Santiago they had to pass through concentrated Spanish defences in the San Juan Hills and a small town in [[El Caney]]. Between 22 and 24 June 1898 the Americans landed under General [[William R. Shafter]] at [[Daiquirí]] and [[Siboney, Cuba|Siboney]], east of Santiago, and established a base. The port of Santiago became the main target of U.S. naval operations, and the American fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. Nearby [[Guantánamo Bay]], with its excellent harbour, was chosen for this purpose and [[1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay|attacked on 6 June]]. The [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]], on 3 July 1898, was the largest naval engagement during the Spanish–American War, and resulted in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron.

Resistance in Santiago consolidated around Fort Canosa,&lt;ref&gt;Daley#, L. (2000). ''El Fortin Canosa en la Cuba del 1898. in Los Ultimos Dias del Comienzo. Ensayos sobre la Guerra Hispano-Cubana-Estadounidense.'' B. E. Aguirre and E. Espina (eds.). RiL Editores: Santiago de Chile. pp. 161–71.&lt;/ref&gt; while major battles between Spaniards and Americans took place [[Battle of Las Guasimas|at Las Guasimas]] on 24 June, and at [[Battle of El Caney|El Caney]] and [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]] on 1 July,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeofheroes.com/wallofhonor/spanish_am/10_sanjuan.html The Battles at El Caney and San Juan Hill] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714045841/http://www.homeofheroes.com/wallofhonor/spanish_am/10_sanjuan.html |date=14 July 2013 }}. HomeOfHeroes.com. Retrieved 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; after which the American advance ground to a halt. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago. The Americans and Cubans began a brutal siege of the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Daley|2000|pp=161–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; which surrendered on 16 July after the defeat of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron. Thus, Oriente fell under the control of Americans and the Cubans, but U.S. General [[Nelson A. Miles]] would not allow Cuban troops to enter Santiago, claiming that he wanted to prevent clashes between Cubans and Spaniards. Thus, Cuban General [[Calixto García]], head of the mambi forces in the Eastern department, ordered his troops to hold their respective areas and resigned, writing a letter of protest to General Shafter.&lt;ref name = &quot;webhmz&quot;/&gt;

After losing the Philippines and Puerto Rico, which had also been invaded by the United States, and with no hope of holding on to Cuba, Spain sued for peace on 17 July 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/|title=The Spanish American War Centennial Website!|publisher=spanamwar.com|accessdate=2 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108013101/http://www.spanamwar.com/|archive-date=8 November 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 August, the U.S. and Spain signed a protocol of peace, in which Spain agreed to relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1898, the U.S. and Spain signed the formal [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], recognizing continuing U. S. military occupation.&lt;ref name=ToP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain|date=10 December 1898|publisher=The Avalon project at Yale law School|accessdate=20 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523121634/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|archive-date=23 May 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Cubans had participated in the liberation efforts, the United States prevented Cuba from sending representatives to the Paris peace talks or signing the treaty, which set no time limit for U.S. occupation and excluded the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]] from Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 77&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the U.S. President had no objection to Cuba's eventual independence, U.S. General William R. Shafter refused to allow Cuban General Calixto García and his rebel forces to participate in the [[Santiago Surrender Tree|surrender ceremonies]] in Santiago de Cuba.

==First U.S. occupation and the Platt amendment==
After the last Spanish troops left the island in December 1898, the government of Cuba was temporarily handed over to the United States on 1 January 1899. The first governor was General [[John R. Brooke]]. Unlike [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[Philippines]], the United States did not annex Cuba because of the restrictions imposed in the [[Teller Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.etsu.edu/cas/history/docs/teller.htm|title=The Teller Amendment|year=1898|publisher=East Tennessee State University|accessdate=30 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113180555/http://www.etsu.edu/cas/history/docs/teller.htm|archive-date=13 November 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political changes===
The U.S. administration was undecided on Cuba's future status. Once it had been pried away from the Spaniards it was to be assured that it moved and remained in the U.S. sphere. How this was to be achieved was a matter of intense discussion and annexation was an option, not only on the mainland but also in Cuba. McKinley spoke about the links that should exist between the two nations.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooke set up a civilian government, placed U.S. governors in seven newly created departments, and named civilian governors for the provinces as well as mayors and representatives for the municipalities. Many Spanish colonial government officials were kept in their posts. The population were ordered to disarm and, ignoring the Mambi Army, Brooke created the Rural Guard and municipal police corps at the service of the occupation forces. Cuba's judicial powers and courts remained legally based on the codes of the Spanish government. Tomás Estrada Palma, Martí's successor as delegate of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, dissolved the party a few days after the signing of the Paris Treaty in December 1898, claiming that the objectives of the party had been met. The revolutionary Assembly of Representatives was also dissolved. Thus, the three representative institutions of the national liberation movement disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic changes===
Before the United States officially took over the government, it had already begun cutting tariffs on American goods entering Cuba, without granting the same rights to Cuban goods going to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 75&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Government payments had to be made in U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the Foraker Amendment, which prohibited the U.S. occupation government from granting privileges and concessions to American investors, the Cuban economy was soon dominated by American capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 75&quot;/&gt; The growth of American sugar estates was so quick that in 1905 nearly 10% of Cuba's total land area belonged to American citizens. By 1902, American companies controlled 80% of Cuba's ore exports and owned most of the sugar and cigarette factories.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba''. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the war, there were several serious barriers for foreign businesses attempting to operate in Cuba. Three separate pieces of legislation—the Joint Resolution of 1898, the Teller Amendment, and the Foraker Amendment—threatened foreign investment. The Joint Resolution of 1898 stated that the Cuban people are by right free and independent, while the Teller Amendment further declared that the United States could not annex Cuba. These two pieces of legislation were crucial in appeasing anti-imperialists as the United States intervened in the war in Cuba. Similarly, the Foraker Amendment, which prohibited the U.S. military government from granting concessions to American companies, was passed to appease anti-imperialists during the occupational period. Although these three statutes enabled the United States to gain a foothold in Cuba, they presented obstacles for American businesses to acquire land and permits. Eventually, Cornelius Van Horne of the Cuba Company, an early railroad company in Cuba, found a loophole in &quot;revocable permits&quot; justified by preexisting Spanish legislation that effectively allowed railroads to be built in Cuba. General Leonard Wood, the governor of Cuba and a noted annexationist, used this loophole to grant hundreds of franchises, permits, and other concessions to American businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Juan C. Santamarina. &quot;The Cuba Company and the Expansion of American Business in Cuba, 1898–1915&quot;. ''Business History Review'' 74.01 (Spring 2000): 41–83. pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the legal barriers were overcome, American investments transformed the Cuban economy. Within two years of entering Cuba, the Cuba Company built a 350-mile railroad connecting the eastern port of Santiago to the existing railways in central Cuba. The company was the largest single foreign investment in Cuba for the first two decades of the twentieth century. By the 1910s it was the largest company in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Santamarina 2000, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The improved infrastructure allowed the sugar cane industry to spread to the previously underdeveloped eastern part of the country. As many small Cuban sugar cane producers were crippled with debt and damages from the war, American companies were able to quickly and cheaply take over the sugar cane industry. At the same time, new productive units called centrales could grind up to 2,000 tons of cane a day making large-scale operations most profitable.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1995, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The large fixed cost of these centrales made them almost exclusively accessible to American companies with large capital stocks. Furthermore, the centrales required a large, steady flow of cane to remain profitable, which led to further consolidation in the industry. Cuban cane farmers who had formerly been landowners became tenants on company land, funneling raw cane to the centrales. By 1902, 40% of the country’s sugar production was controlled by North Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1995, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

With American corporate interests firmly rooted in Cuba, the U.S. tariff system was adjusted accordingly to strengthen trade between the nations. The Reciprocity Treaty of 1903 lowered the U.S. tariff on Cuban sugar by 20%. This gave Cuban sugar a competitive edge in the American marketplace. At the same time, it granted equal or greater concessions on most items imported from the United States. Cuban imports of American goods went from $17 million in the five years before the war, to $38 million in 1905, and eventually to over $200 million in 1918. Likewise, Cuban exports to the United States reached $86 million in 1905 and rose to nearly $300 million in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Smith 1995, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections and independence===
Popular demands for a Constituent Assembly soon emerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantón Navarro p. 77&quot;/&gt; In December 1899, the U.S. War Secretary assured the Cuban populace that the occupation was temporary, that municipal and general elections would be held, that a Constituent Assembly would be set up, and that sovereignty would be handed to Cubans. Brooke was replaced by General Leonard Wood to oversee the transition. Parties were created, including the [[Cuban National Party]], the [[Federal Republican Party of Las Villas]], the [[Republican Party of Havana]] and the [[Democratic Union Party (Cuba)|Democratic Union Party]].

[[Cuban local elections, 1900|The first elections]] for mayors, treasurers and attorneys of the country's 110 municipalities for a one-year-term took place on 16 June 1900, but balloting was limited to literate Cubans older than 21 and with properties worth more than $250. Only members of the dissolved Liberation Army were exempt from these conditions. Thus, the number of about 418,000 male citizens over 21 was reduced to about 151,000. 360,000 women were totally excluded. The same elections were held one year later, again for a one-year-term.

Elections for 31 delegates to a Constituent Assembly were held on 15 September 1900 with the same balloting restrictions. In all three elections, pro-independence candidates, including a large number of mambi delegates, won overwhelming majorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;diwapu&quot;&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was drawn up from November 1900 to February 1901 and then passed by the Assembly. It established a republican form of government, proclaimed internationally recognized individual rights and liberties, freedom of religion, [[separation of church and state|separation between church and state]], and described the composition, structure and functions of state powers.

On 2 March 1901, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Army Appropriations Act of 1901 |Army Appropriations Act]], stipulating the conditions for the withdrawal of United States troops remaining in Cuba following the [[Spanish–American War]]. As a [[rider (politics)|rider]], this act included the [[Platt Amendment]], which defined the terms of Cuban-U.S. relations until 1934. It replaced the earlier [[Teller Amendment]]. The amendment provided for a number of rules heavily infringing on Cuba's sovereignty:

* That the government of Cuba shall never enter into any treaty with any foreign power which will impair the independence of Cuba, nor in any manner permit any foreign power to obtain control over any portion of the island.
* That Cuba would contract no [[foreign debt]] without guarantees that the interest could be served from ordinary revenues.
* That Cuba consent that the United States may intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence, to protect life, property, and individual liberty, and to discharging the obligations imposed by the treaty of Paris.
* That the Cuban claim to the Isle of Pines (now called [[Isla de la Juventud]]) was not acknowledged and to be determined by treaty.
* That Cuba commit to providing the United States &quot;lands necessary for coaling or naval stations at certain specified points to be agreed upon&quot;.

As a precondition to Cuba's independence, the United States demanded that this amendment be approved fully and without changes by the Constituent Assembly as an appendix to the new constitution. Faced with this alternative, the appendix was approved, after heated debate, by a margin of four votes. Governor Wood admitted: &quot;Little or no independence had been left to Cuba with the Platt Amendment and the only thing appropriate was to seek annexation&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;diwapu&quot;/&gt;

In the presidential elections of 31 December 1901, [[Tomás Estrada Palma]], a U.S. citizen still living in the United States, was the only candidate. His adversary, General [[Bartolomé Masó]], withdrew his candidacy in protest against U.S. favoritism and the manipulation of the political machine by Palma's followers. Palma was elected to be the Republic's first President, although he only returned to Cuba four months after the election. The U.S. occupation officially ended when Palma took office on 20 May 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Cantón Navarro, José. ''History of Cuba'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuba in the early 20th century==
{{Main|Republic of Cuba (1902–59)}}
In 1902, the United States handed over control to a Cuban government. As a condition of the transfer, the Cuban state had included in its constitution provisions implementing the requirements of the [[Platt Amendment]], which among other things gave the United States the right to intervene militarily in Cuba. [[Havana]] and [[Varadero]] soon became popular tourist resorts. Though some efforts were made to ease Cuba's ethnic tensions through government policies, racism and informal discrimination towards blacks and mestizos remained widespread during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgezarur.com.br/artigos/124/nation-and-multiculturalism-in-cuba-a-comparison-with-the-united-states-and-brazil|title=Nation and Multiculturalism in Cuba: A Comparison with the United States and Brazil|publisher=GeorgeZarur.com.br|year=2005|accessdate=10 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210181228/http://www.georgezarur.com.br/artigos/124/nation-and-multiculturalism-in-cuba-a-comparison-with-the-united-states-and-brazil|archive-date=10 February 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Tomás Estrada Palma]] was elected in 1902, and Cuba was declared independent, though [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]] was leased to the United States as part of the Platt Amendment. The status of the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]] as Cuban territory was left undefined until 1925, when the United States finally recognized Cuban sovereignty over the island. Estrada Palma, a frugal man, governed successfully for his four-year term; yet when he tried to extend his time in office, a revolt ensued.

The [[Second Occupation of Cuba]], also known as the Cuban Pacification, was a major US military operation that began in September 1906. After the collapse of President Palma's regime, US President Roosevelt ordered an invasion and established an occupation that would continue for nearly four years. The stated goal of the operation was to prevent fighting between the Cubans, to protect North American economic interests, and to hold free elections. In 1906, the United States representative [[William Howard Taft]], notably with the personal diplomacy of [[Frederick Funston]], negotiated an end of the successful revolt led by the young general [[Enrique Loynaz del Castillo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/delcastillo.htm|title=A Biography of General Enrique Loynaz del Castillo|publisher=Spanamwar.com|accessdate=2 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108023135/http://www.spanamwar.com/delcastillo.htm|archive-date=8 November 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had served under Antonio Maceo in the final war of independence.

For three decades, the country was led by former [[List of Presidents of Cuba|War of Independence leaders]], who after being elected did not serve more than two constitutional terms. The Cuban presidential succession was as follows: [[José Miguel Gómez]] (1908–1912); [[Mario García Menocal]] (1913–1920); [[Alfredo Zayas]] (1921–25) and [[Gerardo Machado]] (1925–1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/zayas-bio.htm|title=Alfredo Zayas|publisher=Latin American Studies|accessdate=2 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009032359/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/zayas-bio.htm|archive-date=9 October 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Liberal Gómez the participation of Afro-Cubans in the political process was curtailed when the [[Partido Independiente de Color]] was outlawed and bloodily suppressed in 1912, as American troops reentered the country to protect the sugar plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gott, ''Cuba: A New History'', pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Gómez’s successor, Mario Menocal of the Conservative Party, was a former manager for the Cuban American Sugar Corporation. During his presidency income from sugar rose steeply.&lt;ref&gt;Louis A. Pérez, Jr., ''Intervention, Revolution, and Politics in Cuba'', 1913–1921, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Menocal’s reelection in 1916 was met with armed revolt by Gómez and other Liberals (the so-called &quot;Chambelona War&quot;), prompting the United States to send in Marines, again to safeguard American interests. Gómez was defeated and captured and the rebellion was snuffed out.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gott, ''Cuba: A New History'', pp. 127–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Cuba during World War I}}
In World War I, Cuba declared war on [[Imperial Germany]] on 7 April 1917, one day after the United States entered the war. Despite being unable to send troops to fight in Europe, Cuba played a significant role as a base to protect the West Indies from German [[U-boat]] attacks. A draft law was instituted, and 25,000 Cuban troops raised, but the war ended before they could be sent into action.

[[Alfredo Zayas]], who had taken part in the Liberal rebellion of 1916-17, was elected President in 1920 and took office in 1921. When the Cuban financial system collapsed after a drop in sugar prices, Zayas secured a loan from the United States in 1922. Despite the country’s nominal independence, one historian has concluded that the continued U.S. military intervention and economic dominance had once again made Cuba &quot;a colony in all but name.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gott, ''Cuba: A New History'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War I===
President [[Gerardo Machado]] was elected by popular vote in 1925, but he was constitutionally barred from reelection. Machado, determined to modernize Cuba, set in motion several massive civil works projects such as the Central Highway, but at the end of his constitutional term he held on to power. The United States, despite the Platt Amendment, decided not to interfere militarily. The Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) did very little to resist Machado in his dictator phase; however, numerous other groups did. In the late 1920s and early 1930s a number of Cuban action groups, including some Mambí, staged a series of uprisings that either failed or did not affect the capital.

The [[Sergeants' Revolt]] undermined the institutions and coercive structures of the oligarchic state. The young and relatively inexperienced revolutionaries found themselves pushed into the halls of state power by worker and peasant mobilisations. Between September 1933 and January 1934 a loose coalition of radical activists, students, middle-class intellectuals, and disgruntled lower-rank soldiers formed a Provisional Revolutionary Government. This coalition was directed by a popular university professor, Dr [[Ramón Grau San Martín]]. The Grau government promised a 'new Cuba' with social justice for all classes, and the abrogation of the Platt Amendment. While the revolutionary leaders certainly wanted diplomatic recognition by Washington, they believed their legitimacy stemmed from the popular rebellion which brought them to power, and not from the approval of the United States' Department of State.

To this end, throughout the autumn of 1933, the government decreed a dramatic series of reforms. The Platt Amendment was unilaterally abrogated, and all the political parties of the Machadato were dissolved. The Provisional Government granted autonomy to the University of Havana, women obtained the right to vote, the eight-hour day was decreed, a minimum wage was established for cane-cutters, and compulsory arbitration was promoted. The government created a Ministry of Labour, and a law was passed establishing that 50 per cent of all workers in agriculture, commerce and industry had to be Cuban citizens. The Grau regime set agrarian reform as a priority, promising peasants legal title to their lands. For the first time in Cuban history the country was governed by people who did not negotiate the terms of political power with Spain (before 1898), or with the United States (after 1898). The Provisional Government survived until January 1934, when it was overthrown by an equally loose anti-government coalition of right-wing civilian and military elements. Led by a young [[mulatto]] sergeant, [[Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar]], this movement was supported by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney 2000:436-437.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than endorsing Batista's hand-picked successor Carlos Zayas, the Cuban people elected Ramón Grau San Martín in 1944. A populist physician, who had briefly held the presidency in the 1933 revolutionary process, Grau made a deal with [[labor union]]s to continue Batista's pro-labor policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt; Grau's administration coincided with the end of World War II, and he presided over an economic boom as sugar production expanded and prices rose.

However, increased prosperity brought increased corruption, with [[nepotism]] and favoritism flourishing in the political establishment, and urban violence, a legacy of the early 1930s, reappearing on a large scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/grau-san-mart-n-ram-n &quot;Ramon Grau San Martin&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115175419/http://www.answers.com/topic/grau-san-mart-n-ram-n |date=15 January 2009 }}.

Grau's presidency was followed by that of [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]], also elected democratically, but whose government was tainted by increasing corruption and violent incidents among political factions. Around the same time, [[Fidel Castro]] became a public figure at the University of Havana. [[Eduardo Chibás]]{{snd}} the leader of the [[Partido Ortodoxo]] (Orthodox Party), a liberal democratic group{{snd}} was widely expected to win in 1952 on an anticorruption platform. However, Chibás committed suicide before he could run for the presidency, and the opposition was left without a unifying leader.{{citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph states several facts without supporting citations.|date=October 2015}}

Taking advantage of the opportunity, Batista, who was expected to win only a small minority of the 1952 presidential vote, seized power in an almost bloodless coup three months before the election was to take place. President Prío did nothing to stop the coup, and was forced to leave the island. Due to the corruption of the previous two administrations, the general public reaction to the coup was somewhat accepting at first. However, Batista soon encountered stiff opposition when he temporarily suspended the balloting and the 1940 constitution, and attempted to rule by decree. Nonetheless, elections were held in 1954 and Batista was re-elected under disputed circumstances. Opposition parties mounted a blistering campaign, and continued to do so, using the Cuban free press throughout Batista's tenure in office.{{citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph states several facts without supporting citations.|date=October 2015}}

However, the United States, rather than Latin America, was the frame of reference for educated Cubans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;/&gt; Cubans travelled to the United States, read American newspapers, listened to American radio, watched American television, and were attracted to American culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson-Contesting&quot;/&gt; Middle-class Cubans grew frustrated at the economic gap between Cuba and the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The middle class became increasingly dissatisfied with the administration, while labour unions supported Batista until the very end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominquez-Cuba&quot;/&gt;

Cuba's labour regulations ultimately caused economic stagnation.

==1953–59: the Cuban Revolution==
[[File:60 aniversario del asalto al Cuartel Moncada (9375788996).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Moncada Barracks]], scene of the opening battle of the Cuban Revolution, on the 60th anniversary of the battle in 2013]]
{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}
In 1952, [[Fidel Castro]], a young lawyer running for a seat in the Chamber of Representatives for the [[Partido Ortodoxo]], circulated a petition to depose Batista's government on the grounds that it had illegitimately suspended the electoral process. However, the courts did not act on the petition and ignored Castro's legal challenges. Castro thus resolved to use armed force to overthrow Batista; he and his brother [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]] gathered supporters, and on 26 July 1953 led an attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] near [[Santiago de Cuba]]. The attack ended in failure{{snd}} the authorities killed several of the insurgents, captured Castro himself, tried him and sentenced him to 15&amp;nbsp;years in prison. However, the Batista government released him in 1955, when amnesty was given to many political prisoners, including the ones that assaulted the Moncada barracks. Castro and his brother subsequently went into exile in Mexico, where they met the Argentine revolutionary [[Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara]]. While in Mexico, Guevara and the Castros organized the [[26th of July Movement]] with the goal of overthrowing Batista. In December 1956, Fidel Castro led a group of 82 fighters to Cuba aboard the yacht ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'', landing in the eastern part of the island. Despite a pre-landing rising in Santiago by [[Frank País]] Pesqueira and his followers among the urban pro-Castro movement, Batista's forces promptly killed, dispersed or captured most of Castro's men.{{citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph states dozens of facts without supporting citations.|date=October 2015}}

Castro managed to escape into the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains with as few as 12 fighters, aided by the urban and rural opposition, including Celia Sanchez and the bandits of Cresencio Perez's family. Castro and Guevara then began a guerrilla campaign against the Batista régime, with their main forces supported by numerous poorly armed ''escopeteros'' and the well-armed fighters of Frank País' urban organization. Growing anti-Batista resistance, including a bloodily crushed rising by Cuban Navy personnel in Cienfuegos, soon led to chaos in the country. At the same time, rival guerrilla groups in the Escambray Mountains also grew more effective. Castro attempted to arrange a general strike in 1958, but could not win support among Communists or labor unions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Authoritarian regimes in Latin America|author=Paul H.

The United States imposed trade restrictions on the Batista administration and sent an envoy who attempted to persuade Batista to leave the country voluntarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; With the military situation becoming untenable, Batista fled on 1 January 1959, and Castro took over.

The United States recognized the Castro government on 7 January 1959, six days after Batista fled Cuba. President Eisenhower sent a new ambassador, [[Philip Bonsal]], to replace [[Earl E. T.

Among the opponents of Batista, many wanted to accommodate the United States. However, Castro belonged to a faction which opposed U.S. influence. Castro did not forgive the U.S. supply of arms to Batista during the revolution. On 5 June 1958, at the height of the revolution, he had written: &quot;The Americans are going to pay dearly for what they are doing. When the war is over, I'll start a much longer and bigger war of my own: the war I’m going to fight against them. That will be my true destiny&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Castro to Celia Sanches, 5 June 1958 in Franqui: Diary, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; (The United States had stopped supplies to Batista in March 1958, but left its Military Advisory Group in Cuba).&lt;ref&gt;Paterson in: ''Contesting Castro'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Castro had no intention to bow to the United States. &quot;Even though he did not have a clear blueprint of the Cuba he wanted to create, Castro dreamed of a sweeping revolution that would uproot his country's oppressive socioeconomic structure and of a Cuba that would be free of the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

====Breakdown of relations====
Only six months after Castro seized power, the Eisenhower administration began to plot his ouster. The United Kingdom was persuaded{{by whom|date=February 2018}} to cancel a sale of [[Hawker Hunter]] [[fighter aircraft]] to Cuba. The US [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) met in March 1959 to consider means to institute a régime-change and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) began arming guerillas inside Cuba in May.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomsky 2003&quot;/&gt;

In January 1960 [[Roy R. Rubottom, Jr.]], [[Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs|Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs]], summarized the evolution of [[Cuba–United States relations]] since January 1959: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The period from January to March might be characterized as the honeymoon period of the Castro government. In April a downward trend in US–Cuban relations had been evident… In June we had reached the decision that it was not possible to achieve our objectives with Castro in power and had agreed to undertake the program referred to by Undersecretary of State [[Livingston T. Merchant]]. On 31 October in agreement with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the Department had recommended to the President approval of a program along the lines referred to by Mr. Merchant. The approved program authorized us to support elements in Cuba opposed to the Castro government while making Castro's downfall seem to be the result of his own mistakes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NSC meeting, 14 January 1960, FRUS 1958-60, 6:742–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braddock to SecState, Havana, 1 February 1960, FRUS 1958–60, 6:778.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

He then asked the assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, Roy Rubottom, to summarize the evolution of U.S.-Cuban relations since January 1959: [...] 'The period from January to March might be characterized as the honeymoon period of the Castro government.

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In March 1960 the French ship ''[[La Coubre]]'' blew up in [[Havana Harbor]] as it unloaded munitions, killing dozens. The CIA blamed the explosion on the Cuban government.

Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated rapidly as the Cuban government, in reaction to the refusal of [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Standard Oil]] and [[Texaco]] to refine [[petroleum]] from the Soviet Union in Cuban refineries under their control, took control of those refineries in July 1960. The Eisenhower administration promoted a boycott of Cuba by oil companies, to which Cuba responded by nationalizing the refineries in August 1960. Both sides continued to escalate the dispute. Cuba expropriated more US-owned properties, notably those belonging to the [[ITT Corporation|International Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (ITT) and to the [[United Fruit Company]]. In the Castro government's first [[agrarian reform]] law, on 17 May 1959, the state sought to limit the size of land holdings, and to distribute that land to small farmers in &quot;Vital Minimum&quot; tracts.  This law served as a pretext for seizing lands held by foreigners and for redistributing them to Cuban citizens.

====Formal disconnection====
The United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba on 3 January 1961, and [[US embargo against Cuba | further restricted trade]] in February 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Case Studies in Economic Sanctions and Terrorism: US v.

The [[Kennedy administration]] extended this ban on 8 February 1963, forbidding U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba or to conduct financial or commercial transactions with the country.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
At first the embargo did not extend to other countries, and Cuba traded with most European, Asian and Latin American countries and especially with Canada. However, the United States later pressured other nations and American companies with foreign [[Subsidiary| subsidiaries]] to restrict trade with Cuba. The [[Helms–Burton Act]] of 1996 makes it very difficult for foreign companies doing business with Cuba to also do business in the United States, forcing them to choose between the two marketplaces.

===Bay of Pigs invasion===
[[File:LittleHavanOct06BayOfPigsMonument.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The Bay of Pigs Memorial in [[Miami]], Florida]]
{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}
In April 1961, less than four months into the Kennedy administration, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) executed a plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration. This military campaign to topple Cuba's revolutionary government is now known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion (or ''La Batalla de Girón'' in Cuba).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomsky 2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtholyoke.edu&quot;&gt;US Department of State, ''Foreign Relations of the United States 1961–1963'', Volume X Cuba, 1961–1962 Washington, D.C.

Arriving in Cuba by boat from [[Guatemala]] on 15 April, the brigade landed on the beach [[Playa Girón]] and initially overwhelmed Cuba's counter-offensive. But by 20 April, the brigade surrendered and was publicly interrogated before being sent back to the US. Recently inaugurated president [[John F. Kennedy]] assumed full responsibility for the operation, even though he had vetoed the reinforcements requested during the battle. The invasion helped further build popular support for the new Cuban government.&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Trento. ''Castro and Cuba : From the revolution to the present''.

===The Cuban Missile Crisis===
{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}
Tensions between the two governments peaked again during the October 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The United States had a much larger arsenal of long-range nuclear weapons than the Soviet Union, as well as [[medium-range ballistic missile]]s (MRBMs) in Turkey, whereas the Soviet Union had a large stockpile of medium-range nuclear weapons which were primarily located in Europe. Cuba agreed to let the Soviets secretly place SS-4 ''Sandal'' and SS-5 ''Skean'' MRBMs on their territory. Reports from inside Cuba to exile sources questioned the need for large amounts of ice going to rural areas&lt;!-- apparently the ships were reported as carrying ice? need source --&gt;, which led to the discovery of the missiles, confirmed by [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance photos. The United States responded by establishing a cordon in international waters to stop Soviet ships from bringing in more missiles (designated a [[quarantine]] rather than a [[blockade]] to avoid issues with [[international law]]). At the same time, Castro was getting a little too extreme for the liking of Moscow, so at the last moment the Soviets called back their ships. In addition, they agreed to remove the missiles already there in exchange for an agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba. Only after the fall of the Soviet Union was it revealed that another part of the agreement was the removal of U.S. missiles from Turkey. It also turned out that some submarines that the U.S. Navy blocked were carrying nuclear missiles and that communication with Moscow was tenuous, effectively leaving the decision of firing the missiles at the discretion of the captains of those submarines. In addition, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian government revealed that nuclear-armed FROGs (Free Rocket Over Ground) and [[Ilyushin Il-28]] ''Beagle'' bombers had also been deployed in Cuba.

===Emigration===
{{Main|Cuban exile}}
The establishment of a socialist system in Cuba led to the fleeing of many hundreds of thousands of upper- and middle-class Cubans to the United States and other countries since Castro's rise to power. By 1961, thousands of Cubans had fled Cuba for the United States. On 22 March of that year, an exile council was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethell-Cuba&quot;/&gt; The council planned to defeat the Communist regime and form a provisional government with [[José Miró Cardona]], a noted leader in the civil opposition against Batista, to serve as temporary president until elections could be held.

Between 1959 and 1993, some 1.2&amp;nbsp;million Cubans left the island for the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html &quot;Press Releases&quot;] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709154810/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/000797.html |date=9 July 2009 }}.

R.J. Rummel.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years a number of those who could claim dual Spanish-Cuban citizenship left for Spain. Over the course of several decades, a number of [[Cuban Jews]] were allowed to emigrate to [[Israel]] after quiet negotiations; the majority of the 10,000 or so Jews who were in Cuba in 1959 eventually left the country. By the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cubans were living in many different countries, some in member countries of the [[European Union]]. Spain, Italy, Mexico, and Canada have particularly large Cuban communities.

On 6 November 1965, Cuba and the United States agreed to an airlift for Cubans who wanted to emigrate to the United States. The first of these so-called Freedom Flights left Cuba on 1 December 1965, and by 1971 over 250,000 Cubans had flown to the United States. In 1980 another 125,000 came to United States during a six-month period in the [[Mariel boatlift]], including some criminals and people with psychiatric diagnoses. It was discovered that the Cuban government was using the event to rid Cuba of the unwanted segments of its society. In 2012, Cuba abolished its requirement for exit permits, allowing Cuban citizens to travel to other countries more easily.&lt;ref name=Permit2012&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19972026|title=US welcomes Cuba decision to end foreign travel permits|publisher=BBC|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=21 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018190553/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19972026|archive-date=18 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|Cuban PT-76 tank crew on routine security duties in Angola]]
From its inception, the Cuban Revolution defined itself as [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]], seeking to spread its revolutionary ideals abroad and gain a variety of foreign allies. Although still a developing country itself, Cuba supported African, Central and South American and Asian countries in the fields of military development, health and education. These &quot;overseas adventures&quot; not only irritated the United States but were also quite often a source of dispute with Cuba's ostensible allies in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lobe.

The [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] insurgency in [[Nicaragua]], which led to the demise of the [[Somoza]] dictatorship in 1979, was openly supported by Cuba. However, it was on the African continent where Cuba was most active, supporting a total of 17 liberation movements or leftist governments, in countries including [[Angola]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Mozambique]]. Its Angolan involvement was particularly intense and noteworthy with heavy assistance given to the Marxist–Leninist [[MPLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]].

====Angola====
{{Main|Cuban intervention in Angola}}
Cuba's involvement in the [[Angolan Civil War]] began in the 1960s, when relations were established with the leftist Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The MPLA was one of three organisations struggling to gain Angola's independence from Portugal, the other two being [[UNITA]] and the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA). In August and October 1975, the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF) intervened in Angola in support of the UNITA and FNLA. On 5 November 1975, without consulting the [[USSR]], the Cuban government opted for a direct intervention with combat troops ([[Operation Carlota]]) in support of the MPLA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;France 2006&quot;&gt;Jihan El Tahri. ''Une Odyssée Africaine'' (France, 2006, 59mn).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987–88, South Africa again sent military forces to Angola to stop an advance of MPLA forces (FAPLA) against UNITA, leading to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]], where Cuban troops fought alongside the FAPLA. Cuba also directly participated in the negotiations between Angola and South Africa, again without consulting the USSR. At the height of its operation, Cuba had as many as 50,000 soldiers stationed in Angola.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

On 22 December 1988, Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] in New York, arranging for the retreat of South African and Cuban troops within 30&amp;nbsp;months, and the implementation of the 10-year-old [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UN Security Council Resolution 435]] for the independence of [[Namibia]]. The Cuban intervention, for a short time, turned Cuba into a &quot;global player&quot; in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. Their presence helped the MPLA retain control over large parts of Angola, and their military actions are also credited with helping secure Namibia's independence. The withdrawal of the Cubans ended 13&amp;nbsp;years of foreign military presence in Angola. At the same time, Cuba removed its troops from the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;France 2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2886.htm &quot;Cuba Factsheet&quot;] .

Cuba provided substantial military support to Mariam during the latter's conflict with the [[Somalia|Somali]] dictator [[Siad Barre]] in the 1977–8 [[Ogaden War]], stationing around 24,000 troops in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;westad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Superpower diplomacy in the Horn of Africa|author=Samuel M.

The Soviet Union saw the new revolutionary government in Cuba as an excellent proxy agent in areas of the world where Soviet involvement was not popular on a local level. [[Nikolai Leonov]], the KGB chief in Mexico City, was one of the first Soviet officials to recognize Fidel Castro's potential as a revolutionary, and urged the Soviet Union to strengthen ties with the new Cuban leader. The USSR saw Cuba as having far more appeal with new revolutionary movements, western intellectuals, and members of the [[New Left]], given Cuba's perceived [[David and Goliath]] struggle against U.S. &quot;imperialism&quot;. In 1963, shortly after the [[Cuban missile crisis]], 1,500 DI agents, including [[Che Guevara]], were invited to the USSR for intensive training in intelligence operations.

==Modern era==

===Special Period===
{{Main|Special Period}}
Starting from the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba's second economy|author=Jorge F. Pérez-López}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba experienced a crisis referred to as the &quot;[[Special Period]]&quot;. When the Soviet Union, the country's primary source of trade, was [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] in late 1991, a major supporter of Cuba's economy was lost, leaving it essentially paralyzed because of the economy's narrow basis, focused on just a few products with just a few buyers. National oil supplies, which were mostly imported, were severely reduced. Over 80% of Cuba's trade was lost and living conditions declined. A [[Special Period|&quot;Special Period in Peacetime&quot;]] was declared, which included cutbacks on transport and electricity and even food rationing. In response, the United States tightened up its trade embargo, hoping it would lead to Castro's downfall. But the government tapped into a pre-revolutionary source of income and opened the country to tourism, entering into several joint ventures with foreign companies for hotel, agricultural and industrial projects. As a result, the use of U.S. dollars was legalized in 1994, with special stores being opened which only sold in dollars. There were two separate economies, dollar-economy and the peso-economy, creating a social split in the island because those in the dollar-economy made much more money (as in the tourist-industry). However, in October 2004, the Cuban government announced an end to this policy: from November U.S. dollars would no longer be legal tender in Cuba, but would instead be exchanged for [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible pesos]] (since April 2005 at the exchange rate of $1.08) with a 10% tax payable to the state on the exchange of U.S. dollars cash{{snd}} though not on other forms of exchange.

A ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' paper states that &quot;The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a [[famine in North Korea]] in the mid-1990s. Both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cmaj&quot;/&gt; The government did not accept American donations of food, medicines and money until 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;cmaj&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health consequences of Cuba's Special Period|publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal|pmc=2474886|year=2008|volume=179|issue=3|pmid=18663207|pages=257|doi=10.1503/cmaj.1080068|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; forcing many Cubans to eat anything they could find. In the Havana zoo, the [[peacock]]s, the [[american bison|buffalo]] and even the [[Rhea (bird)|rhea]] were reported to have disappeared during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrotdiplomacy&quot;/&gt; Even domestic cats were reportedly eaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;parrotdiplomacy&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|title=Venezuela and Cuba: Parrot diplomacy|work=The Economist|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801015821/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|archive-date=1 August 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme food shortages and electrical blackouts led to a brief period of unrest, including numerous anti-government protests and widespread increases in urban crime. In response, the Cuban Communist Party formed hundreds of &quot;rapid-action brigades&quot; to confront protesters. The Communist Party's daily publication, ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]'', stated that &quot;delinquents and anti-social elements who try to create disorder and an atmosphere of mistrust and impunity in our society will receive a crushing reply from the people&quot;. In July 1994, 41 Cubans drowned attempting to flee the country aboard a [[tugboat]]; the Cuban government was later [[Tugboat massacre|accused of sinking the vessel deliberately]].&lt;ref name=&quot;werlau-tugboatmassacre&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cubaarchive.org/13_DE_MARZO_TUGBOAT_MASSACRE.pdf|title=Cuba: The Tugboat Massacre of July 13, 1994|author=Maria C.

Thousands of Cubans protested in Havana during the [[Maleconazo uprising]] on 5 August 1994. However, the regime's security forces swiftly dispersed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;cancubachange&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Gutierrez-20-1.pdf|title=Can Cuba Change?|author1=Carl Gershman|author2=Orlando Gutierrez|journal=Journal of Democracy|date=January 2009|volume=20|issue=1|access-date=26 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918225042/http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Gutierrez-20-1.pdf|archive-date=18 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Democracy'' states this was the closest that the Cuban opposition could come to asserting itself decisively.&lt;ref name=&quot;cancubachange&quot;/&gt;

The petition gathered sufficient signatures to be considered by the Cuban government, but was rejected on an alleged technicality. Instead, a [[plebiscite]] was held in which it was formally proclaimed that Castro's brand of socialism would be perpetual.

In 2006, Fidel Castro fell ill and withdrew from public life. The following year, Raúl Castro became Acting President, replacing his brother as the ''de facto'' leader of the country. In a letter dated 18 February 2008, Fidel Castro announced his formal resignation at the 2008 National Assembly meetings, saying &quot;I will not aspire nor accept—I repeat I will not aspire or accept—the post of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/02/19/castro/ &quot;Cuba quiet after Castro announces resignation&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019220440/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/02/19/castro/ |date=19 October 2011 }}.
