The '''Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands''' is an [[states and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], comprising a small archipelago approximately midway between Australia and [[Sri Lanka]] and closer to the Indonesian island of [[Sumatra]]. It is part of [[Southeast Asia]] and is in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].  The territory's [[Dual naming|dual name]] (official since the islands’ incorporation into Australia in 1955) reflects that the islands have historically been known as either the '''Cocos Islands''' or the '''Keeling Islands'''.

The territory consists of two [[atoll]]s made up of 27 [[coral island]]s, of which only two – [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] and [[Home Island]] – are inhabited. The population of around 600 people consists mainly of [[Cocos Malays]], who mostly practise [[Sunni Islam]] and speak [[Cocos Malay|a dialect of Malay]] as their first language.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ck.html |title=Cocos (Keeling) Islands |work=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA |accessdate=27 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912042550/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ck.html |archive-date=12 September 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory is administered by the Australian federal government's [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]], and together with [[Christmas Island]] (which is about {{convert|960|km|mi}} to the east) forms the [[Australian Indian Ocean Territories]] administrative unit. However, the islanders do have a degree of self-government through [[Shire of Cocos|the local shire council]]. Many public services – including health, education, and policing – are provided by the state of [[Western Australia]], and Western Australian law applies except where the federal government has determined otherwise.

The islands were first discovered in 1609 by [[William Keeling]], but no settlement occurred until the early 19th century. One of the first settlers was John Clunies-Ross, a Scottish merchant; much of the island's current population is descended from the Malay workers he brought in to work his [[copra]] plantation. The [[Clunies-Ross family]] ruled the islands as a private fiefdom for almost 150 years, with the head of the family usually recognised as [[resident magistrate]].  The British formally annexed the islands in 1857, and for the next century they were officially administered from either [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] or [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]]. The territory was transferred to Australia in 1955, although until 1979 virtually all of the island's [[real estate]] still belonged to the Clunies-Ross family.

==Name==
The islands have been called the ''Cocos Islands'' (from 1622), the ''Keeling Islands'' (from 1703), the ''Cocos–Keeling Islands'' (since [[James Horsburgh]] in 1805) and the ''Keeling–Cocos Islands'' (19th century).&lt;ref name=&quot;arb399p1t2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woodroffe|first1=C.D.|last2=Berry|first2=P.F.|title=Scientific Studies in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/stream/atollresearchbu399425smit#page/n14|series=Atoll Research Bulletin|volume=399|date=February 1994|publisher=National Museum of Natural History|location=Washington DC|pages=1–2|access-date=26 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410073158/https://archive.org/stream/atollresearchbu399425smit/#page/n14|archive-date=10 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cocos'' refers to the abundant [[coconut]] trees, while ''Keeling'' is [[William Keeling]], who discovered the islands in 1609.&lt;ref name=&quot;arb399p1t2&quot; /&gt;

== Geography ==

The Cocos (Keeling) Islands consist of two flat, low-lying coral atolls with an area of {{convert|14.2|km2|sqmi}}, {{convert|26|km|mi}} of coastline, a highest elevation of {{convert|5|m|ft}} and thickly covered with coconut palms and other vegetation. The climate is pleasant, moderated by the southeast [[trade winds]] for about nine months of the year and with moderate rainfall. [[Tropical cyclone]]s may occur in the early months of the year.

[[North Keeling]] Island is an atoll consisting of just one C-shaped island, a nearly closed atoll ring with a small opening into the lagoon, about {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide, on the east side. The island measures {{convert|1.1|km2|acre}} in land area and is uninhabited. The lagoon is about {{convert|0.5|km2|acre}}. North Keeling Island and the surrounding sea to {{convert|1.5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} from shore form the [[Pulu Keeling National Park]], established on 12 December 1995. It is home to the only surviving population of the endemic, and endangered, [[Cocos Buff-banded Rail]].

South Keeling Islands is an atoll consisting of 24 individual islets forming an incomplete atoll ring, with a total land area of {{convert|13.1|km2|sqmi}}. Only [[Home Island]] and [[West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|West Island]] are populated. The Cocos Malays maintain weekend shacks, referred to as pondoks, on most of the larger islands.

The archipelago was discovered in 1609 by Captain [[William Keeling]] of the [[East India Company]], on a return voyage from the East Indies. [[North Keeling]] was sketched by Ekeberg, a Swedish captain, in 1749, showing the presence of [[coconut|coconut palm]]s. It also appears on a 1789 chart produced by British hydrographer [[Alexander Dalrymple]].&lt;ref name=PKNPMP&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |title=Pulu Keeling National Park Management Plan |publisher=Australian Government |isbn=0-642-54964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, Scottish merchant seaman Captain [[John Clunies-Ross]] stopped briefly at the islands on a trip to India, nailing up a [[Union Jack]] and planning to return and settle on the islands with his family in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ohwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA293|title=Gleanings in Science, Volume 2|date=1830|publisher=Baptist Mission Press|access-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220345/https://books.google.com/books?id=4ohwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA293|archive-date=31 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy Englishman [[Alexander Hare]] had similar plans, and hired a captain{{spaced ndash}} coincidentally, Clunies-Ross's brother{{spaced ndash}}to bring him and a volunteer [[harem]] of 40 [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] women to the islands, where he hoped to establish his private residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;&gt;[[Joshua Slocum]], &quot;[https://archive.org/stream/sailingalonearou00slocuoft#page/212/mode/2up Sailing Alone Around the World&quot;, p. 212] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226134257/https://archive.org/stream/sailingalonearou00slocuoft#page/212/mode/2up |date=26 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hare had previously served as resident of [[Banjarmasin]], a town in [[Borneo]], and found that &quot;he could not confine himself to the tame life that civilisation affords&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;joshua&quot;/&gt;

After some time, Hare's women began deserting him, and instead finding themselves mates amongst Clunies-Ross's sailors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clunies-ross.com/ The Clunies-Ross Chronicle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222330/http://www.clunies-ross.com/ |date=5 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disheartened, Hare left the island.

===Annexation by the British Empire===
The islands were annexed by the British Empire in 1857.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 882&quot;&gt;Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 882&lt;/ref&gt; This annexation was carried out by Captain [[Stephen Grenville Fremantle]] in command of {{HMS|Juno|1844|6}}. Fremantle claimed the islands for the British Empire and appointed [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Ross II]] as Superintendent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cocos Islands|journal=The Chambers's Journal|year=1899|volume=76|pages=187–190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddUXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA187|access-date=6 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231220345/https://books.google.com/books?id=ddUXAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA187|archive-date=31 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, by [[Letters Patent]], the Governor of [[Ceylon]] was made Governor of the islands, and, by further Letters Patent in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;S.R.O. &amp; S.I. Rev. XXI, 512.&lt;/ref&gt; responsibility for the islands was transferred to the Governor of the [[Straits Settlement]] to exercise his functions as &quot;Governor of Cocos Islands&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 882&quot;/&gt;

The islands were made part of the Straits Settlement under an Order in Council of 20 May 1903.&lt;ref&gt;S.R.O. 1903 No. 478, S.R.O. &amp; S.I. Rev. XXI, 515&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in 1886 [[Queen Victoria]] had, by indenture, granted the islands in perpetuity to John Clunies-Ross.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966.

In 1901 a [[telegraph]] cable station was established on Direction Island. Undersea cables went to [[Rodrigues]], [[Mauritius]], [[Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Java]] and [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]]. In 1910 a wireless station was established to communicate with passing ships. The cable station ceased operation in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cocoskeelingislands.com.au/home-2/history/money-22 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215033702/https://www.cocoskeelingislands.com.au/home-2/history/money-22 |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
{{main|Battle of Cocos}}
On the morning of 9 November 1914, the islands became the site of the [[Battle of Cocos]], one of the first naval battles of [[World War I]]. A landing party from the German cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}} captured and disabled the wireless and cable communications station on [[Direction Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Direction Island]], but not before the station was able to transmit a distress call. An Allied troop convoy was passing nearby, and the Australian cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}} was detached from the convoy escort to investigate.

''Sydney'' spotted the island and ''Emden'' at 09:15, with both ships preparing for combat.  At 11:20, the heavily damaged ''Emden'' beached herself on [[North Keeling Island]]. The Australian warship broke to pursue ''Emden''{{'}}s supporting [[Collier (ship)|collier]], which scuttled herself, then returned to North Keeling Island at 16:00. At this point, ''Emden''{{'}}s [[battle ensign]] was still flying: usually a sign that a ship intends to continue fighting. After no response to instructions to lower the ensign, two salvoes were shot into the beached cruiser, after which the Germans lowered the flag and raised a [[flag of surrender|white sheet]]. ''Sydney'' had orders to ascertain the status of the transmission station, but returned the next day to provide medical assistance to the Germans.

Casualties totaled 134 personnel aboard ''Emden'' killed, and 69 wounded, compared to four killed and 16 wounded aboard ''Sydney''. The German survivors were taken aboard the Australian cruiser, which caught up to the troop convoy in [[Colombo]] on 15 November, then transported to [[Malta]] and handed over the prisoners to the [[British Army]]. An additional 50 German personnel from the shore party, unable to be recovered before ''Sydney'' arrived, commandeered a schooner and escaped from Direction Island, eventually arriving in [[Constantinople]]. ''Emden'' was the last active [[Central Powers]] warship in the Indian or Pacific Ocean, which meant troopships from Australia and New Zealand could sail without naval escort, and Allied ships could be deployed elsewhere.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the cable station was once again a vital link. The Cocos were valuable for direction finding by the [[Y service]], the worldwide intelligence system used during the war.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, S. 2012. ''The Secret Listeners''. Aurum Press Ltd. {{ISBN|978 1 78131 079 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied planners noted that the islands might be seized as an airfield for [[Nazi Germany|German]] planes and as a base for commerce raiders operating in the Indian Ocean.  Following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s entry into the war, Japanese forces occupied neighbouring islands. To avoid drawing their attention to the Cocos cable station and its islands' garrison, the [[seaplane]] anchorage between Direction and [[Horsburgh Island|Horsburgh]] islands was not used. Radio transmitters were also kept silent, except in emergencies.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the [[Fall of Singapore]] in 1942, the islands were administered from [[Ceylon]] ([[Sri Lanka]]), and West and Direction Islands were placed under [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military administration. The islands' garrison initially consisted of a platoon from the British Army's [[King's African Rifles]], located on Horsburgh Island, with two {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} guns to cover the anchorage. The local inhabitants all lived on Home Island. Despite the importance of the islands as a communication centre, the Japanese made no attempt either to raid or to occupy them and contented themselves with sending over a reconnaissance aircraft about once a month.

On the night of 8–9 May 1942, 15 members of the garrison, from the [[Ceylon Defence Force]], [[Mutiny|mutinied]] under the leadership of [[Gratien Fernando]]. The mutineers were said to have been provoked by the attitude of their British officers and were also supposedly inspired by Japanese anti-British propaganda. They attempted to take control of the [[Artillery|gun battery]] on the islands. The [[Cocos Islands Mutiny]] was crushed, but the mutineers murdered one non-mutinous soldier and wounded one officer. Seven of the mutineers were sentenced to death at a trial that was later alleged to have been improperly conducted, though the guilt of the accused was admitted. Four of the sentences were commuted, but three men were executed, including Fernando. These were to be the only [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] soldiers executed for mutiny during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=CIM&gt;{{cite book |last=Cruise |first=Noel |authorlink= |title=The Cocos Islands Mutiny |publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press |year=2002 |location=Fremantle |page=248 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=1-86368-310-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 1942, the Japanese submarine ''[[Japanese submarine I-166|I-166]]'' bombarded the islands but caused no damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-166.htm|title=Imperial Submarines|access-date=25 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921203309/http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-166.htm|archive-date=21 September 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the war, two airstrips were built, and three bomber squadrons were moved to the islands to conduct raids against Japanese targets in South East Asia and to provide support during the [[Operation Tiderace|planned]] reinvasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and reconquest of Singapore. The first aircraft to arrive were [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk VIIIs of [[No. 136 Squadron RAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fail|first=J.E.H.|title=FORWARD STRATEGIC AIR BASE COCOS ISLAND|url=http://www.rquirk.com/cocos/cocosart.htm|work=www.rquirk.com|accessdate=13 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207075824/http://www.rquirk.com/cocos/cocosart.htm|archive-date=7 February 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They included some [[B-24|Liberator]] bombers from [[No. 321 Squadron RAF|No. 321 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF]] (members of exiled Dutch forces serving with the [[Royal Air Force]]), which were also stationed on the islands.  When in July 1945 [[No. 99 Squadron RAF|No. 99]] and [[No. 356 Squadron RAF|No. 356]] RAF squadrons arrived on West Island, they brought with them a daily newspaper called ''Atoll'' which contained news of what was happening in the outside world.  Run by airmen in their off-duty hours, it achieved fame when dropped by Liberator bombers on POW camps over the heads of the Japanese guards.

In 1946, the administration of the islands reverted to [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] and it became part of the [[Colony of Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;Colony of Singapore. Government Gazette. (1946, April 1). The Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1946 (G.N. 2, pp. 2–3). Singapore: [s.n.]. Call no.: RCLOS 959.57 SGG; White paper on Malaya (1946, January 26). The Straits Times, p. 2.

===Transfer to Australia===
On 23 November 1955, the islands were transferred from the United Kingdom to the [[Commonwealth of Australia]]. Immediately before the transfer the islands were part of the United Kingdom's [[Colony of Singapore]], in accordance with the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act, 1946 of the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;9 &amp; 10 G. 6, c. 37&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Settlements Acts, 1887 and 1945, as applied by the Act of 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 882&quot;/&gt; The legal steps for effecting the transfer were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. Pgs. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Commonwealth Parliament and the Government requested and consented to the enactment of a United Kingdom Act for the purpose.
*The Cocos Islands Act, 1955, authorized Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to direct that the islands should cease to form part of the [[Colony of Singapore]] and be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth.
*By the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act, 1955, the Parliament of the Commonwealth provided for the acceptance of the islands as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth and for its government. 
*The Cocos Islands Order in Council, 1955, made under the United Kingdom Act of 1955, provided that upon the appointed day (23 November 1955) the islands should cease to form part of the Colony of Singapore and be placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia.
The reason for this comparatively complex machinery was due to the terms of the Straits Settlement (Repeal) Act, 1946. According to Sir Kenneth Roberts-Wray &quot;any other procedure would have been of doubtful validity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The separation involved three steps: separation from the Colony of Singapore; transfer by United Kingdom and acceptance by Australia.

H.&amp;nbsp;J. Hull was appointed the first official representative (now administrator) of the new territory. He had been a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Australian Navy and was released for the purpose. Under Commonwealth Cabinet Decision 1573 of 9 September 1958, Hull's appointment was terminated and [[John William Stokes]] was appointed on secondment from the Northern Territory police. A media release at the end of October 1958 by the Minister for Territories, Hasluck, commended Hull's three years of service on Cocos.

Stokes served in the position from 31 October 1958 to 30 September 1960. His son's boyhood memories and photos of the Islands have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Tony |title=Whatever Will Be, I'll See: Growing Up in the 1940s, 50s and 60s in the Northern Territory, Christmas and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory |year=2012 |publisher=Tony Stokes |isbn=9780646575643 |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.&amp;nbsp;I. Buffett [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] from [[Norfolk Island]] succeeded him and served from 28 July 1960 to 30 June 1966, and later acted as Administrator back on Cocos and on Norfolk Island. In 1974, Ken Mullen wrote a small book&lt;ref&gt;Cocos Keeling, the islands time forgot (1974). Ken Mullen. published by Angus &amp; Robertson, Sydney. 122 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; about his time with wife and son from 1964 to 1966 working at the Cable Station on Direction Island.

In the 1970s, the Australian government's dissatisfaction with the Clunies-Ross feudal style of rule of the island increased. In 1978, Australia forced the family to sell the islands for the sum of {{currency|6,250,000|AUD}}, using the threat of compulsory acquisition. By agreement, the family retained ownership of Oceania House, their home on the island. In 1983, the Australian government reneged on this agreement and told [[Clunies-Ross Family#John Cecil Clunies-Ross|John Clunies-Ross]] that he should leave the Cocos. The following year the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that resumption of Oceania House was unlawful, but the Australian government ordered that no government business was to be granted to Clunies-Ross's shipping company, an action that contributed to his bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cabinet papers: The last King of Cocos loses his palace|url = https://www.smh.com.au/nsw/cabinet-papers-the-last-king-of-cocos-loses-his-palace-20151217-glqb6m.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2016-01-01|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101220559/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/cabinet-papers-the-last-king-of-cocos-loses-his-palace-20151217-glqb6m.html|archive-date = 1 January 2016|url-status = live|df = dmy-all|date = 30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Clunies-Ross now lives in [[Perth, Western Australia]]. However, some members of the Clunies-Ross family still live on the Cocos.

Extensive preparations were undertaken by the government of Australia to prepare the Cocos Malays to vote in their referendum of self-determination. Discussions began in 1982, with an aim of holding the referendum, under United Nations supervision, in mid-1983. Under guidelines developed by the UN Decolonization Committee, residents were to be offered three choices: full independence, free association, or integration with Australia. The last option was preferred by both the islanders and the Australian government. A change in government in Canberra following the March 1983 Australian elections delayed the vote by one year. While the Home Island Council stated a preference for a traditional communal consensus &quot;vote&quot;, the UN insisted on a secret ballot. [[1984 Cocos (Keeling) Islands status referendum|The referendum]] was held on 6 April 1984, with all 261 eligible islanders participating, including the Clunies-Ross family: 229 voted for integration, 21 for Free Association, nine for independence, and two failed to indicate a preference.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Chen, &quot;Pacific Island Development Plan: Cocos (Keeling) Islands- The Political Evolution of a Small Island Territory in the Indian Ocean&quot; (1987): Mr Chen was Administrator, Cocos Islands, from December 1983 – November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years a series of disputes have occurred between the Muslim and the non-Muslim population of the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/lost-in-transition/news-story/de35303c2eaa07c5ffd2a897e4a6e8a8|title=Lost in transition|date=2009-08-31|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|access-date=2018-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223114416/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/lost-in-transition/news-story/de35303c2eaa07c5ffd2a897e4a6e8a8|archive-date=23 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Indigenous status?===
Descendants of the Cocos Malays who were brought to the islands from [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] as well as [[South Africa]] and [[New Guinea]] by Hare and by Clunies-Ross as [[indentured worker]]s, [[slave]]s or [[convict]]s are {{as of|lc=yes|2019}} seeking recognition from the Australian Federal Government to be acknowledged as [[Indigenous Australians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Conversation|url=https://theconversation.com/a-group-of-southeast-asian-descendants-wants-to-be-recognised-as-indigenous-australians-98186|title=A group of Southeast Asian descendants wants to be recognised as Indigenous Australians|date=25 June 2018|first1=Nicholas|last1=Herriman|first2=David R.M.|last2=Irving|first3=Greg|last3=Acciaioli|first4=Monika|last4=Winarnita|first5=Trixie Tangit|last5=Kinajil|access-date=2 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726020326/https://theconversation.com/a-group-of-southeast-asian-descendants-wants-to-be-recognised-as-indigenous-australians-98186|archive-date=26 July 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act also gives Western Australian courts judicial power over the islands. The Cocos Islands remain constitutionally distinct from Western Australia, however; the power of the state to legislate for the territory is power delegated by the federal government. The kind of services typically provided by a state government elsewhere in Australia are provided by departments of the Western Australian Government, and by contractors, with the costs met by the federal government.

There also exists a unicameral [[Shire of Cocos|Cocos (Keeling) Islands Shire Council]] with seven seats. A full term lasts four years, though elections are held every two years; approximately half the members retire each two years.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands residents who are Australian citizens also vote in [[Elections in Australia|federal elections]]. Cocos (Keeling) Islanders are represented in the House of Representatives by the member for the [[Division of Lingiari]] (in the [[Northern Territory]]) and in the Senate by Northern Territory senators.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of the electoral division of Lingiari (NT)|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nt/lingiari.htm|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=2 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425054016/http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nt/lingiari.htm|archive-date=25 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]], the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] received absolute majorities from Cocos electors in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.&lt;ref name=senate&gt;

===Defence and law enforcement===
Defence is the responsibility of the [[Australian Defence Force]]. There are no active military installations or defence personnel on the islands. The Administrator may request the assistance of the Australian Defence Force if required. The 2016 Australian Defence White Paper stated that the airfield in the island would be upgraded to support the [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]]'s [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] maritime patrol aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defence.gov.au/whitepaper/Docs/2016-Defence-White-Paper.pdf|title=2016 Defence White Paper (para. 4.66)|website=defence.gov.au|access-date=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301003400/http://defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/Docs/2016-Defence-White-Paper.pdf|archive-date=1 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian law enforcement and community policing is provided by the [[Australian Federal Police]]. The normal deployment to the island is one [[sergeant]] and one [[constable]]. These are augmented by two locally engaged Special Members who have police powers.

===Courts===
{{see also|Supreme Court of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands}}
Since 1992, court services have been provided by the [[Department of the Attorney General (Western Australia)|Western Australian Department of the Attorney-General]] under a service delivery arrangement with the Australian Government. Western Australian Court Services provide Magistrates Court, District Court, Supreme Court, Family Court, Children's Court, Coroner's Court and Registry for births, deaths and marriages and change of name services. Magistrates and judges from Western Australia convene a [[circuit court]] as required.

===Health care===
Home Island and West Island have medical clinics providing basic health services, but serious medical conditions and injuries cannot be treated on the island and patients are sent to Perth for treatment, a distance of {{cvt|3000|km}}.

== Economy ==
The population of the islands is approximately 600. There is a small and growing tourist industry focused on water-based or nature activities.  In 2016, a beach on Direction Island was named the best beach in Australia by Brad Farmer, an Aquatic and Coastal Ambassador for Tourism Australia and co-author of ''101 Best Beaches 2017''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=Belinda|title=Cossies Beach, Cocos (Keeling) Islands: Beach expert Brad Farmer names Australia's best beach 2017|url=http://www.traveller.com.au/cossies-beach-wa-brad-farmers-best-beach-in-australia-in-2017-gt354u|accessdate=4 December 2016|work=traveller.com.au|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=4 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203155158/http://www.traveller.com.au/cossies-beach-wa-brad-farmers-best-beach-in-australia-in-2017-gt354u|archive-date=3 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bonnor|first1=James|title=Australia appoints Brad Farmer to beach ambassador role|url=http://www.surfersvillage.com/content/australia-appoints-brad-farmer-beach-ambassador|website=www.surfersvillage.com|publisher=XTreme Video|accessdate=4 December 2016|date=22 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220121210/http://www.surfersvillage.com/content/australia-appoints-brad-farmer-beach-ambassador|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small local gardens and fishing contribute to the food supply, but most food and most other necessities must be imported from Australia or elsewhere.

The Cocos Islands Cooperative Society Ltd. employs construction workers, [[stevedore]]s, and lighterage worker operations. Tourism employs others. The unemployment rate was 6.7% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/r.jsp?RegionSummary&amp;region=90102&amp;dataset=ABS_REGIONAL_ASGS&amp;geoconcept=REGION&amp;datasetASGS=ABS_REGIONAL_ASGS&amp;datasetLGA=ABS_REGIONAL_LGA&amp;regionLGA=REGION&amp;regionASGS=REGION|title=Cocos (Keeling) Islands : Region Data Summary|access-date=18 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015212025/http://stat.abs.gov.au/itt/r.jsp?RegionSummary&amp;region=90102&amp;dataset=ABS_REGIONAL_ASGS&amp;geoconcept=REGION&amp;datasetASGS=ABS_REGIONAL_ASGS&amp;datasetLGA=ABS_REGIONAL_LGA&amp;regionLGA=REGION&amp;regionASGS=REGION|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|plastic}}Plastic pollution==
A 2019 study led by Jennifer Lavers from the [[University of Tasmania]]’s Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies published in the journal ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' estimated the volume of [[plastic pollution|plastic rubbish]] on the Islands as around 414 million pieces, weighing 238 tonnes, 93% of which lies buried under the sand. It said that previous surveys which only assessed surface garbage probably “drastically underestimated the scale of debris accumulation”. The plastic waste found in the study consisted mostly of single-use items such as bottles, [[plastic cutlery]], bags and [[drinking straw]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/16/414-million-pieces-of-plastic-found-on-remote-island-group-in-indian-ocean|title=414 million pieces of plastic found on remote island group in Indian Ocean|first=Ben|last=Smee|date=16 May 2019|access-date=7 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific Reports| volume= 9|issue=Article number 7102 |date= 16 May 2019|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43375-4|authors=J.

== Strategic importance ==
{{Update|section|date=November 2017}}

The Cocos Islands are strategically important because of their proximity to shipping lanes in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans.&lt;ref name=wsws /&gt; The United States and Australia have expressed interest in stationing surveillance drones on the Cocos Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;&gt;Whitlock, Craig, &quot;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-expand-ties-with-australia-as-it-aims-to-shift-forces-closer-to-se-asia/2012/03/19/gIQAPSXlcS_story.html U.S., Australia to broaden military ties amid Pentagon pivot to SE Asia] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130209004219/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-expand-ties-with-australia-as-it-aims-to-shift-forces-closer-to-se-asia/2012/03/19/gIQAPSXlcS_story.html |date=9 February 2013 }}&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euronews]] described the plan as Australian support for an increased American presence in Southeast Asia, but expressed concern that it was likely to upset Chinese officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;euro&quot;&gt;Grubel, James, &quot;[http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1459124-australia-open-to-us-spy-flights-from-indian-ocean-island/ Australia open to US spy flights from Indian Ocean].&quot; [[Euronews]], 28 March 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527063046/http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1459124-australia-open-to-us-spy-flights-from-indian-ocean-island/ |date=27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Cogan has written for the [[World Socialist Web Site]] that the plan to station surveillance drones at Cocos is one component of former US President [[Barack Obama]]'s &quot;pivot&quot; towards Asia, facilitating control of the sea lanes and potentially allowing US forces to enforce a blockade against China.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;&gt;Cogan, James, &quot;[http://wsws.org/articles/2012/apr2012/darw-a14.shtml US Marines begin operations in northern Australia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416030936/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/apr2012/darw-a14.shtml |date=16 April 2012 }}.&quot; ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]'', 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After plans to construct airbases were leaked to the ''[[Washington Post]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Australian defence minister [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]] stated that the Australian government views the &quot;Cocos as being potentially a long-term strategic location, but that is down the track.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;&gt;McGuirk, Rod, &quot;[http://www.startribune.com/world/144482165.html Australia to Welcome 250 US Marines next Month, Plays down Proposal for Indian Ocean Air Base].&quot; {{dead link|date=July 2012}} ''[[Associated Press]]'', 27 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one paved airport on the West Island. A tourist bus operates on Home Island.

The only airport is [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport]] with a single {{convert|2,441|m|ft|abbr=on}} paved runway. [[Virgin Australia]] operates scheduled jet services from [[Perth Airport]] via Christmas Island. After 1952, the airport at Cocos Islands was a stop for airline flights between Australia and South Africa, and [[Qantas]] and [[South African Airways]] stopped there to refuel. The arrival of long-range jet aircraft ended this need in 1967.

An interisland ferry, the ''Cahaya Baru'', connects West, Home and Direction Islands.

There is a [[lagoon]] anchorage between Horsburgh and Direction islands for larger vessels, while yachts have a dedicated anchorage area in the southern lee of Direction Island. There are no major [[seaport]]s on the islands.

===Communications===
The islands are connected within Australia's telecommunication system (with number range +61 8 9162 xxxx). Public phones are located on both West Island and Home Island. A reasonably reliable GSM mobile phone network (number range +61 406 xxx), run by CiiA (Christmas Island Internet Association), operates on Cocos (Keeling) Islands.  SIM cards (full size) and recharge cards can be purchased from the Telecentre on West Island to access this service.

[[Australia Post]] provides mail services with the postcode 6799. There are post offices on West Island and Home Island. Standard letters and express post items are sent by air twice weekly, but all other mail is sent by sea and can take up to two months for delivery.

It is administered by VeriSign through a subsidiary company eNIC, which promotes it for international registration as &quot;the next .com&quot;; .cc was originally assigned in October 1997 to eNIC Corporation of Seattle WA by the IANA.  The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] also uses the .cc domain, along with .nc.tr.

Internet access on Cocos is provided by CiiA (Christmas Island Internet Association), and is supplied via satellite ground station on West Island, and distributed via a wireless PPPoE-based WAN on both inhabited islands.  Casual internet access is available at the Telecentre on West Island and the Indian Ocean Group Training office on Home Island.

The [[National Broadband Network]] announced in early 2012 that it would extend service to Cocos in 2015 via high-speed satellite link.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gizmodo&quot;&gt;Kidman, Alex, &quot;[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/02/nbn-to-launch-satellites-in-2015/ NBN To Launch Satellites in 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912093443/http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/02/nbn-to-launch-satellites-in-2015/ |date=12 September 2012 }}.&quot; ''[[Gizmodo]]'', 8 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
