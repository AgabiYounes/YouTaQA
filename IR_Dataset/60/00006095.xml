After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] was split into two parts: the [[Ingushetia|Republic of Ingushetia]] and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], which sought independence. Following the [[First Chechen War]] with Russia, Chechnya gained ''[[de facto]]'' independence as the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].

===Origin of Chechnya's population===
{{main|Vainakh origin hypotheses}}
According to [[Leonti Mroveli]], the 11th-century [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] chronicler, the word Caucasian is derived from the [[Nakh peoples|Vainakh]] ancestor [[Caucas|Kavkas]].&lt;ref&gt;The work of Leonti Mroveli: &quot;The history of the Georgian Kings&quot;dealing with the history of Georgia and the [[Caucasus]] since ancient times to the 5th century AD, is included in medieval code of Georgian annals &quot;Kartlis Tskhovreba&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to George Anchabadze of [[Ilia State University]] {{quotation|The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the [[Caucasus]]. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by Leonti Mroveli, the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was &quot;Kavkas&quot;, hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]]. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as the most &quot;Caucasian&quot; people of all the Caucasians (Caucasus – Kavkas – Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/1887/ |title=Caucasian Knot &amp;#124; An Essay On the History of the Vainakh People.

Kodzoev |title=History of Ingush nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the invention of the wheel (3000&amp;nbsp;BC), horseback riding, metal works (copper, gold, silver, iron), dishes, armor, daggers, knives, arrow tips. The artifacts were found near [[Nasare-Cort]], [[Muzhichi]], Ja-E-Bortz (also known as [[Surkha-khi]]), Abbey-Gove (also known as [[Nazran]] or Nasare)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kodzoev&quot; /&gt;

=== Pre-imperial era ===
From 900–1200, the kingdom in the centre of the Caucasus was split into [[Alania]] and [[Noble Alania]] ([[Russian language|Russian]] Царственные Аланы). The German scientist [[Peter Simon Pallas]] believed that Ingush people (Kist) were the direct descendants from [[Alania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingushetiya.ru/article/95.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217060433/http://www.ingushetiya.ru/article/95.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |title=Ингушетия.Ru • Авторские Материалы |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1239, the [[Alania]] capital of [[Maghas]] was destroyed and Alan confederacy of the Northern [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian]] highlanders, nations, and tribes by [[Batu Khan]] (a [[Mongol]] leader and a grandson of [[Genghis Khan]]) &quot;Magas was destroyed in the beginning of 1239 by the hordes of Batu Khan. Historically Magas was located at approximately the same place on which the new capital of [[Ingushetia]] is now built&quot; – D.V.Zayats&lt;ref name=&quot;Geography&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.V.Zayats |year=2001 |title=Maghas – &quot;The Sun City&quot; – New Capital of Ingushetia |url=http://geo.1september.ru/2001/11/4.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502001233/http://geo.1september.ru/2001/11/4.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1300–1400, there was frequent warfare between the [[Alans]], [[Tamerlan]], [[Tokhtamysh]], culminating in the [[Battle of the Terek River]]. The Alan tribes built fortresses, castles, and defensive walls protecting the mountains from the invaders. Part of the lowland tribes were occupied by Mongols. The insurgency against Mongols began.

In 1991 the Jordanian historian Abdul-Ghani Khassan presented a photocopy from old Arabic scripts claiming that Alania was in Chechnya and Ingushetia, and the document from Alanian historian [[Azdin Vazzar]] (1395–1460) who claimed to be from Nokhcho (Chechen) tribe of Alania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chechenews.com/developments/1013-1.html |title=Аланский историк из чеченцев |publisher=Chechenews.com |date=2010-08-29 |accessdate=2014-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233502/http://www.chechenews.com/developments/1013-1.html |archivedate=December 30, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Категория: Мировая история |url=http://www.95live.ru/world-history/alan-historian.html |title=Аланский историк |publisher=95live.ru |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century saw the first Russian involvement in the Caucasus. 1558 Temryuk of Kabarda sent his emissaries to Moscow requesting help from [[Ivan the Terrible]] against the [[Vainakh]] tribes. [[Ivan the Terrible]] married Temryuk's daughter [[Maria Temryukovna]]. An alliance was formed to gain the ground in the central Caucasus for the expanding [[Tsardom of Russia]] against stubborn [[Vainakh]] defenders. Chechnya was a nation in the Northern Caucasus that fought against foreign rule continually since the 15th century. The Chechens converted over the next few centuries to [[Sunni Islam]], as Islam was associated with resistance to Russian encroachment.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsaroieva&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Tsaroïeva |first=Mariel |title=Anciennes croyances des Ingouches et des Tchétchènes: peuples du Caucase du Nord |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1qtAWyeYOEC |year=2005 |publisher=Maisonneuve et Larose |location=Paris |language=French |isbn=978-2-7068-1792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ilyasov&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ilyasov |first=Lecha |title=The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present |year=2009 |publisher=UNESCO Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |author2=Ziya Bazhayev Charity Foundation |isbn=978-5-904549-02-2 |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001860/186004E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter the Great|Peter I]] first sought to increase Russia's political influence in the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] at the expense of [[Safavid Persia]] when he launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722–1723)]]. Notable in Chechen history, this particular Russo-Persian War marked the first military encounter between Imperial Russia and the [[Vainakh]]. Russian forces succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Iran for several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGj4B1rdcu0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=russo+persian+war+1722+vainakh#v=onepage&amp;q=russo%20persian%20war%201722%20vainakh&amp;f=false |title=The Insurgency in Chechnya and the North Caucasus: From Gazavat to Jihad |accessdate=25 December 2014|isbn=9780313386343 |last1=Schaefer |first1=Robert W. |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Russians took control of the Caspian corridor and moved into Persian-ruled [[Dagestan]], Peter's forces ran into mountain tribes. Peter sent a cavalry force to subdue them, but the Chechens routed them.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot; /&gt; In 1732, after Russia already ceded back most of the Caucasus to [[Persia]], now led by [[Nader Shah]], following the [[Treaty of Resht]], Russian troops clashed again with Chechens in a village called Chechen-aul along the [[Argun River (Caucasus)|Argun River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot; /&gt; The Russians were defeated again and withdrew, but this battle is responsible for the apocryphal story about how the Nokchi came to be known as &quot;Chechens&quot;-the people ostensibly named for the place the battle had taken place. The name Chechen was however already used since as early as 1692.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot; /&gt;

Under intermittent Persian rule since 1555, in 1783 the eastern Georgians of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] led by [[Erekle II]] and Russia signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]. According to this treaty, Kartl-Kakheti received protection from Russia, and Georgia abjured any dependence on [[Qajar dynasty|Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dUHhTPdJ6yIC&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=agha+mohammad+khan+conquer+georgia#v=onepage&amp;q=agha%20mohammad%20khan%20conquer%20georgia&amp;f=false |title=Iran at War: 1500–1988 |accessdate=25 December 2014 |df=mdy |isbn=9781780962214 |last1=Farrokh |first1=Kaveh |date=2011-12-20 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to increase its influence in the Caucasus and to secure communications with Kartli and other minority Christian regions of the Transcaucasia which it considered useful in its wars against Persia and Turkey, the Russian Empire began conquering the Northern Caucasus mountains. The Russian Empire used Christianity to justify its conquests, allowing Islam to spread widely because it positioned itself as the religion of liberation from tsardom, which viewed Nakh tribes as &quot;bandits&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ling&quot; /&gt; The rebellion was led by [[Mansur Ushurma]], a Chechen [[Naqshbandi]] ([[Sufi]]) sheikh—with wavering military support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish a [[Transcaucasus]] Islamic state under [[shari'a]] law. He was unable to fully achieve this because in the course of the war he was betrayed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], handed over to Russians, and executed in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederick Baddeley, ''The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus'', London, Curzon Press, 1999, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the forced ceding of the current territories of Dagestan, most of [[Azerbaijan]], and Georgia by Persia to Russia, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–1813)]] and its outcoming [[Treaty of Gulistan]], Russia significantly widened its foothold in the Caucasus at the expense of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ey63iJcVvbMC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=treaty+of+gulistan+azerbaijan+dagestan#v=onepage&amp;q=treaty%20of%20gulistan%20azerbaijan%20dagestan&amp;f=false |title=Russian Imperialism: Development and Crisis |accessdate=25 December 2014|isbn=9780275964818 |last1=Cohen |first1=Ariel |year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another successful Caucasus war against [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] several years later, starting in [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|1826]] and ending in 1828 with the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], and a successful war against [[Ottoman Turkey]] in [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|1828]], enabled Russia to use a much larger portion of its army in subduing the natives of the [[North Caucasus]].

The resistance of the [[Nakh peoples|Nakh]] tribes never ended and was a fertile ground for a new Muslim-[[Caucasian Avars|Avar]] commander, [[Imam Shamil]], who fought against the Russians from 1834 to 1859 (see [[Murid War]]). In 1859, Shamil was captured by Russians at aul Gunib. Shamil left [[Boysangur Benoiski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO--iigYIes |title=человек из камня БАЙСАНГУР БЕНОЕВСКИЙ |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Chechen with one arm, one eye, and one leg, in charge of command at Gunib. Benoiski broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia for another two years until he was captured and killed by Russians. The Russian tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil, the resistance in the North Caucasus would stop, but it did not. Russia began to use a colonisation tactic by destroying Nakh settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands. The Cossacks suffered defeat after defeat and were constantly attacked by mountaineers, who were robbing them of food and weaponry.

The tsarists' regime used a different approach at the end of the 1860s. They offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Muhajir (Caucasus)]]). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighters at the end of the 19th century was a Chechen [[abrek]] [[Zelimxan|Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev]] and his comrade-in-arms Ingush abrek [[Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski]]. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and government post-service, mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed at the beginning of the 20th century. The war between Nakh tribes and Russia resurfaced during the times of the [[Russian Revolution]], which saw the Nakh struggle against [[Anton Denikin]] and later against the [[Soviet Union]].

On December&amp;nbsp;21, 1917, [[Ingushetia]], Chechnya, and [[Dagestan]] declared independence from Russia and formed a single state: &quot;United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus&quot; (also known as the [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]) which was recognised by major world powers.  The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura (Dagestan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1900.ethnia.org/polity.php?ASK_CODE=KC__&amp;ASK_YY=1919&amp;ASK_MM=05&amp;ASK_DD=07&amp;SL=en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222101340/http://1900.ethnia.org/polity.php?ASK_CODE=KC__&amp;ASK_YY=1919&amp;ASK_MM=05&amp;ASK_DD=07&amp;SL=en |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Russia_war.html |title=Russian Civil War Polities |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savechechnya.com/eng.news/press_1273.htm |title=Общественное движение ЧЕЧЕНСКИЙ КОМИТЕТ НАЦИОНАЛЬНОГО СПАСЕНИЯ |publisher=Savechechnya.com |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2014-03-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044426/http://savechechnya.com/eng.news/press_1273.htm |archivedate=February 23, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tapa Tchermoeff]], a prominent Chechen statesman, was elected the first prime minister of the state.

===Soviet rule===

During Soviet rule, Chechnya and Ingushetia were combined to form [[Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In the 1930s Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing the [[Holodomor]]. As a result, many of the Ukrainians settled in Chechen-Ingush ASSR permanently and survived the famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Umarova |first=Amina |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/chechnya-ukraine-holodomor-survivors/25177285.html |title=Chechnya's Forgotten Children Of The Holodomor |publisher=Rferl.org |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although over 50,000 Chechens and over 12,000 Ingush were fighting against [[Nazi Germany]] on the front line (including heroes of the USSR: [[Abukhadzhi Idrisov]], [[Khanpasha Nuradilov]], [[Movlid Visaitov]]), and although Nazi German troops were fought to a complete stop at two Chechen-Ingush ASSR cities [[Malgobek]] and Ordzhonikidze (renamed to [[Vladikavkaz]]) after capturing half of the Caucasus in less than a month; Chechens and Ingush were falsely accused as Nazi supporters and entire nations were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] during [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|Operation Lentil]] to the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] (later [[Kazakhstan]]) in 1944 near the end of [[World War II]] where over 60% of Chechen and Ingush populations perished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta 2008&quot;&gt;Lieven, Dominic.

Many of the materials were later proved to be fabricated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yakovlev&quot;&gt;[[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]] ''Time of darkness'', Moscow, 2003, {{ISBN|5-85646-097-9}}, pages 205–206 ({{lang-ru|Яковлев А.

The territory of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was divided between [[Stavropol Krai]] (where [[Grozny Okrug]] was formed), the [[Dagestan ASSR]], the [[North Ossetian ASSR]], and the [[Georgian SSR]].

The Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their land after 1956 during [[de-Stalinisation]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta 2008&quot; /&gt; when Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was restored but both boundaries and ethnic composition of the territory significantly changed.  There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]], who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and Ingushes. The republic lost its [[Prigorodny District, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Prigorodny District]] which transferred to North Ossetian ASSR but gained predominantly Russian [[Naursky District]] and [[Shelkovskoy District]] that is considered the homeland for [[Terek Cossacks]].

The [[Russification]] policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with [[Russian language]] proficiency required in many aspects of life to provide Chechens better opportunities for advancement in the Soviet system.&lt;ref name=&quot;ling&quot; /&gt;

On November&amp;nbsp;26, 1990, the Supreme Council of Chechen-Ingush ASSR adopted the &quot;Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Chechen-Ingush Republic&quot;. This declaration was part of the reorganisation of the Soviet Union. This new treaty would have been signed August 22, 1991, which would have transformed 15 republic states into more than 80. The August 19–21, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt]] led to the abandonment of this reorganisation.&lt;ref&gt;James Hughes. &quot;The Peace Process in Chechnya&quot;, contained in Richard Sakwa's ''Chechnya: From Past to Future''. Page 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, the [[All-National Congress of the Chechen People|Chechen National Congress]], was formed, led by ex-[[Soviet Air Force]] general and new Chechen President [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]]. It campaigned for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was opposed by [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s [[Russian Federation]], which argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union—as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian States had—but was part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede. It also argued that other [[republics of Russia]], such as [[Tatarstan]], would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right. Finally, it argued that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of Russia and hence its secession would hurt the country's economy and energy access.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally and forgoing the position held by the several successive Russian governments through the current administration.

===Chechen Wars===
{{Main|First Chechen War|Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Second Chechen War}}[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-prayer3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A Chechen man prays during the [[Battle of Grozny (1994–95)|Battle of Grozny]].]]The First Chechen War took place from 1994 to 1996, when Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, which had declared independence in November 1991. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in men, weaponry, and [[air support]], the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful full-scale battles and [[insurgency]] raids. In three months, Russia lost more tanks (over 1,997 tanks) in Grozny than during the [[Battle of Berlin]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/1990s/1998/no-1129-september-1998/book-reviews-chechnya-small-victorious-war-capi |title=Book Reviews: 'Chechnya: A Small Victorious War' &amp; 'Capitalism and Class Struggle in the USSR' &amp;#124; The Socialist Party of Great Britain |publisher=Worldsocialism.org |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis]] in 1995 shocked the Russian public and led to international condemnation of the Chechen rebels.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In April 1996 the first democratically elected president of Chechnya, [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]], was killed by Russian forces using a booby trap bomb and a missile fired from a warplane after he was located by triangulating the position of a [[satellite phone]] he was using.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = 'Dual attack' killed president|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/325347.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 1999-04-21|access-date = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread [[morale|demoralisation]] of the Russian forces in the area and a successful offensive to re-take Grozny by Chechen rebel's forces led by [[Aslan Maskhadov]] prompted [[Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] to declare a ceasefire in 1996, and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later that saw a withdrawal of Russian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = F&amp;P RFE/RL Archive|url = http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/news/omri/1997/05/970512I.html|website = www.friends-partners.org|accessdate = 2016-01-01|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033829/http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/news/omri/1997/05/970512I.html|archive-date = November 17, 2015|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new President Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and prime minister in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing the Russian government to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090714135120/http://www.freedomhouse.org/modules/mod_call_dsp_country-fiw.cfm?year=2003&amp;country=2593 Chechnya, reference article by Freedom House publications.]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals. Most of these funds were taken by Chechen authorities and divided between favoured warlords.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  Nearly half a million people (40% of Chechnya's prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in [[refugee camps]] or overcrowded villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissident&quot;&gt;[[Alexander Goldfarb (author)|Alex Goldfarb]] and Marina Litvinenko.

President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on October 25, 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing.  Bargishev's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on &quot;[[Wahhabism]]&quot;, was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a [[state of emergency]]. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.

The [[War of Dagestan]] began on August&amp;nbsp;7, 1999, during which the [[Islamic International Brigade]] (IIPB) began an unsuccessful incursion into the neighboring Russian republic of [[Dagestan]] in favour of the Shura of Dagestan which sought independence from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9908/19/russia.dagestan.02/ Moscow again plans wider war in Dagestan] [[CNN]] Retrieved on April 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In September, a series of [[Russian apartment bombings|apartment bombs]] that killed around 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow, were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechen]] separatists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta 2008&quot; /&gt; Some journalists contested the official explanation, instead blaming the Russian Secret Service for blowing up the buildings to initiate a new military campaign against Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091399kashirskoyebomb Context of 'September 13, 1999: Second Moscow Apartment Bombing Kills 118; Chechen Rebels Blamed'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215082756/http://historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091399kashirskoyebomb |date=February 15, 2013 }} Retrieved on April 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the bombings, a prolonged air campaign of retaliatory strikes against the Ichkerian regime and a ground offensive that began in October 1999 marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War.

In response to the increasing terrorism, Russia tightened its grip on Chechnya and expanded its anti-terrorist operations throughout the region. Russia installed a pro-Russian Chechen regime.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of the Chechen Republic}}

==Informal divisions==

There are no true districts of Chechnya, but many believe that the different dialects of the Chechen language define different districts. The main dialects are:
Grozny, also known as the Dzhokhar dialect, is the dialect of people who live in and in some towns around Grozny.
Naskhish, a dialect spoken to the northeast of Chechnya. The most notable difference in this dialect is the addition of the letters &quot;ȯ&quot;, &quot;ј&quot; and &quot;є&quot;
Day, pronounced like the word 'die' is spoken in a small section of the south, around and in the town of Day.

There are other dialects which are believed to define districts, but because these areas are so isolated, not much research has been done on these areas.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Chechnya}}

Since 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Today, Chechnya is a relatively stable [[federal republic]], although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on April 2, 2003, after an all-Chechen referendum was held on March 23, 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional [[teip]]s, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.

===Regional government===

The former separatist religious leader (mufti) [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], looked upon as a traitor by many separatists, was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on October 5, 2003. Incidents of [[ballot stuffing]] and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) monitors. On May 9, 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a [[land mine|landmine]] explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and [[Sergey Abramov (politician)|Sergey Abramov]] was appointed to the position of acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] (son of [[Akhmad Kadyrov]]) has been the caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed as the new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia referred to as the ''[[Kadyrovtsy]]''. The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].

In 2009, the US government financed American organization [[Freedom House]] included Chechnya in the &quot;Worst of the Worst&quot; list of most repressive societies in the world, together with [[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf Worst of the Worst: The World's Most Repressive Societies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110015057/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/WoW09/WOW%202009.pdf |date=November 10, 2011 }} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), ''[[Freedom House]]'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Russian regional government, there was a separatist Ichkeria government that was not recognized by any state (although members have been given political asylum in European and Arab countries, as well as the United States).

Ichkeria was a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] between 1991 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unpo.org/members/20854|title=UNPO: Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|website=unpo.org|access-date=2019-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former president of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the [[Georgian Civil War]], recognized the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://pirweli.com.ge/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3399&amp;Itemid=45 in 1993, ex –President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia recognized Chechnya's independence..], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821134007/http://pirweli.com.ge/eng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3399&amp;Itemid=45 |date=August 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognized [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] under the [[Taliban]] government on January 16, 2000. This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5597-11.cfm Are Chechens in Afghanistan?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807172345/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/5597-11.cfm |date=August 7, 2009 }} – By Nabi Abdullaev, Dec 14, 2001, Moscow Times&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria—Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kullberg&quot;&gt;Kullberg, Anssi. &quot;The Background of Chechen Independence Movement III: The Secular Movement&quot;. ''The Eurasian politician''. 1 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Ichkeria also received vocal support from the Baltic countries, a group of Ukrainian nationalists and Poland; Estonia once voted to recognize, but the act never was followed through due to pressure applied by both Russia and the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kullberg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kari Takamaa and Martti Koskenneimi.

''Central Asian Survey'', Volume 14, Issue 4 1995, pages 553–572&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of this government was [[Aslan Maskhadov]], the Foreign Minister was [[Ilyas Akhmadov]], who was the spokesman for Maskhadov. Aslan Maskhadov had been elected in an internationally monitored election in 1997 for 4 years, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001 he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offenses in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the [[Second Chechen War]]. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on March 8, 2005, and the assassination of Maskhadov was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. [[Akhmed Zakayev]], Deputy Prime Minister and a Foreign Minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in [[England]]. He and others chose [[Abdul Khalim Saidullayev]], a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On June 17, 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in a Chechen town Argun.

The successor of Saidullayev became [[Doku Umarov]]. On October 31, 2007, Umarov abolished the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the [[Caucasus Emirate]] with himself as its [[Emir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itstime.it/Commenti/CaucEmiri.pdf |title=What is Hidden Behind the Idea of the Caucasian Emirate? |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports that after hundreds of thousands of [[Caucasus Russians|ethnic Russians]] and Chechens fled their homes following inter-ethnic and [[Separatism|separatist]] conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpCountrySummaries)/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&amp;count=10000 Government efforts help only some IDPs rebuild their lives], IDMC, August 13, 2007  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821165016/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/%28httpCountrySummaries%29/441ED4F5458A7C1DC125733600369629?OpenDocument&amp;count=10000 |date=August 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September&amp;nbsp;1, 1997, Criminal Code reportedly being implemented in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya, Article 148 punishes &quot;anal sexual intercourse between a man and a woman or a man and a man&quot;. For first- and second-time offenders, the punishment is [[caning]]. A third conviction leads to the death penalty, which can be carried out in a number of ways including [[stoning]] or [[Decapitation|beheading]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]]:[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur04/009/1997/en/ Amnesty International working against laws punishing sexual relations between men] , September 1, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups criticized the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections as unfairly influenced by the central Russian government and military.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5028949 Chechnya Holds Parliamentary Vote], Morning Edition, NPR, November 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that pro-Russian Chechen forces under the command of [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], as well as federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. &quot;If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture. And there is little chance that your torturer will be held accountable&quot;, said Holly Cartner, Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of the Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]]:[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/11/12/chechnya-research-shows-widespread-and-systematic-use-torture Chechnya: Research Shows Widespread and Systematic Use of Torture]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February&amp;nbsp;1, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government. The accusations were sparked by the assassination in Austria of a former Chechen rebel who had gained access to Kadyrov's inner circle, 27-year-old [[Umar Israilov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chivers |first=C.&amp;nbsp;J. |title=Slain Exile Detailed Cruelty of the Ruler of Chechnya |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/world/europe/01torture.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July&amp;nbsp;1, 2009, [[Amnesty International]] released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the [[Russian Federation]] against Chechen citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable. This led to the conclusion that Chechnya was being ruled without law, being run into further devastating destabilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]]:[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur46/012/2009/en/l Russian Federation Rule Without Law: Human Rights violations in the North Caucasus], July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, the Chechen economy fell apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell 2007 163–168&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=John|date=2007|editor-last=Gammer|editor-first=Moshe|editor2-last=Lokshina|editor2-first=Tanya|editor3-last=Thomas|editor3-first=Ray|editor4-last=Mayer|editor4-first=Mary|editor5-last=Dunlop|editor5-first=John B.|title=Chechnya: Russia's 'War on Terror' or 'War of Terror'?|jstor=20451332|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=59|issue=1|pages=163–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but the change did not occur due to the re-taking of Chechnya by Russian troops in the [[Second Chechen War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell 2007 163–168&quot;/&gt;

The economic situation in Chechnya has improved considerably since 2000. According to the ''New York Times'', major efforts to rebuild Grozny have been made, and improvements in the political situation have led some officials to consider setting up a tourism industry, though there are claims that construction workers are being irregularly paid and that poor people have been displaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/world/europe/30grozny.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Chechnya's Capital Rises From the Ashes, Atop Hidden Horrors |first=Andrew E. |last=Kramer |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chechnya's unemployment was 67% in 2006 and fell to 21.5% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://knoema.com/atlas/Russian-Federation/Chechnya-Republic-of/Unemployment-rate |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412062011/https://knoema.com/atlas/Russian-Federation/Chechnya-Republic-of/Unemployment-rate |archive-date=April 12, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total revenue of the budget of Chechnya for 2017 was 59.2&amp;nbsp;billion rubles. Of these, 48.5&amp;nbsp;billion rubles were so-called &quot;gratuitous receipts&quot; from the federal budget of the Russian Federation.
