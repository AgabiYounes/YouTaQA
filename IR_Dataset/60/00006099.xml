A '''carboxylic acid''' is an [[organic compound]] that contains a '''carboxyl group''' (C(=O)OH).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=carboxylic acids|file=C00852}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general formula of a carboxylic acid is '''R–COOH''', with [[substituent|R referring to the alkyl group]].  Carboxylic acids occur widely. Important examples include the [[amino acid]]s and [[acetic acid]]. Deprotonation of a carboxyl group gives a carboxylate [[anion]].

==Examples and nomenclature==
Carboxylic acids are commonly identified by their [[trivial name]]s. They often have the suffix ''-ic acid''. {{anchor|-oic}}[[IUPAC]]-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an ''-oic acid'' suffix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_24.htm Recommendations 1979]. Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-4 Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[butyric acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. For nomenclature of complex molecules containing a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the [[parent chain]] even if there are other [[substituent]]s, such as [[3-chloropropanoic acid]]. Alternately, it can be named as a &quot;carboxy&quot; or &quot;carboxylic acid&quot; substituent on another parent structure, such as [[2-Furoic acid|2-carboxyfuran]].

The carboxylate anion (R–COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of a carboxylic acid is usually named with the suffix ''-ate'', in keeping with the general pattern of ''-ic acid'' and ''-ate'' for a [[conjugate acid]] and its conjugate base, respectively. For example, the conjugate base of [[acetic acid]] is [[acetate]].

==Physical properties==

===Solubility===
Carboxylic acids are [[polarity (chemistry)|polar]]. Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl –C=O) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl –OH), they also participate in [[hydrogen bond]]ing. Together, the hydroxyl and carbonyl group form the functional group carboxyl. Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimers in nonpolar media due to their tendency to &quot;self-associate&quot;. Smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas higher carboxylic acids have limited solubility due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain. These longer chain acids tend to be soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols.&lt;ref name=M&amp;B&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=R.T.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.N.|date=1992|title=Organic Chemistry|edition=6th|isbn=0-13-643669-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aqueous sodium hydroxide and carboxylic acids, even hydrophobic ones, react to yield water-soluble sodium salts. For example, [[Enanthic acid|enathic acid]] has a low solubility in water (0.2 g/L), but its sodium salt is very soluble in water.
[[File:Solubility in different environments.jpg|none|thumb|369x369px]]

===Boiling points===
Carboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, because of their greater surface areas and their tendency to form stabilised dimers through [[hydrogen bond]]s. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporised, increasing the [[enthalpy of vaporization]] requirements significantly.[[File:Carboxylic acid dimers.png|thumb|Carboxylic acid [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]]|alt=|none]]

===Acidity===
Carboxylic acids are [[Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory|Brønsted–Lowry acids]] because they are proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) donors. They are the most common type of [[organic acid]].

Carboxylic acids are typically [[weak acid|weak acids]], meaning that they only partially [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into [[Hydronium|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[cation|cations]] and [[Carboxylate|RCOO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[anion|anions]] in neutral [[Water (molecule)|aqueous]] solution. For example, at room temperature, in a 1-[[molarity|molar]] solution of [[acetic acid]], only 0.4% of the acid are dissociated. Electron-withdrawing substituents, such as [[Trifluoromethyl|-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group]], give stronger acids (the pKa of formic acid is 3.75 whereas trifluoroacetic acid, with a [[Trifluoromethyl group|trifluoromethyl substituent]], has a pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.23). Electron-donating substituents give weaker acids (the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of formic acid is 3.75 whereas acetic acid, with a [[Methyl group|methyl substituent]], has a pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 4.76)

[[Deprotonation]] of carboxylic acids gives carboxylate anions; these are [[resonance stabilized]], because the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms, increasing the stability of the anion. Each of the carbon–oxygen bonds in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character. The carbonyl carbon's partial positive charge is also weakened by the -&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; negative charges on the 2 oxygen atoms.

===Odour===
Carboxylic acids often have strong sour odours. [[Esters]] of carboxylic acids tend to have pleasant odours, and many are used in [[perfume]].

=== Characterization ===
Carboxylic acids are readily identified as such by [[infrared spectroscopy]]. They exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the C–O vibration bond (''ν''&lt;sub&gt;C=O&lt;/sub&gt;) between 1680 and 1725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. A characteristic ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;O–H&lt;/sub&gt; band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; region.&lt;ref name=M&amp;B/&gt; By &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrometry, the [[hydroxyl]] hydrogen appears in the 10–13 ppm region, although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.

==Occurrence and applications==
Many carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale. They are also frequently found in nature. Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of [[amino acid|aminocarboxylic acids]] are the main components of [[protein]]s.

Carboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include [[acetic acid]] (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), [[acrylic acid|acrylic and methacrylic acids]] (precursors to polymers, adhesives), [[adipic acid]] (polymers), [[citric acid]] (a flavor and preservative in food and beverages), [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (chelating agent), [[fatty acid]]s (coatings), [[maleic acid]] (polymers), [[propionic acid]] (food preservative), [[terephthalic acid]] (polymers). Important carboxylate salts are soaps.

==Synthesis==

===Industrial routes===
In general, industrial routes to carboxylic acids differ from those used on a smaller scale because they require specialized equipment.
*Carbonylation of alcohols as illustrated by the [[Cativa process]] for the production of acetic acid.  Formic acid is prepared by a different carbonylation pathway, also starting from methanol.
*Oxidation of [[aldehyde]]s with air using cobalt and manganese catalysts. The required aldehydes are readily obtained from alkenes by [[hydroformylation]].
*Oxidation of hydrocarbons using air. For simple alkanes, this method is inexpensive but not selective enough to be useful. Allylic and benzylic compounds undergo more selective oxidations. Alkyl groups on a benzene ring are oxidized to the carboxylic acid, regardless of its chain length. [[Benzoic acid]] from [[toluene]], [[terephthalic acid]] from ''para''-[[xylene]], and [[phthalic acid]] from ''ortho''-[[xylene]] are illustrative large-scale conversions. [[Acrylic acid]] is generated from [[propene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riemenschneider|first=Wilhelm|date=2002|chapter=Carboxylic Acids, Aliphatic|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a05_235|isbn=3527306730}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Oxidation of ethene using [[silicotungstic acid]] catalyst.
*Base-catalyzed dehydrogenation of alcohols.
*Carbonylation coupled to the addition of water. This method is effective and versatile for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary [[carbocation]]s, e.g. [[isobutylene]] to [[pivalic acid]]. In the [[Koch reaction]], the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong acids. Hydrocarboxylations involve the simultaneous addition of water and [[Carbon monoxide|CO]]. Such reactions are sometimes called &quot;[[Walter Reppe|Reppe chemistry]].&quot;
:HCCH + CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  → CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H

* Hydrolysis of [[triglyceride]]s obtained from plant or animal oils. These methods of synthesizing some long-chain carboxylic acids are related to [[soap making]].
*[[Fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] of ethanol. This method is used in the production of [[vinegar]].
*The [[Kolbe–Schmitt reaction]] provides a route to [[salicylic acid]], precursor to [[aspirin]].

===Laboratory methods===
Preparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.
*[[Oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids|Oxidation of primary alcohols]] or [[aldehyde]]s with strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidants]] such as [[potassium dichromate]], [[Jones reagent]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[sodium chlorite]]. The method is more suitable for laboratory conditions than the industrial use of air, which is &quot;greener&quot; because it yields less inorganic side products such as chromium or manganese oxides.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}
*Oxidative cleavage of [[olefin]]s by [[ozonolysis]], [[potassium permanganate]], or [[potassium dichromate]].
*Hydrolysis of [[nitrile]]s, [[ester]]s, or [[amide]]s, usually with acid- or base-catalysis.
*Carbonation of a [[Grignard reagent]] and [[organolithium]] reagents:
:RLi + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li
:RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li + HCl →  RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H + LiCl
* [[Halogenation]] followed by hydrolysis of [[methyl ketone|methyl ketones]] in the [[haloform reaction]]
* Base-catalyzed cleavage of non-enolizable ketones, especially aryl ketones:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Carboxylation Of Aromatic Compounds: Ferrocenecarboxylic Acid|author=Perry C. Reeves|journal=Org. Synth.|year=1977|volume=56|page=28|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.056.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:RC(O)Ar  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  ArH

===Less-common reactions===
Many reactions produce carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or are mainly of academic interest.
* Disproportionation of an [[aldehyde]] in the [[Cannizzaro reaction]]
* Rearrangement of diketones in the [[benzilic acid rearrangement]] involving the generation of benzoic acids are the [[von Richter reaction]] from nitrobenzenes and the [[Kolbe–Schmitt reaction]] from [[phenol|phenols]].

==Reactions==

[[File:Carboxylic Acid Sunshine Diagram1.svg|thumb|right|400px|Carboxylic acid [[organic reaction]]s]]

The most widely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters, amides, carboxylate salts, acid chlorides, and alcohols. Carboxylic acids react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (–OH) group is replaced with a metal [[cation]]. For example, acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) to form sodium acetate, [[carbon dioxide]], and water:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Carboxylic acids also react with [[alcohol]]s to give [[ester]]s. This process is widely used, e.g. in the production of [[polyester]]s. Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into [[amide]]s, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of [[amino acid]]s into [[peptide]]s is a significant biochemical process that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

The hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using [[thionyl chloride]] to give [[acyl chloride]]s. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to [[thioester]]s.

=== Reduction ===
Like [[ester]]s, most of carboxylic acid can be [[carboxylic acid reduction|reduced]] to alcohols by [[hydrogenation]] or using hydride or alkyl transferring agents (since they will deprotonate the acids instead without transfer) such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] or [[Grignard reagent]]s ([[Organolithium reagent|organolithium]] compounds).

''N'',''N''-Dimethyl(chloromethylene)ammonium chloride (ClHC=N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activates the carboxylic acid to give the carboxymethyleneammonium salt, which can be reduced by a mild reductant like lithium tris(''t''-butoxy)aluminum hydride to afford an aldehyde in a one pot procedure.   This procedure is known to tolerate reactive carbonyl functionalities such as ketone as well as moderately reactive ester, olefin, nitrile, and halide moieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=Reduction of carboxylic acids to aldehydes: 6-Ooxdecanal|prep=CV8P0498|last1=Fujisawa|first1=Tamotsu|last2=Sato|first2=Toshio|collvol=8|collvolpages=498|volume=66|page=121|date=1988|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.066.0121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Barbier-Wieland degradation}}

===Specialized reactions===
* As with all carbonyl compounds, the protons on the [[alpha-carbon|α-carbon]] are labile due to [[keto–enol tautomerism|keto–enol tautomerization]]. Thus, the α-carbon is easily halogenated in the [[Hell–Volhard–Zelinsky halogenation]].
* The [[Schmidt reaction]] converts carboxylic acids to [[amine]]s.
* Carboxylic acids are decarboxylated in the [[Hunsdiecker reaction]].
* The [[Dakin–West reaction]] converts an amino acid to the corresponding amino ketone.
* In the [[Barbier–Wieland degradation]], an carboxylic acid on an aliphatic chain having a simple the [[methylene bridge]] at the alpha position can have the chain shortened by one carbon. The inverse procedure is the [[Arndt–Eistert synthesis]], where an acid is converted into acyl halide, which is then reacted with [[diazomethane]] to give one additional methylene in the aliphatic chain.
* Many acids undergo [[oxidative decarboxylation]]. [[Enzyme]]s that catalyze these reactions are known as [[carboxylase]]s ([[Enzyme Commission number|EC]]&amp;nbsp;6.4.1) and [[decarboxylase]]s (EC&amp;nbsp;4.1.1).
* Carboxylic acids are reduced to [[aldehyde]]s via the [[ester]] and [[Diisobutylaluminium hydride|DIBAL]], via the acid chloride in the [[Rosenmund reduction]] and via the thioester in the [[Fukuyama reduction]].
* In [[ketonic decarboxylation]] carboxylic acids are converted to ketones.
* Organolithium reagents (&gt;2 equiv) react with carboxylic acids to give a dilithium 1,1-diolate, a stable [[tetrahedral intermediate]] which decomposes to give a ketone upon acidic workup.
* The [[Kolbe electrolysis]] is an electrolytic, decarboxylative dimerization reaction. It gets rid of the carboxyl groups of two acid molecules, and joins the remaining fragments together.
