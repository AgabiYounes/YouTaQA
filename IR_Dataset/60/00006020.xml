'''''Crash'''''  is a novel by English author [[J. G. Ballard]], first published in 1973. It is a story about [[symphorophilia]]; specifically [[Traffic collision|car-crash]] [[sexual fetishism]]: its protagonists become sexually aroused by staging and participating in real car-crashes.

In 1996, the novel was made into a [[Crash (1996 film)|film of the same name]] by [[David Cronenberg]].

==Plot summary==
The story is told through the eyes of [[narrator]] James Ballard, named after the author himself, but it centers on the sinister figure of Dr. Robert Vaughan, a &quot;former TV-scientist, turned nightmare angel of the expressways&quot;. Ballard meets Vaughan after being involved in a car accident himself near [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]. Gathering around Vaughan is a group of alienated people, all of them former crash victims, who follow him in his pursuit to re-enact the crashes of celebrities and experience what the narrator calls &quot;a new sexuality, born from a perverse technology&quot;. Vaughan's ultimate fantasy is to die in a head-on collision with movie star [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Crash.html?id=Y8-iHi1IBigC|title=Crash|first=J.

==Critical reception==
The novel received divided reviews when originally published. One [[publisher's reader]] returned the verdict &quot;This author is beyond psychiatric help. Do Not Publish!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/j-g-ballard|title=J. G. Ballard|last=Halford|first=Macy|date=2009-04-20|access-date=2019-08-01|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1973 review in [[The New York Times]] was equally horrified: &quot;''Crash'' is, hands-down, the most repulsive book I've yet to come across.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/98/07/12/specials/ballard-crash.html|title=Crash|last=|first=|date=|website=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, retrospective opinion now considers ''Crash'' to be one of Ballard's best and most challenging works. Reassessing ''Crash'' in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Zadie Smith]] wrote, &quot;C''rash'' is an existential book about how ''everybody uses everything''. How everything uses everybody. And yet it is not a hopeless vision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/04/zadie-smith-jg-ballard-crash|title=Sex and wheels: Zadie Smith on JG Ballard's Crash|last=Smith|first=Zadie|date=2014-07-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-31|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Ballard's legacy, she writes: &quot;In Ballard's work there is always this mix of futuristic dread and excitement, a sweet spot where dystopia and utopia converge. For we cannot say we haven't got precisely what we dreamed of, what we always wanted, so badly.&quot;

===Music===
[[The Normal]]'s 1978 song &quot;[[Warm Leatherette]]&quot; was inspired by the novel as was &quot;[[Miss the Girl]],&quot; a 1983 [[single (music)|single]] by [[The Creatures]].
The [[Manic Street Preachers]]' song &quot;Mausoleum&quot; from 1994's ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' contains the famous Ballard quote about his reasons for writing the book, &quot;I wanted to rub the human face in its own vomit. I wanted to force it to look in the mirror.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/20/jg-ballard-film-music-architecture-tv|title=How JG Ballard cast his shadow right across the arts|first1=Peter|last1=Bradshaw|first2=Deyan|last2=Sudjic|first3=Dave|last3=Simpson|first4=Iain|last4=Sinclair|first5=Mark|last5=Lawson|date=April 20, 2009|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other film adaptations===
An apparently unauthorized adaptation of Crash called ''Nightmare Angel'' was filmed in 1986 by Susan Emerling and [[Zoe Beloff]]. This short film bears the credit &quot;Inspired by J.G. Ballard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Brett|title=The Forgotten Crash: Nightmare Angel|journal=Video Watchdog|date=Oct–Nov 2009|issue=152|pages=12–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
