'''Common Era'''  ('''CE''') is one of the notation systems for the world's most widely used [[calendar era]]. '''BCE''' ('''Before the Common Era''' or '''Before the Current Era''') is the era before CE. BCE and CE are alternatives to the [[Dionysius Exiguus#Anno Domini|Dionysian]] BC and AD system respectively. The Dionysian era distinguishes eras using [[Anno Domini|AD]] (''{{lang|la|anno Domini}}'', &quot;in [the] year of [the] Lord&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Anno Domini&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini |title = Anno Domini |encyclopedia = Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year = 2003 |publisher = Merriam-Webster |quote = Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord |accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BC (&quot;before Christ&quot;). Since the two notation systems are numerically equivalent, &quot;{{currentyear}} CE&quot; corresponds to &quot;AD {{currentyear}}&quot; and &quot;400 BCE&quot; corresponds to &quot;400 BC&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anno Domini&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce.htm |title=Controversy over the use of the &quot;CE/BCE&quot; and &quot;AD/BC&quot; dating notation/ |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Common Era |dictionary=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition = 3rd |date=1992 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Two separate systems that also do not use religious titles, the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical system]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard, do use a [[year zero]].

{{See also|Anno Domini}}
The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Era of Martyrs]] system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt; He attempted to number years from an initial reference date (&quot;[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]&quot;), an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html &quot;Calendars&quot;] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW_1mt4oebQC&amp;pg=PA686&amp;dq=jesus+birth+year+before |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1995 |isbn= 978-0-8028-3781-3 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as &quot;''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, O., (1983), &quot;The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church&quot; in Coyne, G.V. et al.

This way of numbering years became more widespread in Europe with its use by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed was the year of birth of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of not using a [[year zero]].{{efn|As noted in [[History of zero|History of the zero]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the twelfth century.}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to the system]] begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=&quot;CathEncy-Chron&quot; /&gt;

=== Vulgar Era ===
{{wikt|vulgar}}
[[File:Johannes Kepler 1610.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Kepler]] first used &quot;Vulgar Era&quot; to distinguish dates on the Christian calendar from the [[regnal year]] typically used in national law.]]
The term &quot;Common Era&quot; is traced back in English to its appearance as &quot;[[wikt:vulgar|Vulgar]] Era&quot; to distinguish dates on the Ecclesiastic calendar in popular use from dates of the [[regnal year]], the year of reign of a sovereign, typically used in national law. (The word 'vulgar' originally meant 'of the ordinary people', with no derogatory associations.)

The first use of the Latin term ''anno aerae nostrae vulgaris''{{Efn|name=VulgarisAerae0|In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Aera Vulgaris''. It also occasionally appears, in Latin declination, as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.}} discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1 /&gt; Kepler uses it again, as ''ab Anno vulgaris aerae'', in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae2&gt;{{cite book |title=Second use of &quot;vulgaris aerae&quot; (Latin for Common Era) (1616) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kElSQAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|publisher=Plancus |author=Kepler, Johann |year=1616 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum caelestium, ab Ānno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII en observationibus potissimum Tychonis Brahei hypothesibus physicis, et tabulis Rudolphinis... |first=Johann |last=Kepler |publisher=Plancus |year=1616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again, as ''ab anno vulgaris aerae'', in 1617.&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae3&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w47twAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|title=Third use of &quot;vulgaris aerae&quot; (Latin for Common Era) (1617) |publisher=sumptibus authoris, excudebat Iohannes Plancus |author1=Kepler, Johannes |author2=Fabricus, David |year=1617 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum coelestium, ab anno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII[-XXXVI]... |quote=Part 3 has title: Tomi L Ephemeridvm Ioannis Kepleri pars tertia, complexa annos à M.DC.XXIX. in M.DC.XXXVI.

=== History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation ===
Although Jews have their own [[Hebrew calendar]], they often use the [[Gregorian calendar]], without the AD prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Jews do not generally use the words &quot;A.D.&quot; and &quot;B.C.&quot; to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. &quot;A.D.&quot; means &quot;the year of our [[L-rd]],&quot; and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). |author=Tracey R Rich |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years | title=Judaism 101 | accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years in the Western calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/susser/plymouthinscriptions.htm |title=Plymouth, England Tombstone inscriptions |publisher=Jewish Communities &amp; Records |quote=Here is buried his honour Judah ben his honour Joseph, a prince and honoured amongst philanthropists, who executed good deeds, died in his house in the City of Bath, Tuesday, and was buried here on Sunday, 19 Sivan in the year 5585.

== Contemporary usage ==
Some academics in the fields of [[theology]], [[education]], [[archaeology]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide &quot;Do not use C.E. (common era), B.P. (before present), or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C.&quot; (In section I 5 the Society explains how to use &quot;years B.P.&quot; in connection with [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon ages]].) {{cite web |url=https://sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |date=December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052334/http://www.sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-16 |url-status=live }} whereas the [[American Anthropological Association]] style guide takes a different approach calling for &quot;C.E.&quot; and &quot;B.C.E.&quot; {{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm |title=AAA Style Guide |format=PDF |author=American Anthropological Society

The style guide for the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News'' says that BCE and CE should be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620230309/http://ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 June 2006 |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide &amp; Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the use of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s was reported in 2005 to be growing.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt; Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to BCE/CE, ending a period of 138 years in which the traditional BC/AD dating notation was used. BCE/CE is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505010633/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |archive-date=2011-05-05 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]. Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }};{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=2011-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, an advisory panel for the religious education syllabus for [[England and Wales]] recommended introducing BCE/CE dates to schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |title=AD and BC become CE/BCE |date=9 February 2002 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220120909/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |archivedate=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2018 some local education authorities were using them.&lt;ref name=Tel-NT /&gt;  In 2018, the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] said it would continue to use BC/AD as its house style.&lt;ref name=Tel-NT&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/12/national-trust-tells-properties-stick-anno-domini-historic-site/ &quot;National Trust tells properties to stop dropping BC and AD out of fear it might offend non-Christians&quot;], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', by Henry Bodkin, 12 November, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  [[English Heritage]] explains its era policy thus: &quot;It might seem strange to use a Christian calendar system when referring to British prehistory, but the BC/AD labels are widely used and understood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/history-and-stories/history/stonehenge-glossary/ Stonehenge glossary, &quot;BC and AD&quot;] English Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;  Some parts of the BBC use BCE/CE, but others have refused to do so.&lt;ref name=Tel-NT /&gt; As at October 2019, the BBC News style guide has entries for AD and BC, but not for CE or BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC News style guide |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/en/collections/news-style-guide |website=BBC |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state's new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032052/http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710123618/http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 July 2009 |title=School board keeps traditional historic designations |author=Joe Biesk |newspaper=Louisville Courier-Journal |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926165947/http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 September 2006|title=Kentucky Board of Education Report |publisher=Kentucky Board of Education Report |date=10 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0307-1235| last = Malkin| first = Bonnie| title = Anger in Australia as school books ‘write Christ out of history’| work = The Telegraph| location = London| accessdate = 1 January 2020| date = 2 September 2011| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/8736932/Anger-in-Australia-as-school-books-write-Christ-out-of-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] (now the Canadian Museum of History) in [[Ottawa]], which had previously switched to BCE/CE, decided to change back to BC/AD in material intended for the public, while retaining BCE/CE in academic content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nationalpost.com/holy-post/museum-of-civilization-putting-the-christ-back-in-history-as-bc-and-ad-return &quot;Museum of Civilization putting the ‘Christ’ back in history as BC and AD return&quot;], by Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press, ''National Post'', 27 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The style guide for [[The Guardian]] says, under the entry for CE/BCE: &quot;some people prefer CE (common era, current era, or Christian era) and BCE (before common era, etc) to AD and BC, which, however, remain our style&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guardian style guide |url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-c |website=Guardian |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=5 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

=== Support ===
The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit &quot;Our Lord&quot; in the abbreviation ''AD''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to Jesus as Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law and Practice|year=1910|page=1116|quote=It has been said of the Latin words anno Domini, meaning in the year of our Lord [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions At Your Fingertips|author1=Michael McDowell |author2=Nathan Robert Brown |publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-1-101-01469-1|page=38|quote=Marked by the turn of the Common Era, C.E., originally referred to as A.D., an abbreviation of the Latin ''Anno Domini'', meaning &quot;Year of our God/Lord.&quot; This was a shortening of ''Anno Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'', meaning &quot;Year of our God/Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christians]], but who are not themselves Christian.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelTolrnc&quot; /&gt;

Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kofifaith&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lefevere |first=Patricia |title=Annan: 'Peace is never a perfect achievement'&amp;nbsp;– United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan |newspaper=National Catholic Reporter |date=11 December 1998 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713031248/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |title=Common values for a common era: Even as we cherish our diversity, we need to discover our shared values |author=Annan, Kofi A., (then Secretary-General of the United Nations) |date=28 June 1999 |publisher=Civilization: The Magazine of the Library of Congress |accessdate=2011-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020027/http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |archivedate=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adena K. Berkowitz, when arguing at the Supreme Court, opted to use BCE and CE because &quot;Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designations – B.C.E. and C.E. – cast a wider net of inclusion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180814202630/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html |author=Safire, William |date=17 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus, some Christians are offended by the removal of the reference to him in era notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132926/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 October 2007|last=Whitney|first=Susan|title=Altering history?

There are also secular concerns. In 1993 the English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that &quot;if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; The short lived [[French Republican Calendar]], for example, began with the first year of the [[French First Republic]] and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to the [[Book of Genesis]]) for a ten-day week.

According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the teacher and politician [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=A conservative's answer to Wikipedia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19 |date=22 June 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its &quot;Conservapedia Commandments&quot; is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to &quot;deny the historical basis&quot; of the dating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions in style guides ==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Thus, the current year is written as {{currentyear}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{currentyear}} CE, or as AD {{currentyear}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[Full stop|periods]] (e.g., &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:87%;&quot;&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or &quot;C.E.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html |title=Major Rule Changes in The Chicago Manual of Style, Fifteenth Edition |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=Certain abbreviations traditionally set in small caps are now in full caps (AD, BCE, and the like), with small caps an option. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909071543/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html|archivedate=9 September 2007|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.&lt;ref&gt;''SBL Handbook of Style'' [[Society of Biblical Literature]] 1999 &quot;8.1.2 ERAS – The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E. (with periods). If you use A.D. and B.C., remember that A.D. precedes the date and B.C. follows it. (For the use of these abbreviations in titles, see §&amp;nbsp;7.1.3.2.)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Germany]], Jews in [[Berlin]] seem to have already been using &quot;(Before the) Common Era&quot; in the 18th century, while others like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Joke&quot; /&gt; The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like ''vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (before the common chronology).&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums. Ein unpartheiisches Organ für alles jüdische Interesse'', II. Jahrgang, No. 60, Leipzig, 19. Mai 1838 (19 May 1838).

Staat |accessdate=15 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was soon discovered that many German Jews had been using the convention ever since the 18th century, and [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] found it ironic to see &quot;[[Aryan]]s following Jewish example nearly 200 years later&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jewish Joke&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759195,00.html |title=GERMANY: Jewish Joke |date=7 March 1938|accessdate=2012-02-05 |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], common forms used for &quot;BC&quot; are aC and a. de C. (for &quot;antes de Cristo&quot;, &quot;before Christ&quot;), with variations in punctuation and sometimes the use of J.C. (Jesucristo) instead of C. In scholarly writing, AEC is the equivalent of the English &quot;BCE&quot;, &quot;antes de la Era Común&quot; or &quot;Before the Common Era&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spanish.about.com/od/writtenspanish/qt/dates.htm |title=Writing Dates in Spanish |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD (''Oed Crist'') and CE (''Oes Cyffredin''); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, ''Cyn Crist'') is used exclusively, as ''Cyn yr Oes Cyffredin'' would abbreviate to a mild obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=welsh-termau-cymraeg;982a203b.0610 |title=Welsh-Termau-Cymraeg Archives |language=cy |publisher=JISCMail |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Russian language|Russian]] since the Soviet time the notation ''до н.э.'' (''до нашей эры'', lit. ''before our era'') and ''н.э.'' (''нашей эры'', lit. ''of our era'') is used almost universally. The notation ''до Р.Х.''/''от Р.Х.'' (''до/от Рождества Христова'', i.e. ''before/after the birth of Christ'', equivalent to Latin [[Ante Christum natum]]) used almost only within the Christian religious tradition.{{cn|date=March 2020}}
*In [[Chinese language|China]], upon the foundation of the Republic of China, the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Government in Nanking]] adopted the Minguo Era, but used the Western calendar for international purposes. The translated term was 西元 (&quot;xī yuán&quot;, &quot;Western Era&quot;). Later, in 1949, the [[People's Republic of China]] adopted 公元 (gōngyuán, &quot;Common Era&quot;) for all purposes domestic and foreign（as well as Hong Kong in 1997 and Macau in 1999 to eliminate the usage of Minguo Era in these places.{{cn|date=March 2020}}
