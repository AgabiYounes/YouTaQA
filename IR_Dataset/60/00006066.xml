'''Carl Philipp Gottfried''' (or '''Gottlieb''') '''von Clausewitz'''{{refn|group=note|{{German title von}} }} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aʊ|z|ə|v|ɪ|t|s}}; 1 June 1780&amp;nbsp;– 16 November 1831)&lt;ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Clausewitz and His Works|url= http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/Bassford/Cworks/Works.htm |website=Clausewitz.com |access-date=July 9, 2018 |last=Bassford |first=Christopher |date=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Prussian general and [[Military theory|military theorist]] who stressed the &quot;moral&quot; (meaning, in modern terms, [[Military psychology|psychological]]) and political aspects of war. His most notable work, ''[[On War|Vom Kriege]]'' (''On War''), was unfinished at his death.
Clausewitz was a [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] in many different senses and, while in some respects a romantic, also drew heavily on the rationalist ideas of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Clausewitz's thinking is often described as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] because of his [[dialectic]]al method; but, although he was probably personally acquainted with Hegel, there remains debate as to whether or not Clausewitz was in fact influenced by him.&lt;ref name=Cormier&gt;Cormier, Youri. War As Paradox: Clausewitz &amp; Hegel on Fighting Doctrines and Ethics, (Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill Queen's University Press, 2016) http://www.mqup.ca/war-as-paradox-products-9780773547698.php&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183–232}} He stressed the dialectical interaction of diverse factors, noting how unexpected developments unfolding under the &quot;[[fog of war]]&quot; (i.e., in the face of incomplete, dubious, and often completely erroneous information and high levels of [[fear]], doubt, and excitement) call for rapid decisions by alert commanders. He saw history as a vital check on [[erudite]] abstractions that did not accord with experience. In contrast to the early work of [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], he argued that war could not be quantified or reduced to mapwork, geometry, and graphs.  Clausewitz had many [[aphorisms]], of which the most famous is &quot;War is the continuation of politics by other means.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Clausewitz |first=Carl von |authorlink=Carl von Clausewitz |editor1-first= Michael |editor1-last=Howard |editor1-link=Peter Paret |editor2-first=Peter |editor2-last= Paret |title= On War |trans-title=Vom Krieg |edition=Indexed |year=1984 |origyear=1832 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-01854-6 |page= 87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
Clausewitz's Christian names are sometimes given in non-German sources as &quot;Karl,&quot; &quot;Carl Philipp Gottlieb,&quot; or &quot;Carl Maria.&quot;  He spelled his own given name with a &quot;C&quot; in order to identify with the classical Western tradition; writers who use &quot;Karl&quot; are often seeking to emphasize his German (rather than European) identity. &quot;Carl Philipp Gottfried&quot; appears on Clausewitz's tombstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clausewitz.com/TombSite.htm |title=Clausewitz's tombstone |website=Clausewitz.com |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, sources such as military historian [[Peter Paret]] and ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' continue to use Gottlieb instead of Gottfried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/120545/Carl-von-Clausewitz |title=Carl von Clausewitz |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and military career==
Clausewitz was born on 1 June 1780 in [[Burg bei Magdeburg]] in the Prussian [[Duchy of Magdeburg]] as the fourth and youngest son of a family that made claims to noble status which Carl accepted. Clausewitz's family claimed descent from the Barons of Clausewitz in Upper Silesia, though scholars question the connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Aron|first= Raymond|title= Clausewitz: Philosopher of War|year= 1983|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|pages= 12–14|url= https://books.google.com/?id=KPI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn= 9780710090096}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, the son of a [[Lutheran]] pastor, had been a professor of theology. Clausewitz's father, once a lieutenant in the [[Prussian army|army]] of [[Frederick the Great]], [[King of Prussia]], held a minor post in the Prussian internal-revenue service. Clausewitz entered the Prussian military service at the age of twelve as a [[lance-corporal]], eventually attaining the rank of major general.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio /&gt;

Clausewitz served in the [[First Coalition|Rhine Campaigns]] (1793–1794) including the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]], when the [[Prussian army]] invaded France during the [[French Revolution]], and fought in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1806 to 1815. He entered the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]'' (also cited as &quot;The German War School&quot;, the &quot;Military Academy in Berlin&quot;, and the &quot;Prussian Military Academy,&quot; later the &quot;War College&quot;) in Berlin in 1801 (aged 21), probably studied the writings of the philosophers [[Immanuel Kant]] and/or [[Fichte]] and [[Schleiermacher]] and won the regard of General [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]], the future first chief-of-staff of the newly reformed Prussian Army (appointed 1809). Clausewitz, [[Hermann von Boyen]] (1771–1848) and [[Karl von Grolman]] (1777–1843) were among Scharnhorst's primary allies in his efforts to reform the Prussian army between 1807 and 1814.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Clausewitz served during the Jena Campaign as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Prince Augustus Ferdinand of Prussia|Prince August]]. At the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]] on 14 October 1806—when Napoleon invaded Prussia and defeated the massed Prussian-Saxon army commanded by [[Charles William Ferdinand|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand]], [[Duke of Brunswick]]—he was captured, one of the 25,000 prisoners taken that day as the Prussian army disintegrated. He was 26. Clausewitz was held prisoner with his prince in [[France]] from 1807 to 1808. Returning to Prussia, he assisted in the reform of the Prussian army and state.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio /&gt;

[[File:Marievonclausewitz.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Marie von Clausewitz (née, Countess von Brühl)]]
On 10 December 1810 he married the socially prominent [[Countess]] [[Marie von Brühl]], whom he had first met in 1803. She was a member of the noble German [[von Brühl]] family originating in [[Thuringia]]. The couple moved in the highest circles, socialising with Berlin's political, literary and intellectual élite. Marie was well-educated and politically well-connected—she played an important role in her husband's career progress and intellectual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Bellinger, Vanya Eftimova. ''Marie von Clausewitz: The Woman Behind the Making of On War''. New York/London: Oxford University Press, 2015. {{ISBN|978-0-19-022543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also edited, published, and introduced his collected works.&lt;ref name=&quot;5 Things&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellinger|first1=Vanya Eftimova|title=Five Things You Didn't Know About Carl von Clausewitz|journal=Real Clear Defense|date=January 6, 2016|url=http://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2016/01/06/five_things_you_didnt_know_about_carl_von_clausewitz_108863.html|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposed to Prussia's enforced alliance with [[Napoleon I]], Clausewitz left the Prussian army and served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] from 1812 to 1813 during the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|Russian Campaign]], taking part in the [[Battle of Borodino]] (1812). Like many Prussian officers serving in Russia, he joined the [[Russian-German Legion]] in 1813. In the service of the [[Russian Empire]], Clausewitz helped negotiate the [[Convention of Tauroggen]] (1812), which prepared the way for the coalition of Prussia, Russia, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] that ultimately defeated Napoleon and his allies.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio /&gt;

In 1815 the Russian-German Legion became integrated into the Prussian Army and Clausewitz re-entered Prussian service as a colonel.&lt;ref&gt;See Timothy McCranor, &quot;On the Pedagogical Intent of Clausewitz's On War,&quot; ''MCU Journal'' vol. 9, no. 1, Spring 2018, pp.133-154.&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon appointed chief-of-staff of [[Johann von Thielmann]]'s III Corps. In that capacity he served at the [[Battle of Ligny]] and the [[Battle of Wavre]] during the [[Waterloo Campaign]] in 1815. An army led personally by Napoleon defeated the Prussians at [[Ligny]] (south of [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] and the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]) on 16 June 1815, but they withdrew in good order. Napoleon's failure to destroy the Prussian forces led to his defeat a few days later at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (18 June 1815), when the Prussian forces arrived on his right flank late in the afternoon to support the Anglo-Dutch-Belgian forces pressing his front. Napoleon had convinced his troops that the field grey uniforms were those of Marshall Grouchy's Granadiers. Clausewitz's unit fought heavily outnumbered at [[Battle of Wavre|Wavre]] (18–19 June 1815), preventing large reinforcements from reaching Napoleon at Waterloo.  After the war Clausewitz served as the director of the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]'', where he served until 1830. In that year he returned to active duty with the army. Soon afterwards, the outbreak of several revolutions around Europe and [[November Uprising|a crisis in Poland]] appeared to presage another major European war. Clausewitz was appointed chief of staff of the only army Prussia was able to mobilise in this emergency, which was sent to the Polish border. Its commander, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau|Gneisenau]], died of cholera (August 1831), and Clausewitz took command of the Prussian army's efforts to construct a ''cordon sanitaire'' to contain the great [[1829–51 cholera pandemic|cholera outbreak]] (the first time cholera had appeared in modern heartland Europe, causing a continent-wide panic). Clausewitz himself died of the same disease shortly afterwards, on 17 November 1831.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio /&gt;

His widow edited, published, and wrote the introduction to his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' on the [[philosophy of war]] in 1832. (He had started working on the text in 1816, but had not completed it.)&lt;ref name=smith57&gt;Smith, Rupert, ''The Utility of Force'', Penguin Books, 2006, p. 57; Paul Donker, &quot;[https://www.clausewitzstudies.org/bibl/DonkerP-TheEvolutionOfClausewitzsVomKriege.pdf The Evolution of Clausewitz's ''Vom Kriege'': a reconstruction on the basis of the earlier versions of his masterpiece],&quot; trans. Paul Donker and Christopher Bassford, ClausewitzStudies.org, August 2019.
&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote the preface for ''On War'' and by 1835 had published most of his collected works.&lt;ref name=&quot;5 Things&quot;/&gt; She died in January 1836.

==Theory of war==
{{war}}
Clausewitz was a professional combat soldier who was involved in numerous military campaigns, but he is famous primarily as a military theorist interested in the examination of war, utilising the campaigns of [[Frederick the Great]] and Napoleon as frames of reference for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paret | first1 = Peter | year = 2012 | title = Clausewitz and Schlieffen as Interpreters of Frederick the Great: Three Phases in the History of Grand Strategy | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 837–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a careful, systematic, philosophical examination of war in all its aspects. The result was his principal book, ''[[On War]],'' a major work on the philosophy of war. It was unfinished when Clausewitz died and contains material written at different stages in his intellectual evolution, producing some significant contradictions between different sections. The sequence and precise character of that evolution is a source of much debate, as are exact meaning behind his seemingly contradictory claims (discussions pertinent to the tactical, operational and strategic levels of war are one example). Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text, particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignments, to include more material on &quot;people's war&quot; and forms of war other than high-intensity warfare between states, but relatively little of this material was included in the book.&lt;ref name=smith57 /&gt; Soldiers before this time had written treatises on various military subjects, but none had undertaken a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of those written by Clausewitz and [[Leo Tolstoy]], both of which were inspired by the events of the [[Napoleonic Era]].

Clausewitz's work is still studied today, demonstrating its continued relevance. More than sixteen major English-language books that focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2014, whereas his 19th-century rival [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]] faded from influence. The historian [[Lynn Montross]] said the outcome, &quot;may be explained by the fact that Jomini produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy.  The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Montross, ''War Through the Ages'' (2nd ed. 1946) p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jomini did not attempt to define war but Clausewitz did, providing (and dialectically comparing) a number of definitions. The first is his dialectical thesis: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&quot; The second, often treated as Clausewitz's 'bottom line,' is in fact merely his dialectical antithesis: &quot;War is merely the continuation of politics with other means.&quot; The synthesis of his dialectical examination of the nature of war is his famous &quot;trinity,&quot; saying that war is &quot;a fascinating trinity—composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; the play of chance and probability, within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to pure reason.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Clausewitz, ''On War'', originally ''Vom Kriege'' (3 vols., Berlin: 1832–34). The edition cited here was edited by Michael Howard and Peter Paret, Princeton University Press, 1984, pp. 75, 87, 89, 605.&lt;/ref&gt;   Christopher Bassford says the best shorthand for Clausewitz's trinity should be something like &quot;violent emotion/chance/rational calculation.&quot; However, it is frequently presented as &quot;people/army/government,&quot; a misunderstanding based on a later paragraph in the same chapter. This misrepresentation was popularised by U.S. Army Colonel Harry Summers' Vietnam-era interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Harry G., Jr. ''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War'' (Novato, CA: Presidio Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; facilitated by weaknesses in the 1976 Howard/Paret translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher |last=Bassford |chapter=The Primacy of Policy and the &quot;Trinity&quot; in Clausewitz's Mature Thought. |editor1-first=Hew |editor1-last=Strachan |editor2-first=Andreas |editor2-last=Herberg-Rothe |title=Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century: Proceedings of a March, 2005 conference at Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |pages=74–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree to which Clausewitz managed to revise his manuscript to reflect that synthesis is the subject of much debate. His final reference to war and ''Politik'', however, goes beyond his widely quoted antithesis: &quot;War is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means. We deliberately use the phrase 'with the addition of other means' because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different. In essentials that intercourse continues, irrespective of the means it employs. The main lines along which military events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Evan Luard, ed.|title=Basic Texts in International Relations: The Evolution of Ideas about International Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_S-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244|year=2016|publisher=Springer|page=244|isbn=9781349221073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausewitz introduced systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking, with powerful implications not only for historical and analytical writing but also for practical policy, military instruction, and operational planning. He relied on his own experiences, contemporary writings about Napoleon, and on deep historical research. His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study, written when he was 25, of the [[Thirty Years War]]. He rejects the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s view of the war as a chaotic muddle and instead explains its drawn-out operations by the [[economy]] and [[technology]] of the age, the social characteristics of the troops, and the commanders' politics and psychology. In ''On War'', Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions, actions, and reactions in an uncertain and dangerous context, and also as a socio-political phenomenon. He also stressed the complex nature of war, which encompasses both the socio-political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy.&lt;ref name=Paret&gt;Paret, ''Clausewitz and the State: The Man, His Theories, and His Times''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii}}

The word &quot;[[strategy]]&quot; had only recently come into usage in modern Europe, and Clausewitz's definition is quite narrow: &quot;the use of engagements for the object of war.&quot; Clausewitz conceived of war as a political, social, and military phenomenon which might — depending on circumstances — involve the entire population of a nation at war. In any case, Clausewitz saw military force as an instrument that states and other political actors use to pursue the ends of policy, in a dialectic between opposing wills, each with the aim of imposing his policies and will upon his enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Beatrice |last=Heuser |chapter=Clausewitz’ Ideas of Strategy and Victory |editor1-first=Hew |editor1-last=Strachan |editor2-first=Andreas |editor2-last=Herberg-Rothe |title=Clausewitz in the 21st Century: Proceedings of a March, 2005 conference at Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |pages=132–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clausewitz's emphasis on the inherent superiority of the defence suggests that habitual aggressors are likely to end up as failures. The inherent superiority of the defence obviously does not mean that the defender will always win, however: there are other asymmetries to be considered. He was interested in co-operation between the regular army and militia or partisan forces, or citizen soldiers, as one possible — sometimes the only — method of defence. In the circumstances of the Wars of the French Revolution and with Napoleon, which were energised by a rising spirit of nationalism, he emphasised the need for states to involve their entire populations in the conduct of war. This point is especially important, as these wars demonstrated that such energies could be of decisive importance and for a time led to a democratisation of the armed forces much as universal suffrage democratised politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael I. |last=Handel|title=Clausewitz and Modern Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4A6fCuHGWhcC&amp;pg=PA71|year=1986|publisher=Psychology Press|page=71|isbn=9780714632940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Clausewitz was intensely aware of the value of intelligence at all levels, he was also very sceptical of the accuracy of much military intelligence: &quot;Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain.... In short, most intelligence is false.&quot;&lt;ref name=OnWar1873 /&gt;{{rp|Vol. I pg. 38}} This circumstance is generally described as part of the [[fog of war]]. Such sceptical comments apply only to intelligence at the tactical and operational levels; at the strategic and political levels he constantly stressed the requirement for the best possible understanding of what today would be called strategic and political intelligence. His conclusions were influenced by his experiences in the Prussian Army, which was often in an intelligence fog due partly to the superior abilities of Napoleon's system but even more to the nature of war.  Clausewitz acknowledges that friction creates enormous difficulties for the realisation of any plan, and the ''fog of war'' hinders commanders from knowing what is happening. It is precisely in the context of this challenge that he develops the concept of military genius, whose capabilities are seen above all in the execution of operations. 'Military genius' is not simply a matter of intellect, but a combination of qualities of intellect, experience, personality, and temperament (and there are many possible such combinations) that create a very highly developed mental aptitude for the waging of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frederick L. |last=Shepherd III|title=The Fog Of War: Effects Of Uncertainty On Airpower Employment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBhvCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT9|year=2014|publisher=Pickle Partners|page=9|isbn=9781782896807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The armed forces of every belligerent, whether of a single state or of an alliance of states, have a certain unity, and in that way, connection; but where connection is there come in analogies of the centre of gravity. There are, therefore, in these armed forces certain centres of gravity, the movement and direction of which decide upon other points, and these centres of gravity are situated where the greatest bodies of troops are assembled. But just as, in the world of inert matter, the action against the centre of gravity has its measure and limits in the connection of the parts, so it is in war, and here as well as there the force exerted may easily be greater than the resistance requires, and then there is a blow in the air, a waste of force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnWar1873&quot;/&gt;{{rp|Vol. II pg. 180}}}}

==Interpretation and misinterpretation==
Clausewitz used a [[dialectical]] method to construct his argument, leading to frequent misinterpretation of his ideas. British military theorist [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] contends that the enthusiastic acceptance by the [[Prussia]]n military establishment – especially [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke the Elder]], a former student of his &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=35

}}&lt;/ref&gt; – of what they believed to be Clausewitz's ideas, and the subsequent widespread adoption of the Prussian military system worldwide, had a deleterious effect on [[military theory]] and [[warfare|practice]], due to their egregious misinterpretation of his ideas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As so often happens, Clausewitz's disciples carried his teaching to an extreme which their master had not intended.... [Clausewitz's] theory of war was expounded in a way too abstract and involved for ordinary soldier-minds, essentially concrete, to follow the course of his argument – which often turned back from the direction in which it was apparently leading.  Impressed yet befogged, they grasped at his vivid leading phrases, seeing only their surface meaning, and missing the deeper current of his thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]] ''Strategy'' London:Faber, 1967. Second rev. ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As described by [[Christopher Bassford]], then-professor of strategy at the [[National War College]] of the United States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main sources of confusion about Clausewitz's approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation. For example, Clausewitz's famous line that &quot;War is a mere continuation of politics by other means,&quot; (&quot;Der Krieg ist eine bloße Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln&quot;) while accurate as far as it goes, was not intended as a statement of fact. It is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point – made earlier in the analysis – that &quot;war is nothing but a duel [or wrestling match, a better translation of the German ''Zweikampf''] on a larger scale.&quot; His synthesis, which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements, says that war is neither &quot;nothing but&quot; an act of brute force nor &quot;merely&quot; a rational act of politics or policy. This synthesis lies in his &quot;fascinating trinity&quot; [wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit]: a dynamic, inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion, chance, and rational calculation.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzDotComBio /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example of this confusion is the idea that Clausewitz was a proponent of [[total war]] as used in the Third Reich's propaganda in the 1940s. In fact, he never used the term &quot;total war&quot;: rather, he discussed &quot;absolute war,&quot; a concept which evolved into the much more abstract notion of &quot;ideal war&quot; discussed at the very beginning of ''Vom Kriege''—the purely ''logical'' result of the forces underlying a &quot;pure,&quot; Platonic &quot;ideal&quot; of war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clausewitz.com/mobile/Bassford-Supersession5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In what he called a &quot;logical fantasy,&quot; war cannot be waged in a limited way: the rules of competition will force participants to use all means at their disposal to achieve victory. But in the ''real world'', he said, such rigid logic is unrealistic and dangerous. As a practical matter, the military objectives in ''real'' war that support political objectives generally fall into two broad types: &quot;war to achieve limited aims&quot;; and war to &quot;disarm&quot; the enemy, &quot;to render [him] politically helpless or militarily impotent.&quot; Thus the complete defeat of the enemy may not be necessary, desirable, or even possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hal |last1=Brands|first2=Jeremi |last2=Suri|title=The Power of the Past: History and Statecraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D03DCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147|year=2015|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|page=147|isbn=9780815727132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times the reconstruction of Clausewitzian theory has been a matter of much dispute. One analysis was that of [[Panagiotis Kondylis]], a Greek-German writer and philosopher, who opposed the interpretations of [[Raymond Aron]] in ''Penser la Guerre, Clausewitz'', and other liberal writers. According to Aron, Clausewitz was one of the first writers to condemn the militarism of the Prussian general staff and its war-proneness, based on Clausewitz's argument that &quot;war is a continuation of politics by other means.&quot; In ''Theory of War,'' Kondylis claims that this is inconsistent with Clausewitzian thought. He claims that Clausewitz was morally indifferent to war (though this probably reflects a lack of familiarity with personal letters from Clausewitz, which demonstrate an acute awareness of war's tragic aspects) and that his advice regarding politics' dominance over the conduct of war has nothing to do with pacifist ideas. For Clausewitz, war is simply one unique means that is sometimes applied to the eternal quest for power, of ''raison d'État'' in an anarchic and unsafe world.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Other notable writers who have studied Clausewitz's texts and translated them into English are historians [[Peter Paret]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]], and the philosopher, musician, and [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Anatol Rapoport]]. Howard and Paret edited the most widely used edition of ''On War'' (Princeton University Press, 1976/1984) and have produced comparative studies of Clausewitz and other theorists, such as Tolstoy. [[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]]'s ''A Guide to the Reading of &quot;On War&quot;'', in the 1976 Princeton translation, expressed his interpretations of the Prussian's theories and provided students with an influential synopsis of this vital work.

The British military historian [[John Keegan]] attacked Clausewitz's theory in his book ''[[A History of Warfare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, ''[[A History of Warfare]]''. 1993. Second edition 2004, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Keegan argued that Clausewitz assumed the existence of states, yet 'war antedates the state, diplomacy and strategy by many millennia.'

==Influence==
Clausewitz died without completing ''On War'', but despite this his ideas have been widely influential in [[military theory]] and have had a strong influence on German military thought specifically. Later Prussian and German generals, such as [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth Graf von Moltke]], were clearly influenced by Clausewitz: Moltke's widely quoted statement that &quot;No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy&quot; is a classic reflection of Clausewitz's insistence on the roles of chance, friction, &quot;fog,&quot; uncertainty, and interactivity in war.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzInEnglish&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher |last=Bassford|title=Clausewitz in English: The Reception of Clausewitz in Britain and America, 1815–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmCpdoajce0C&amp;pg=PA20|year=1994|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=20–21|isbn=9780195083835}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

Clausewitz's influence spread to British thinking as well, though at first more as a historian and analyst than as a theorist.&lt;ref name=ClausewitzInEnglish /&gt; See for example [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's extended essay] discussing Clausewitz's study of the [http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]—Wellington's only serious written discussion of the battle, which was widely discussed in 19th-century Britain. Clausewitz's broader thinking came to the fore following Britain's military embarrassments in the Boer War (1899–1902). One example of a heavy Clausewitzian influence in that era is [[Spenser Wilkinson]], journalist, the first [[Chichele Professor of Military History]] at Oxford University, and perhaps the most prominent military analyst in Britain from c. 1885 until well into the interwar period. Another is naval historian [[Julian Corbett]] (1854–1922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz's concepts and frequently an emphasis on Clausewitz's ideas about 'limited war' and the inherent strengths of the defensive form of war. Corbett's practical strategic views were often in prominent public conflict with Wilkinson's – see, for example, Wilkinson's article &quot;[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/Wilkinson/StrategyAtSea.htm Strategy at Sea],&quot; ''The Morning Post'', 12 February 1912. Following the First World War, however, the influential British military commentator [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] in the 1920s erroneously attributed to him the doctrine of &quot;total war&quot; that during the First World War had been embraced by many European general staffs and emulated by the British. More recent scholars typically see that war as so confused in terms of political rationale that it in fact contradicts much of ''On War.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Strachan | first = Hew | year = 2011 | title = Clausewitz and the First World War | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 75 | issue = 2| pages = 367–391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential British Clausewitzians today is [[Colin S. Gray]]; historian [[Hew Strachan]] (like Wilkinson also the [[Chichele Professor of Military History]] at Oxford University, since 2001) has been an energetic proponent of the ''study'' of Clausewitz, but his own views on Clausewitz's ideas are somewhat ambivalent.

With some interesting exceptions (e.g., [[John McAuley Palmer (general)|John McAuley Palmer]], [[Robert Matteson Johnston|Robert M. Johnston]], Hoffman Nickerson), Clausewitz had little influence on American military thought before 1945 other than via British writers, though Generals [[Eisenhower]] and [[Patton]] were avid readers. He did influence [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]]&lt;ref name=Cormier /&gt; {{rp|233–60}} and [[Mao Zedong]], and thus the Communist Soviet and Chinese traditions, as Lenin emphasised the inevitability of wars among capitalist states in the age of imperialism and presented the armed struggle of the working class as the only path toward the eventual elimination of war.&lt;ref&gt;Kipp, Joseph W. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1987539 &quot;Lenin and Clausewitz: the Militarization of Marxism, 1914–1921.&quot;] ''Military Affairs'' 1985 49(4): 184–91. {{ISSN|0026-3931}}. In JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] was an admirer of Clausewitz and called him &quot;one of the great military writers&quot;, his influence on the Red Army was immense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mertsalov, A.N. pages 11-19&quot;&gt;Mertsalov, A.N. &quot;Jomini versus Clausewitz&quot; pp. 11–19 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark and Ljubica Erickson, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2004 p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian historian A.N. Mertsalov commented that &quot;It was an irony of fate that the view in the USSR was that it was Lenin who shaped the attitude towards Clausewitz, and that Lenin's dictum that war is a continuation of politics is taken from the work of this [allegedly] anti-humanist anti-revolutionary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mertsalov, A.N. pages 11-19&quot;/&gt; The American mathematician [[Anatol Rapoport]] wrote in 1968 that Clausewitz as interpreted by Lenin formed the basis of all Soviet military thinking since 1917, and quoted the remarks by [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Vasily Sokolovsky|V.D. Sokolovsky]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In describing the essence of war, Marxism-Leninism takes as its point of departure the premise that war is not an aim in itself, but rather a tool of politics. In his remarks on Clausewitz's ''On War'', Lenin stressed that &quot;Politics is the reason, and war is only the tool, not the other way around. Consequently, it remains only to subordinate the military point of view to the political&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rapoport&gt;Rapoport, Anatol &quot;Introduction&quot; pp. 11–82 from ''On War,'' London: Penguin, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry A. Kissinger]], however, described Lenin's approach as being that politics is a continuation of war by other means, thus turning Clausewitz's argument &quot;on its head.&quot;&lt;ref name=ClausewitzInEnglish /&gt;{{rp|198}}

Rapoport argued that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Lenin's approval of Clausewitz, it probably stems from his obsession with the struggle for power. The whole Marxist conception of history is that of successive struggles for power, primarily between social classes. This was constantly applied by Lenin in a variety of contexts. Thus the entire history of philosophy appears in Lenin's writings as a vast struggle between &quot;idealism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot;. The fate of the socialist movement was to be decided by a struggle between the revolutionists and the reformers. Clausewitz's acceptance of the struggle for power as the essence of international politics must have impressed Lenin as starkly realistic.&lt;ref name=Rapoport /&gt;{{rp|37–38}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clausewitz directly influenced Mao Zedong, who read ''On War'' in 1938 and organised a seminar on Clausewitz for the Party leadership in [[Yan'an]]. Thus the &quot;Clausewitzian&quot; content in many of Mao's writings is not merely a regurgitation of Lenin but reflects Mao's study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Yuanlin | year = 1999 | title = Mao Zedongs Bezugnahme auf Clausewitz | url = | journal = Archiv für Kulturgeschichte | volume = 81 | issue = 2| pages = 443–71 | doi=10.7788/akg.1999.81.2.443}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea that war involves inherent &quot;friction&quot; that distorts, to a greater or lesser degree, all prior arrangements, has become common currency in fields such as business strategy and sport. The phrase ''[[fog of war]]'' derives from Clausewitz's stress on how confused warfare can seem while immersed within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berkun | first = Scott | title = The Art of Project Management | isbn = 978-0-596-00786-7 | year = 2005 | publisher = OŔeilly | location = Beijing | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780596007867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[Center of gravity (military)|center of gravity]], used in a military context derives from Clausewitz's usage, which he took from [[Newtonian mechanics]]. In U.S. military doctrine, &quot;center of gravity&quot; refers to the basis of an opponent's power at the operational, strategic, or political level, though this is only one aspect of Clausewitz's use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph W Graham|title=What the U.

===Late 20th and early 21st century===
The deterrence strategy of the United States in the 1950s was closely inspired by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]’s reading of Clausewitz as a young officer in the 1920s. Eisenhower was greatly impressed by Clausewitz’s example of a theoretical, idealised “absolute war” in ''Vom Krieg'' as a way of demonstrating how absurd it would be to attempt such a strategy in practice. For Eisenhower, the age of nuclear weapons had made what was for Clausewitz in the early 19th century only a theoretical vision an all too real possibility in the mid-20th century. From Eisenhower's viewpoint, the best deterrent to war was to show the world just how appalling and horrific a nuclear “absolute war” would be if it should ever occur, hence a series of much publicised nuclear tests in the Pacific, giving first priority in the defence budget to nuclear weapons and delivery systems over conventional weapons, and making repeated statements in public that the United States was able and willing at all times to use nuclear weapons. In this way through the [[massive retaliation]] doctrine and the closely related foreign policy concept of [[brinkmanship]], Eisenhower hoped to hold out a creditable vision of Clausewitzian nuclear “absolute war” in order to deter the Soviet Union and/or China from ever risking a war or even conditions that might lead to a war with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Gaddis, John Lewis &quot;We Now Know'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, 1998 pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''...Philanthropists may easily imagine there is a skilful method of disarming and overcoming an enemy without causing great bloodshed, and that this is the proper tendency of the art of War. However plausible this may appear, still it is an error which must be extirpated; for in such dangerous things as war, the errors which proceed from a spirit of benevolence are just the worst. As the use of physical power to the utmost extent by no means excludes the co-operation of the intelligence, it follows that he who uses force unsparingly, without reference to the quantity of bloodshed, must obtain a superiority if his adversary does not act likewise. By such means the former dictates the law to the latter, and both proceed to extremities, to which the only limitations are those imposed by the amount of counteracting force on each side.'''|float=right |width=30% |fontzsize=101%|bgcolor=Cornsilk |author=Clausewitz |source=''On War'', Book I, Chapter 1&lt;ref name=OnWar1873 /&gt;{{rp|Vol. I pgs. 1–2}}}}
After 1970, some theorists claimed that [[nuclear proliferation]] made Clausewitzian concepts obsolete after the 20th-century period in which they dominated the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sheppard, John E., Jr. | title = On War: Is Clausewitz Still Relevant? | journal = Parameters | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | date = September 1990 | pages = 85–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Sheppard, Jr., argues that by developing nuclear weapons, state-based conventional armies simultaneously both perfected their original purpose, to destroy a mirror image of themselves, and made themselves obsolete. No two [[nuclear powers|powers]] have used nuclear weapons against each other, instead using conventional means or [[proxy wars]] to settle disputes. If such a conflict did occur, presumably both combatants would be [[Mutually assured destruction|annihilated]]. Heavily influenced by the war in Vietnam and by antipathy to American strategist [[Henry Kissinger]], the American biologist, musician, and game-theorist [[Anatol Rapoport]] argued in 1968 that a Clausewitzian view of war was not only obsolete in the age of nuclear weapons, but also highly dangerous as it promoted a &quot;zero-sum paradigm&quot; to international relations and a &quot;dissolution of rationality&quot; amongst decision-makers.&lt;ref name=Rapoport /&gt;{{rp|73–77}}

The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century have seen many instances of state armies attempting to suppress [[insurgency|insurgencies]], [[terrorism]], and other forms of [[asymmetrical warfare]]. Clausewitz did not focus solely on wars between countries with well-defined armies. The era of the French Revolution and Napoleon was full of revolutions, rebellions, and violence by &quot;non-state actors&quot;, such as the wars in the French Vendée and in Spain. Clausewitz wrote a series of “Lectures on Small War” and studied the rebellion in the Vendée (1793–1796) and the Tyrolean uprising of 1809. In his famous “Bekenntnisdenkschrift” of 1812, he called for a “Spanish war in Germany” and laid out a comprehensive guerrilla strategy to be waged against Napoleon. In ''On War'' he included a famous chapter on “The People in Arms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reiner Pommerin|title=Clausewitz Goes Global: Carl von Clausewitz in the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UTaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293|year=2014|page=293|isbn=9783937885780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent critic of Clausewitz is the Israeli military historian [[Martin van Creveld]]. In his book ''The Transformation of War'',&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Creveld, ''The Transformation of War: The Most Radical Reinterpretation of Armed Conflict Since Clausewitz'' (New York: The Free Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Creveld argued that Clausewitz's famous &quot;Trinity&quot; of people, army, and government was an obsolete socio-political construct based on the state, which was rapidly passing from the scene as the key player in war, and that he (Creveld) had constructed a new &quot;non-trinitarian&quot; model for modern warfare. Creveld's work has had great influence. Daniel Moran replied, 'The most egregious misrepresentation of Clausewitz's famous metaphor must be that of Martin van Creveld, who has declared Clausewitz to be an apostle of Trinitarian War, by which he means, incomprehensibly, a war of 'state against state and army against army,' from which the influence of the people is entirely excluded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moran, &quot;Clausewitz on Waterloo: Napoleon at Bay,&quot; in Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, ''On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellington, and the Campaign of 1815'', ed./trans. Christopher Bassford, Daniel Moran, and Gregory W. Pedlow (Clausewitz.com, 2010), p.242, n.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Bassford went further, noting that one need only ''read'' the paragraph in which Clausewitz defined his Trinity to see &quot;that the words 'people,' 'army,' and 'government' appear nowhere at all in the list of the Trinity’s components.... Creveld's and Keegan's assault on Clausewitz's Trinity is not only a classic 'blow into the air,' i.e., an assault on a position Clausewitz doesn't occupy. It is also a pointless attack on a concept that is quite useful in its own right. In any case, their failure to read the actual wording of the theory they so vociferously attack, and to grasp its deep relevance to the phenomena they describe, is hard to credit.&quot;&lt;ref name=TipToe /&gt;

Some have gone further and suggested that Clausewitz's best-known aphorism, that war is a continuation of politics with other means, is not only irrelevant today but also inapplicable historically.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance John Keegan, ''A History of Warfare'' (New York: Knopf, 1993), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; For an opposing view see the sixteen essays presented in ''Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century'' edited by [[Hew Strachan]] and Andreas Herberg-Rothe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Hew |editor1-last=Strachan |editor2-first=Andreas |editor2-last=Herberg-Rothe |title=Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century: Proceedings of a March, 2005 conference at Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In military academies, schools, and universities worldwide, Clausewitz's literature is often mandatory reading.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Caforio, ''Social sciences and the military: an interdisciplinary overview'' (2006) p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;
