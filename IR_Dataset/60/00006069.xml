[[File:25 pair color code chart.svg|upright|thumb|[[25-pair color code]] chart used in certain kinds of wiring.]]
A '''color code''' or '''colour code''' is a system for displaying information by using different [[color]]s.

The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long distance communication by use of flags, as in [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers: Volume 29'' (1893), p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein [[red]] signified [[Risk|danger]] and [[white]] signified [[safety]], with other colors having similar assignments of meaning.

As chemistry and other technologies advanced, it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar, such as [[Electrical wiring|wiring]] in electrical and electronic devices, and pharmaceutical [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]].

The use of color codes has been extended to abstractions, such as the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] color code in the United States. Similarly, [[hospital emergency codes]] often incorporate colors (such as the widely used &quot;Code Blue&quot; indicating a [[cardiac arrest]]), although they may also include numbers, and may not conform to a uniform standard.

Color codes do present some potential problems. On forms and signage, the use of color can distract from black and white text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;See, e.g., Michael Richard Cohen, ''Medication Errors'' (2007), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often difficult for [[color blindness|color blind]] and blind people to interpret, and even for those with normal color vision, use many colors to code many variables can lead to use of confusingly similar colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;/&gt;

==Examples==
Systems incorporating color-coding include:

*In electronics:
**[[Electrical wiring]] – AC power phase, neutral, and grounding wires
**[[Electronic color code]] – for electronic components
**[[Jump start (vehicle)|Jumper cables]] used to jump-start a vehicle
**[[Surround sound#Channel identification|Surround sound ports and cables]]
**[[Audio and video interfaces and connectors#Audio|Audio connectors]]
**[[Audio and video interfaces and connectors#Video|Video connectors]]
**[[Color coding of optical fibers|Optical fibers]]
**[[PC System Design Guide#Color-coding scheme for connectors and ports|PC connectors and ports]]
**[[Three-phase electric power#Color codes|Three-phase electric power]] (electrical wiring)
**[[25-pair color code]] – telecommunications wiring
**[[Ethernet physical layer#Twisted-pair cable|Ethernet twisted-pair wiring]] – local area networks
*In video games
**[[Health (gaming)|Health]] and [[Magic (gaming)|magic points]]
**To distinguish friend from foe, for instance in ''[[StarCraft]]'', ''[[Halo (game)|Halo]]'', or ''[[League of Legends]]''
**To distinguish rarity or quality of items in adventure and [[role-playing game]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Color-Coded Loot|publisher=Giant Bomb|url=http://giantbomb.com/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In navigation:
**[[Navigation light]]
**[[Sea mark]]
**[[Characteristic light]]
**[[Traffic light]]s
*Other technology:
**[[Bottled gas]]es
**[[Fire extinguisher]]s
**[[Utility color code|Underground utility location]]
**[[Black hat hacking]], [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]]
**[[kerbside collection]] 
*In military use:
**[[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#Affiliation]]
**[[Artillery shell]]s and other munitions, which are color-coded according to their pyrotechnic contents
**[[Rainbow Herbicides]]
**[[List of Rainbow Codes]]
*In social functions:
** [[Jeff Cooper#Combat mindset and the Cooper color code|Cooper's Color Code]] of the combat mindset
**[[ISO 22324]], Guidelines for color-coded alerts in public warning
**[[Handkerchief code]]
**[[Ribbon]] colors ''see:'' [[:Category:Ribbon symbolism]]
**[[Rank in Judo]]
**[[Blue-collar worker]], [[white-collar worker]], [[pink-collar worker]], [[grey-collar]], [[green-collar worker]]
*At point of sale (especially for [[packaging]] within a huge range of [[Stock keeping unit|products]]: to quickly differentiate variants, brands, categories)
