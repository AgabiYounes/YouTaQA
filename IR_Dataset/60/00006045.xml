'''Clodius''' is an alternate form of the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]'' [[Claudius (gens)|Claudius]], a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] ''[[gens]]'' that was traditionally regarded as [[Sabine]] in origin. The alternation of ''o'' and ''au'' is characteristic of the Sabine dialect. The [[grammatical gender|feminine form]] is '''Clodia'''.

===Publius Clodius Pulcher===
{{main|Publius Clodius Pulcher}}
&lt;!--the footnote at the end of this section is the source for the entire section--&gt;During the [[Roman Republic|Late Republic]], the spelling ''Clodius'' is most prominently associated with [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], a [[populares|popularis]] politician who gave up his patrician status through [[Roman adoption|an order]] in order to qualify for the office of [[tribune#Plebeian tribune|tribune of the ''plebs'']]. Clodius positioned himself as a champion of the urban ''[[plebs]]'', supporting free grain for the poor and the right of association in guilds (''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]]''); because of this individual's ideology, ''Clodius'' has often been taken as a more &quot;plebeian&quot; spelling and a gesture of political solidarity. Clodius's two elder brothers, the [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 54 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]] who was [[Roman consul|consul]] in 54 BC and the [[Gaius Claudius Pulcher (praetor 56 BC)|C. Claudius Pulcher]] who was praetor in 56 BC, conducted more conventional political careers and are referred to in contemporary sources with the traditional spelling.

The view that ''Clodius'' represents a plebeian or politicized form has been questioned by Clodius's chief modern-era biographer. In ''The Patrician Tribune'', W. Jeffrey Tatum points out that the spelling is also associated with Clodius's sisters and that &quot;the political explanation … is almost certainly wrong.&quot; A plebeian branch of the ''gens'', the Claudii Marcelli, retained the supposedly patrician spelling, while there is some [[epigraphy|inscriptional]] evidence that the ''-o-'' form may also have been used on occasion by close male relatives of the &quot;patrician tribune&quot; Clodius. Tatum argues that the use of ''-o-'' by the &quot;chic&quot; [[Clodia Metelli]] was a fashionable affectation, and that Clodius, whose perhaps inordinately loving relationship with his sister was the subject of much gossip and insinuation, was imitating his stylish sibling. The [[Claudius (gens)#Etymology|linguistic variation of ''o'' for ''au'']] was characteristic of the [[Umbrian language]], of which [[Sabine]] was a branch. Forms using ''o'' were considered archaic or rustic in the 50s BC, and the use of ''Clodius'' would have been either a whimsical gesture of [[pastoral|pastoral fantasy]], or a trendy assertion of [[antiquarianism|antiquarian]] authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jeffrey Tatum, ''The Patrician Tribune: Publius Clodius Pulcher'' (University of North Caroline Press, 1999), pp. 247–248 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHGYYaHLgfgC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=%22Clodius+or+Claudius%3F%22+inauthor:Tatum&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Clodius%20or%20Claudius%3F%22%20inauthor%3ATatum&amp;f=false online.] The idea that the form ''Clodius'' announced ethnic identity is suggested also by Gary D. Farney, ''Ethnic identity and aristocratic competition in Republican Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 89 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jdFF_Pc7GPMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA89&amp;dq=Clodius+Claudius+spelling&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Clodius%20Claudius%20spelling&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;
