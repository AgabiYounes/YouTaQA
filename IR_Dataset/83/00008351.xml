Parker School (Chicago)|Francis W. Parker School]] and at [[Goddard College]] in [[Plainfield, Vermont]]. At the Chicago Public Library Foundation 20th anniversary fundraiser in 2006, though, Mamet announced &quot;My alma mater is the Chicago Public Library. I got what little educational foundation I got in the third-floor reading room, under the tutelage of a Coca-Cola sign&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mamet|first=David|title=My Alma Mater|journal=American Libraries|date=2006|pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a move to Chicago's North Side, Mamet encountered theater director [[Robert Sickinger]], and began to work occasionally at Sickinger's [[Hull House|Hull House Theatre]]. This represented the beginning of Mamet's lifelong involvement with the theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nadel2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=I.

Among those films, ''[[Heist (2001 film)|Heist]]'' enjoyed the biggest commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150921210011/http://www.hollywood.com/movies/box-office-analysis-nov-11-57232728/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=heist.htm |title=Heist |access-date=2009-02-19 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20021216041748/http://us.imdb.com/Charts/video020609&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:David Mamet - 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Mamet in 1978]] --&gt;

When Mamet adapted his play for the 1992 film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', he wrote an additional part (including the monologue &quot;[[Coffee's for closers]]&quot;) for [[Alec Baldwin]].

Mamet continues to work with an informal repertory company for his films, including Crouse, [[William H. Macy]], [[Joe Mantegna]], and [[Rebecca Pidgeon]], as well as the aforementioned school friends.

Mamet did a rewrite of the script for ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' under the pseudonym &quot;Richard Weisz&quot; and turned in an early version of a script for ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'' which was rejected by director [[Spike Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Janet |title=The Battle To Film Malcolm X |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975087-1,00.html |magazine=Time |accessdate=2007-03-20 | date=1992-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Mamet directed a film version of ''[[Beckett on Film#Catastrophe|Catastrophe]],'' a one-act play by [[Samuel Beckett]] featuring [[Harold Pinter]] and [[John Gielgud]] (in his final screen performance). In 2008, he directed and wrote the [[mixed martial arts]] movie ''[[Redbelt]],'' about a martial arts instructor tricked into fighting in a professional bout.

In [[On_Directing_Film|''On Directing Film,'']] Mamet asserts that directors should focus on getting the point of a scene across, rather than simply following a protagonist, or adding visually beautiful or intriguing shots. Films should create order from disorder in search of the objective.

===Books===
In 1990 Mamet published ''The Hero Pony'', a 55-page collection of poetry. He has also published a series of short plays, monologues and four novels, ''The Village'' (1994), ''The Old Religion'' (1997), ''Wilson: A Consideration of the Sources'' (2000), and ''Chicago'' (2018).

In 2004 he published a lauded version of the classical [[Faust]] story, ''Faustus'', however, when the play was staged in [[San Francisco]] during the spring of 2004, it was not well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=von Buchau |first=Stephanie |title=Dr. Faustus |url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/4489 |publisher=TheaterMania |accessdate=2004-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041023060400/http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm/story/4489 |archivedate=2004-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2010, Mamet released a graphic novel ''The Trials of Roderick Spode (The Human Ant)''.

On June 2, 2011, ''The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture'', Mamet's book detailing his conversion from modern liberalism to &quot;a reformed liberal&quot; was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CSPAN Video: The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/SecretK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamet published ''Three War Stories'', a collection of novellas, on November 11, 2013. In an interview with Newsmax TV, Mamet said he wanted to write about war, despite never having served. Moreover, the book allowed Mamet to free characters that had occupied his mind for years. On the subject of characters as a reason for writing, Mamet told the host, &quot;You want to get these guys out of your head. You just want them to stop talking to you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bachman |first=John |title=Author Mamet to Newsmax: New Stories Deal With Brutality of War |url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/mamet-brutality-war-novellas/2013/11/11/id/535981 |publisher=Newsmax |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One December 3, 2019, Mamet is set to publish a novel, ''The Diary of a Porn Star by Priscilla Wriston-Ranger: As Told to David Mamet With an Afterword by Mr. Mamet.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://posthillpress.com/book/the-diary-of-a-porn-star-by-priscilla-wriston-ranger-as-told-to-david-mamet-with-an-afterword-by-mr-mamet The Diary of a Porn Star by Priscilla Wriston-Ranger: As Told to David Mamet with an Afterword by Mr. Mamet]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television and radio ===
Mamet wrote the &quot;Wasted Weekend&quot; episode of ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' that aired in 1987. His then-wife, [[Lindsay Crouse]], appeared in numerous episodes (including that one) as Officer McBride. Mamet is also the creator, producer and frequent writer of the television series ''[[The Unit]]'', where he wrote a well-circulated [http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/ memo] to the writing staff. He directed a third-season episode of ''[[The Shield]]'' with [[Shawn Ryan]]. In 2007, Mamet directed two television commercials for [[Ford Motor Company]]. The two 30-second ads featured the [[Ford Edge]] and were filmed in Mamet's signature style of fast-paced dialogue and clear, simple imagery. Mamet's sister, [[Lynn Mamet|Lynn]], is a producer and writer for television shows, such as ''The Unit'' and ''Law &amp; Order''.

Mamet has contributed several dramas to [[BBC Radio]] through Jarvis &amp; Ayres Productions, including an adaptation of ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' for [[BBC Radio 3]] and new dramas for [[BBC Radio 4]]. The comedy ''Keep Your Pantheon (or On the Whole I'd Rather Be in Mesopotamia)'' was aired in 2007.

===Other media and political views===
Since May 2005 he has been a contributing blogger at ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', drawing satirical cartoons with themes including political strife in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/david-mamet |title=David Mamet – Politics on The Huffington Post |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 essay at ''[[The Village Voice]]'' titled &quot;Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mamet |first=David |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/03/11/david-mamet-why-i-am-no-longer-a-brain-dead-liberal/ |title=David Mamet: Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain-Dead Liberal' |newspaper=Village Voice |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; he revealed that he had gradually rejected so-called [[political correctness]] and [[progressivism]] and embraced [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]]. Mamet has spoken in interviews of changes in his views,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benn |first=Aluf |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/an-interview-with-david-mamet-on-israel-and-zionism-1.407117 |title=An interview with David Mamet on Israel and Zionism Israel News |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting his agreement with [[free market]] theorists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;David Mamet,&quot; ''[[Freedom Watch]] with Judge [[Andrew Napolitano]]'', ''[[Fox Business Network]]'', June 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], and economist [[Thomas Sowell]], whom Mamet called &quot;one of our greatest minds&quot;.

During promotion of a book, Mamet said British people had &quot;a taint of [[antisemitism|anti-semitism]],&quot; claiming they &quot;want to give [Israel] away to some people whose claim is rather dubious.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gapper&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gapper |first=John |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/ft/2011/06/lunch_with_david_mamet.html?via=gdpr-consent|title=Lunch With David Mamet|work=Slate|agency=Financial Times|date=June 11, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, Mamet went on to say that &quot;there are famous dramatists and novelists [in the UK] whose works are full of anti-Semitic filth.&quot; He refused to give examples because of British libel laws (the interview was conducted in New York City for the ''[[Financial Times]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Gapper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/12/david-mamet-antisemitism-britain|title=David Mamet launches tirade against 'antisemitism' of British writers|work=The Observer|date=June 12, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his pro-Israel positions; in his book ''The Secret Knowledge'' he claimed that &quot;Israelis would like to live in peace within their borders; the Arabs would like to kill them all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/node/18833539?story_id=18833539&amp;fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=A liberal recants | date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamet wrote an article for the November 2012 issue of ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]'' imploring fellow [[Jewish Americans]] to vote for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mamet |first=David |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/the_final_obama_romney_showdown_a_note_to_a_stiff_necked_people |title=The final Obama/Romney showdown: A note to a stiff-necked people &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arellano |first=Jennifer |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2012/11/05/david-mamet-mitt-romney/ |title=David Mamet implores fellow Jews to vote for Mitt Romney &amp;#124; PopWatch &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Popwatch.ew.com |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay for ''[[Newsweek]]'', published on 29 January 2013, Mamet argued against [[gun control]] laws: &quot;It was intended to guard us against this inevitable decay of government that the Constitution was written. Its purpose was and is not to enthrone a Government superior to an imperfect and confused electorate, but to protect us from such a government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2013/01/28/gun-laws-and-the-fools-of-chelm-by-david-mamet.html Gun Laws and the Fools of Chelm]. Mamet, David. ''Newsweek / The Daily Beast''. 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamet has described the [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)|NFL anthem protests]] as “absolutely f***ing despicable”.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt;

Mamet's style of writing dialogue, marked by a cynical, street-smart edge, precisely crafted for effect, is so distinctive that it has come to be called ''Mamet speak.''&lt;ref&gt;A Companion to Twentieth-century American Drama, David Krasner, Blackwell Publishing, 2005, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write &quot;pretty&quot; at the expense of sound, logical plots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing in Restaurants |url=https://archive.org/details/writinginrestaur00mame |url-access=registration |last=Mamet |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked how he developed his style for writing dialogue, Mamet said, &quot;In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, based solely on our ability to speak the language viciously. That's probably where my ability was honed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Playboy Interviews: The Directors |editor=Stephen Randall |year=2006 |publisher=M Press |page=276 |chapter=David Mamet: April 1996, interviewed by Geoffrey Norman and John Rezek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One instance of Mamet's dialogue style can be found in ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', in which two down-on-their-luck real estate salesmen are considering stealing from their employer's office. [[Glengarry Glen Ross#Characters|George Aaronow]] and [[Glengarry Glen Ross#Characters|Dave Moss]] equivocate on the meaning of &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;speak&quot;, turning language and meaning to deceptive purposes:

:'''Moss''' No. What do you mean? Have I talked to him about ''this'' [Pause]
:'''Aaronow''' Yes. I mean are you actually ''talking'' about this, or are we just...
:'''Moss''' No, we're just...
:'''Aaronow''' We're just ''&quot;talking&quot;'' about it.
:'''Moss''' We're just ''speaking'' about it. [Pause] As an ''idea.''
:'''Aaronow''' As an idea.
:'''Moss''' Yes.
:'''Aaronow''' We're not actually ''talking'' about it.
:'''Moss''' No.
:'''Aaronow''' Talking about it as a...
:'''Moss''' ''No.''
:'''Aaronow''' As a ''robbery.''
:'''Moss''' As a &quot;robbery?&quot; No.

Mamet dedicated ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' to [[Harold Pinter]], who was instrumental in its being first staged at the [[Royal National Theatre]], (London) in 1983, and whom Mamet has acknowledged as an influence on its success, and on his other work.&lt;ref name=NightWaves&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/nightwaves/pip/htjwr/ &quot;Landmarks,&quot;] on ''[[Night Waves]]'' [[BBC Radio]], March 3, 2005, accessed January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mamet and gender issues===
Mamet's plays have frequently sparked debate and controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;TG&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bway.ly/e1kah#https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jul/08/david-mamet-warns-theatres-25000-fine-if-you-discuss-my-work-glengarry-glen-ross-oleanna|title=David Mamet’s $25,000 threat to theatres over post-show talks|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Dalya|last=Alberge|date=8 July 2017|accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a staging of ''Oleanna'' in 1992, in which a post-secondary student accuses her professor of sexual harassment, a critic reported that the play divided the audience by gender and recounted &quot;couples emerged screaming at each other&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TG&quot; /&gt;

Arthur Holmberg in his 2014 book ''David Mamet and Male Friendship'', has reconsidered the gender issue in many of Mamet's plays throughout his career by asserting a prominent and recurrent reversed sexual orientation of portrayed male gender preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Holmberg, ''David Mamet and Male Friendship'', Hardcover: 276 pages, Palgrave Macmillan (April 2, 2014), {{ISBN|978-1137305183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Mamet and actress [[Lindsay Crouse]] married in 1977 and divorced in 1990. The couple have two children, Willa and [[Zosia Mamet|Zosia]]. Willa was a professional photographer and is now a singer/songwriter;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mamet |first1=Willa |title=Willa Mamet |url=https://www.willamametmusic.com/ |website=Willa Mamet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zosia is an actress. Mamet has been married to actress and singer-songwriter [[Rebecca Pidgeon]] since 1991. They live together in [[Santa Monica]], California.&lt;ref name=tt/&gt; They have two children, [[Clara Mamet|Clara]] and Noah.

Mamet is a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jew]] and strongly pro-Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5164626 |title=An Interview With David Mamet on Israel and Zionism|publisher=haaretz.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archive ==
The papers of David Mamet were sold to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 2007 and first opened for research in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00486p1|title=David Mamet: An Inventory of His Papers in the Manuscript Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing collection consists mainly of manuscripts and related production materials for most of his plays, films, and other writings, but also includes his personal journals from 1966 to 2005. In 2015, the Ransom Center secured a second major addition to Mamet's papers that include more recent works. Additional materials relating to Mamet and his career can be found in the Ransom Center's collections of [[Robert De Niro]], [[Mel Gussow]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Paul Schrader]], [[Don DeLillo]], and John Russell Brown.
