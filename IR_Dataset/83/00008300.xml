'''Doris Day''' (born '''Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff'''; April 3, 1922&amp;nbsp;– May 13, 2019&lt;!-- Do not change her birth date to 1924 or any other date - this has been discussed and resolved on the talk page. --&gt;) was an American actress, singer, and animal welfare activist. She began her career as a [[big band]] singer in 1939, achieving commercial success in 1945 with two No. 1 recordings, &quot;[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]&quot; and &quot;[[My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time]]&quot; with [[Les Brown &amp; His Band of Renown]]. She left Brown to embark on a solo career and recorded more than 650 songs from 1947 to 1967.

Day's film career began during the latter part of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] with the film ''[[Romance on the High Seas]]'' (1948), leading to a 20-year career as a motion picture actress. She starred in films of many genres, including musicals, comedies, dramas, and thrillers. She played the title role in ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'' (1953) and starred in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) with [[James Stewart]]. Her best-known films are those in which she co-starred with [[Rock Hudson]], chief among them 1959's ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She also worked with [[James Garner]] on both ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Thrill of It All (film)|The Thrill of It All]]'' (1963), and  starred alongside [[Clark Gable]], [[Cary Grant]], [[James Cagney]], [[David Niven]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Richard Widmark]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Lauren Bacall]], and [[Rod Taylor]] in various movies. After ending her film career in 1968, only briefly removed from the height of her popularity, she starred in her own sitcom ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'' (1968–1973).

Day became one of the biggest film stars in the early 1960s, and as of 2012 was one of eight performers to have been the top box-office earner in the United States four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Biographies&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK2419200293&amp;u=xavier_main&amp;jsid=9460d7cd6fd7bee022fae21120e7eb84|title=Doris Day|date=2013|accessdate=January 15, 2016|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|publication-place=Detroit, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AEHotchner1976&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doris Day: Her Own Story|last=Hotchner|first=A.E.|publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc.|year=1976|isbn=978-0-688-02968-5|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she released her 29th studio album ''[[My Heart (Doris Day album)|My Heart]]'' which contained new material and became a UK Top 10 album. She received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and a Legend Award from the [[Society of Singers]]. In 1960, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorisday.com/work/awards Doris Day awards and nominations], Dorisday.com&lt;/ref&gt; and was given the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in motion pictures in 1989. In 2004, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]; this was followed in 2011 by the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association's Career Achievement Award]].

[[File:Doris Day, Aquarium, gottlieb.01841.jpg|thumb|upright|Day at the Aquarium Jazz Club, New York (1946)]]
While recovering from her car accident, Kappelhoff started to sing along with the radio and discovered a talent she did not know she had. &quot;During this long, boring period, I used to while away a lot of time listening to the radio, sometimes singing along with the likes of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], and [[Glenn Miller]]&quot;, she told [[A. E. Hotchner]], one of Day's biographers. &quot;But the one radio voice I listened to above others belonged to [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. There was a quality to her voice that fascinated me, and I'd sing along with her, trying to catch the subtle ways she shaded her voice, the casual yet clean way she sang the words.&quot;{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|pp=38–39}}

Observing her daughter sing rekindled Alma's interest in [[show business]], and she decided Doris must have singing lessons. She engaged a teacher, Grace Raine.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|p=38}} After three lessons, Raine told Alma that young Doris had &quot;tremendous potential&quot;; Raine was so impressed that she gave Doris three lessons a week for the price of one. Years later, Day said that Raine had the biggest effect on her singing style and career.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|pp=38–39}}

During the eight months she was taking singing lessons, Kappelhoff had her first professional jobs as a vocalist, on the [[WLW]] radio program ''Carlin's Carnival'', and in a local restaurant, Charlie Yee's Shanghai Inn.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|pp=40–41}} During her radio performances, she first caught the attention of [[Barney Rapp]], who was looking for a female vocalist and asked if she would like to audition for the job. According to Rapp, he had auditioned about 200 singers when Kappelhoff got the job.{{Sfn|Hotchner|1975|p=44}}

While working for Rapp in 1939, she adopted the stage surname &quot;Day&quot;, at Rapp's suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doris Day's sweet success| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3569113.stm|work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate= August 10, 2013|date=April 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapp felt that &quot;Kappelhoff&quot; was too long for [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]], and he admired her rendition of the song &quot;Day After Day&quot;.{{Sfn|Kaufman|2008|p=22}} After working with Rapp, Day worked with bandleaders Jimmy James,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To Entertain at Convention Here |url= https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-celebrity-clipping-apr-17-1940-241851| accessdate=April 3, 2017|work=[[The Lima News]]|date=April 17, 1940|page=11}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Crosby]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutro2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last= Sutro| first=Dirk|title=Jazz For Dummies| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tqkRibY3RHoC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-06852-6|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Family2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=The Guinan Family |title= Lakewood Park |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zh0zVcyDFxUC&amp;pg=PA72 |accessdate= August 8, 2013|date=October 2009| publisher= Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-6578-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Day appeared as a singer in three [[Soundies]] with the Les Brown band.&lt;ref name=&quot;TerenzioMacGillivray1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Terenzio|first1=Maurice|last2=MacGillivray|first2=Scott|last3=Okuda|first3=Ted|title=The Soundies Distributing Corporation of America: a history and filmography of their &quot;jukebox&quot; musical films of the 1940s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aH5ZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=August 9, 2013|date=1991|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-89950-578-7|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working with Brown, Day recorded her first hit recording, &quot;[[Sentimental Journey (song)|Sentimental Journey]]&quot;, released in early 1945.

While singing with the Les Brown band and for nearly two years on [[Bob Hope]]'s weekly radio program,&lt;ref name=&quot;BrowneBrowne2001&quot; /&gt; she toured extensively across the United States.

Her performance of the song &quot;[[Embraceable You]]&quot; impressed songwriter [[Jule Styne]] and his partner, [[Sammy Cahn]], and they recommended her for a role in ''[[Romance on the High Seas]]'' (1948).

===Breakthrough (1955–1958)===
[[File:Doris Day in Love Me or Leave Me trailer.jpg|right|thumb|Day in the trailer for ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]'' (1955)]]
Having become primarily recognized as a musical-comedy actress, Day gradually took on more dramatic roles to broaden her range. Her dramatic star turn as singer [[Ruth Etting]] in ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]'' (1955), with top billing above [[James Cagney]], received critical and commercial success, becoming Day's biggest hit thus far.&lt;ref name=&quot;LisantiPaul2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lisanti|first1=Tom|last2=Paul|first2=Louis|title=Film Fatales: Women in Espionage Films and Television, 1962–1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4VJCaXXANA0C&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1194-8|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cagney said she had &quot;the ability to project the simple, direct statement of a simple, direct idea without cluttering it&quot;, comparing her to [[Laurette Taylor]]'s Broadway performance in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' (1945), one of the greatest performances by an American actor.&lt;ref&gt;Aljean Harmetz (2019). &quot;Doris Day, Charming Star With a Golden Voice, Dies at 97&quot;.

Day starred in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s suspense film ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) with [[James Stewart]]. She sang two songs in the film, &quot;[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]&quot; which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler2008 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Don|title=Music of the Postwar Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2dgJVseZAlsC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34191-5|pages=113–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;We'll Love Again&quot;. The film was Day's 10th movie to be in the Top 10 at the box office. Day played the title role in the thriller/noir ''[[Julie (1956 film)|Julie]]'' (also 1956) with [[Louis Jourdan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doris Day Due Tonight for Premiere|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21285390/the_cincinnati_enquirer/|accessdate=June 26, 2018|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=October 7, 1956|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three successive dramatic films, Day returned to her musical/comedic roots in ''[[The Pajama Game (film)|The Pajama Game]]'' (1957) with [[John Raitt]].

''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} annual nationwide poll of disc jockeys had ranked Day as the No. 1 female vocalist nine times in ten years (1949 through 1958), but her success and popularity as a singer was now being overshadowed by her box-office appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dorisday.net/recordings/|title=The Films of Doris Day: recordings|website=Dorisday.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box-office success (1959–1968)===
[[File:DorisDay-midnightlace.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Day in a publicity portrait for ''[[Midnight Lace]]'' (1960)]]
In 1959, Day entered her most successful phase as a film actress with a series of romantic comedies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gourley2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gourley|first=Catherine|title=Gidgets and Women Warriors: Perceptions of Women in the 1950s and 1960s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7lH55EmxkbkC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=2008|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-6805-6|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Monteith2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Monteith|first=Sharon|title=American Culture in the 1960s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6dG0vvkizM0C&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1947-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; This success began with ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959), co-starring [[Rock Hudson]] who became a lifelong friend, and [[Tony Randall]].

Along with [[David Niven]] and [[Janis Paige]], Day starred in ''[[Please Don't Eat the Daisies (film)|Please Don't Eat the Daisies]]'' (1960) and with [[Cary Grant]] in the comedy ''[[That Touch of Mink]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doris Day, Cary Grant, That Touch of Mink (1962) {{!}} The Films of Doris Day |url=https://www.dorisday.net/that-touch-of-mink/ |website=www.dorisday.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1960 and the 1962 to 1964 period, she ranked number one at the box office, the second woman to be number one four times, an accomplished equalled by no other actress except Shirley Temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;AljeanHarmetz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Harmetz|first=Aljean |title=Wholesome Box-Office Star and Golden Voice of 'Que Sera, Sera'.|year=2019|publisher=The New York Times|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She set a record that has yet to be equaled, receiving seven consecutive [[Laurel Awards]] as the top female box office star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris1976&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=George|title=Doris Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bu9kAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=August 9, 2013|year=1976|publisher=Pyramid Publications|isbn=978-0-515-03959-7|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, the [[sexual revolution]] of the [[baby boomer]] generation had refocused public attitudes about sex. Times changed, but Day's films did not. Day's next film ''[[Do Not Disturb (1965 film)|Do Not Disturb]]'' (1965) was popular with audiences, but her popularity soon waned. Critics and comics dubbed Day &quot;The World's Oldest Virgin&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Doris Day|type=Filmography|title=[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCormick|first=Neil|title=Doris Day: sexy side of the girl next door|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8711630/Doris-Day-sexy-side-of-the-girl-next-door.html|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=August 20, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and audiences began to shy away from her films. As a result, she slipped from the list of top box-office stars, last appearing in the top ten with the hit film ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'' (1966). One of the roles she turned down was that of Mrs. Robinson in ''[[The Graduate]]'', a role that eventually went to [[Anne Bancroft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grindon2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood Romantic Comedy: Conventions, History and Controversies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=okkZPTEnYqMC&amp;pg=PT87|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9595-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her published memoirs, Day said she had rejected the part on moral grounds: she found the script &quot;vulgar and offensive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kashner|first=Sam|title=Here's to You, Mr. Nichols: The Making of ''The Graduate''|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/graduate200803|accessdate=January 17, 2014|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=Condé Nast|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She starred in the western film ''[[The Ballad of Josie]]'' (1967). That same year, Day recorded ''[[The Love Album (Doris Day album)|The Love Album]]'', although it was not released until 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Day&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dorisday.com/about|type=Official website|title=About|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year (1968), she starred in the comedy film ''[[Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?]]'' which centers on the [[Northeast blackout of November 9, 1965]].

From 1959 to 1970, Day received nine Laurel Award nominations (and won four times) for best female performance in eight comedies and one drama. From 1959 through 1969, she received six [[Golden Globe]] nominations for best female performance in three comedies, one drama (''Midnight Lace''), one musical (''Jumbo''), and her television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doris Day|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/doris-day|publisher=[[Golden Globes]]|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy and television career===
[[File:Doris Day on television show set.JPG|thumb|left|On the set of ''[[The Doris Day Show]]'']]
After her third husband [[Martin Melcher]] died on April 20, 1968, a shocked Day discovered that Melcher and his business partner and &quot;adviser&quot; Jerome Bernard Rosenthal had squandered her earnings, leaving her deeply in debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonneborn2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sonneborn|first=Liz|title=A to Z of American Women in the Performing Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yf2741A_BkYC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=August 8, 2013|date=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0790-5|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenthal had been her attorney since 1949, when he represented her in her uncontested divorce action against her second husband, saxophonist [[George W.

Day filed suit against Rosenthal in February 1969, won a successful decision in 1974, but did not receive compensation until a settlement in 1979.&lt;ref name=metnews&gt;{{cite news|last=Grace|first=Roger M.|title='Uncle Jerry' Faces the Music in Court, in State Bar Proceeding|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2007/perspectives100907.htm|accessdate=August 8, 2013|newspaper=Metropolitan News-Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day also learned to her displeasure that Melcher had committed her to a television series, which became ''[[The Doris Day Show]]''.

{{quote|It was awful. I was really, really not very well when Marty [Melcher] passed away, and the thought of going into TV was overpowering. But he'd signed me up for a series.

Day hated the idea of performing on television, but felt obligated to do it.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCM2013&quot;/&gt; The first episode of ''The Doris Day Show'' aired on September 24, 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doris Day Heads Own Show|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2406&amp;dat=19680912&amp;id=XwMrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JpQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2991,4638121|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=Hawkins County Post|date=September 12, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, from 1968 to 1973, employed &quot;Que Sera, Sera&quot; as its theme song.

By the end of its run in 1973, public tastes had changed, [[rural purge|as had those of the television industry]], and her firmly established persona was regarded as passé. She largely retired from acting after ''The Doris Day Show'', but did complete two television specials, ''The Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff Special'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356548/|title=The Doris Mary Anne Kappelhoff Special|accessdate=April 17, 2019|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Doris Day Today'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0313992/|title=Doris Day Today|accessdate=April 17, 2019|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a guest on various shows in the 1970s.

In the 1985–86 season, Day hosted her own television talk show, ''Doris Day's Best Friends'', on the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN).&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCSnares&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oberman|first=Tracy-Ann|title=Rock and Doris and Elizabeth: a moment that changed Hollywood|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/15/rock-hudson-revealed-aids|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=July 4, 2013|date=October 16, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network canceled the show after 26 episodes, despite the worldwide publicity it received.

===1980s and 1990s===
Day's husband and agent, Martin Melcher, had Beverly Hills lawyer Jerome Rosenthal handle his wife's money since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Sandler, Rachel ''When Doris Day (And Her Fortune) Got Taken For a Ride'' May 13, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;During that period, Rosenthal committed breaches of professional ethics that are difficult to exaggerate&quot;, as one court put it.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenthal v. Justices of the Supreme Court of California'', 910 F.2d 561 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1985, the California Supreme Court rejected Rosenthal's appeal of the multimillion-dollar judgment against him for legal malpractice, and upheld conclusions of a trial court and a Court of Appeal&lt;ref&gt;
''Day v. Rosenthal'', 170 Cal.App.3d 1132 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; that Rosenthal acted improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-10-17-mn-14780-story.html|title=High Court Rejects Judgment Appeal : Doris Day Wins 17-Year Battle With Ex-Attorney|last=Morain|first=Dan|date=October 17, 1985|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 14, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the lower court's judgment.

He named Day as a co-defendant, describing her as an &quot;unwilling, involuntary plaintiff whose consent cannot be obtained&quot;. Rosenthal claimed that millions of dollars Day lost were in real estate sold after Melcher died in 1968, in which Rosenthal asserted that the attorneys gave Day bad advice, telling her to sell, at a loss, three hotels, in [[Palo Alto, California]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Atlanta, Georgia]], plus some oil leases in [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-06-14-re-7056-story.html|title=Doris Day Investments Subject of Suit|last=Ryon|first=Ruth|date=June 14, 1987|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 14, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he had made the investments under a long-term plan, and did not intend to sell them until they appreciated in value.

Day turned down a tribute offer from the [[American Film Institute]] and from the Kennedy Center Honors because they require attendance in person.

===2010s===
Day, aged 89, released ''[[My Heart (Doris Day album)|My Heart]]'' in the United Kingdom on September 5, 2011, her first new album in nearly two decades since the release of ''[[The Love Album (Doris Day album)|The Love Album]]'', which, although recorded in 1967, was not released until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cody|first1=Antony|title=Doris Day releases first album in 17 years|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8733546/Doris-Day-releases-first-album-in-17-years.html|accessdate=May 18, 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album is a compilation of previously unreleased recordings produced by Day's son, Terry Melcher, before his death in 2004.

In a rare interview with ''The Hollywood Reporter'' on April 4, 2019, the day after her 97th birthday, Day talked about her work on the Doris Day Animal Foundation, founded in 1978. On the question of what her favorite film was, she answered ''[[Calamity Jane (film)|Calamity Jane]]'': &quot;I was such a tomboy growing up, and she was such a fun character to play. Of course, the music was wonderful, too—'Secret Love,' especially, is such a beautiful song.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HR2019&quot;&gt;Laurie Brookins, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/doris-day-talks-turning-97-her-animal-philanthropy-rock-hudson-1199279 “Doris Day, in Rare Interview, Talks Turning 97, Her Animal Foundation and Rock Hudson: 'I Miss Him'”,] ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''. April 3, 2019. ''(Retrieved April 10, 2019.)''&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate her birthday, her fans gathered each year to take part in a three-day party in her hometown of [[Carmel, California]], in late March. The event was also a fundraiser for her Animal Foundation. During the 2019 event, there was a special screening of her film ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959) to celebrate its 60th anniversary. About the film, Day stated in the same interview that she &quot;had such fun working with my pal, Rock. We laughed our way through three films we made together and remained great friends. I miss him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HR2019&quot; /&gt;

==Animal welfare activism==
Day's interest in animal welfare and related issues apparently dated to her teen years. While recovering from an automobile accident, she took her dog Tiny for a walk without a leash. Tiny ran into the street and was killed by a passing car. Day later expressed guilt and loneliness about Tiny's untimely death. In 1971, she co-founded Actors and Others for Animals, and appeared in a series of newspaper advertisements denouncing the wearing of fur, alongside [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and [[Jayne Meadows]].{{Sfn|Patrick|McGee|2006|p=132|ps=, photograph of ad.}}

In 1978, Day founded the Doris Day Pet Foundation, now the Doris Day Animal Foundation (DDAF).&lt;ref name=&quot;Grudens2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Grudens|first=Richard|title=Sally Bennett's Magic Moments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6M6S4t4ejcC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=2001|publisher=Celebrity Profiles Publishing|isbn=978-1-57579-181-4|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-profit [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) grant-giving public charity]], DDAF funds other non-profit causes throughout the US that share DDAF's mission of helping animals and the people who love them.

To complement the Doris Day Animal Foundation, Day formed the [[Doris Day Animal League]] (DDAL) in 1987, a national non-profit citizen's lobbying organization whose mission is to reduce pain and suffering and protect animals through legislative initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul: Stories about Pets as Teachers, Healers, Heroes, and Friends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIPdhSiMN48C&amp;pg=PA385|accessdate=August 8, 2013|year=1998|publisher=HCI Books|isbn=978-1-55874-571-1|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day actively lobbied the [[United States Congress]] in support of legislation designed to safeguard [[animal welfare]] on a number of occasions and in 1995 she originated the annual [[Spay Day USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Join 'Spay Day USA' campaign|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19950131&amp;id=EUNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3068,7529821|accessdate=January 15, 2016|work=[[Gainesville Sun]]|date=January 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DDAL merged into [[The Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090601770.html|title=Merger Adds to Humane Society's Bite|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 5, 2007|first=Judy|last=Sarasohn|date=September 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HSUS now manages World Spay Day, the annual one-day spay/neuter event that Day originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Spay Day|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/spay_day/|publisher=[[The Humane Society of the United States]]|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
