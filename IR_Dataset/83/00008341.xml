==Early life==
Delroy Lindo was born in 1952 in [[Lewisham]], south east [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaliyah 'Best Video' Acceptance Speech 2002 - MOBO |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35iMCnD-dRc |publisher=Mobo Awards, Channel 4, YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[Jamaica]]n [[British Jamaican|parents]] who had emigrated to [[UK|Britain]]. Lindo became interested in acting as a child during a [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] play. His mother was a [[nurse]] and his father worked in various jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120629210618/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_10_57/ai_97997635 Are these the 5 best actors in America?] from Ebony&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[teenager]], he and his mother moved to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. When he was sixteen, they moved to [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cricket&quot;/&gt; At the age of 24, Lindo started acting studies at the [[American Conservatory Theater]], graduating in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/delroy-lindo/bio/146992 &quot;Delroy Lindo&quot;], TV Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lindo's film debut came in 1976 with the Canadian [[John Candy]] comedy ''[[Find the Lady (1976 film)|Find the Lady]]'', followed by two other roles in films, including an Army [[Sergeant]] in ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' (1979).

He stopped his film career for 10 years to concentrate on theatre acting. In 1982 he debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the Boys]],'' directed by the play's [[South Africa]]n author [[Athol Fugard]]. By 1988 Lindo had earned a [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination for his portrayal of Herald Loomis in [[August Wilson]]'s ''[[Joe Turner's Come and Gone]]''.

Lindo returned to film in the 1990s, acting alongside [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Joan Chen]] in the science fiction film ''[[The Blood of Heroes|Salute of the Jugger]]'' (1990), which has become a cult classic. Although he had turned down [[Spike Lee]] for a role in ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', Lee cast him as Woody Carmichael in the drama ''[[Crooklyn]]'' (1994), which brought him notice. Together with his other roles with Lee - as the West Indian Archie, a psychotic gangster, in ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', and a starring role as a neighbourhood drug dealer in ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'' - he became established in his film career.

Other films in which he has starring roles are [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), Ron Howard's ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' (1996) and ''[[Soul of the Game]]'' (1996), as the baseball player [[Satchel Paige]].

In 1998 Lindo co-starred as African-American explorer [[Matthew Henson]], in the TV film ''Glory &amp; Honor'', directed by [[Kevin Hooks]]. It portrayed his nearly 20-year partnership with Commander [[Robert Peary]] in Arctic exploration and their effort to find the [[Geographic North Pole]] in 1909. He received a Satellite Award as best actor. Lindo continues to work in television and was most recently seen on the short-lived NBC drama ''[[Kidnapped (2006 TV series)|Kidnapped]]''.

Lindo played an angel in the comedy film ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]'' (1997).

He guest-starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode &quot;[[Brawl in the Family (The Simpsons)|Brawl in the Family]]&quot;, playing a similar character named Gabriel.

Lindo had a small role in the 1995 science fiction/action film ''[[Congo (film)|Congo]],'' playing the [[corruption|corrupt]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] Wanta. Lindo was not credited for the role.

In the British film, ''[[Wondrous Oblivion]]'' (2003), directed by [[Paul Morrison (director)|Paul Morrison]], he starred as Dennis Samuels, the father of a Jamaican immigrant family in London in the 1950s; he coaches his children and the son of a neighbour Jewish family in [[cricket]], earning their admiration in a time of strained social relations. Lindo said he made the film in honour of his parents, who had similarly moved to London in those years.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricket&quot;&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/26/1085461828735.html &quot;It's not just cricket&quot;], ''The Age,'' 30 May 2004, accessed 27 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Lindo began an association with [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]] in [[Berkeley, California]], when he directed [[Tanya Barfield]]'s play ''The Blue Door''. In the autumn of 2008, Lindo revisited [[August Wilson]]'s play, ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'', directing a production at the Berkeley Rep. In 2010, he played the role of elderly seer Bynum in [[David Lan]]'s production of ''Joe Turner'' at the [[Young Vic Theatre]] in London.

As of 2015, Lindo is expected to play [[Marcus Garvey]] in a biopic of the black nationalist historical figure that has been [[development hell|in pre-production]] for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Delroy Lindo to Star as Marcus Garvey in Upcoming Biopic|url = https://www.colorlines.com/articles/delroy-lindo-star-marcus-garvey-upcoming-biopic|website = Colorlines|accessdate = 2015-12-21|first = Sameer|last = Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://thesource.com/2016/03/07/marcus-garvey-biopic-set-to-be-released-in-2017/ MARCUS GARVEY BIOPIC SET TO BE RELEASED IN 2017] ''The Source'',  MARCH 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jamaica-star.com/article/entertainment/20151204/popular-us-actor-delroy-lindo-star-marcus-garvey-new-biopic Popular US actor Delroy Lindo to star as Marcus Garvey in a new biopic] The Jamaica '' Star'', December 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
