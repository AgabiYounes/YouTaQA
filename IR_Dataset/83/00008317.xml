'''Duke of Marlborough''' ({{IPAc-en|local|audio=En-uk-Marlborough.ogg|ˈ|m|ɔːr|l|b|ər|ə}} {{respell|MORL|bər|ə}}) is a title in the [[Peerage of England]]. It was created by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1702 for [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill, 1st Earl of Marlborough]] (1650–1722), the noted military leader. In historical texts, it is often to him that an unqualified use of the title refers. The name of the dukedom refers to [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] in [[Wiltshire]]. 

The [[Earl of Marlborough|earldom of Marlborough]] was held by the family of Ley from its creation 1626 until its extinction with the death of the 4th earl in 1679. The title was recreated 10 years later for John Churchill (in 1689).

==History of the dukedom==
Churchill had been made ''Lord Churchill of [[Eyemouth]]'' (1682) in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[peerage]], and ''Baron Churchill'' of [[Sandridge]] (1685) and ''Earl of Marlborough'' (1689) in the [[Peerage of England]]. Shortly after her accession to the throne in 1702, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] made Churchill the first ''Duke of Marlborough'' and granted him the subsidiary title ''Marquess of [[Blandford]]''.

In 1678, Churchill married [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Jennings]] (1660–1744), a courtier and influential favourite of the queen. They had seven children, of whom four daughters married into some of the most important families in [[Great Britain]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He was pre-deceased by his son, [[John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford]], in 1703; so, to prevent the extinction of the titles, a special [[Act of Parliament]] was passed. When the 1st Duke of Marlborough died in 1722 his title as ''Lord Churchill of Eyemouth'' in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[peerage]] became extinct and the Marlborough titles passed, according to the Act, to his eldest daughter [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|Henrietta]] (1681–1733), the 2nd Duchess of Marlborough. She was married to the [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|2nd Earl of Godolphin]] and had a son who predeceased her.{{cn|reason=her own article mentions two sons, both born in 1700 (twins?), for one of whom no death date is given|date=April 2019}}

When Henrietta died in 1733, the Marlborough titles passed to her nephew [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|Charles Spencer]] (1706–1758), the third son of her late sister [[Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland (1683-1716)|Anne]] (1683–1716), who had married the [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|3rd Earl of Sunderland]] in 1699. After his older brother's death in 1729, Charles Spencer had already inherited the [[Spencer family]] estates and the titles of ''[[Earl of Sunderland]]'' (1643) and ''Baron Spencer'' of [[Wormleighton Manor|Wormleighton]] (1603), all in the [[Peerage of England]]. Upon his maternal aunt Henrietta's death in 1733, Charles Spencer succeeded to the Marlborough family estates and titles and became the 3rd Duke. When he died in 1758, his titles passed to his eldest son [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|George]] (1739–1817), who was succeeded by his eldest son George, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|5th Duke]] (1766–1840). In 1815, [[Francis Spencer, 1st Baron Churchill|Francis Spencer]] (the younger son of the [[George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough|4th Duke]]) was created ''[[Baron Churchill of Whichwood|Baron Churchill]]'' in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1902, his grandson, the [[Victor Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill|3rd Baron Churchill]], was created '''[[Baron Churchill (1815 creation)#Viscounts Churchill (1902)|Viscount Churchill]]'''.

In 1817, the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|5th Duke]] obtained permission to assume and bear the [[surname]] of Churchill in addition to his surname of [[Spencer family|Spencer]], to perpetuate the name of his illustrious great-great-grandfather. At the same time he received [[Royal Licence]] to quarter the [[coat of arms]] of Churchill with his paternal arms of Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=17256 |date=3 June 1817 |page=1277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay &quot;&gt;Paul Courtenay, The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/reference/the-armorial-bearings-of-sir-winston-churchill The Armorial Bearings of Sir Winston Churchill] (accessed 20 July 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Dukes thus originally bore the surname &quot;Spencer&quot;: the [[double-barrelled name|double-barrelled surname]] of &quot;Spencer-Churchill&quot; as used since 1817 remains in the family, though some members have preferred to style themselves &quot;Churchill&quot;.

The 7th Duke was the paternal grandfather of the [[British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]], born at [[Blenheim Palace]] on 30 November 1874.

The 11th Duke, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 11th Duke of Marlborough|John Spencer-Churchill]] died in 2014, having assumed the title in 1972. The 12th and present Duke is [[Jamie Spencer-Churchill, 12th Duke of Marlborough|Charles James Spencer-Churchill]].

==Family seat==
[[File:Blenheim Palace IMG 3675.JPG|thumb|Burial place of most Dukes and Duchesses of Marlborough in the chapel at [[Blenheim Palace]].]]
The family seat is [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], [[Oxfordshire]].

After his leadership in the victory against the [[France|French]] in the [[Battle of Blenheim]] on 13 August 1704, the 1st Duke was honoured by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] granting him the royal manor of [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], and building him a house at her expense to be called Blenheim. Construction started in 1705 and the house was completed in 1722, the year of the 1st Duke's death. Blenheim Palace has since remained in the Churchill and Spencer-Churchill family.

With the exception of the [[John Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough|10th Duke]] and his first wife, the Dukes and Duchesses of Marlborough are buried in Blenheim Palace's chapel. Most other members of the Spencer-Churchill family are interred in [[St Martin's Church, Bladon|St. Martin's parish churchyard]] at [[Bladon]], a short distance from the palace.

==Succession to the title==
The dukedom can theoretically pass through a female line. However, unlike the remainder to [[Hereditary peer#Writ of Summons|heirs general]] found in most other peerages that allow [[male-preference primogeniture]], the grant does not allow for [[Abeyance#Peerage law|abeyance]] and follows a more restrictive [[Semi-Salic]] formula designed to keep succession wherever possible in the male line. The succession is as follows:{{cn|reason=Source for this? It's apparently not a literal quote, as it contradicts the wording in [http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/marlborough1702.htm]|date=April 2019}}

Succession to the title under the first and second contingencies have lapsed; holders of the title from the 3rd Duke trace their status from the third contingency.

It is now very unlikely that the dukedom will be passed to a woman or through a woman, since all the male-line descendants of the 1st Duke's second daughter Anne Spencer, Countess of Sunderland&amp;mdash;including the lines of the [[Baron Churchill (1815 creation)#Viscounts Churchill (1902)|Viscounts Churchill and Barons Churchill of Wychwood]] and of the [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]] and of the entire Spencer-Churchill and Spencer family&amp;mdash;would have to become extinct.

If that were to happen, the Churchill titles would pass to the [[Earl of Jersey]] (and merge with the earldom as long as it is extant), the heir-male of the 1st Duke's granddaughter [[Anne Russell, Duchess of Bedford|Anne Villiers (born Egerton), Countess of Jersey]], daughter of Elizabeth Egerton, Duchess of Bridgewater, the third daughter of the first Duke.

The next heir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/montagu1766.htm#MONTAGU_1766_1 |title=Montagu, Duke of (GB, 1766 - 1790) |publisher=Cracroftspeerage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{notinsource||does not mention Marlborough at all|date=April 2019}} would be the [[Duke of Buccleuch]], the heir-male of the 1st Duke's great-granddaughter Elizabeth Montagu, Duchess of Buccleuch, the daughter of Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu (1766 creation), the daughter of the 1st Duke's youngest daughter Mary, Duchess of Montagu (1705 creation).

The fourth surviving line is represented by the [[Earl of Chichester]] and his family, the heir-male of the 1st Duke's most senior great-great-granddaughter Mary Henrietta Osborne, Countess of Chichester, daughter of [[Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds]], only child of Mary Godolphin, Duchess of Leeds, daughter of the 1st Duke's eldest daughter [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough]], by her husband [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/leeds1694.htm#Leeds_1694_5 |title=Leeds, Duke of (E, 1694 - 1964) |publisher=Cracroftspeerage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other titles of the Dukes==

===Subsidiary titles===
The Duke holds subsidiary titles: ''Marquess of [[Blandford]]'' (created in 1702 for John Churchill), ''[[Earl of Sunderland]]'' (created in 1643 for the [[Spencer family]]), ''Earl of Marlborough'' (created in 1689 for John Churchill), ''Baron Spencer'' of [[Wormleighton Manor|Wormleighton]] (created in 1603 for the Spencer family), and ''Baron Churchill'' of [[Sandridge]] (created in 1685 for John Churchill), all in the Peerage of England.

The title ''Marquess of Blandford'' is used as the [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy title]] for the Duke's eldest son and heir. The Duke's eldest son's eldest son can use the courtesy title ''Earl of Sunderland'', and the duke's eldest son's eldest son's eldest son (not necessarily the eldest great-grandson) the title ''Lord Spencer of Wormleighton'' (not to be confused with [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]]).

The title of ''Earl of Marlborough'', created for John Churchill in 1689, had previously been created for [[James Ley, 1st Earl of Marlborough|James Ley]], in 1626, becoming extinct in 1679.

===Foreign titles===
The 1st Duke was honoured with land and titles in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]] created him a [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire|Prince]] in 1704, and in 1705, his successor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph I]] gave him the [[principality of Mindelheim]] (once the lordship of the noted soldier [[Georg von Frundsberg]]). He was obliged to surrender Mindelheim in 1714 by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which returned it to [[Bavaria]]. He tried to obtain [[County of Nellenburg|Nellenburg]] in Austria in exchange, which at that time was only a county ('Landgrafschaft'), but this failed, partially because Austrian law did not allow for Nellenburg to be converted into a sovereign principality.&lt;ref&gt;William Coxe, ''Herzogs Johann von Marlborough Leben und Denkwürdigkeiten'', vol. 6, Vienna 1822, pp. 297–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Duke's princely title of Mindelheim became extinct either on the return of the land to Bavaria or on his death, as the Empire operated Salic Law, which prevented female succession.

==Coats of arms==

===Original arms of the Churchill family===

The original arms of Sir [[Winston Churchill (1620–1688)]], father of the 1st Duke of Marlborough, were simple and in use by his own father in 1619. The shield was Sable a lion rampant Argent, debruised by a bendlet Gules. The addition of a [[St George's cross|canton of Saint George]] (see below) rendered the distinguishing mark of the bendlet unnecessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

The Churchill crest is blazoned as a lion couchant guardant Argent, supporting with its dexter forepaw a banner Gules, charged with a dexter hand appaumée of the first, staff Or.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

In recognition of Sir Winston's services to King Charles I as Captain of the Horse, and his loyalty to King Charles II as a Member of Parliament, he was awarded an [[augmentation of honour]] to his arms around 1662. This rare mark of royal favour took the form of a [[St George's cross|canton of Saint George]]. At the same time, he was authorised to omit the bendlet, which had served the purpose of distinguishing this branch of the Churchill family from others which bore an undifferenced lion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

===Arms of the 1st Duke of Marlborough===

Sir Winston's shield and crest were inherited by his son [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]]. Minor modifications reflected the bearer's social rise: the helm was now shown in profile and had a closed grille to signify the bearer's rank as a peer, and there were now supporters placed on either side of the shield. They were the mythical [[Griffin]] (part lion, part eagle) and [[Wyvern]] (a dragon without hind legs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt; The supporters were derived from the arms of the family of the 1st Duke's mother, Drake of [[Ash, Musbury|Ash]] (Argent, a wyvern gules; these arms can be seen on the monument in Musbury Church to Sir [[Bernard Drake]], d.1586).

The motto was ''Fiel pero desdichado'' (Spanish for &quot;Faithful but unfortunate&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson, Thomas 1830, p 401&quot;&gt;Robson, Thomas, ''The British Herald, or Cabinet of Armorial Bearings of the Nobility &amp; Gentry of Great Britain &amp; Ireland'', Volume I, Turner &amp; Marwood, Sunderland, 1830, p. 401 (CHU-CLA).&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st Duke was also entitled to a [[coronet]] indicating his rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

When the 1st Duke was made a [[Prince of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1705, two unusual features were added: the Imperial Eagle and a Princely Coronet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt; His estates in Germany, such as [[Mindelheim]], were represented in his arms by additional quarterings.

===Arms of the Spencer-Churchill family===

In 1817, the 5th Duke received Royal Licence to place the quarter of Churchill ahead of his paternal arms of Spencer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt; The shield of the [[Spencer family]] arms is: quarterly Argent and Gules, in the second and third quarters a fret Or, over all on a bend Sable three escallops of the first. The Spencer crest is: out of a ducal coronet Or, a griffin's head between two wings expanded Argent, gorged with a collar gemel and armed Gules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt; Paul Courtenay observes that &quot;It would be normal in these circumstances for the paternal arms (Spencer) to take precedence over the maternal (Churchill), but because the Marlborough dukedom was senior to the Sunderland earldom, the procedure was reversed in this case.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

Also in 1817, a further [[augmentation of honour]] was added to his armorial achievement. This incorporated the bearings from the standard of the Manor of Woodstock and was borne on an escutcheon, displayed over all in the centre chief point, as follows: Argent a cross of [[St George's cross|Saint George]] surmounted by an [[inescutcheon]] Azure, charged with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, two over one. This inescutcheon represents the royal arms of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

These quartered arms, incorporating the two augmentations of honour, have been the arms of all subsequent Dukes of Marlborough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtenay&quot;/&gt;

===Motto===
The [[motto]] ''Fiel pero desdichado'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Faithful though Joyless&quot;. &quot;Desdichado&quot; means without happiness or without joy, alluding to the first Duke's father, [[Winston Churchill (1620–1688)|Winston]], who was a royalist and faithful supporter of the king during the [[English Civil War]] but was not compensated for his losses after the restoration. Charles II [[knight]]ed Winston Churchill and other Civil War royalists but did not compensate them for their wartime losses, thereby inducing Winston to adopt the motto. It is unusual for the motto of an Englishman of the era to be in Spanish rather than [[Latin]], and it is not known why this is the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/fielpero.html |title=Churchill's Motto |publisher=Churchill Society of London |accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
