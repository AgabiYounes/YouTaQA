'''Dinosaurs''' are&lt;!-- Please use &quot;are&quot;, as the scientific consensus is that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs. --&gt; a diverse group of [[reptile]]s{{refn|group=note|name=cold-blooded|Although dinosaurs are reptiles, views on them as being [[Thermoregulation|cold-blooded]] animals have changed in recent years; see [[#Physiology|physiology]] for more details.}} of the [[clade]] '''Dinosauria'''. They first appeared during the [[Triassic]] [[Geological period|period]], between 243 and 233.23&amp;nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]], although the exact origin and timing of the [[evolution of dinosaurs]] is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s after the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] 201.3&amp;nbsp;million years ago; their dominance continued through the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The [[fossil]] record demonstrates that [[bird]]s are modern [[feathered dinosaur]]s, having [[Evolution of birds|evolved]] from earlier [[Theropoda|theropods]] during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] approximately 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into '''avian dinosaurs''', or birds; and '''non-avian dinosaurs''', which are all dinosaurs other than birds.

Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ecology|ecological]] standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living [[species]], are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides [[perciformes|perciform]] fish. Using fossil evidence, [[paleontology|paleontologists]] have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]] and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[Neontology#Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa|extant]] species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], others [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were [[Oviparity|egg-laying]]; and that [[nest]]-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.

While dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many [[extinction|extinct]] groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed [[skeleton|skeletal]] modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|39.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and heights of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and were the largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy [[bone]]s are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: ''[[Xixianykus]]'', for example, was only about {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.

Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.

==Etymology==
The [[taxon]] 'Dinosauria' was formally named in 1842 by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Richard Owen|Sir Richard Owen]], who used it to refer to the &quot;distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles&quot; that were then being recognized in [[England]] and around the world.&lt;ref name=Owen1841/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|Dinosauria|accessdate=2019-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived {{ety|grc|''[[wikt:δεινός|δεινός]]'' (deinos)|terrible, potent or fearfully great||''[[wikt:σαῦρος|σαῦρος]]'' (sauros)|lizard or reptile}}.&lt;ref name=Owen1841/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ/&gt; Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.&lt;ref name=FBS97/&gt;

Other prehistoric animals, including [[pterosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]], and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |url-status=live |title=Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs And Other Saurs – Big Differences |last=Chamary |first=JV |date=September 30, 2014 |website=[[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]] |publisher=Forbes Media, LLC |location=[[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City, NJ]] |issn=0015-6914 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110172257/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |archive-date=2014-11-10 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade [[Avemetatarsalia|Ornithodira]]. The other groups mentioned are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of [[Sauropsida]] (the reptile and bird clade), except ''Dimetrodon'' (which is a [[synapsid]]).

==Definition==
[[File:LA-Triceratops mount-2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Triceratops]]'' skeleton, [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]]]]
Under [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and [[Bird#Diversification of modern birds|modern birds]] (Neornithes), and all its descendants.&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt; It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.&lt;ref name=olshevsky2000/&gt; Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs: &quot;Dinosauria = [[Ornithischia]] + [[Saurischia]]&quot;, encompassing [[ankylosauria]]ns (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), [[stegosauria]]ns (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), [[ceratopsia]]ns (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]]s (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including &quot;[[Hadrosauridae|duck-bills]]&quot;), theropods (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).&lt;ref name=&quot;Letal05&quot;/&gt;

Birds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |url-status=live |title=Using the tree for classification |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831003846/https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |archive-date=2019-08-31 |access-date=2019-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;

Research by Matthew G. Baron, [[David B. Norman]], and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron ''et al.'' recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the [[Theropoda]] than the [[Sauropodomorpha]], as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade [[Ornithoscelida]] to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of ''[[Triceratops|Triceratops horridus]]'', ''[[house sparrow|Passer domesticus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]'', and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20170322&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |author-link=Nicholas Wade |title=Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree |date=March 22, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |url-status=live |url-access=registration |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407234942/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |archive-date=2018-04-07 |access-date=2019-10-30}} &quot;A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2017, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NAT-20170322&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baron |first1=Matthew G. |last2=Norman |first2=David B. |author-link2=David B.

===General description===
[[File:Neognathae.jpg|thumb|alt=montage of four birds|In [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[bird]]s are included in the group Dinosauria.]]
Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs can be generally described as [[archosaur]]s with [[Terrestrial locomotion#Posture|hind limbs held erect beneath the body]].&lt;ref name=DFG97/&gt; Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and [[pelycosaur]]s (especially ''Dimetrodon''), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=DL90/&gt; Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the [[Mesozoic]] [[Era]], especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; [[mammal]]s, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.&lt;ref name=MM97/&gt;

Dinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500 non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang&amp;Dodson&quot;/&gt; An earlier study predicted that about 3,400 dinosaur genera existed, including many that would not have been preserved in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=russell1995/&gt; By September 17, 2008, 1,047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.&lt;ref name=AmosBBC/&gt;

In 2016, the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the Mesozoic was estimated to be 1,543–2,468.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Starrfelt |first1=Jostein |last2=Liow |first2=Lee Hsiang |date=April 5, 2016 |title=How many dinosaur species were there?

While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as ''[[Anchisaurus]]'' and ''Iguanodon'', could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the [[Early Jurassic]] epoch.&lt;ref name=MacLeod/&gt; Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as ''[[Microraptor]]'') could fly or at least glide, and others, such as [[spinosauridae|spinosaurids]], had [[list of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]] habits.&lt;ref name=theropods/&gt;

===Distinguishing anatomical features===
While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral [[archosaur]]ian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the [[Synapomorphy and apomorphy|synapomorphies]] of such a group.&lt;ref name=&quot;B012&quot;/&gt;

A detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by [[Sterling Nesbitt]]&lt;ref name=nesbitt2011/&gt; confirmed or found the following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies, some previously known:
* in the [[skull]], a supratemporal fossa (excavation) is present in front of the [[Skull#Structure|supratemporal fenestra]], the main opening in the rear skull roof
* [[epipophyses]], obliquely backward pointing processes on the rear top corners, present in the anterior (front) neck [[vertebra]]e behind the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] and [[Axis (anatomy)|axis]], the first two neck vertebrae
* apex of deltopectoral crest (a projection on which the [[clavipectoral triangle|deltopectoral]] muscles attach) located at or more than 30% down the length of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone)
* [[Radius (bone)|radius]], a lower arm bone, shorter than 80% of humerus length
* [[fourth trochanter]] (projection where the [[caudofemoralis]] muscle attaches on the inner rear shaft) on the [[femur]] (thigh bone) is a sharp flange
* fourth trochanter asymmetrical, with distal, lower, margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft
* on the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]], upper ankle bones, the proximal articular facet, the top connecting surface, for the [[fibula]] occupies less than 30% of the transverse width of the element
* exoccipitals (bones at the back of the skull) do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity, the inner space of the braincase
* in the pelvis, the proximal articular surfaces of the [[ischium]] with the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] and the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] are separated by a large concave surface (on the upper side of the ischium a part of the open hip joint is located between the contacts with the pubic bone and the ilium)
* [[cnemial crest]] on the [[tibia]] (protruding part of the top surface of the shinbone) arcs anterolaterally (curves to the front and the outer side)
* distinct proximodistally oriented (vertical) ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia (the rear surface of the lower end of the shinbone)
* concave articular surface for the fibula of the calcaneum (the top surface of the calcaneum, where it touches the fibula, has a hollow profile)

Nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies, and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt;
[[File:Skull diapsida 1.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a typical [[diapsid]] skull&lt;br /&gt;j: [[jugal bone]], po: [[postorbital bone]], p: [[parietal bone]], sq: [[squamosal bone]], q: [[quadrate bone]], qj: [[quadratojugal bone]]]]
A variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[Infratemporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group [[Archosaur]]ia, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.&lt;ref name=TRHJ00/&gt; Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated [[scapula]], or shoulder blade; a [[sacrum]] composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'');&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt; and a [[Acetabulum#Perforate Acetabulum|perforate acetabulum]], or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in ''[[Saturnalia tupiniquim]]'', for example).&lt;ref name=&quot;UC Berkeley Journal of Earth Sciences&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/dinomm.html |last1=Smith |first1=Dave |display-authors=et al. |title=Dinosauria: Morphology |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley |access-date=2019-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LARB99/&gt; Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the [[Late Triassic]] epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.&lt;ref name=NIP07/&gt;
[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|Hip joints and hindlimb postures of: (left to right) typical [[reptile]]s (sprawling), dinosaurs and [[mammal]]s (erect), and [[rauisuchia]]ns (pillar-erect)]]
Dinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to [[Evolution of mammals#Erect limbs|most modern mammals]], but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side.&lt;ref name=Holland1909/&gt; This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur.&lt;ref name=MJB00/&gt; Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that [[Carrier's constraint|surpassed those of &quot;sprawling&quot; reptiles]].&lt;ref name=RC05/&gt; Erect limbs probably also helped support the [[evolution]] of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs.&lt;ref name=TKMB07/&gt; Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including [[rauisuchia]]ns, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a &quot;pillar-erect&quot; configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the [[ilium (bone)|upper pelvic bone]] was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.&lt;ref name=TKMB07/&gt;

===Origins and early evolution===
Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during the Middle to Late Triassic epochs, roughly 20&amp;nbsp;million years after the devastating [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species approximately 252 million years ago.&lt;ref name=KPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=TannerLucas/&gt; [[Radiometric dating]] of the [[List of rock formations|rock formation]] that contained fossils from the early dinosaur [[genus]] ''[[Eoraptor]]'' at 231.4&amp;nbsp;million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;OARM2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcober |first1=Oscar A.|last2=Martinez |first2=Ricardo N. |date=October 19, 2010 |title=A new herrerasaurid (Dinosauria, Saurischia) from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina |journal=[[ZooKeys]] |location=[[Sofia]] |publisher=[[Pensoft Publishers]] |issue=63 |pages=55–81 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.63.550 |pmc=3088398 |issn=1313-2989 |pmid=21594020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleontologists think that ''Eoraptor'' resembles the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of all dinosaurs;&lt;ref name=Sereno1999/&gt; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal [[predation|predators]].&lt;ref name=SFRM93/&gt; The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as ''[[Marasuchus]]'' and ''[[Lagerpeton]]'' in [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[Middle Triassic]] strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243&amp;nbsp;million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus ''[[Nyasasaurus]]'' from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.&lt;ref name=nyasasaurus&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nesbitt |first1=Sterling J. |last2=Barrett |first2=Paul M. |last3=Werning |first3=Sarah |last4=Sidor |first4=Christian A. |author-link4=Christian Sidor |last5=Charig |first5=Alan J. |author-link5=Alan J.

When dinosaurs appeared, they were not the dominant terrestrial animals.

===Evolution and paleobiogeography===
Dinosaur evolution after the Triassic follows changes in vegetation and the location of continents. In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass [[Pangaea]], and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoid]] carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; [[Gymnosperm]] plants (particularly [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s), a potential food source, [[Evolutionary radiation|radiated]] in the Late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[Megalosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian [[ornithischia]]ns and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]] and [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] of [[Tanzania]]. Dinosaurs in [[China]] show some differences, with specialized [[Metriacanthosauridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but [[Plateosauridae|prosauropods]] had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;
[[File:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Marasuchus|Marasuchus lilloensis]]'', a dinosaur-like [[Avemetatarsalia|ornithodiran]]]]
By the [[Early Cretaceous]] and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through [[Europe]], North America, and northern [[Africa]]. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in [[South America]]. In [[Asia]], maniraptoran coelurosaurians like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early ceratopsians like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, [[Australia]] was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early [[Late Cretaceous]]. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur tooth#Dental batteries|dental batteries]], taken to its extreme in [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]].&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=serenoetal07/&gt;
[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|The early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large), ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small) and a ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' skull]]
There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, [[rhabdodontidae|rhabdodontid]] iguanodontians, [[nodosauridae|nodosaurid]] ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; Flowering plants were greatly radiating,&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=PSAS05/&gt; Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or [[omnivore]]s, with [[Therizinosauria|therizinosaur]]ians and [[ornithomimosauria]]ns becoming common.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt;

The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous, caused the extinction of all dinosaur groups except for the [[Bird#Diversification of modern birds|neornithine]] birds. Some other diapsid groups, such as [[crocodilia]]ns, [[sebecosuchia]]ns, turtles, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[Rhynchocephalia|sphenodontia]]ns, and [[choristodera]]ns, also survived the event.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;

The surviving lineages of neornithine birds, including the ancestors of modern [[ratite]]s, [[Fowl|ducks and chickens]], and a variety of [[Charadriiformes|waterbirds]], diversified rapidly at the beginning of the [[Paleogene]] period, entering [[ecological niche]]s left vacant by the extinction of Mesozoic dinosaur groups such as the arboreal [[enantiornithine]]s, aquatic [[hesperornithine]]s, and even the larger terrestrial theropods (in the form of ''[[Gastornis]]'', [[Eogruidae|eogruiids]], [[bathornithids]], ratites, [[Geranoididae|geranoidids]], [[mihirung]]s, and &quot;[[terror bird]]s&quot;). It is often cited that mammals out-competed the neornithines for dominance of most terrestrial niches but many of these groups co-existed with rich mammalian faunas for most of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.&lt;ref name=lindow&gt;{{harvnb|Dyke|Kaiser|2011|loc=chpt. 14: &quot;Bird Evolution Across the K–Pg Boundary and the Basal Neornithine Diversification&quot; by Bent E.

==Classification==
{{Main|Dinosaur classification}}

Dinosaurs belong to a group known as archosaurs, which also includes modern crocodilians. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side.&lt;ref name=&quot;B012&quot;/&gt;

Collectively, dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches, Saurischia and Ornithischia. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all [[taxon|taxa]] sharing a more recent common ancestor with ''Triceratops'' than with Saurischia. Anatomically, these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their [[pelvis|pelvic]] structure. Early saurischians—&quot;lizard-hipped&quot;, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''sauros'' (σαῦρος) meaning &quot;lizard&quot; and ''ischion'' (ἰσχίον) meaning &quot;hip joint&quot;—retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a pubis bone directed [[anatomical terms of location|cranially]], or forward.&lt;ref name=MJB00/&gt; This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups (''[[Herrerasaurus]]'',&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; [[Therizinosauria|therizinosauroids]],&lt;ref name=clarketal2004/&gt; dromaeosaurids,&lt;ref name=MAPM04/&gt; and birds&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;). Saurischia includes the theropods (exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked herbivores which include advanced, quadrupedal groups).&lt;ref name=theropods/&gt;&lt;ref name=sauropodomorphs&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Michael P. |author-link1=Michael P.

By contrast, ornithischians—&quot;bird-hipped&quot;, from the Greek ''ornitheios'' (ὀρνίθειος) meaning &quot;of a bird&quot; and ''ischion'' (ἰσχίον) meaning &quot;hip joint&quot;—had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the pubic bone was oriented [[anatomical terms of location|caudally]] (rear-pointing). Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of species which were primarily herbivores. ('''NB:''' the terms &quot;lizard hip&quot; and &quot;bird hip&quot; are misnomers&amp;nbsp;– birds evolved from dinosaurs with &quot;lizard hips&quot;.)&lt;ref name=&quot;B012&quot;/&gt;

Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, Early Jurassic, Late Jurassic and Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=Sereno1999/&gt; Predatory theropod dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the Mesozoic, most often fall into the {{convert|100|to|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on|comma=gaps}} category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on [[order of magnitude]], whereas [[Holocene|recent]] predatory carnivoran mammals peak in the {{convert|10|to|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} category.&lt;ref name=JF93/&gt; The [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] of Mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between {{convert|1|to|10|t|ST}}.&lt;ref name=Peczkis1994/&gt; This contrasts sharply with the average size of Cenozoic mammals, estimated by the [[National Museum of Natural History]] as about {{convert|2|to|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NMNH/&gt;

The sauropods were the largest and heaviest dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an [[order of magnitude]] more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as ''[[Paraceratherium]]'' (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sander |first1=P.

Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.&lt;ref name=KC06/&gt;

Scientists will probably never be certain of the [[largest organisms|largest and smallest dinosaurs]] to have ever existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals were ever fossilized and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paul|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest herbivorous specimens on record were discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive ''Argentinosaurus'', which may have weighed {{gaps|80|000}} to {{gaps|100|000}}&amp;nbsp;kilograms (90 to 110&amp;nbsp;short tons) and reached length of {{convert|30|-|40|m|ft}}; some of the longest were the {{convert|33.5|m|ft|sp=us}} long ''Diplodocus hallorum''&lt;ref name=KC06/&gt; (formerly ''Seismosaurus''), the {{convert|33|-|34|m|ft|sp=us}} long ''[[Supersaurus]]''&lt;ref name=LHW07/&gt; and {{convert|37|m|feet}} long ''[[Patagotitan]]''; and the tallest, the {{convert|18|m|ft|sp=us}} tall ''[[Sauroposeidon]]'', which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The heaviest and longest dinosaur may have been ''[[Maraapunisaurus]]'', known only from a now lost partial vertebral [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arch]] described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been {{convert|58|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighed {{gaps|122|400}} kg ({{gaps|270|000}} lb).&lt;ref name=KC06/&gt; However, as no further evidence of sauropods of this size has been found, and the discoverer, [[Edward Drinker Cope]], had made typographic errors before, it is likely to have been an extreme overestimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodruff |first1=D.

===Behavior===
[[File:Maiasaurusnest.jpg|thumb|A nesting ground of hadrosaur ''[[Maiasaura|Maiasaura peeblesorum]]'' was discovered in 1978.]]

Many modern birds are highly social, often found living in flocks. There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in [[crocodile]]s (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.&lt;ref name=alexander2006/&gt;

The first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&amp;nbsp;''[[Iguanodon|Iguanodon bernissartensis]]'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.&lt;ref name=Yans/&gt; Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,&lt;ref name=Day2002/&gt; although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.&lt;ref name=JLW05/&gt; Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.&lt;ref name=DVetal08sino/&gt; The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.&lt;ref name=LG93/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maxwell&amp;ostrom1995&quot;/&gt; However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.&lt;ref name=RB07/&gt;

[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in intra-specific combat]]
The crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, theropods and [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.&lt;ref name=PC98/&gt;

From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',&lt;ref name=AMNH/&gt; providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.&lt;ref name=carpenter1998/&gt; Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.&lt;ref name=carpenter1998/&gt; [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in [[Madagascar]] in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=rogersetal2003/&gt;

Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].&lt;ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/&gt;

Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.&lt;ref name=VMK07/&gt; Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the [[enantiornithine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chiappe|Witmer|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''Microraptor''&lt;ref name=chatterjee2007/&gt;) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,&lt;ref name=alexander2006/&gt; whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,&lt;ref name=goriely/&gt; and whether sauropods could float.&lt;ref name=Henderson2006/&gt;

===Communication===
[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]'']]
Modern birds are known to [[Animal communication|communicate]] using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt; Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li2010&quot;/&gt; The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the [[larynx]] and the latter through the unique [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt;

The earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the duck-like ''[[Vegavis|Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clarke2016&quot;/&gt; A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tobias2016&quot;/&gt; The crests of the [[Lambeosaurini]] and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in [[vocal resonance]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Weishampel981&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witmer&quot;/&gt; though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt;

All dinosaurs laid [[Amniote|amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Currie|Padian|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopediaOfDinosaurs/page/n235 206]|loc=&quot;Eggs, Eggshells, and Nests&quot; by Konstantin E. Mikhailov.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaur eggs were usually laid in a nest. Most species create somewhat elaborate nests which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansell&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hansell|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting [[Common murre|common guillemot]] lays its eggs on bare rock, and male [[emperor penguin]]s keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional [[oviduct]] and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying [[Broodiness#Broodiness in non-avian animals|brooding]] until all eggs were laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Varrichioetal.02&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varricchio |first1=David J. |last2=Horner |first2=John R. |last3=Jackson |first3=Frankie D. |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |location=Milton Park, Oxfordshire |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564–576 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in [[calcium]], is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''Allosaurus'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=LW08/&gt;

Another widespread trait among modern birds (but see below in regards to fossil groups and extant [[megapodes]]) is parental care for young after hatching. [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner's]] 1978 discovery of a ''[[Maiasaura]]'' (&quot;good mother lizard&quot;) nesting ground in [[Montana]] demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods.&lt;ref name=HM79/&gt; A specimen of the [[Mongolia]]n [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati|Citipati osmolskae]]'' was discovered in a [[Chicken#Broodiness|chicken-like brooding position]] in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;search.eb&quot;/&gt; which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Currie|Koppelhus|Shugar|Wright|2004|pp=[http://thomas-hopp.com/pdf/DinoBrooding.pdf 234–250]|loc=chpt. 11: &quot;Dinosaur Brooding Behavior and the Origin of Flight Feathers&quot; by Thomas P. Hopp and Mark J.

However, there is ample evidence of [[precociality]] or [[Precociality#Superprecociality|superprecociality]] among many dinosaur species, particularly theropods. For instance, non-[[Euornithes|ornithuromorph]] birds have been abundantly demonstrated to have had slow growth rates, [[megapode]]-like egg burying behavior and the ability to fly soon after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Zhonghe |last1=Zhou |first2=Fucheng |last2=Zhang |date=October 22, 2004 |title=A Precocial Avian Embryo from the Lower Cretaceous of China |journal=Science |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |volume=306 |issue=5696 |page=653 |doi=10.1126/science.1100000 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=15499011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/drowned-cretaceous-bird-colony/ |url-status=live |title=A drowned nesting colony of Late Cretaceous birds |last=Naish |first=Darren |author-link=Darren Naish |date=May 15, 2012 |department=Tetrapod Zoology |website=[[Scientific American#Website|Scientific American]] |publisher=[[Springer Nature]] |location=Stuttgart |type=blog |issn=0036-8733 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925031243/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/drowned-cretaceous-bird-colony/ |archive-date=2018-09-25 |access-date=2019-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernández |first1=Mariela S. |last2=García |first2=Rodolfo A. |last3=Fiorelli |first3=Lucas |last4=Scolaro |first4=Alejandro |last5=Salvador |first5=Rodrigo B. |last6=Cotaro |first6=Carlos N. |last7=Kaiser |first7=Gary W. |last8=Dyke |first8=Gareth J. |author8-link=Gareth J.

{{Main|Physiology of dinosaurs}}
Because both modern crocodilians and birds have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), it is likely that this is a trait shared by all archosaurs, including all dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=CH04/&gt; While all modern birds have high metabolisms and are &quot;warm-blooded&quot; ([[Warm-blooded|endotherm]]ic), a vigorous debate has been ongoing since the 1960s regarding how far back in the dinosaur lineage this trait extends. Scientists disagree as to whether non-avian dinosaurs were endothermic, [[ectotherm]]ic, or some combination of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pontzer |first1=Herman |last2=Allen |first2=Vivian |last3=Hutchinson |first3=John R. |date=November 11, 2009 |editor-last=Farke |editor-first=Andrew Allen |title=Biomechanics of running indicates endothermy in bipedal dinosaurs |journal=PLOS ONE |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=PLOS |volume=4 |issue=11 |page=e7783 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007783 |pmc=2772121 |pmid=19911059 |bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.7783P |issn=1932-6203}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After non-avian dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic. This supposed &quot;cold-bloodedness&quot; was used to imply that the ancient dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, even though many modern reptiles are fast and light-footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic remained a prevalent view until [[Robert T. Bakker|Robert T. &quot;Bob&quot; Bakker]], an early proponent of dinosaur [[endothermy]], published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/metabolism.html |last1=Smith |first1=Dave |display-authors=et al. |title=Hot-Blooded or Cold-Blooded?? |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |location=Berkeley |access-date=2019-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |author-link=Robert T.

Modern evidence indicates that some non-avian dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates and that some early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (aided by the animals' bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species). Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of [[South Polar region of the Cretaceous#Dinosaurs|polar dinosaurs in Australia]] and [[Antarctica#Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)|Antarctica]] as well as analysis of blood-vessel structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms.

In saurischian dinosaurs, higher metabolisms were supported by the evolution of the avian respiratory system, characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton, making them hollow.&lt;ref name=Sereno2008/&gt; Early avian-style respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than those of mammals of similar size and build. In addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen, the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism, which is essential for animals that are active but too large to get rid of all the excess heat through their skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Farlow|Brett-Surman|1997|pp=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780253333490/page/449 449–473]|loc=chpt. 32: &quot;Dinosaurian Physiology: The Case for 'Intermediate' Dinosaurs&quot; by R.E.H.

==Origin of birds==
{{Main|Origin of birds}}

The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name=huxley1868/&gt; After the work of [[Gerhard Heilmann]] in the early 20th century, the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of the idea of their being descendants of generalized [[Thecodontia|thecodonts]], with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of [[clavicle]]s in dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=heilmann/&gt; However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused [[furcula|wishbone]], which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent;&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt; they had been found as early as 1924 in ''[[Oviraptor]]'', but misidentified as an [[interclavicle]].&lt;ref name=HO24/&gt; In the 1970s, [[John Ostrom]] revived the dinosaur–bird theory,&lt;ref name=ostrom1973/&gt; which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]],&lt;ref name=gauthier1986/&gt; and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds.&lt;ref name=TRHJ00/&gt; Of particular note have been the fossils of the [[Yixian Formation]], where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20161208&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt; Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.&lt;ref name=Mayretal2005/&gt; They are most closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt; A minority of scientists, most notably [[Alan Feduccia]] and [[Larry Martin]], have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal,&lt;ref name=martin2004/&gt; or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=AF02/&gt;

[[Feather]]s are one of the most recognizable characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups.

''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was the first fossil found that revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a [[transitional fossil]], in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.&lt;ref name=PW88/&gt; Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the [[Lagerstätten|lagerstätte]] of the Yixian Formation, [[Liaoning]], northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweitzeretal1999&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Watt |first2=J.A. |last3=Avci |first3=R. |last4=Knapp |first4=L. |last5=Chiappe |first5=L. |last6=Norell |first6=M. |last7=Marshall |first7=M. |display-authors=3 |date=August 15, 1999 |title=Beta-keratin specific immunological reactivity in feather-like structures of the Cretaceous Alvarezsaurid, ''Shuvuuia deserti'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology|Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=285 |issue=2 |pages=146–157 |pmid=10440726 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19990815)285:2&lt;146::AID-JEZ7&gt;3.0.CO;2-A |issn=1552-5007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin,&lt;ref name=TLS03/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLH05/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSFX07/&gt; and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=AF02/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLH05/&gt; However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.&lt;ref name=Prum2003/&gt;

In 2016, it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in [[amber]].

===Skeleton===
Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the [[transitional fossil|missing link]] between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, pubis, [[wrist]] (semi-lunate [[carpal]]), arm and [[Shoulder girdle|pectoral girdle]], furcula (wishbone), and [[Keel (bird anatomy)|breast bone]]. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens the case for the link.&lt;ref name=archaeopteryxucmp&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/birds/archaeopteryx.html |last=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=''Archaeopteryx'': An Early Bird |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |location=Berkeley |access-date=2019-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to a 2005 investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had bird-like feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons, as is the case in birds. &quot;What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds&quot;, O'Connor said.&lt;ref name=OConnorClaessens2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Andrea |date=July 13, 2005 |title=Study: Predatory Dinosaurs had Bird-Like Pulmonary System |url=https://www.ohio.edu/research/communications/dinosaur_study.cfm |work=Research Communications |location=[[Athens, Ohio|Athens, OH]] |publisher=[[Ohio University]] |access-date=2019-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, scientists described ''[[Aerosteon|Aerosteon riocoloradensis]]'', the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system.

===Behavioral evidence===
Fossils of the [[Troodontidae|troodonts]] ''[[Mei long|Mei]]'' and ''[[Sinornithoides]]'' demonstrate that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms.&lt;ref name=XUNorell2004/&gt; This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.

Some dinosaurs are known to have used [[gizzard]] stones like modern birds. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.&lt;ref name=wings2007/&gt;

==Extinction of major groups==
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}

The discovery that birds are a type of dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated.&lt;ref name=Dingus1998&gt;{{harvnb|Dingus|Rowe|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all non-avian dinosaurs, estimated to have been 628-1078 species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Loeuff |first=Jean |date=December 2012 |title=Paleobiogeography and biodiversity of Late Maastrichtian dinosaurs: how many dinosaur species went extinct at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary? |journal=[[Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France]] |location=[[Les Ulis]] |publisher=[[EDP Sciences]] |volume=183 |issue=6 |pages=547–559 |doi=10.2113/gssgfbull.183.6.547 |issn=0037-9409}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, [[squamata]] and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the [[Extinction event|mass extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Longrich |first1=Nicholas R. |last2=Bhullar |first2=Bhart-Anjan S. |last3=Gauthier |first3=Jacques A. |date=December 26, 2012 |title=Mass extinction of lizards and snakes at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary |journal=Proc.

This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an [[impact event]] was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.&lt;ref name=ktextinction&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keller |first1=Gerta |author1-link=Gerta Keller |last2=Adatte |first2=Thierry |last3=Gardin |first3=Silvia |last4=Bartolini |first4=A. |last5=Bajpai |first5=S. |display-authors=3 |date=April 30, 2008 |title=Main Deccan volcanism phase ends near the K–T boundary: Evidence from the Krishna–Godavari Basin, SE India |journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |volume=268 |issue=3–4 |pages=293–311 |bibcode=2008E&amp;PSL.268..293K |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.015 |issn=0012-821X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=multimpacts&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Mullen |first=Leslie |date=October 20, 2004 |title=Multiple Impacts? |url=https://www.astrobio.net/meteoritescomets-and-asteroids/multiple-impacts/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[NASA]] |issn=2152-1239 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705201308/https://www.astrobio.net/meteoritescomets-and-asteroids/multiple-impacts/ |archive-date=2017-07-05 |access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLeod/&gt;

===Impact event===
{{Main|Chicxulub crater}}
[[File:Chicxulub radar topography.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicxulub Crater]] at the tip of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur [[extinction]].]]
The [[Alvarez hypothesis|asteroid impact hypothesis]], which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by [[Walter Alvarez]] and colleagues, links the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous to a [[bolide]] impact approximately 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Randall|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarez ''et al.'' proposed that a sudden increase in [[iridium]] levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact.&lt;ref name=Alvarezetal80/&gt; The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide {{convert|5|to|15|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide hit in the vicinity of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] (in southeastern [[Mexico]]), creating the approximately {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Chicxulub crater]] and triggering the mass extinction.&lt;ref name=ARHetal91/&gt;&lt;ref name=KPetal96/&gt; Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. The consensus among scientists who support this [[hypothesis]] is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=Douglas S. |last2=McKenna |first2=Malcolm C. |author2-link=Malcolm McKenna |last3=Toon |first3=Owen B. |author3-link=Owen Toon |last4=Hope |first4=Sylvia |last5=Lillegraven |first5=Jason A. |display-authors=3 |date=May–June 2004 |title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=[[Geological Society of America Bulletin]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Geological Society of America |volume=116 |issue=5–6 |pages=760–768 |bibcode=2004GSAB..116..760R |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |issn=0016-7606 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918141759/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-18 |access-date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, scientists drilling into the seafloor off Mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a city-sized asteroid smashed into the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |date=September 15, 2019 |title=Details Discovered About the Day the Dinosaurs Died |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |url-status=live |department=News |work=[[MSN|MSN.com]] |location=[[Redmond, Washington|Redmond, WA]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918064400/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |archive-date=2019-09-18 |access-date=2019-11-08}}

===Deccan Traps===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] --&gt;
{{Main|Deccan Traps}}

Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&amp;nbsp;million years ago and lasted for over 2&amp;nbsp;million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1&amp;nbsp;million years about 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.&lt;ref name=wwnjsd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

The Deccan Traps in [[India]] could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the Deccan Traps &quot;contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of [{{convert|8|C-change|F-change}}] in the last half million years before the impact [at Chicxulub].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=What Really Killed the Dinosaurs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dino_trans.shtml |access-date=2019-11-11 |series=[[Horizon (British TV series)|Horizon]] |last=Fortune |first=Jack (narrator) |network=[[BBC Television]] |date=October 7, 2004 |series-no=41 |number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wwnjsd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

In the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by [[Signor–Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.&lt;ref name=Alvarez1997/&gt;

===Possible Paleocene survivors===
{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}
Non-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]]. In 2000, paleontologist [[Spencer G. Lucas]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] right femur in the [[San Juan Basin]], [[New Mexico]], and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name=Fassett/&gt; Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to {{convert|1.3|m|in|abbr=on}} above the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, representing {{gaps|40|000}}&amp;nbsp;years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.&lt;ref name=Sloan/&gt; Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.&lt;ref name=FS05/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt; Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with [[uranium–lead dating]] methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 ± 0.9&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name=fassettetall2011/&gt; If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.&lt;ref name=FS05/&gt;

==History of study==
{{Further|History of paleontology}}
Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] bones and documented them as such. For example, ''[[Chronicles of Huayang|Huayang Guo Zhi]]''&amp;nbsp;({{zh|t=華陽國志|labels=no}}), a [[gazetteer]] compiled by [[Chang Qu]]&amp;nbsp;({{zh|t=常璩|labels=no}}) during the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)|Western Jin Dynasty]] (265–316), reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in [[Sichuan]] Province.&lt;ref name=dong1992/&gt; Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized &quot;dragon bones&quot; for use in [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional medicines]], a practice that continues as of 2020.&lt;ref name=BBCdinobonemed/&gt; In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of [[giant]]s and other [[Bible|biblical]] creatures.&lt;ref name=benton2000&gt;{{harvnb|Paul|2000|pp=10–44|loc=chpt. 1: &quot;A Brief History of Dinosaur Paleontology&quot; by Michael J. Benton.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in England. Part of a bone, now known to have been the femur of a ''Megalosaurus'',&lt;ref name=WAS97/&gt; was recovered from a limestone quarry at [[Cornwell, Oxfordshire|Cornwell]] near [[Chipping Norton]], Oxfordshire, in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''The Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (1677).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plot|1677}}&lt;/ref&gt; He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the femur of a huge  human, perhaps a [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] or another type of giant featured in legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plot|1677|p=[https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryo00plot/page/136 136]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/learning/pdfs/plot.pdf |title=Robert Plot |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2006 |website=Learning more |publisher=[[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] |location=Oxford |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001094736/http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/learning/pdfs/plot.pdf |archive-date=2006-10-01 |access-date=2019-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Lhuyd]], a friend of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]], published ''Lithophylacii Britannici ichnographia'' (1699), the first scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a sauropod [[tooth]], ''[[Rutellum|Rutellum impicatum]]'',&lt;ref name=L99/&gt;&lt;ref name=DS02/&gt; that had been found in Caswell, near [[Witney]], Oxfordshire.&lt;ref name=G45/&gt;

[[File:William Buckland detail.png|thumb|left|[[William Buckland]]]]
Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev [[William Buckland]], the first Reader of Geology at the University of Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of ''Megalosaurus'' and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a [[scientific journal]].&lt;ref name=WAS97/&gt;&lt;ref name=buckland1824/&gt; The second dinosaur genus to be identified, ''Iguanodon'', was discovered in 1822 by [[Mary Ann Mantell]]&amp;nbsp;– the wife of English geologist [[Gideon Mantell]]. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.&lt;ref name=GM25/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDS97/&gt;

The study of these &quot;great fossil lizards&quot; soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term &quot;dinosaur&quot;. He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum, London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.&lt;ref name=owen94&gt;{{harvnb|Rupke|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1858, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the first known American dinosaur, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]]. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in [[Maidstone|Maidstone, England]]), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.&lt;ref name=weishampel06&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Prieto-Marquez |first1=Albert |last2=Weishampel |first2=David B. |last3=Horner |first3=John R. |date=March 2006 |title=The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus |url=https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |location=Warsaw |publisher=Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=77–98 |issn=0567-7920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622113255/https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-22 |access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877]]
Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling because the explosions from the dynamic would potentially destroy any and all dinosauric evidence). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History, while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;

After 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including Antarctica. The first [[Antarctica#Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)|Antarctic dinosaur]] to be discovered, the ankylosaurid ''[[Antarctopelta|Antarctopelta oliveroi]]'', was found on [[James Ross Island]] in 1986,&lt;ref name=antarctopelta&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salgado |first1=Leonardo |author1-link=Leonardo Salgado |last2=Gasparini |first2=Zulma |author2-link=Zulma Brandoni de Gasparini |date=March 2006 |title=Reappraisal of an ankylosaurian dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of James Ross Island (Antarctica) |url=http://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/sites/default/files/articles/pdf/g2006n1a5.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Geodiversitas |location=[[Paris]] |publisher=[[National Museum of Natural History, France|Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=119–135 |issn=1280-9659 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502100439/http://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/sites/default/files/articles/pdf/g2006n1a5.pdf |archive-date=2018-05-02 |access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod ''[[Cryolophosaurus|Cryolophosaurus ellioti]]'', was formally named and described in a scientific journal.&lt;ref name=cryolophosaurus&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hammer |first1=William R. |author1-link=William R.

Current dinosaur &quot;hot spots&quot; include southern South America (especially Argentina) and China. China in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization.&lt;ref name=Schweitzeretal1999/&gt;

{{Main|Dinosaur renaissance}}
[[File:Dr. Bob Bakker with Dino.jpg|thumb|Paleontologist [[Robert T. Bakker]] with mounted skeleton of a tyrannosaurid (''[[Gorgosaurus|Gorgosaurus libratus]]'')]]
The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by [[John Ostrom]]'s discovery of ''[[Deinonychus]]'', an active predator that may have been warm-blooded, in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and cold-blooded. [[Vertebrate paleontology]] has become a global [[science]]. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the well-preserved feathered dinosaurs&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20161208&quot; /&gt; in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of [[cladistics]], which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record.&lt;ref name=bakker86&gt;{{harvnb|Bakker|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft tissue and DNA===
[[File:Scipionyx samniticus 232.jpg|thumb|''[[Scipionyx]]'' from the [[Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]], Italy]]
One of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the [[Pietraroja Formation|Pietraroia Plattenkalk]] in southern [[Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, ''[[Scipionyx|Scipionyx samniticus]]''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.&lt;ref name=&quot;softtissue&quot; /&gt;

In the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' leg bone from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer2005/&gt; When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[Osteon|bone matrix]], and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer2005/&gt;

In 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a [[Hadrosauridae|duck-billed dinosaur]], ''[[Brachylophosaurus|Brachylophosaurus canadensis]]'', found in the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]]. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells.

==Cultural depictions==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}
[[File:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|Outdated ''Iguanodon'' statues created by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] for the Crystal Palace Park in 1853]]
[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|The battles that may have occurred between ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'' are a recurring theme in [[popular science]] and dinosaurs' depiction in culture]]
By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word &quot;dinosaur&quot; into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, &quot;dinosaur&quot; is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;m-w&quot;/&gt;

Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] was unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Museum#Natural history museums|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.&lt;ref name=torrens1993/&gt; Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.&lt;ref name=breithaupt1997/&gt;

The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',&lt;ref name=bleakhouse/&gt; dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in [[advertising]]; numerous [[Company (law)|companies]] have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted, or obsolete.&lt;ref name=DFGlut1997/&gt;
