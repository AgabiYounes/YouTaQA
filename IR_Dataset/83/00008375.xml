The '''draugr''' or '''draug''' ({{lang-non|draugr}}, plural {{lang|non|'''draugar'''}}; modern {{lang-is|draugur}}, {{lang-fo|dreygur}} and [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and {{lang-no|draug}}) is an [[undead]] creature from [[Norse mythology]], also called  {{lang|non|'''aptrganga''' or '''aptrgangr'''}}, literally &quot;again-walker&quot; ({{lang-is|afturganga}}).

The word ''draugr'' can be traced to a [[Proto-Indo European]] stem ''*{{PIE|dʰrowgʰos}}'' &quot;phantom&quot;, from ''*{{PIE|dʰrewgʰ-}}'' &quot;deceive&quot; (see also Avestan &quot;[[druj]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;eiec&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first1=Edgar C. |last1=Polomé |first2=Douglas Q. |last2=Adams |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Spirit |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Old Norse meaning of the word is a [[revenant]]. In Swedish, ''draug'' is a modern [[loanword]] from West Norse, as the native Swedish form ''drög'' has acquired the meaning of &quot;a pale, ineffectual, and slow-minded person that drags himself along&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JER102&quot;&gt;Rietz, J. E. ''Svenskt dialektlexikon'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The will appears to be strong, strong enough to draw the ''hugr'' [animate will] back to one's body. These reanimated individuals were known as ''draugar''. However, though the dead might live again, they could also die again. ''Draugar'' die a &quot;second death&quot; as Chester Gould calls it, when their bodies decay, are burned, dismembered or otherwise destroyed.&lt;ref name=Remley&gt;{{cite book|last=Remley|first=Gregg A. Smith ; with a foreword by Paul G.|title=The function of the living dead in medieval Norse and Celtic literature : death and desire|date=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=9780773453531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Draugar live in their graves, often guarding treasure buried with them in their burial mound. They are animated corpses with a corporeal body, unlike ghosts, with similar physical abilities as in life. Older literature makes clear distinctions between sea-draugar and land-draugar.

== Traits ==
Draugar possess superhuman strength, can increase their size at will, and carry the unmistakable stench of decay. According to Gregg Smith, &quot;The appearance of a ''draugr'' was that of a dead body: swollen, blackened and generally hideous to look at.&quot;&lt;ref name=Remley /&gt; They are undead figures from Norse and Icelandic mythology which appear to retain some semblance of intelligence. They exist to guard their treasure, wreak havoc on living beings, or torment those who wronged them in life. The draugr's ability to increase its size also increased its weight, and the body of the draugr was described as being extremely heavy. Thorolf of [[Eyrbyggja saga]] was &quot;uncorrupted, and with an ugly look about him… swollen to the size of an ox,&quot; and his body was so heavy that it could not be raised without levers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PE187&quot;&gt;Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GS115&quot;&gt;''Grettirs Saga'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also noted for the ability to rise from the grave as wisps of smoke and &quot;swim&quot; through solid rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;MP103&quot;&gt;Magnussen and Palsson, ''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; 

In folklore, draugar slay their victims through various methods including crushing them with their enlarged forms, devouring their flesh, devouring them whole in their enlarged forms, indirectly killing them by driving them mad, and by drinking their blood. Animals feeding near the grave of a draugr might be driven mad by the creature's influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;BC81-93&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Curran |first=Bob |authorlink= |title=Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures that Stalk the Night |publisher=Career Press |year=2005 |pages=81–93 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lK0iQcCUZqkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-56414-807-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also die from being driven mad. Thorolf, for example, caused birds to drop dead when they flew over his bowl barrow.

The draugr's victims were not limited to trespassers in its home. The roaming undead devastated livestock by running the animals to death either by riding them or pursuing them in some hideous, half-flayed form. Shepherds' duties kept them outdoors at night, and they were particular targets for the hunger and hatred of the undead:
{{quote|text=The oxen which had been used to haul Thorolf's body were ridden to death by demons, and every single beast that came near his grave went raving mad and howled itself to death. The shepherd at Hvamm often came racing home with Thorolf after him. One day that Fall neither sheep nor shepherd came back to the farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;PE115&quot;&gt;Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Draugar are noted for having numerous magical abilities (referred to as ''trollskap'') resembling those of living witches and wizards, such as shape-shifting, controlling the weather, and seeing into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR163&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Hilda Roderick Ellis |authorlink=Hilda Ellis Davidson |title=The Road to Hel: A Study of the Conception of the Dead in Old Norse Literature |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=1943 |page=163 |url= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A draugr can change into a seal,&lt;ref name=&quot;PE165&quot;&gt;Palsson and Edwards, ''Eyrbyggja Saga'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LS80&quot;&gt;''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; a great flayed bull, a grey horse with a broken back but no ears or tail, and a cat that would sit upon a sleeper's chest and grow steadily heavier until the victim suffocated.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS166&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Jacqueline |authorlink= |title=Icelandic Folktales and Legends |publisher=University of California Press |year=1972 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HY-DCKd6UgUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-520-02116-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The draugr Þráinn (Thrain) shape-shifted into a cat-like creature (''kattakyn'') in ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]'':
{{quote|text=Then Thrain turned himself into a [[troll]], and the barrow was filled with a horrible stench; and he stuck his claws into the back of Hromund's neck, tearing the flesh from his bones.&lt;ref name=&quot;KP68&quot;&gt;Kershaw, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Draugar have the ability to enter into the dreams of the living,&lt;ref name=&quot;HR163&quot;/&gt; and they will frequently leave a gift behind so that &quot;the living person may be assured of the tangible nature of the visit&quot;.{{sfnp|Chadwick|1946|p=53}}  Draugar also have the ability to curse a victim, as shown in the [[Grettis saga]], where Grettir is cursed to be unable to become any stronger. Draugar also brought disease to a village and could create temporary darkness in daylight hours. They preferred to be active during the night, although it did not appear to be vulnerable to sunlight like some other revenants. Draugr can also kill people with bad luck.

A draugr's presence might be shown by a great light that glowed from the mound like [[foxfire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FP36&quot;&gt;Fox and Palsson, ''Grettirs Saga'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This fire would form a barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR161&quot;&gt;Davidson, ''The Road to Hel'', p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The draugr could also move magically through the earth, swimming through solid stone as does Killer-Hrapp:

{{quote|text=Then Olaf tried to rush Hrapp, but Hrapp sank into the ground where he had been standing and that was the end of their encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;MP103&quot;/&gt;}}

Some draugar are immune to weapons, and only a hero has the strength and courage needed to stand up to so formidable an opponent. In legends, the hero would often have to wrestle the draugr back to his grave, thereby defeating him, since weapons would do no good. A good example of this is found in ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]''. Iron could injure a draugr, as is the case with many supernatural creatures, although it would not be sufficient to stop it.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS107&quot;&gt;Simpson, ''Icelandic Folktales and Legends'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the hero is required to dispose of the body in unconventional ways. The preferred method is to cut off the draugr's head, burn the body, and dump the ashes in the sea—the emphasis being on making absolutely sure that the draugr was dead and gone.&lt;ref name=&quot;VA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ghosts.shtml |title=Viking Answer Lady Webpage - The Walking Dead: Draugr and Aptrgangr in Old Norse Literature |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |date=2005-12-14 |accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draugar were said to be either ''hel-blár'' (&quot;death-blue&quot;) or ''nár-fölr'' (&quot;corpse-pale&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;BC81-93&quot;/&gt; The death-blue color was not actually grey but was a dark blue or maroon hue which covered the entire body. Glámr, the undead shepherd of ''Grettis saga'', was reported to be dark blue,&lt;ref name=&quot;FP72&quot;&gt;Fox and Palsson, ''Grettirs Saga'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laxdæla saga]] describes how bones were dug up belonging to a dead sorceress who had appeared in dreams, and they were &quot;blue and evil looking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MP235&quot;&gt;Magnusson and Palsson, ''Laxdaela Saga'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resting place of the draugr was a tomb which they were able to leave during the night to visit the living. Such visits are supposed to be horrible events that often end in death for one or more of the living, which would then warrant the exhumation of the draugr by a hero.

The draugr's motivation was primarily jealousy and greed. Greed causes it to viciously attack any would-be grave robbers, but the draugr also expresses an innate jealousy of the living stemming from a longing for the things of life which it once had. They also exhibit an immense and nearly insatiable appetite, as shown in the encounter of Aran and Asmund, sword brothers who made an oath that, if one should die, the other would sit vigil with him for three days inside the burial mound. When Aran died, Asmund brought his own possessions into the barrow—banners, armor, hawk, hound, and horse—then set himself to wait the three days:

{{quote|text=During the first night, Aran got up from his chair and killed the hawk and hound and ate them. On the second night he got up again from his chair, and killed the horse and tore it into pieces; then he took great bites at the horse-flesh with his teeth, the blood streaming down from his mouth all the while he was eating…. The third night Asmund became very drowsy, and the first thing he knew, Aran had got him by the ears and torn them off.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSOMT99-101&quot;&gt;''Gautrek's Saga and Other Medieval Tales'', pp. 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Creation of draugar ==
The main indication that a deceased person will become a draugr is that the corpse is not in a horizontal position but is found in an upright or sitting position, indicating that the dead might return.{{sfnp|Jakobsson|2011|p=296}} Any mean, nasty, or greedy person can become a draugr. As Ármann notes, &quot;most medieval Icelandic ghosts are evil or marginal people. If not dissatisfied or evil, they are unpopular&quot;.{{sfnp|Jakobsson|2011|p=295}}

== Means of prevention ==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Norre naeraa 600px.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Nørre Nærå Runestone is interpreted as having a &quot;grave binding inscription&quot; used to keep the deceased in its grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Stephen A. |authorlink = |title=Witchcraft and Magic in the Nordic Middle Ages |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2011 |pages=22–23 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=shCXJLB6mDAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-8122-4290-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Traditionally,{{where|date=October 2018}} a pair of open iron scissors was placed on the chest of the recently deceased, and straws or twigs might be hidden among their clothes. The big toes were tied together or needles were driven through the soles of the feet in order to keep the dead from being able to walk. Tradition also held that the coffin should be lifted and lowered in three different directions as it was carried from the house to confuse a possible draugr's sense of direction.

The most effective means of preventing the return of the dead was believed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to be a corpse door, a special door through which the corpse was carried feet-first with people surrounding it so that the corpse couldn't see where it was going. The door was then bricked up to prevent a return. It is speculated{{by whom|date=October 2018}} that this belief began in Denmark and spread throughout the Norse culture, founded on the idea that the dead could only leave through the way they entered.

In ''Eyrbyggja saga'', draugar are driven off by holding a &quot;door-doom&quot;. One by one, they are summoned to the door-doom and given judgment and forced out of the home by this legal method. The home was then purified with holy water to ensure that they never came back.

== Similar creatures ==
A variation of the draugr is the ''haugbui'' (from Old Norse ''haugr''' &quot;howe, barrow, tumulus&quot;) which was a mound-dweller, the dead body living on within its tomb. The notable difference between the two was that the haugbui is unable to leave its grave site and only attacks those who trespass upon their territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;BC81-93&quot;/&gt;

The haugbui was rarely found far from its burial place and is a type of undead commonly found in Norse sagas. The creature is said to either swim alongside boats or sail around them in a partially submerged vessel, always on their own. In some accounts, witnesses portray them as shapeshifters who take on the appearance of seaweed or moss-covered stones on the shoreline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.skadi.net/archive/index.php/t-76010.html The Walking Dead: Draugr and Aptrgangr in Old Norse Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==

===Icelandic Sagas===
One of the best-known draugar is '''Glámr''', who is defeated by the hero in ''[[Grettis saga]]''. After Glámr dies on Christmas Eve, &quot;people became aware that Glámr was not resting in peace. He wrought such havoc that some people fainted at the sight of him, while others went out of their minds&quot;. After a battle, Grettir eventually gets Glámr on his back. Just before Grettir kills him, Glámr curses Grettir because &quot;Glámr was endowed with more evil force than most other ghosts&quot;,{{sfnp|Scudder|2005}} and thus he was able to speak and leave Grettir with his curse after his death.

A somewhat ambivalent, alternative view of the draugr is presented by the example of [[Gunnar Hámundarson]] in ''[[Njáls saga]]'': &quot;It seemed as though the howe was agape, and that Gunnar had turned within the howe to look upwards at the moon. They thought that they saw four lights within the howe, but not a shadow to be seen. Then they saw that Gunnar was merry, with a joyful face.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Njal's saga|date=2001|publisher=Penguin|others=Cook, Robert, 1932-2011.|isbn=0140447695|location=London|oclc=47938075}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=We need a source describing the ghost with these words, otherwise this is original research.|date=January 2019}}

In the ''[[Eyrbyggja saga]]'', a shepherd is assaulted by a blue-black draugr. The shepherd's neck is broken during the ensuing scuffle. The shepherd rises the next night as a draugr.&lt;ref name=&quot;BC81-93&quot;/&gt;

===Recent===
[[Image:Draug.jpg|thumb|right|140px|A &quot;draug&quot; from modern Scandinavian folklore&lt;ref name=&quot;JL2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13508/13508-h/13508-h.htm |title=Weird Tales from the Northern Seas |author=Housman, Laurence (illustrations); R. Nisbet Bain (1893 translation); Jonas Lie (original Danish) |year=1893 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; aboard a ship, in sub-human form, wearing oilskins]]

In more recent [[Scandinavian folklore]], the draug (the modern spelling used in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) is often identified with the spirits of [[Sailor|mariner]]s [[Drowning|drowned]] at sea. The creature is said to possess a distinctly human form, with the exception that its head is composed entirely of [[seaweed]]. In other tellings, the draug is described as being a headless fisherman, dressed in [[oilskin]] and sailing in half a boat (the Norwegian municipality of [[Bø, Nordland]] has the half-boat in its coat-of-arms). This trait is common in the northernmost part of Norway, where life and culture was based on fishing more than anywhere else. The reason for this may be that the fishermen often drowned in great numbers, and the stories of restless dead coming in from sea were more common in the north than any other region of the country.

A recorded legend from [[Trøndelag]] tells how a [[cadaver]] lying on a beach became the object of a quarrel between the two types of draug (headless and seaweed-headed). A similar source even tells of a third type, the ''gleip'', known to hitch themselves to sailors walking ashore and make them slip on the wet rocks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

But, though the draug usually presages death, there is an amusing account in [[Northern Norway]] of a northerner who managed to outwit him:

{{quote|text=It was [[Christmas Eve]], and Ola went down to his boathouse to get the [[keg]] of [[brandy]] he had bought for the holidays. When he got in, he noticed a draugr sitting on the keg, staring out to sea. Ola, with great presence of mind and great bravery (it might not be amiss to state that he already had done some drinking), tiptoed up behind the draugr and struck him sharply in the small of the back, so that he went flying out through the window, with sparks hissing around him as he hit the water. Ola knew he had no time to lose, so he set off at a great rate, running through the churchyard which lay between his home and the boathouse. As he ran, he cried, &quot;Up, all you Christian [[Spirit|souls]], and help me!&quot; Then he heard the sound of fighting between the ghosts and the draugr, who were battling each other with [[Coffin|coffin boards]] and bunches of seaweed. The next morning, when people came to church, the whole yard was strewn with coffin covers, boat boards, and seaweed. After the fight, which the ghosts won, the draugr never came back to that district.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}

===Use in popular culture===

The modern and popular connection between the draug and the sea can be traced back to authors like [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]] and Regine Nordmann, whose works include several books of fairy tales, as well as the drawings of [[Theodor Kittelsen]], who spent some years living in [[Svolvær]]. Up north, the tradition of sea-draugs is especially vivid.

[[Arne Garborg]] describes land-draugs coming [[Haugtussa|fresh from the graveyards]], and the term ''draug'' is even used of [[vampires]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The notion of draugs who live in the mountains is present in the poetic works of [[Henrik Ibsen]] (''[[Peer Gynt]]''), and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]]. The [[Nynorsk]] translation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' used the term for both [[Nazgûl]] and the dead men of [[Dunharrow]]. Tolkien's [[Barrow-Wights]] bear obvious similarity to, and were inspired by the haugbui. In the video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', draugr are the undead skeletal remains of fallen warriors that inhabit the ancient burial sites of a Nordic-inspired race of man. Draugr are a common enemy, the first encountered by the player, in the 2018 video game ''[[God of War (2018)|God of War]]'', with a variety of different powers and abilities.

The [[exoplanet]] [[PSR B1257+12 A]] has been named &quot;Draugr&quot;.
