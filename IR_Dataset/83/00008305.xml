==Classification==
Dyslexia is divided into developmental and acquired forms. This article is primarily about ''developmental dyslexia'', i.e., dyslexia that begins in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. 3rd ed. &quot;[https://oed.com/view/Entry/331223 dyslexia, ''n'']. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2012 (&quot;a learning disability specifically affecting the attainment of literacy, with difficulty esp. in word recognition, spelling, and the conversion of letters to sounds, occurring in a child with otherwise normal development, and now usually regarded as a neurodevelopmental disorder with a genetic component.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Acquired dyslexia occurs subsequent to neurological insult, such as [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[stroke]]. People with acquired dyslexia exhibit some of the signs or symptoms of the developmental disorder, but requiring different assessment strategies and treatment approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woollams|first=Anna M.|date=2014-01-19|title=Connectionist neuropsychology: uncovering ultimate causes of acquired dyslexia|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=369|issue=1634|pages=20120398|doi=10.1098/rstb.2012.0398|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3866427|pmid=24324241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Characteristics of dyslexia}}
In early childhood, symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of dyslexia include [[speech delay|delayed onset]] of speech and a lack of phonological awareness.&lt;ref name=Handler2011/&gt; A common myth closely associates dyslexia with mirror writing and reading letters or words backwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;LilienfeldLynn2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;pg=PT88|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread Misconceptions about Human Behavior|last2=Lynn|first2=Steven Jay|last3=Ruscio|first3=John|last4=Beyerstein|first4=Barry L.|date=15 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-6074-5|pages=88–89|last1=Lilienfeld|first1=Scott O.|authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld|authorlink4=Barry Beyerstein|accessdate=19 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109130327/https://books.google.com/books?id=8DlS0gfO_QUC&amp;pg=PT88|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are seen in many children as they learn to read and write, and are not considered to be defining characteristics of dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Handler2011/&gt;

School-age children with dyslexia may exhibit [[medical sign|signs]] of difficulty in identifying or generating rhyming words, or counting the number of syllables in words–both of which depend on [[phonological awareness]].&lt;ref name=DAss&gt;{{cite web |title=Dyslexia and Related Disorders |date=January 2003 |website=Alabama Dyslexia Association |publisher=[[International Dyslexia Association]] |accessdate=29 April 2015 |url=http://idaalabama.org/Facts/Dyslexia_and_Related.pdf |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124053/http://idaalabama.org/Facts/Dyslexia_and_Related.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also show difficulty in segmenting words into individual sounds or may blend sounds when producing words, indicating reduced [[phonemic awareness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PeerReid2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peer |first1=Lindsay |last2=Reid |first2=Gavin |title=Multilingualism, Literacy and Dyslexia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-aoABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219 |year=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-60899-5 |page=219 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109204808/https://books.google.com/books?id=-aoABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219 |archivedate=9 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties with word retrieval or naming things is also associated with dyslexia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaywitz2013a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shaywitz, Sally E.|author2=Shaywitz, Bennett A.|chapter=Chapter 34 Making a Hidden Disability Visible: What Has Been Learned from Neurobiological Studies of Dyslexia|editor1=Swanson, H.

Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may include difficulties with summarizing stories, memorization, reading aloud, or learning foreign languages. Adults with dyslexia can often read with good comprehension, though they tend to read more slowly than others without a learning difficulty and perform worse in [[spelling]] tests or when reading nonsense words–a measure of phonological awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarrad|first1=Lum|title=Procedural learning is impaired in dyslexia: evidence from a meta-analysis of serial reaction time studies|journal=Research of Developmental Disabilities|date=October 2013|pages=3460–76|pmid=23920029|pmc=3784964|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.017|volume=34|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associated conditions===
Dyslexia often co-occurs with other learning disorders, but the reasons for this comorbidity have not been clearly identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Dyslexia, dysgraphia, procedural learning and the cerebellum |journal=Cortex |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=117–27 |date=September 2009|pmid=19818437 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.08.016|last1=Nicolson |first1=R.

Researchers have been trying to find the neurobiological basis of dyslexia since the condition was first identified in 1881.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald Berkhan ref 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReidFawcett2008x&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reid, Gavin|author2=Fawcett, Angela|author3=Manis, Frank|author4=Siegel, Linda|title=The SAGE Handbook of Dyslexia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=937rqz4Ryc8C&amp;pg=PA127|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84860-037-9|page=127|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109200307/https://books.google.com/books?id=937rqz4Ryc8C&amp;pg=PA127|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some have tried to associate the common problem among people with dyslexia of not being able to see letters clearly to abnormal development of their visual nerve cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein2014&quot; &gt;{{cite journal |first1=John |last1=Stein |year=2014 |title=Dyslexia: the Role of Vision and Visual Attention |journal=Current Developmental Disorders Reports |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=267–80 |pmid=25346883 |pmc=4203994 |doi=10.1007/s40474-014-0030-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroanatomy===
[[Neuroimaging]] techniques, such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] ([[fMRI]]) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), have shown a correlation between both functional and structural differences in the brains of children with reading difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitaker2010r&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitaker, Harry A.|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNcDiRV2jJQC&amp;pg=PA180|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-096499-7|page=180|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109173223/https://books.google.com/books?id=GNcDiRV2jJQC&amp;pg=PA180|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people with dyslexia show less electrical activation in parts of the left hemisphere of the brain involved with reading, such as the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], [[inferior parietal lobule]], and the middle and [[Brodmann area 20|ventral temporal cortex]].&lt;ref name=Pammer2014/&gt; Over the past decade, brain activation studies using PET to study language have produced a breakthrough in the understanding of the neural basis of language. Neural bases for the visual [[lexicon]] and for auditory verbal [[short-term memory]] components have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=cathy|title=A Review and Synthesis of the first 20 years of Pet and fMRI studies of heard Speech, Spoken Language and Reading|journal=NeuroImage|date=16 August 2012|volume=62 |issue=2|pages=816–847|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.04.062|pmid=22584224|pmc=3398395}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some implication that the observed neural manifestation of developmental dyslexia is task-specific (i.e., functional rather than structural). fMRIs of people with dyslexia indicate an interactive role of the [[cerebellum]] and cerebral cortex as well as other brain structures in reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=S|title=Neuroimaging essentials in essential tremor: a systematic review.|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|date=May 2014|pages=217–231|pmid=25068111|pmc=4110352|doi=10.1016/j.nicl.2014.05.003|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandler|first1=William|title=The genetic relationship between handedness and neurodevelopmental disorders|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|date=February 2014|pages=83–90|pmid=24275328|pmc=3969300|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2013.10.008|volume=20|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cerebellar theory of dyslexia proposes that impairment of cerebellum-controlled muscle movement affects the formation of words by the tongue and facial muscles, resulting in the [[fluency]] problems that some people with dyslexia experience. The cerebellum is also involved in the [[Autonomic nervous system|automatization]] of some tasks, such as reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cain|first1=Kate|title=Reading development and difficulties|date=2010|publisher=TJ International|page=134|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FT6RALjOr9QC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=cerebellar+theory+of+dyslexia#v=onepage&amp;q=cerebellar%20theory%20of%20dyslexia&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 March 2015|isbn=9781405151559}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that some children  with dyslexia have motor task and balance impairments could be consistent with a cerebellar role in their reading difficulties. However, the cerebellar theory has not been supported by controlled research studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levav|first1=Itzhak|title=Psychiatric and Behavioral Disorders in Israel: From Epidemiology to Mental health|date=2009|publisher=Green Publishing|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W2RzffMnpg8C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=cerebellar+theory+of+dyslexia#v=onepage&amp;q=cerebellar%20theory%20of%20dyslexia&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 March 2015|isbn=9789652294685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Research into potential genetic causes of dyslexia has its roots in post-autopsy examination of the brains of people with dyslexia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stein2014&quot; /&gt; Observed anatomical differences in the [[language center]]s of such brains include microscopic [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] malformations known as [[wikt:ectopia|ectopias]], and more rarely, [[blood vessel|vascular]] micro-malformations, and  [[microgyrus]]—a smaller than usual size for the gyrus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faust2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Faust, Miriam|title=The Handbook of the Neuropsychology of Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEWVqdNFL4cC&amp;pg=PA941|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3040-3|pages=941–43|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109200538/https://books.google.com/books?id=UEWVqdNFL4cC&amp;pg=PA941|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previously cited studies and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benitez|first1=A|title=Neurobiology and neurogenetics of dyslexia|journal=Neurology (In Spanish)|date=November 2010|pmid=21093706|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2009.12.010|volume=25|issue=9|pages=563–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that abnormal cortical development, presumed to occur before or during the sixth month of [[fetal]] brain development, may have caused the abnormalities.

===Gene–environment interaction===
The contribution of gene–environment interaction to reading disability has been intensely studied using [[twin studies]], which estimate the proportion of variance associated with a person's environment and the proportion associated with their genes. Both environmental and genetic factors appear to contribute to reading development. Studies examining the influence of environmental factors such as parental education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Parental Education Moderates Genetic Influences on Reading Disability |journal=Psychol.

As environment plays a large role in learning and memory, it is likely that [[epigenetic]] modifications play an important role in reading ability. Measures of [[gene expression]], [[Histone#Histone modification|histone modifications]], and [[methylation]] in the human periphery are used to study epigenetic processes; however, all of these have limitations in the extrapolation of results for application to the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roth |first=Tania L. |last2=Roth |first2=Eric D. |last3=Sweatt |first3=J.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Gray733.png|thumb|140px|Corpus callosum view, front part at top of image]]

Most people who are right-hand dominant have the left hemisphere of their brain specialize more in language processing. In terms of the mechanism of dyslexia, fMRI studies suggest that this specialization may be less pronounced or even absent in cases with dyslexia. Additionally, anatomical differences in the [[corpus callosum]], the bundle of nerve fibers that connects the left and right hemispheres, have been linked to dyslexia via different studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;habi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Habib |first1=Michael |title=Pediatric Neurology Part I |volume=111 |chapter=Dyslexia |date=2013 |pages=229–235 |chapter-url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444528919000233 |accessdate=19 December 2018 |language=en|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52891-9.00023-3 |pmid=23622168 |series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |isbn=9780444528919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data via diffusion tensor MRI indicate changes in connectivity or in gray matter density in areas related to reading/language.

===Assessment===
* Strive for a multidisciplinary team approach involving the child's parent(s) and teacher(s); school psychologist; pediatrician; and, as appropriate, [[Speech-language pathology|speech and language pathologist (speech therapist)]]; and [[Occupational therapy|occupational therapist]].&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Christo, John M. Davis, and Stephen E. Brock, ''Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School'' (New York: Springer Science+Business Media, 2009), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Possess a thorough familiarity with typical ages children reach various general developmental milestones (write first name; draw a square), and domain-specific milestones, such as phonological awareness (recognize rhyming words; identify the initial sounds in words).&lt;ref&gt;Mather, Nancy and Barbara J. Wendling. ''Essentials of Dyslexia Assessment and Intervention''. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid over-reliance on tests. Careful observation of the child in the school and home environments, and sensitive, comprehensive parental interviews are just as important as tests.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Gavin and Jennie Guise. ''The Dyslexia Assessment''. London: Bloomsbury, 2017 (&quot;... assessment for dyslexia includes more than tests; it involves comprehensive insights into the student's learning. This requires a full and comprehensive individual assessment as well as consideration of the environment and contextual factors.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Thambirajah, ''Developmental Assessment of the School-Aged Child with Developmental Disabilities: A Clinician's Guide'' (London: Jessica Kingsley, 2011), 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Take advantage of the empirically supported &quot;response to intervention&quot; (RTI) approach,&lt;ref&gt;Jimerson, Shane R., Matthew K. Burns, and Amanda M. VanDerHeyden. ''Handbook of Response to Intervention: The Science and Practice of Multi-Tiered Systems of Support''. 2nd ed. New York: Springer Science+Business Media, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which &quot;... involves monitoring the progress of a group of children through a programme of intervention rather than undertaking a static assessment of their current skills. Children with the most need are those who fail to respond to effective teaching, and they are readily identified using this approach.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Snowling, Margaret J. &quot;Early Identification and Interventions for Dyslexia: A Contemporary View.&quot; ''Journal of Research in Special Education Needs'' 13, no. 1, 7–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assessment tests====
There is a wide range of tests that are used in clinical and educational settings to evaluate the possibility that a person might have dyslexia.&lt;ref name=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/dyslexics/learn-about-dyslexia/dyslexia-testing/tests|title=Tests for Dyslexia and Learning Disabilities|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=15 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000802/http://dyslexiahelp.umich.edu/dyslexics/learn-about-dyslexia/dyslexia-testing/tests|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If initial testing suggests that a person might have dyslexia, such tests are often followed up with a full diagnostic assessment to determine the extent and nature of the disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;PeerReid2013p&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peer, Lindsay|author2=Reid, Gavin|title=Introduction to Dyslexia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTiAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35|year=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-135-37290-3|pages=35–40|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109134343/https://books.google.com/books?id=OTiAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tests can be administered by a teacher or computer; others require specialized training and are given by psychologists.&lt;ref name=balexia/&gt; Some test results indicate how to carry out teaching strategies.&lt;ref name=&quot;balexia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Screening and assessment|url=http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/educator/screening-and-assessment|website=British Dyslexia Association|accessdate=11 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330101403/http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/educator/screening-and-assessment|archivedate=30 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fletcher|first1=Jack|title=Dyslexia: the evolution of a scientific concept|journal=Journal of International Neuropsychology Society|date=2009|pages=501–508|pmc=3079378|pmid=19573267|doi=10.1017/S1355617709090900|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a variety of different cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and environmental factors all could contribute to difficultly learning to read, a comprehensive evaluation should consider these different possibilities. These tests and observations can include:&lt;ref name=&quot;gerd&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulte-Körne |first1=Gerd |title=The Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Dyslexia |journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt International |date=October 2010 |volume=107 |issue=41 |pages=718–727 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2010.0718 |pmid=21046003 |pmc=2967798 |issn=1866-0452}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*General measures of cognitive ability, such as the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]], [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], or [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales]]. Low general cognitive ability would make reading more difficult. Cognitive ability measures also often try to measure different cognitive processes, such as verbal ability, nonverbal and spatial reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. There are different versions of these tests for different age groups. Almost all of these require additional training to give and score correctly, and are done by psychologists. According to Mather and Schneider (2015), a confirmatory profile and/or pattern of scores on cognitive tests confirming or ruling-out reading disorder has not yet been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Mather, N., &amp; Schneider, D.

*Screening or evaluation for mental health conditions: Parents and teachers can complete rating scales or behavior checklists to gather information about emotional and behavioral functioning for younger people. Many checklists have similar versions for parents, teachers, and younger people old enough to read reasonably well (often 11 years and older) to complete. Examples include the Behavioral Assessment System for Children, and the [[Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire]]. All of these have nationally representative norms, making it possible to compare the level of symptoms to what would be typical for the younger person's age and biological sex. Other checklists link more specifically to psychiatric diagnoses, such as the [[Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale|Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales]] or the [[Screen for child anxiety related disorders|Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED)]]. [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] uses brief tools that are designed to catch cases with a disorder, but they often get false positive scores for people who do not have the disorder. Screeners should be followed up by a more accurate test or diagnostic interview as a result. Depressive disorders and anxiety disorders are two-three times higher in people with dyslexia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more common, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collett |first1=Brent R. |last2=Ohan |first2=Jeneva L. |last3=Myers |first3=Kathleen M. |title=Ten-Year Review of Rating Scales.

*Review of academic achievement and skills: Average spelling/reading ability for a dyslexic is a percentage ranking &lt;16, well below normal. In addition to reviewing grades and teacher notes, standardized test results are helpful in evaluating progress. These include group administered tests, such as the [[Iowa Tests of Educational Development]], that a teacher may give to a group or whole classroom of younger people at the same time. They also could include individually administered tests of achievement, such as the [[Wide Range Achievement Test]], or the [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|Woodcock-Johnson]] (which also includes a set of achievement tests).

==Screening==
Screening procedures seek to identify children who show signs of possible dyslexia. In the preschool years, a family history of dyslexia, particularly in biological parents and siblings, predicts an eventual dyslexia diagnosis better than any test.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Christo, John M. Davis, and Stephen E. Brock, ''Identifying, Assessing, and Treating Dyslexia at School'' (New York: Springer Science+Business Media, 2009), 56. {{ISBN|9780387885995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primary school (ages 5–7), the ideal screening procedure consist of training primary school teachers to carefully observe and record their pupils' progress through the phonics curriculum, and thereby identify children progressing slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J. Snowling, ''Dyslexia: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2019), 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190599/Letters_and_Sounds_-_DFES-00281-2007.pdf Letters and Sounds: Principles and Practice of High Quality Phonics], Ref: DFES-00281-2007 (00281-2007BKT-EN), Primary National Strategy, Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers identify such students they can supplement their observations with screening tests such as the ''Phonics screening check''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phonics-screening-check-2019-materials|title=Phonics screening check: 2019 materials|work=United Kingdom Department for Education, Standards and Testing Agency|access-date=14 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; used by United Kingdom schools during [[w:Year One (education)|Year One]].

In the medical setting, child and adolescent psychiatrist M. S. Thambirajah emphasizes that &quot;[g]iven the high prevalence of developmental disorders in school-aged children, all children seen in clinics should be systematically screened for developmental disorders irrespective of the presenting problem/s.&quot; Thambirajah recommends screening for developmental disorders, including dyslexia, by conducting a brief developmental history, a preliminary psychosocial developmental examination, and obtaining a school report regarding academic and social functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental assessment of the school-aged child with developmental disabilities : a clinician's guide|last=Thambirajah, M.

There are different definitions of dyslexia used throughout the world, but despite significant differences in writing systems, dyslexia occurs in different populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Protopapas|first1=Athanassios|title=From temporal processing to developmental language disorders: mind the gap|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2013|pmid=24324245|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0090|pmc=3866431|volume=369|issue=1634|pages=20130090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyslexia is not limited to difficulty in converting letters to sounds, and Chinese people with dyslexia may have difficulty converting [[Chinese character]]s into their meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Jing|title=The visual magnocellular-dorsal dysfunction in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia impedes Chinese character recognition.|journal=Scientific Reports|date=November 2014|pmc=4238300|pmid=25412386|doi=10.1038/srep07068|volume=4|pages=7068|bibcode = 2014NatSR...4E7068Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall2012l&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall, Chloe|title=Current Issues in Developmental Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5VK_TWsQ3N4C&amp;pg=PA152|year=2012|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-84872-084-8|page=152|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109144200/https://books.google.com/books?id=5VK_TWsQ3N4C&amp;pg=PA152|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese vocabulary uses logographic, monographic, non-alphabet writing where one character can represent an individual phoneme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Brain, Mind, and Developmental Psychopathology in Childhood|url = https://books.google.com/?id=5ujeVaMa9U0C&amp;pg=PA177|publisher = Jason Aronson|date = 16 January 2012|isbn = 9780765708663|first = Elena|last = Garralda|first2 = Jean-Philippe|last2 = Raynaud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonological-processing hypothesis attempts to explain why dyslexia occurs in a wide variety of languages. Furthermore, the relationship between phonological capacity and reading appears to be influenced by orthography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phonological processing deficits as a universal model for dyslexia: evidence from different orthographies|journal = CoDAS|pages = 509–519|volume = 26|issue = 6|doi = 10.1590/2317-1782/20142014135|pmid = 25590915|first = Ana Luiza Gomes Pinto|last = Navas|first2 = Érica de Cássia|last2 = Ferraz|first3 = Juliana Postigo Amorina|last3 = Borges|first4 = Ana Luiza Gomes Pinto|last4 = Navas|first5 = Érica de Cássia|last5 = Ferraz|first6 = Juliana Postigo Amorina|last6 = Borges|year = 2014|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of developmental dyslexia}}
Dyslexia was clinically described by [[Oswald Berkhan]] in 1881,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oswald Berkhan ref 1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Berkhan O |year=1917 |title=Über die Wortblindheit, ein Stammeln im Sprechen und Schreiben, ein Fehl im Lesen |trans-title=About word blindness, adyslalia of speech and writing, a weakness in reading |language=German |journal=Neurologisches Centralblatt |volume=36 |pages=914–27 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DmEsAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AUCALB3248710&amp;q=Wortblindheit#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term ''dyslexia'' was coined in 1883 by [[Rudolf Berlin]], an [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berlin&quot;&gt;Berlin, Rudolf.

However, studies have alluded to potential differences due to variation in performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mishra|first1=Srikanta K.|title=Medial efferent mechanisms in children with auditory processing disorders.|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=October 2014|pmid=25386132|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00860|pmc=4209830|volume=8|pages=860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
{{See also|List of artistic depictions of dyslexia|List of people diagnosed with dyslexia}}
As is the case with any disorder, society often makes an assessment based on incomplete information. Before the 1980s, dyslexia was thought to be a consequence of education, rather than a neurological disability. As a result, society often misjudges those with the disorder.&lt;ref name=pmid21046003/&gt; There is also sometimes a workplace stigma and negative attitude towards those with dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Berr|first1=J|title=Factors influencing work participation of adults with developmental dyslexia|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|pmc=3913008|pmid=24460949|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-77|volume=14|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the instructors of a person with dyslexia lack the necessary training to support a child with the condition, there is often a negative effect on the student's learning participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Inclusion of Students with Dyslexia in Higher Education: A Systematic Review Using Narrative Synthesis|journal = Dyslexia (Chichester, England)|date = 1 November 2014|pmc = 4253321|pmid = 25293652|pages = 346–369|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/dys.1484|first = Marco|last = Pino|first2 = Luigina|last2 = Mortari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Writing Systems Template Image.svg|thumb|120px|Writing Systems]]
Most dyslexia research relates to [[alphabetic writing system]]s, and especially to [[European languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid2012a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=Gavin|title=The Routledge Companion to Dyslexia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrBQAmfXYooC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-61710-2|page=16|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109205019/https://books.google.com/books?id=QrBQAmfXYooC&amp;pg=PA16|archivedate=9 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substantial research is also available regarding people with dyslexia who speak Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, or other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richlan|first1=Fabio|title=Functional neuroanatomy of developmental dyslexia; the role of orthographic depth|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=May 2014|pmid=24904383|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00347|pmc=4033006|volume=8|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outward expression of individuals with reading disability and regular poor readers is the same in some respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reading Difficulty and Disability |url=https://report.nih.gov/NIHfactsheets/Pdfs/ReadingDifficultyandDisability(NICHD).pdf |website=report.nih.gov |publisher=NIH |accessdate=10 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
