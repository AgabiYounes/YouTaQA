'''David Janssen''' (born '''David Harold Meyer''', March 27, 1931 – February 13, 1980) was an American film and television actor who is best known for his starring role as [[Richard Kimble]] in the television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' (1963–1967). Janssen also had the title roles in three other series: ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''; ''[[Harry O]]''; and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]''.

In 1996 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him number 36 on its ''50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time'' list.&lt;ref name=&quot;TV Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time [1996]|url=http://www.amiannoying.com/%28S%28g1g1bocjrzwlurkwaw4mhsqb%29%29/collection.aspx?collection=1194|website=Am I annoying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Janssen was born in 1931 in [[Naponee, Nebraska|Naponee]], a village in [[Franklin County, Nebraska|Franklin County]] in southern [[Nebraska]], to Harold Edward Meyer, a banker (May 12, 1906&amp;nbsp;– November 4, 1990) and Berniece Graf (May 11, 1910&amp;nbsp;– November 26, 1995). Janssen was of Irish and Jewish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eder|first=Shirley|title='Angels' Will Be Back – Without Shelly Hack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19800220&amp;id=TWhQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uVgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3044,1222316|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=February 20, 1980|page=12-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his parents' divorce in 1935, his mother moved with five-year-old David to Los Angeles, California, and later married Eugene Janssen (February 18, 1918&amp;nbsp;– March 30, 1996) in 1940 in Los Angeles. Young David used his stepfather's name after he entered show business as a child.

He attended [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]] in Los Angeles, where he excelled on the basketball court, setting a school-scoring record that lasted over 20 years. His first film part was at the age of thirteen, and by the age of twenty-five he had appeared in twenty films and served two years as an enlisted man in the [[United States Army]]. During his Army days, Janssen became friends with fellow enlistees [[Martin Milner]] and [[Clint Eastwood]] while posted at [[Fort Ord]], California.

==Acting career==
[[File:David Janssen Fugitive 1967.JPG|thumb|in TV series ''The Fugitive'', 1963–1967 (final episode)]]
Janssen appeared in many television series before he landed programs of his own. In 1956, he and [[Peter Breck]] appeared in [[John Bromfield]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'' in the episode &quot;The Turkey Farmers&quot;. Later, he guest-starred on [[NBC]]'s [[medical drama]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the role of Hal Kincaid in the 1962 episode &quot;Make Me a Place&quot;, with series co-stars [[Wendell Corey]] and [[Jack Ging]]. He joined friend Martin Milner in a 1962 episode of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' as the character Kamo in the episode &quot;One Tiger to a Hill.&quot;

Janssen starred in four television series of his own:
* ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'' (1957–1960), a [[CBS]]/[[Four Star Television|Four Star]] hit series that also introduced [[Mary Tyler Moore]], showing only her legs, and [[Barbara Bain]] as Diamond's girlfriend.
* ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' (1963–67), the hit [[Quinn Martin]]-produced series, about a Midwest doctor wrongly convicted of murdering his wife;
* ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'' (1971–1972), one of [[Jack Webb]]'s [[Mark VII Limited]] productions for [[Universal Studios]], as a government agent investigating counterfeiters and other federal crimes;
* ''[[Harry O]]'' (1974–1976), as a San Diego-based private eye.

At the time, the final episode of ''The Fugitive'' held the record for the greatest number of American homes with television sets to watch a series finale, at 72 percent in August 1967. 

His films include ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'', the biography of [[Audie Murphy]], who was the most decorated American soldier of World War II; [[John Wayne]]'s Vietnam war film ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''; opposite [[Gregory Peck]] in the space story ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', in which Janssen played an astronaut sent to rescue three stranded men in space, and ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'', as a television journalist in Rome reporting on the election of a new Pope ([[Anthony Quinn]]). He also played pilot Harry Walker in the [[1973]] action movie ''[[Birds of Prey (1973 film)|Birds of Prey]]''.

He starred as a Los Angeles police detective trying to clear himself in the killing of an apparently innocent doctor in the 1967 film ''[[Warning Shot (1967 film)|Warning Shot]]''. The film was shot during a break in the spring and summer of 1966 between the third and fourth seasons of ''The Fugitive.''

Janssen played an alcoholic in the 1977 TV movie ''A Sensitive, Passionate Man'', which co-starred [[Angie Dickinson]], and an engineer who devises an unbeatable system for [[blackjack]] in the 1978 made-for-TV movie ''Nowhere to Run'', co-starring [[Stefanie Powers]] and [[Linda Evans]]. Janssen's impressively husky voice was used to good effect as the narrator for the TV mini-series ''Centennial'' (1978–79); he also appeared in the final episode.  He starred in the made-for-TV mini series ''S.O.S. Titanic'' as John Jacob Astor, playing opposite Beverly Ross as his wife, Madeleine, in 1979.

Though Janssen's scenes were cut from the final release, he also appeared as a journalist in the film ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'', which he accepted to work with [[Laurence Olivier]] who played General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. At the time of his death, Janssen had just begun filming a television movie playing the part of [[Father Damien]], the priest who dedicated himself to the [[leprosy|leper]] colony on the island of [[Molokai]], Hawaii. The part was eventually reassigned to actor [[Ken Howard]] of the CBS series ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]''.

In 1996 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him number 36 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Guide to TV|year=2004|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=0-7607-5634-1|page=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
