'''Delft''' ({{IPA-nl|dɛlft||Nl-Delft.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities in the Netherlands by province|city]] and [[List of municipalities of the Netherlands|municipality]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[South Holland]], [[Netherlands]]. It is located between [[Rotterdam]], to the southeast, and [[The Hague]], to the northwest. Together with them, it is part of both [[Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area]] and the [[Randstad]].

Delft is a popular tourist destination in the country of The Netherlands. It is home to [[Delft University of Technology]] (TU Delft), regarded as center of technological research and development in the Netherlands, [[Delftware|Delft Blue pottery]] and the currently reigning [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. Historically, Delft played a highly influential role in the [[Dutch Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Huerta, Robert D.: ''Giants of Delft: Johannes Vermeer and the Natural Philosophers: The Parallel Search for Knowledge during the Age of Discovery''.

Artenstein: &quot;By 1895 Beijerinck had returned to academia after leaving the [[Wageningen University|Agricultural School]] for a 10-year stint in industrial microbiology in Delft, the South Holland birthplace of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|van Leeuwenhoek]], one of the founding fathers of microbiology. During his first years at the [[Technical University of Delft]], Beijerinck resumed the research on [[tobacco mosaic disease]] that he had started while working with [[Adolf Mayer|Mayer]]. Even then, he had appreciated that the affliction was microbial in nature, although he felt that the actual agents had yet to be discovered. Beijerinck's investigations at Delft proved fruitful; he not only confirmed the infectivity of the [[contagium vivum fluidum]]—soluble living germ—despite filtration, but he importantly demonstrated that unlike bacteria, the culprit of tobacco disease of plants was incapable of independent growth, requiring the presence of living, dividing host cells in order to replicate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Delft can be considered to be the true birthplace of microbiology, with its several sub-disciplines such as [[bacteriology]], [[protozoology]], and [[history of virology|virology]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Delft}}

===Early history===
[[File:Cornelis Springer, The Gemeenlandshuis and the Old Church, Delft, Summer (1877).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Gemeenlandshuis and the Old Church in (1877) by [[Cornelis Springer]]]]
[[File:Antique map of Delft, Netherlands by Blaeu J. 1649.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Delft in 1649 ([[Joan Blaeu|Blaeu]])]]

The city of Delft came into being beside a canal, the 'Delf', which comes from the word ''delven'', meaning to delve  or dig, and this led to the name Delft. At the elevated place where this 'Delf' crossed the creek wall of the silted up river Gantel, a Count established his [[manor]], probably around 1075. Partly because of this, Delft became an important market town, the evidence for which can be seen in the size of its central market square.

Having been a rural village in the early Middle Ages, Delft developed into a city, and on April 15, 1246, [[William II of Holland|Count Willem II]] granted Delft its [[City rights in the Netherlands|city charter]]. Trade and industry flourished. In 1389 the Delfshavensche Schie canal was dug through to the river [[Nieuwe Maas|Maas]], where the port of [[Delfshaven]] was built, connecting Delft to the sea.

Until the 17th century Delft was one of the major cities of the then county (and later province) of [[County of Holland|Holland]]. In 1400, for example, the city had 6,500 inhabitants, making it the third largest city after [[Dordrecht]] (8,000) and [[Haarlem]] (7,000).  In 1560, Amsterdam, with 28,000 inhabitants, had become the largest city, followed by Delft, Leiden and Haarlem, which each had around 14,000 inhabitants.

In 1536 a large part of the city was destroyed by the great fire of Delft.

The town's association with the [[House of Orange]] started when [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Willem van Oranje), nicknamed [[William the Silent]] (Willem de Zwijger), took up residence in 1572 in the former Saint-Agatha convent (subsequently called the Prinsenhof). At the time he was the leader of growing national Dutch resistance against Spanish occupation, known as the [[Eighty Years' War]].  By then Delft was one of the leading cities of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and it was equipped with the necessary [[city wall]]s to serve as a headquarters. [[Battle of Delft (1573)|An attack by Spanish forces (Battle of Delft)]] in October of that year was repelled.

After the [[Act of Abjuration]] was proclaimed in 1581, Delft became the ''[[de facto]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of the newly independent Netherlands, as the seat of the [[Prince of Orange]].

When William was shot dead on July 10, 1584 by [[Balthazar Gerards]] in the hall of the Prinsenhof (now the [[Museum Het Prinsenhof|Prinsenhof Museum]]), the family's traditional burial place in [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] was still in the hands of the Spanish. Therefore, he was buried in the Delft [[Nieuwe Kerk, Delft|Nieuwe Kerk]] (New Church), starting a tradition for the House of Orange that has continued to the present day.

Around this time, Delft also occupied a prominent position in the field of printing.

A number of Italian glazed earthenware makers settled in the city and introduced a new style. The tapestry industry also flourished when famous manufacturer François Spierincx moved to the city.  In the 17th century, Delft experienced a new heyday, thanks to the presence of an office of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) (opened in 1602) and the manufacture of [[Delftware|Delft Blue china]].

A number of notable artists based themselves in the city, including [[Leonard Bramer]], [[Carel Fabritius]], [[Pieter de Hoogh]], [[Gerard Houckgeest]], [[Emanuel de Witte]], [[Jan Steen]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]].
[[Reinier de Graaf]] and [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] received international attention for their scientific research. 

===Delft Explosion===
[[File:Delftsedonderslag.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Egbert van der Poel]]: ''A View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654'']]

The Delft Explosion, also known in history as the Delft Thunderclap, occurred on 12 October 1654&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/the-day-the-world-came-to-an-end-the-great-delft-thunderclap-of-1654/ &quot;The Day the World Came to an End: the Great Delft Thunderclap of 1654&quot;, Radio Netherlands Archives, October 14, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; when a [[gunpowder]] store exploded, destroying much of the city. Over a hundred people were killed and thousands were wounded.

About {{convert|30|t|1|lk=on}} of gunpowder were stored in [[Barrel (storage)|barrels]] in a [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] in a former [[Order of Poor Ladies|Clarist]] [[convent]] in the Doelenkwartier district, where the Paardenmarkt is now located. Cornelis Soetens, the keeper of the magazine, opened the store to check a sample of the powder and a huge explosion followed. Luckily, many citizens were away, visiting a market in [[Schiedam]] or a fair in [[The Hague]].

Today, the explosion is primarily remembered for killing Rembrandt's most promising pupil, [[Carel Fabritius]], and destroying almost all of his works.

Delft artist [[Egbert van der Poel]] painted several pictures of Delft showing the devastation.

The gunpowder store was subsequently re-housed, a 'cannonball's distance away', outside the city, in a new building designed by architect [[Pieter Post]].

==Culture==
[[File:Delft plate faience Famille Rose 1760 1780.jpg|thumb|Delft blue is most famous but there are other kinds of Delftware, like this plate faience in rose]]

Delft is well known for the [[Delftware|Delft pottery]] [[ceramic]] products&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunford2010&quot;/&gt; which were styled on the imported [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]] of the 17th century. The city had an early start in this area since it was a home port of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. It can still be seen at the pottery factories [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles|De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles (or Royal Delft)]] and De Delftse Pauw, while new ceramics and ceramic art can be found at the [[Gallery Terra Delft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KK 1996&quot;&gt;Kitty Kilian, &quot;[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1996/05/23/10-jaar-galerie-terra-keramisch-gezicht-op-delft-7310973-a912879 10 jaar galerie Terra; Keramisch gezicht op Delft].&quot; ''NRC Handelsblad,'' 23 May 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] (1632–1675) was born in Delft. Vermeer used Delft streets and home interiors as the subject or background in his paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunford2010&quot;/&gt;
Several other famous painters lived and worked in Delft at that time, such as [[Pieter de Hooch|Pieter de Hoogh]], [[Carel Fabritius]], [[Nicolaes Maes]], Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet. They were all members of the [[Delft School (painting)|Delft School]]. The Delft School is known for its images of domestic life and views of households, church interiors, courtyards, squares and the streets of Delft. The painters also produced pictures showing historic events, flowers, portraits for patrons and the court as well as decorative pieces of art.

Delft supports creative arts companies. From 2001 the {{ill|Bacinol (building)|lt=Bacinol|nl|Bacinol}}, a building that had been disused since 1951, began to house small companies in the creative arts sector.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} However, demolition of the building started in December 2009, making way for the construction of the new railway tunnel in Delft. The occupants of the building, as well as the name 'Bacinol', moved to another building in the city. The name Bacinol relates to [[DSM (company)#History|Dutch penicillin research during WWII]].

==Education==
[[File:TU Delft buildings.jpg|thumb|TU Delft buildings]]
[[Delft University of Technology]] (TU Delft) is one of four universities of technology in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.4tu.nl/en/|title=4TU.Federation|website=4tu.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded as an academy for civil engineering in 1842 by [[William II of the Netherlands|King William II]]. Today well over 21,000 students are enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/feiten-en-cijfers/onderwijs/studentenpopulatie/|title=Studentenpopulatie|website=TU Delft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, providing postgraduate education for people from developing countries, draws on the strong tradition in [[water management]] and [[hydraulic engineering]] of the Delft university.

==Economy==
In the local economic field essential elements are:
* education; (amongst others [[Delft University of Technology]]) ({{As of|2017}} 21.651 students and 4.939 full-time employees),
* scientific research; (amongst others &quot;TNO&quot; [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]]),  Stichting Deltares, Nederlands Normalisatie-Instituut, [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for water education, [[Technopolis Innovation Park Delft|Technopolis Innovation Park]];
* tourism; (about one million registered visitors a year),
* industry; (DSM Gist Services BV,  ([[Delftware]]) earthenware production by [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles]], [[Exact Holding|Exact Software Nederland BV]], TOPdesk, Ampelmann)
* retail;  ([[IKEA]] (Inter IKEA Systems B.V., owner and worldwide franchisor of the IKEA Concept, is based in Delft), Makro, Eneco Energy NV).

==Nature and recreation==
[[File:Delft Plantagegeer.JPG|thumb|The ''Plantagegeer'', one of Delft's several smaller city parks]]
East of Delft lies a relatively large nature and recreation area called the &quot;Delftse Hout&quot; (&quot;Delft Wood&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Delftse_Hout|title=Category:Delftse Hout|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the forest lie bike, horse-riding and footpaths. It also includes a vast lake (suitable for swimming and windsurfing), narrow beaches, a restaurant, and community gardens, plus camping ground and other recreational and sports facilities. (There is also a facility for renting bikes from the station.)

Inside the city, apart from a central park, there are several smaller town parks, including &quot;Nieuwe Plantage&quot;, &quot;Agnetapark&quot;, &quot;Kalverbos&quot;.
There is also the [[Botanical Garden]] of the TU and an [[arboretum]] in Delftse Hout.
