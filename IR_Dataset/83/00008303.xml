In Down syndrome, AMKL is typically preceded by [[transient myeloproliferative disease]] (TMD), a disorder of [[Haematopoiesis|blood cell production]] in which non-cancerous megakaryoblasts with a mutation in the ''[[GATA1]]'' gene rapidly divide during the later period of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=See2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25956670&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tamblyn JA, Norton A, Spurgeon L, Donovan V, Bedford Russell A, Bonnici J, Perkins K, Vyas P, Roberts I, Kilby MD | title = Prenatal therapy in transient abnormal myelopoiesis: a systematic review | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = F67–71 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 25956670 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2014-308004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition affects 3–10% of babies with Down.&lt;ref name=See2012/&gt; While it often spontaneously resolves within three months of birth, it can cause serious blood, liver, or other complications.&lt;ref name=Gam2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gamis|first=AS|author2=Smith, FO|title=Transient myeloproliferative disorder in children with Down syndrome: clarity to this enigmatic disorder.|journal=British Journal of Haematology|date=Nov 2012|volume=159|issue=3|pages=277–87|pmid=22966823|doi=10.1111/bjh.12041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 10% of cases, TMD progresses to AMKL during the three months to five years following its resolution.&lt;ref name=See2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gam2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid27510823&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatnagar N, Nizery L, Tunstall O, Vyas P, Roberts I | title = Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis and AML in Down Syndrome: an Update | journal = Current Hematologic Malignancy Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 333–41 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27510823 | pmc = 5031718 | doi = 10.1007/s11899-016-0338-x | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with DS have a lower risk of all major solid cancers including those of lung, breast, cervix, with the lowest relative rates occurring in those aged 50 years or older.&lt;ref name=Nix2018/&gt; This low risk is thought due to an increase in the expression of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s present on chromosome 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cancer genome and tumor microenvironment|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-0711-0|page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3Lb9Mxl4qcC&amp;pg=PA203|edition=Online-Ausg.|editor=Andrei Thomas-Tikhonenko|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704142502/https://books.google.com/books?id=x3Lb9Mxl4qcC&amp;pg=PA203|archivedate=2015-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nix2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nixon DW | title = Down Syndrome, Obesity, Alzheimer's Disease, and Cancer: A Brief Review and Hypothesis | journal = Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | page = 53| date = March 2018 | pmid = 29587359 | pmc = 5924389 | doi = 10.3390/brainsci8040053 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One exception is testicular [[Germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]] which occurs at a higher rate in DS.&lt;ref name=Nix2018/&gt;

==Cause==
{{Main|Genetics of Down syndrome}}
[[File:Down Syndrome Karyotype.png|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Karyotype]] for trisomy Down syndrome: notice the three copies of chromosome 21]]
Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of the [[gene]]s on [[chromosome 21]], rather than the usual two.&lt;ref name=Patt2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lana2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lana-Elola|first=E|author2=Watson-Scales, SD |author3=Fisher, EM |author4= Tybulewicz, VL |title=Down syndrome: searching for the genetic culprits|journal=Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms|date=Sep 2011|volume=4|issue=5|pages=586–95|pmid=21878459 |doi=10.1242/dmm.008078 |pmc=3180222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal.&lt;ref name=Steph2010/&gt; Those who have one child with Down syndrome have about a 1% risk of having a second child with the syndrome, if both parents are found to have normal [[karyotype]]s.&lt;ref name=Nel2010/&gt;

The extra chromosome content can arise through several different ways. The most common cause (about 92–95% of cases) is a complete extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in [[trisomy]] 21.&lt;ref name=Rubin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/DownSyndrome.html |title=CDC—Birth Defects, Down Syndrome—NCBDDD |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2013-11-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728031507/https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/DownSyndrome.html |archivedate=2017-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1.0 to 2.5% of cases, some of the cells in the body are normal and others have trisomy 21, known as [[mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] Down syndrome.&lt;ref name=Nel2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treatment &amp; prognosis in pediatrics.|year=2013|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Medical P|isbn=978-93-5090-428-2|page=391|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlR5jdVkm8kC&amp;pg=PA391|author=Kausik Mandal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123082941/https://books.google.com/books?id=LlR5jdVkm8kC&amp;pg=PA391|archivedate=2017-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other common mechanisms that can give rise to Down syndrome include: a [[Robertsonian translocation]], [[isochromosome]], or [[ring chromosome]].

==Mechanism==
The extra genetic material present in DS results in overexpression of a portion of the 310 genes located on chromosome 21.&lt;ref name=Lana2011/&gt; This overexpression has been estimated at around 50%, due to the third copy of the chromosome present.&lt;ref name=Nel2010/&gt; Some research has suggested the Down syndrome critical region is located at bands 21q22.1–q22.3,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/943216-overview |title=Genetics of Down syndrome |accessdate=2011-05-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527214124/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/943216-overview |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with this area including genes for [[Amyloid precursor protein|amyloid]], [[superoxide dismutase]], and likely the [[ETS2]] proto [[oncogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Current diagnosis &amp; treatment psychiatry|year=2008|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-142292-5|pages=Chapter 3|edition=2nd|editor=Michael H.

The dementia that occurs in Down syndrome is due to an excess of [[amyloid beta]] [[peptide]] produced in the brain and is similar to [[Alzheimer's disease]], which also involves amyloid beta build-up.&lt;ref name=Wek2013/&gt; Amyloid beta is processed from [[amyloid precursor protein]], the gene for which is located on chromosome 21.&lt;ref name=Wek2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weksler|first=ME|author2=Szabo, P |author3=Relkin, NR |author4=Reidenberg, MM |author5=Weksler, BB |author6= Coppus, AM |title=Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome: treating two paths to dementia|journal=Autoimmunity Reviews|date=Apr 2013|volume=12|issue=6|pages=670–73|pmid=23201920|doi=10.1016/j.autrev.2012.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senile plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s are present in nearly all by 35&amp;nbsp;years of age, though dementia may not be present.&lt;ref name=Steph2010/&gt; Those with DS also lack a normal number of [[lymphocytes]] and produce less [[antibody|antibodies]] which contributes to their increased risk of infection.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

===Epigenetics===
Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age such as Alzheimer's disease. The accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues, but molecular evidence for this hypothesis is sparse. According to a biomarker of tissue age known as [[epigenetic clock]], trisomy 21 increases the age of blood and brain tissue (on average by 6.6 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;Horvath2015DownSyndrome&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Accelerated epigenetic aging in Down syndrome.| journal = [[Aging Cell]]| volume = 14| issue = 3| year = 2015| pmid = 25678027| pmc = 4406678| vauthors = Horvath S, Garagnani P, Bacalini MG, Pirazzini C, Salvioli S, Gentilini D, Di Blasio AM, Giuliani C, Tung S, Vinters HV, Franceschi C| doi = 10.1111/acel.12325| pages = 491–95| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150516152126/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12325/epdf| archivedate = 2015-05-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Before birth===
When screening tests predict a high risk of Down syndrome, a more invasive diagnostic test ([[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]]) is needed to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt; The false-positive rate with screening is about 2–5% (see section [[Down syndrome#Screening|Screening]] below).&lt;ref name=Can2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Canick|first=J|title=Prenatal screening for trisomy 21: recent advances and guidelines|journal=Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine|date=Jun 2012|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1003–08|pmid=21790505|doi=10.1515/cclm.2011.671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are more reliable tests, but they increase the risk of [[miscarriage]] between 0.5 and 1%.&lt;ref name=Tab2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tabor|first=A|author2=Alfirevic, Z|title=Update on procedure-related risks for prenatal diagnosis techniques.|journal=Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy|year=2010|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–7|pmid=20051662|doi=10.1159/000271995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of limb problems may be increased in the offspring if chorionic villus sampling is performed before 10 weeks.&lt;ref name=Tab2010/&gt; The risk from the procedure is greater the earlier it is performed, thus amniocentesis is not recommended before 15 weeks gestational age and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks gestational age.&lt;ref name=Tab2010/&gt;

===Abortion rates===
About 92% of pregnancies in Europe with a diagnosis of Down syndrome are terminated.&lt;ref name=Mans1999/&gt; As a result, there are almost no people with Down's in [[Iceland]] and [[Denmark]], where screening is commonplace.&lt;ref name=Slate2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/05/how-down-syndrome-is-redefining-the-abortion-debate.html|title=How Down Syndrome Is Redefining the Abortion Debate|last=Graham|first=Ruth|date=2018-05-31|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the termination rate after diagnosis is around 75%,&lt;ref name=Slate2018/&gt; but varies from 61% to 93% depending on the population surveyed.&lt;ref name=Nat2012/&gt; Rates are lower among women who are younger and have decreased over time.&lt;ref name=Nat2012/&gt; When nonpregnant people are asked if they would have a termination if their fetus tested positive, 23–33% said yes, when high-risk pregnant women were asked, 46–86% said yes, and when women who screened positive are asked, 89–97% say yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=H |author2=Van Riper, M |author3=Thoyre, S|title=Decision making following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome: an integrative review|journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health|date=Mar–Apr 2012|volume=57|issue=2|pages=156–64|pmid=22432488|doi=10.1111/j.1542-2011.2011.00109.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After birth===
The diagnosis can often be suspected based on the child's physical appearance at birth.&lt;ref name=Nelson2011/&gt; An analysis of the child's chromosomes is needed to confirm the diagnosis, and to determine if a [[Chromosomal translocation|translocation]] is present, as this may help determine the risk of the child's parents having further children with Down syndrome.&lt;ref name=Nelson2011/&gt; Parents generally wish to know the possible diagnosis once it is suspected and do not wish pity.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

===Screening===
Guidelines recommend screening for Down syndrome to be offered to all pregnant women, regardless of age.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CG62: Antenatal care |url=http://publications.nice.org.uk/antenatal-care-cg62 |publisher=London: National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |accessdate=16 February 2013 |author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126165543/http://publications.nice.org.uk/antenatal-care-cg62 |archivedate=26 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of tests are used, with varying levels of accuracy. They are typically used in combination to increase the detection rate.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; None can be definitive, thus if screening is positive, either [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]] is required to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt; Screening in both the first and second trimesters is better than just screening in the first trimester.&lt;ref name=ACOG2007/&gt; The different screening techniques in use are able to pick up 90–95% of cases, with a false-positive rate of 2–5%.&lt;ref name=Can2012/&gt; If Down syndrome occurs in one in 500 pregnancies and the test used has a 5% false-positive rate, this means, of 26 women who test positive on screening, only one will have Down syndrome confirmed.&lt;ref name=Can2012/&gt; If the screening test has a 2% false-positive rate, this means one of eleven who test positive on screening have a fetus with DS.&lt;ref name=Can2012/&gt;

==Management==
Efforts such as [[early childhood intervention]], screening for common problems, medical treatment where indicated, a good family environment, and work-related training can improve the development of children with Down syndrome.

A number of health organizations have issued recommendations for [[screening (medicine)|screening]] those with Down syndrome for particular diseases.&lt;ref name=Bull2011/&gt; This is recommended to be done systematically.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt;

At birth, all children should get an [[electrocardiogram]] and [[echocardiogram|ultrasound of the heart]].&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; Surgical repair of heart problems may be required as early as three months of age.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; [[Heart valve]] problems may occur in young adults, and further ultrasound evaluation may be needed in adolescents and in early adulthood.&lt;ref name=Hick2012/&gt; Due to the elevated risk of testicular cancer, some recommend checking the person's testicles yearly.&lt;ref name=Malt2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- School  --&gt;
Education programs before reaching school age may be useful.&lt;ref name=Wei2010/&gt; School-age children with Down syndrome may benefit from [[inclusive education]] (whereby students of differing abilities are placed in classes with their peers of the same age), provided some adjustments are made to the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inclusion: Educating Students with Down Syndrome with Their Non-Disabled Peers|url=http://www.kcdsg.org/files/content/Educating%20Students%20with%20Down%20Syndrome%20With%20Their%20Typical%20Peers.pdf|publisher=National Down Syndrome Society|accessdate=5 February 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127111652/http://www.kcdsg.org/files/content/Educating%20Students%20with%20Down%20Syndrome%20With%20Their%20Typical%20Peers.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence to support this, however, is not very strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=G|title=Educational psychology and the effectiveness of inclusive education/mainstreaming|journal=The British Journal of Educational Psychology|date=Mar 2007|volume=77|issue=Pt 1|pages=1–24|pmid=17411485|doi=10.1348/000709906x156881|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f09fc7b9e7af16a55f2ef4f9d6c4dc6b473bfde}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] of 1975 requires public schools generally to allow attendance by students with Down syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New|first=Rebecca S.|title=Early childhood education an international encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-01448-2|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JulOlhMP3JAC&amp;pg=PA305|author2=Cochran, Moncrieff|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123083030/https://books.google.com/books?id=JulOlhMP3JAC&amp;pg=PA305|archivedate=2017-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Early Intervention&amp;nbsp;Therapies  --&gt;
Individuals with Down syndrome may learn better visually. Drawing may help with language, speech, and reading skills.

Efforts to develop motor skills include physical therapy, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy.

In the 20th century, many individuals with Down syndrome were institutionalized, few of the associated medical problems were treated, and most died in infancy or early adult life. With the rise of the [[eugenics movement]], 33 of the then 48 [[U.S. state]]s and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability.

==Other animals==
Down syndrome may also occur in animals other than humans. In [[great apes]] chromosome 22 corresponds to the human chromosome 21 and thus trisomy 22 causes Down syndrome in apes. The condition was observed in a [[common chimpanzee]] in 1969 and a [[Bornean orangutan]] in 1979, but neither lived very long. The common chimpanzee Kanako (born around 1993, in Japan) has become the longest-lived known example of this condition. Kanako has some of the same symptoms that are common in human Down syndrome. It is unknown how common this condition is in chimps but it is plausible it could be roughly as common as Down syndrome is in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hirata |first1=S |last2=Hirai |first2=H |last3=Nogami |first3=E |last4=Morimura |first4=N |last5=Udono |first5=T |title=Chimpanzee Down syndrome: a case study of trisomy 22 in a captive chimpanzee. |journal=Primates; Journal of Primatology |date=April 2017 |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=267–273 |doi=10.1007/s10329-017-0597-8 |pmid=28220267|hdl=2433/228259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Second case of 'Down syndrome' in chimpanzees identified in Japan |url=https://www.upi.com/Second-case-of-Down-syndrome-in-chimpanzees-identified-in-Japan/3991487709938/ |website=UPI |accessdate=11 May 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
