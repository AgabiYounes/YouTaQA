'''Drag racing''' is a type of [[motor racing]] in which [[automobile]]s or [[motorcycle]]s (usually specially prepared for the purpose) compete, usually two at a time, to be first to cross a set finish line. The race follows a short, straight course from a [[standing start]] over a measured distance, most commonly {{convert|1/4|mi|ft  m|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, with a shorter ({{convert|1,000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) becoming increasingly popular, as it has become the standard for [[Top Fuel]] [[Dragster (car)|dragsters]] and [[funny car]]s, where some major bracket races and other sanctioning bodies have adopted it as the standard, while the {{convert|1/8|mi|ft m|0|abbr=on}} is also popular in some circles. Electronic timing and speed sensing systems have been used to record race results since the 1960s.

The history of automobiles and motorcycles being used for drag racing is nearly as long as the history of motorized vehicles themselves, and has taken the form of both illegal [[street racing]], and as an organized and regulated [[motorsport]].

==Basics of drag racing==

===Starting===
Push starts to get engines running were necessary until the [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) mandated self-starters in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHRA.com&quot;&gt;Burgess, Phil, ''National Dragster'' editor.  &quot;Obsolete skills, part 1: On the track&quot;, at [https://www.nhra.com/news/2008/obsolete-skills-part-1-track  NHRA.com] (retrieved 22 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; After burnouts, cars would be pushed back by crews; this persisted until NHRA required reversing systems in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHRA.com&quot;/&gt; [[Don Garlits]] was the first to do burnouts across the starting line, which is now standard practise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drag Illustrated&quot;&gt;Tocher, Ian. &quot;‘Big Daddy’ Describes Birth of the Burnout&quot;, published 18  March 2018, at [https://dragillustrated.com/big-daddy-describes-birth-of-the-burnout/ ''Drag Illustrated''] (retrieved 23 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Each driver then backs up to and stages at the starting line.

===Prerace preparations===
Before each race (commonly known as a pass), each driver is allowed to perform a [[burnout (vehicle)|burnout]], which heats the driving tires and lays rubber down at the beginning of the track, improving traction. The cars run through a &quot;water box&quot; (formerly a &quot;bleach box&quot;, before bleach was replaced by flammable traction compound, which produced spectacular, and dangerous, flame burnouts; the hazard led NHRA to mandate use of water in the 1970s&lt;ref name=&quot;Drag Illustrated&quot;/&gt;).

Modern races are started electronically by a system known as a ''[[Christmas tree (drag racing)|Christmas tree]]'', which consists of a column of lights for each driver/lane, and two light beam sensors per lane on the track at the starting line. Current NHRA trees, for example, feature one blue light (split into halves), then three amber, one green, and one red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhra.com/story/2011/4/12/new-tree-implemented-for-visitmyrtlebeachcom-nhra-four-wide-nationals/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420065503/http://www.nhra.com/story/2011/4/12/new-tree-implemented-for-visitmyrtlebeachcom-nhra-four-wide-nationals/ |archivedate=2011-04-20 }} New Tree implemented for NHRA VisitMyrtleBeach.com Four-Wide Nationals&lt;/ref&gt; When the first light beam is broken by a vehicle's front tire(s), the vehicle is &quot;pre-staged&quot; (approximately {{convert|7|in|mm}} from the starting line), and the pre-stage indicator on the tree is lit. When the second light beam is broken, the vehicle is &quot;staged&quot;, and the stage indicator on the tree is lit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhra.com/nhra101/basics.aspx NHRA.com] Basics of Drag Racing&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicles may then leave the pre-stage beam, but must remain in the stage beam until the race starts.

===Staging===
Once one competitor is staged, their opponent has a set amount of time to stage or they will be instantly disqualified, indicated by a red light on the tree. Otherwise, once both drivers are staged, the system chooses a short delay at random (to prevent a driver being able to anticipate the start), then starts the race. The light sequence at this point varies slightly. For example, in NHRA Professional classes, three amber lights on the tree flash simultaneously, followed 0.4 seconds later by a green light (this is also known as a &quot;pro tree&quot;). In NHRA Sportsman classes, the amber lights illuminate in sequence from top to bottom, 0.5 seconds apart, followed 0.5 seconds later by the green light (this is also known as a &quot;sportsman tree&quot; or &quot;full tree&quot;). If a vehicle leaves the starting line before the green light illuminates, the red light for that lane illuminates instead, and the driver is disqualified (also known as ''red lighting''). In a handicap start, the green light automatically lights up for the first driver, and the red light is only lit in the proper lane after both cars have launched if one driver leaves early, or if both drivers left early, the driver whose reaction time is worse (if one lane has a -.015 and the other lane has a -.022, the lane of the driver who committed a 0.022 is given the red light after both cars have left), as a red light infraction is only assessed to the driver with the worse infraction, if both drivers leave early. Even if both drivers leave early, the green light is automatically lit for the driver that left last, and they still may win the pass (as in the 2014 NHRA Auto Club Pro Stock final, [[Erica Enders-Stevens]] and [[Jason Line]] both committed red light infractions; only Line was assessed with a red light, as he was -.011 versus Enders-Stevens' -.002).

===Measurements===
Several measurements are taken for each race: reaction time, elapsed time, and speed. Reaction time is the period from the green light illuminating to the vehicle leaving the staging beams or breaking the guard beam. Elapsed time is the period from the vehicle leaving the starting line to crossing the finish line. Speed is measured through a [[speed trap]] covering the final {{convert|66|ft|m}} to the finish line, indicating average speed of the vehicle in that distance.

Except where a breakout rule is in place, the winner is the first vehicle to cross the finish line, and therefore the driver with the lowest combined reaction time and elapsed time. Because these times are measured separately, a driver with a slower elapsed time can actually win if that driver's advantage in reaction time exceeds the elapsed time difference. In heads-up racing, this is known as a ''[[holeshot]] win''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhra.com/glossary.aspx|title=NHRA Glossary|publisher=NHRA|accessdate=August 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903044153/http://www.nhra.com/glossary.aspx|archivedate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In categories where a breakout rule is in effect (for example, NHRA Junior Dragster, Super Comp, Super Gas, Super Stock, and Stock classes, as well as some dial-in classes), if a competitor is faster than his or her predetermined time (a &quot;breakout&quot;), that competitor loses. If both competitors are faster than their predetermined times, the competitor who breaks out by less time wins. Regardless, a red light foul is worse than a breakout, except in Junior Dragster where exceeding the absolute limit is a cause for disqualification.

===Bracket system===
Most race events use a traditional [[Bracket (tournament)|bracket]] system, where the losing car and driver are eliminated from the event while the winner advances to the next round, until a champion is crowned. Events can range from 16 to over 100 car brackets. Drivers are typically [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] by elapsed times in qualifying.  In bracket racing without a breakout (such as NHRA Competition Eliminator), pairings are based on times compared to their index (faster than index for class is better). In bracket racing with a breakout (Stock, Super Stock, but also the NHRA's Super classes), the closest to the index is favourable.

A popular alternative to the standard eliminations format is the Chicago Style format (also called the Three Round format in Australia), named for the US 30 Dragstrip in suburban [[Gary, Indiana]] where a midweek meet featured this format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.competitionplus.com/drag-racing/news/14381-chicago-once-a-funny-car-heaven|title=Encore Feature: Chicago Once a Funny Car Heaven|publisher=Competition Plus|accessdate=March 21, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506094925/http://www.competitionplus.com/drag-racing/news/14381-chicago-once-a-funny-car-heaven|archivedate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All entered cars participate in one qualifying round, and then are paired for the elimination round. The two fastest times among winners from this round participate in the championship round. Depending on the organisation, the next two fastest times may play for third, then fifth, and so forth, in consolation rounds. Currently, an IHRA 400 Thunder championship race in Australia uses the format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andra.com.au/latest-news/group-1/1730-revolutionary-new-event-format-promises-easter-thrills-at-willowbank-racewa.html|title=Revolutionary new event format promises Easter thrills at Willowbank Raceway|publisher=Australian National Drag Racing Association|accessdate=March 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distances===
The standard distance of a drag race is 1,320 feet, 402 m, or 1/4 mile. However, due to safety concerns, certain sanctioning bodies (notably the NHRA for its Top Fuel and Funny Car classes) have shortened races to 1,000 feet. Some drag strips are even shorter and run 660 feet, 201 m, or 1/8 mile. The 1,000 foot distance is now also popular with bracket racing, especially in meets where there are 1/8 mile cars and 1/4 mile cars racing together, and is used by the revived American Drag Racing League for its primary classes (not Jr Dragster). Some organisations that deal with Pro Modified and &quot;Mountain Motor&quot; Pro Stock cars (Professional Drag Racers Association) use the 1/8 mile distance, even if the tracks are 1/4 mile tracks.

===North America===
The [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) oversees the majority of drag racing events in North America. The next largest organization is the [[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA). Nearly all drag strips are associated with one sanctioning body or the other.

Besides NHRA and IHRA, there are niche organizations for muscle cars and nostalgia vehicles. The Nostalgia Drag Racing League (NDRL) based in Brownsburg, IN, runs a series of 1/4 mile (402m) drag races in the Midwest for 1979 and older nostalgic appearing cars, with four classes of competition running in an index system. Pro 7.0 and Pro 7.50 run heads up 200 mile per hour (320 kilometre per hour) passes, while Pro Comp and Pro Gas run 8.0 to 10.0 indices. NDRL competition vehicles typically include Front Engine Dragsters, Altereds, Funny Cars, early Pro Stock clones, Super Stocks and Gassers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDRL Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullin|title=NDRL - Nostalgia Drag Racing League|url=http://www.nostalgiadragleague.com|accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Electric Drag Racing Association]] (NEDRA) races [[electric vehicle]]s against high performance gasoline-powered vehicles such as [[Dodge Vipers]] or classic [[muscle car]]s in 1/4 and 1/8&amp;nbsp;mile (402m &amp; 201m) races. The current [[electric drag racing]] record is &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedra.com/200mph_club.html |title=National Electric Drag Racing Association - Roger Hedlund 200 mph Club |publisher=Nedra.com |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2019-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6.940 seconds at 201.37&amp;nbsp;mph (324.0736 km/h) for a quarter mile (402m). Another niche organization is the VWDRC which run a VW-only championship with vehicles running under 7 seconds.

Prior to the founding of the NHRA and IHRA, smaller organizations sanctioned drag racing in the early years, which included the competing [[American Hot Rod Association|AHRA]] in the United States from 1955 to 2005.

===Australia===
{{Expand section|date=August 2012}}
The first Australian Nationals event was run in 1965 at Riverside raceway, near Melbourne. The Australian National Drag Racing Association ([[Australian National Drag Racing Association|ANDRA]]) was established in 1973, and today they claim they are the &quot;best in the world outside the United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;andra&quot;&gt;[http://www.andra.com.au/subpage.asp?Menu=6&amp;Page=History Australian National Drag Racing Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018144233/http://andra.com.au/subpage.asp?Page=History&amp;Menu=6 |date=2009-10-18 }} ANDRA History&lt;/ref&gt; ANDRA sanctions races throughout Australia and throughout the year at all levels, from Junior Dragster to [[Top Fuel]].

The ANDRA Drag Racing Series is for professional drivers and riders and includes [[Top Fuel]], Top Alcohol, [[Top Doorslammer]] (similar to the USA Pro Modified class), Pro Stock (using 400 cubic inch engines (6.5 litres)), Top Bike and Pro Stock Motorcycle.

The Summit Sportsman Series is for ANDRA sportsman drivers and riders and includes Competition, Super Stock, Super Compact, Competition Bike, Supercharged Outlaws, Top Sportsman, Modified, Super Sedan, Modified Bike, Super Street and Junior Dragster.

In 2015, after a dispute with ANDRA, Sydney Dragway, Willowbank Raceway and the Perth Motorplex invited the [[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA) to sanction events at their tracks. Since then the Perth Motorplex has reverted to an ANDRA sanction and Springmount Raceway has embraced the IHRA umbrella. The 400 Thunder Series now attracts professional racers to its races at Sydney Dragway and Willowbank Raceway and is the premiere series in Australia.

Communications provider OVO Mobile provides a live stream of all 400 Thunder Australian Professional Drag Racing Series events to fans globally. The 400 Thunder Series is aired on SBS Speedweek.

Drag racing was imported to Europe by American NATO troops during the Cold War.&lt;ref name=&quot;francedrag&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fpromotop.org%2Ffrancedrag%2Fmodules%2Fnews%2F |title=History |publisher=francedrag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Races were held in West Germany beginning in the 1960s at the airbases at [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]] and Sembach&lt;ref name=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?langpair=auto%7Cen&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dragracinghistory.de%2Fcontents%2Fhistory1949.html |title=Drag racing history in Germany |publisher=dragracinghistory.de }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the UK at various airstrips and racing circuits&lt;ref name=&quot;uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trakbytes.co.uk/6064.html|title=UK drag racing history 1960-1964|publisher=www.trakbytes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the opening of Europe's first permanent drag strip at [[Santa Pod Raceway]] in 1966.

The [[FIA]] organises a Europe-wide four wheeled championship for the Top Fuel, Top Methanol Dragster, Top Methanol Funny Car, Pro Modified and Pro Stock classes. [[Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM Europe]] organises a similar championship for bike classes. In addition, championships are run for sportsman classes in many countries throughout Europe by the various national motorsport governing bodies.

===New Zealand===
Drag racing in New Zealand started in the 1960s. The New Zealand Hot Rod Association (NZHRA) sanctioned what is believed to have been the first drag meeting at an open cut coal mine at Kopuku, south of Auckland, sometime in 1966. In 1973, the first and only purpose built drag strip opened in Meremere by the Pukekohe Hot Rod Club. In April 1993 the governance of drag racing was separated from the NZHRA and the New Zealand Drag Racing Association (NZDRA) was formed. In 2014, New Zealand's second purpose built drag strip – Masterton Motorplex – opened.

The first New Zealand Drag Racing Nationals was held in the 1966/67 season at Kopuku, near Auckland.

There are now two governing bodies operating drag racing in New Zealand with the Florida-based [[International Hot Rod Association]] sanctioning both of New Zealands major tracks at Ruapuna ([http://www.pbdrc.co.nz/ Pegasus Bay Drag Racing Association]) in the South Island and [http://www.dragway.co.nz/ Meremere Dragway Inc] in the North Island. However, the official ASN of the sport, per FIA regulations, is the New Zealand Drag Racing Association.

===South America===

Many countries in South America race 200 meters, unlike in the United States and Australia, where 400 meters or 1/4 mile is typical.

===South Asia===
{{cleanup section|reason=language / style, ref formatting etc.|date=October 2019}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Organized drag racing is rapidly growing in [[India]]. The country's first drag race meet was organized by ''Autocar India'' in Mumbai in 2002. Since then there have been many drag racing events in India. The most popular event is Elite Octanes' Valley Run which is held at Ambey Valley air strip in [[Lonavla|Loanavla]] every year. 

The biggest drag series event was organized by India Speed Week with three different locations around India. After the series two riders were chosen to represent the country 2017 initiative to bring 11 times world drag racing champion Rickey Gadson to India. The initiative was executed during the Valley Run 2017 event, which gave the participants a platform to perform at the highest level globally. Rickey Gadson, as an extension of the initiative invited two of the top performing drag racers to visit USA to train and get an opportunity to represent India at the World Finals of drag racing held on 16-18 November 2018 in [[Valdosta, Georgia|Valdosta]] GA, USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;autocarindia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autocarindia.com/motor-sports-news/indian-riders-to-compete-in-world-finals-of-motorcycle-drag-racing-410209|title=Indian riders to compete in World Finals of Motorcycle Drag Racing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dragbike.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dragbike.com/man-cup-indian-riders-to-compete-at-world-finals/|title=Man Cup: Indian Riders to Compete in World Finals}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result the two riders performed in their maiden event outside India. Also during the event, Amit Sharma, the fastest drag racer in Indian drag racing history, produced a time slip of 8.87 sec's – the fastest ever by any Indian.&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060409/asp/look/story_6060932.asp ''The Telegraph'', [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], &quot;Men in Drag&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag racing is also gaining popularity in [[Pakistan]], with private organizations sponsoring such events. The [[Bahria Town]] [[Public housing|housing project]] recently organized a drag racing event in [[Rawalpindi]] with the help of some of the country's best drivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan&quot;&gt;

[[Sri Lanka]] has seen an immense growth in drag racing due to legal meets held by the Ceylon Motor Sports Club, an FIA sanctioned body. In recent years, exotic cars and Japanese power houses have been taking part in these popular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/2014/08/13/cmsc-slaf-drag-race-on-24-august/|title=CMSC – SLAF Drag Race on 24 August|accessdate=17 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426003046/http://www.ft.lk/2014/08/13/cmsc-slaf-drag-race-on-24-august/|archivedate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Drag racing is an established sport in South Africa, with a number of strips around the country including [[Tarlton International Raceway]] and ODI Raceway. Drag racing is controlled by Motorsport South Africa and all drivers are required to hold a valid Motorsport South Africa license.&lt;ref name=&quot;msa2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 MSA Drag Racing Handbook|url=http://www.tarltonrace.com/2010/2010%20MSA%20Drag%20Racing%20Rulebook.pdf|accessdate=31 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203231846/http://www.tarltonrace.com/2010/2010%20MSA%20Drag%20Racing%20Rulebook.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drivers can compete in a number of categories including Top Eliminator, Senior Eliminator, Super Competition Eliminator, Competition Eliminator, Pro Street Bikes, Superbike Eliminator, Supersport Shootout (motorcycle), Street Modified, and Factory Stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;msa2010&quot;/&gt;

==Classes==
[[Image:Caterpiller-sponsored dragster.jpg|thumb|right|Caterpillar-sponsored dragster. Note wide slicks and high-mounted wing, to assist traction.]]

There are hundreds of classes in drag racing, each with different requirements and restrictions on things such as weight, engine size, body style, modifications, and many others. [[NHRA]] and [[International Hot Rod Association|IHRA]] share some of these classes, but many are solely used by one sanctioning body or the other. The NHRA boasts over 200 classes, while the IHRA has fewer. Some IHRA classes have multiple sub-classes in them to differentiate by engine components and other features. There is even a class for aspiring youngsters, [[Junior Dragster]], which typically uses an eighth-mile track, also favored by VW racers.

In 1997, the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] (cars) and [[Union Européenne de Motocyclisme|UEM]] (bikes) began sanctioning drag racing in Europe with a fully established European Drag Racing Championship, in cooperation (and rules compliance) with NHRA. The major European drag strips include Santa Pod Raceway in Podington, England; Alastaro Circuit, Finland; [[Mantorp Park]], Sweden; Gardermoen Raceway, Norway and the [[Hockenheimring]] in Germany.

[[Image:'Pain Killer' jr. dragster.JPG|thumb|''Pain Killer'' J/D. Note the driver, helmet off, is still in the car, which is under tow on the return road, headed for the pits.]]

There is a somewhat arbitrary definition of what constitutes a &quot;professional&quot; class. The NHRA includes 5 pro classes; Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, Pro Modified and Pro Stock Motorcycle. The FIA features a different set of 5 pro classes; Top Fuel, Top Methanol Dragster, Top Methanol Funny Car, Pro Modified and Pro Stock. Other sanctioning bodies have similarly different definitions. A partial list of classes includes:

[[File:Top Fuel.JPG|thumb|Top Fuel dragsters&lt;!--identify the cars &amp; place!--&gt;]]
* [[Top Fuel]] Dragster (TF/D). The dragsters, or &quot;diggers&quot;, are the fastest class. Among the fastest-accelerating machines in the world, these cars can cover the dragstrip in less than 3.7 seconds and record trap speeds over {{convert|330|mph|abbr=on}}. Under current rules, Modern Top Fuel dragsters are {{convert|25|ft|abbr=on}} long and weigh {{convert|2,320|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;!--under current rules...--&gt; in race-ready trim. Methanol mixed with up to 90% [[nitromethane]] is used as fuel.

 [[File:Funny Car AAA.JPG|thumb|Typical Funny Cars&lt;!--identify the cars &amp; place! Are these actual TF/FCs?--&gt;]]
* Top Fuel [[Funny Car]] (TF/FC) Similar to their dragster counterparts but with a shorter wheelbase and a carbon-fiber body that loosely resembles a production-based automobile, Funny Cars, or “floppers,” routinely run in the 4.0s and can exceed 315&amp;nbsp;mph.  In 2017 NHRA driver [[Robert Hight]] ran a career best ET. 3.793 and speed of 339.87&amp;nbsp;mph.

[[File:Pro Stock.JPG|thumb|A typical Pro Stock car.&lt;!--identify the car &amp; place!--&gt;]]
* [[Pro Stock]] (NHRA, IHRA/MMPSA) Often called “factory hot rods” because of their resemblance to production-based cars (and because they must maintain a relatively stock appearance), and commonly known as  &quot;doorslammers&quot;, Pro Stockers can record quarter-mile times in the 6.4 second range, and speeds over {{convert|210|mph|abbr=on}}. They can rev to more than 10,500 rpm and make in excess of {{convert|1300|hp|abbr=on}}. NHRA engines can be no more than {{convert|500|cuin|L|adj=on}} [[Engine displacement|displacement]] while MMPSA cars can run a maximum of {{convert|820|cuin|L}} (called &quot;Mountain Motors&quot;).  IHRA engines can be no more than {{convert|400|cuin|L|adj=on}}.  Both classes require the motors to be naturally aspirated.
* [[Pro Stock Motorcycle]] (NHRA and IHRA) These highly modified vehicles, which can run under 6.8 seconds at more than 195&amp;nbsp;mph, feature a purpose-built tube chassis and a lightweight, aerodynamically enhanced replica of original bodywork.
* [[Pro Modified]] (Pro Mod).  Known as [[Top Doorslammer]] in Australia.  Some engine restrictions, very high power. Cars can run superchargers, turbochargers, or nitrous oxide. Cars running blowers are limited to {{convert|527|cuin|L|1}} while cars with nitrous can run up to {{convert|740|cuin|L}}.  This class is globally recognised, although the name differs between North America and Australia.
* [[Top Alcohol Dragster]] (TA/D). Known as Top Methanol Dragster in FIA competition. Top Alcohol Dragsters resemble Top Fuelers, but have significant differences. They may use a supercharged methanol-burning engine or an injected nitromethane combination. They can run in the 5.1s at more than 280&amp;nbsp;mph.
* [[Top Alcohol Funny Car]] (TA/FC). Known as Top Methanol Funny Car in FIA competition. Similar in physical appearance to their nitro-burning Funny Car counterparts, Top Alcohol Funny Cars are restricted to the use of methanol fuel and have three-speed transmissions. They can run in the 5.4s at more than 265&amp;nbsp;mph. In the IHRA, Alcohol Funny Car is the fifth pro category, replacing NHRA's Pro Stock Bike.

 [[File:Comp Eliminator.JPG|thumb|A typical Comp car.&lt;!--identify the car &amp; place!--&gt;]]
* [[Competition Eliminator]] This is the NHRA class with the most variety. Each of its 88 sections is assigned an index based on what a well-built car should run, and races are handicapped according to those indexes.
* [[Outlaw Series]]
* [[Pro FWD]]
* [[Sport Front-Wheel-Drive]] (SFWD) This is a class that is dedicated to solely front wheel drive vehicles. One of the motivations behind the creation of this class was to keep cars as original looking as they could possibly be. SFWD is one of the most common and popular import drag racing classes. The two most common vehicles in this class are the Honda Civic and the Acura Integra. In this class, the number one restriction is that each vehicle must retain its original chassis. No modification to the OEM floorboard or Firewall is permitted. In addition, at least one headlight and both brake lights must be fully functional. Suspension and brake modifications are allowed to a certain extent. Aftermarket components are permitted as long as the original mounting points are not modified. All four brakes must be retained and parachutes are permitted. The stock dashboard and windshield must be retained along with the car's original interior from the front seats forward, while rear seats as well as passenger-side seat may be removed. Racing gas or E85 may be used; methanol may not. Internal engine modifications of all types, aftermarket engine blocks, and engine swaps are permitted. Engines may use nitrous oxide or be turbocharged. Tires may be a maximum of {{convert|25|in|mm|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|9.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} in tread width. All cars must meet a minimum weight requirement of {{convert|2200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, plus any weight penalties teams may incur for having certain equipment installed that would have given them too much of an advantage over the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ogs1320.com/sfwd/ |title=SFWD rules |publisher=Ogs1320.com |date= |accessdate=2019-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1305-sport-front-wheel-drive-class-explained/ | title=Sport Front-Wheel-Drive Class Explained - Honda Tuning Magazine| date=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1305-sport-front-wheel-drive-class-explained/|title=Sport Front-Wheel-Drive Class Explained - Honda Tuning Magazine|date=2013-06-23|work=SuperStreetOnline|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Stick Shift]] Reserved for vehicles with a [[Manual transmission]]. The rising popularity of automatic transmissions in drag racing created the demand for these classes. Popular sanctioning bodies include United Manual Transmission Racers, Pro Stick Racing, Rocky Mountain Stick Shifters, and Ozark Mountain Super Shifters.
* [[Super Comp]]/[[Quick Rod]] The quickest of the heads-up Super classes (8.90 index) is composed primarily of dragsters. Most cars are capable of running well under the index but use electronic aids to run close to it without breaking out.

 [[File:Super Gas Probe.JPG|thumb|Super Gas Probe.&lt;!--identify the car &amp; place!--&gt;]]
* [[Super Gas]]/[[Super Rod]] Super Gas entries, which run on a 9.90 index, are primarily full-bodied cars and street roadsters. No dragsters or altereds are permitted. As in Super Comp, competitors use electronic aids to run as close to the class standard without going under.
* [[Super Street]]/[[Hot Rod (drag racing class)|Hot Rod]] Racers compete on a fixed 10.90 index. All vehicles must be full-bodied cars and weigh no less than 2,800 pounds except for six-cylinder cars (2,000) and four-cylinder and rotary-powered cars (1,200). Engine and chassis modifications are virtually unlimited.

[[File:Super Street Mustang.JPG|thumb|Super Street Mustang]]
 [[File:Super Stock.JPG|thumb|A typical Super Stock car&lt;!--identify the car &amp; place!--&gt;]]
* [[Super Stock]] Super Stock vehicles resemble ordinary passenger cars, but are actually heavily modified. Entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower and compete on indexes. The breakout rule is enforced.
* [[Stock (drag racing class)|Stock]] Stock cars are similar to Super Stockers, but rules regarding everything from engine modifications to body alterations are much stricter. Virtually any car is eligible to compete, and entries are classified using factory shipping weight and horsepower.
* [[Sport Compact]]
* Top Sportsman (NHRA, IHRA, ANDRA) Competitors in these full-bodied entries may choose their own dial-in for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.99 seconds. Full Tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}.

 [[File:Top Dragster.JPG|thumb|Blown Top Dragster{{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=alky, gas, or fuel?}}&lt;!--identify the cars &amp; place!--&gt;]]
* Top Dragster (T/D) (NHRA, IHRA, ANDRA) Competitors in these open-wheel entries may choose their own dial-in for eliminations, generally from 6.00 to 7.70 seconds. Full tree starts are used, and the breakout rule is enforced. Cars can run in the sixes at more than {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}. Cars can run any combination of motor: blown, turbo, nitrous or just all motor.
* Top Fuel Funny Bike (high performance 5 second bikes)
* [[Nostalgia Super Stock]]
* NHRA and ANDRA [[Summit Racing]] series Super Pro, Pro, and bike.
* Junior Dragster (racers between the ages of 8 and 18 may race a half scale version of the sport's fastest car, Top Fuel Dragster. Juniors run as follows: 12.90-slower for 8-9&amp;nbsp;year olds, 10-12&amp;nbsp;year olds at 8.90, and 13-18&amp;nbsp;year olds 7.90 and slower at a top speed of 85&amp;nbsp;mph).  These cars race at 1/8 mile or 1/16 mile.
* NHRA new class for Juniors is JR COMP running 6.90s at a top speed of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h}} (1/8 mile or 1/16 mile).
A complete listing of all classes can be found on the respective NHRA and IHRA official websites.

[[Image:Dragster engine.jpg|thumb|left|Dragster engine with dual-plug heads, dual ignition magnetos, and intake snorkel]]

The UEM also has a different structure of professional categories with Top Fuel Bike, Super Twin Top Fuel Bike, and Pro Stock Bike contested, leaving the entire European series with a total of 8 professional categories.

To allow different cars to compete against each other, some competitions are raced on a handicap basis, with faster cars delayed on the starting line enough to theoretically even things up with the slower car. This may be based on rule differences between the cars in stock, super stock, and modified classes, or on a competitor's chosen &quot;dial-in&quot; in [[bracket racing]].

For a list of drag racing [[world record]]s in each class, see [[Dragstrip#Quarter mile times]].

==Dial-in==
A 'dial-in' is a time the driver estimates it will take his or her car to cross the finish line, and is generally displayed on one or more windows so the starter can adjust the starting lights on the tree accordingly. The slower car will then get a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] equal to the difference in the two dial-ins, so if both cars perform perfectly, they would cross the finish line dead even. If either car goes faster than its dial-in (called breaking out), it is disqualified regardless of who has the lower elapsed time; if both cars break out, the one who breaks out by the smallest amount wins. However, if a driver had jump-started (red light) or crossed a boundary line, both violations override any break out (except in some classes with an absolute break out rule such as Junior classes).

The effect of the bracket racing rules is to place a premium on consistency of performance of the driver and car rather than on raw speed, in that victory goes to the driver able to precisely predict elapsed time, whether it is fast or slow. This in turn makes victory much less dependent on budget, and more dependent on skill, making it popular with casual weekend racers.

== History ==
The [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) was founded in 1951, to take illegal racing off the [[Street racing|street]].

The organization banned the use of [[nitromethane]] in 1957, calling it unsafe, in part through the efforts of [[C. J. Hart (drag racing)|C. J. Hart]]; the ban would be lifted in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nostalgiadragworld.com/oldsite/v1i5billottoldhabits.php Nostalgiadragworld.com] (retrieved 5 May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
