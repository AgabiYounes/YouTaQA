The '''California Institute of Technology '''('''Caltech''')&lt;ref name=&quot;caltech&quot;&gt;The university itself only spells its short form as &quot;Caltech&quot;; other spellings such as [http://styleguide.caltech.edu/wordmark &quot;Cal Tech&quot; and &quot;CalTech&quot; are incorrect] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412052404/http://styleguide.caltech.edu/wordmark# |date=April 12, 2012 }}. The Institute is also occasionally referred to as &quot;CIT&quot;, most notably in its [[alma mater]], but this is uncommon.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[private university|private]] [[doctorate-granting university|doctorate-granting]] [[research university]] in [[Pasadena]], [[California]]. It was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by [[Amos G. Throop]] in 1891 and began attracting influential scientists such as [[George Ellery Hale]], [[Arthur Amos Noyes]] and [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1920. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]], and the antecedents of [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under [[Theodore von Kármán]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aau&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476 |title=Member Institutions |publisher=American Association of Universities |access-date=May 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69oUMM90E?url=http://www.aau.edu/about/article.aspx?id=5476 |archive-date=August 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/ |title=Early History |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |access-date=May 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026135745/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/early/ |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is one among a small group of [[Institute of Technology (United States)|institutes of technology in the United States]] which is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.

=== Throop College ===
[[Image:Detroit Photographic Company (0048).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Throop Polytechnic Institute on its original campus at downtown Pasadena]]

Caltech started as a [[vocational school]] founded in Pasadena in 1891 by local businessman and politician [[Amos G. Throop]]. The school was known successively as '''Throop University''', '''Throop Polytechnic Institute''' (and Manual Training School)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where to educate, 1898–1899.

At a time when scientific research in the United States was still in its infancy, [[George Ellery Hale]], a solar [[astronomer]] from the [[University of Chicago]], founded the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] in 1904. He joined Throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of [[James Augustin Brown Scherer|James A. B. Scherer]], a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser, to Throop's presidency in 1908. Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W. Gates to donate $25,000 in seed money to build Gates Laboratory, the first science building on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates lab&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodstein |first=Judith R. |author-link=Judith R.

=== World Wars ===

In 1910, Throop moved to its current site. Arthur Fleming donated the land for the permanent campus site. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] delivered an address at Throop Institute on March 21, 1911, and he declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to see institutions like Throop turn out perhaps ninety-nine of every hundred students as men who are to do given pieces of industrial work better than any one else can do them; I want to see those men do the kind of work that is now being done on the [[Panama Canal]] and on the great irrigation projects in the interior of this country—and the one-hundredth man I want to see with the kind of cultural scientific training that will make him and his fellows the matrix out of which you can occasionally develop a man like your great astronomer, George Ellery Hale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltech Catalog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_10_11.pdf |title=Caltech Catalog |publisher=Caltech |access-date=May 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110409051312/http://catalog.caltech.edu/pdf/catalog_10_11.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same year, a bill was introduced in the [[California Legislature]] calling for the establishment of a publicly funded &quot;California Institute of Technology&quot;, with an initial budget of a million dollars, ten times the budget of Throop at the time. The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California]] successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of the World War II necessitated the broader development of research-based science education.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Dream Endures&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|url=https://archive.org/details/dreamendurescali00star|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=1997|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dreamendurescali00star/page/74 74–77]|chapter=Unto the Stars Themselves, Astronomy and the Pasadena Perspective|isbn=0-19-515797-4|access-date=November 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191203202552/https://archive.org/details/dreamendurescali00star|archive-date=December 3, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of Throop attracted [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Arthur Amos Noyes]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology.

With the onset of [[World War I]], Hale organized the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation. President Scherer, hearing of the formation of the council, immediately offered to take part in its work, and with this object, he secured within three days an additional research endowment of one hundred thousand dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodstein|first=Judith R.|title=Millikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]|location=New York, NY|year=1991|pages=[https://archive.org/details/millikansschoolh00good/page/64 64–75]|chapter=The Birth of Caltech|isbn=0-393-03017-2|url=https://archive.org/details/millikansschoolh00good/page/64}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Through the National Research Council, Hale simultaneously lobbied for science to play a larger role in national affairs, and for Throop to play a national role in science. The new funds were designated for physics research, and ultimately led to the establishment of the Norman Bridge Laboratory, which attracted experimental [[physics|physicist]] [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;bridge lab&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodstein|first=Judith R.|title=Millikan's School: A History of the California Institute of Technology|publisher=[[W.

Subsequently, they continued their partnership in developing Caltech.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot; /&gt;

{{wide image|Caltech Entrance.jpg|640px|align-cap=center|Caltech entrance at 1200 E California Blvd.  On the left is East Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics and on the right is the Linde Hall of Mathematics and Physics.}}
Under the leadership of Hale, Noyes, and Millikan (aided by the booming economy of [[Southern California]]), Caltech grew to national prominence in the 1920s and concentrated on the development of Roosevelt's &quot;Hundredth Man&quot;. On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time &quot;to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltech Catalog&quot;/&gt; In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von Kármán]]. Kármán later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for [[rocket|rocket science]]. In 1928, construction of the [[Palomar Observatory]] began.

Millikan served as &quot;Chairman of the Executive Council&quot; (effectively Caltech's president) from 1921 to 1945, and his influence was such that the Institute was occasionally referred to as &quot;Millikan's School.&quot; Millikan initiated a visiting-scholars program soon after joining Caltech. Scientists who accepted his invitation include luminaries such as [[Paul Dirac]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/goodstein/ |title = History of Caltech |website = Nobelprize.org |access-date = June 18, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100804153722/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/goodstein/ |archive-date = August 4, 2010 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] arrived on the Caltech campus for the first time in 1931 to polish up his [[Theory of General Relativity]], and he returned to Caltech subsequently as a visiting professor in 1932 and 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.caltech.edu/about/fastfacts.html |title=Fast Facts about Caltech History |publisher=The Caltech Archives |access-date=March 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708080210/http://archives.caltech.edu/about/fastfacts.html |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Caltech was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;caltech-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/125/01/OH_Acosta.pdf |title=Oral History – Allen J.

=== Project Vista ===
[[File:Caltech aerial 1944.png|thumb|The campus in 1944]]

From April 1 to December 1, 1951, Caltech was the host of a federal classified study, [[Project Vista]]. The selection of Caltech as host for the project was based on the university's expertise in rocketry and nuclear physics. In response to the war in Korea and the pressure from the Soviet Union, the project was Caltech's way of assisting the federal government in its effort to increase national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1280/1/DuBridge.pdf |title=DuBridge, Lee A. &quot;The President's Report.&quot; Engineering and Science 15.6 (1952): 9 |access-date=April 27, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427192026/http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/1280/1/DuBridge.pdf |archive-date=April 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was created to study new ways of improving the relationship between tactical air support and ground troops. The Army, Air Force, and Navy sponsored the project, however it was under contract with the Army. The study was named after the hotel, Vista del Arroyo Hotel, which housed the study. The study operated under a committee with the supervision of President [[Lee Alvin DuBridge|Lee A. DuBridge]]. [[William Alfred Fowler|William A. Fowler]], a professor at Caltech, was selected as research director. More than a fourth of Caltech's faculty and a group of outside scientists staffed the project.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, David C.

In compensation for its participation, the university received about $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Post-war growth ===
In the 1950s–1970s, Caltech was the home of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Richard Feynman]], whose work was central to the establishment of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. Feynman was also widely known outside the physics community as an exceptional teacher and colorful, unconventional character.

During [[Lee A. DuBridge]]'s tenure as Caltech's president (1946–1969), Caltech's faculty doubled and the campus tripled in size. DuBridge, unlike his predecessors, welcomed [[federal funding]] of science. New research fields flourished, including [[chemical biology]], [[planetary science]], [[nuclear astrophysics]], and [[geochemistry]]. A [[Hale_Telescope|200-inch telescope]] was dedicated on nearby Palomar Mountain in 1948 and remained the world's most powerful optical telescope for over forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/hale.html |title=The 200-inch Hale Telescope |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |access-date=September 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718065231/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/hale.html |archive-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caltech opened its doors to female undergraduates during the presidency of [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]] in 1970, and they made up 14% of the entering class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/06/local/me-caltech6 |title=Caltech chemistry improves |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=August 12, 2010 |first=Larry |last=Gordon |date=August 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508071501/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/06/local/me-caltech6 |archive-date=May 8, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of female undergraduates has been increasing since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot; /&gt;

In 1973, the students from [[Dabney House]] protested a presidential visit with a sign on the library bearing the simple phrase &quot;[[Watergate scandal|Impeach Nixon]]&quot;. The following week, Ross McCollum, president of the [[National Oil Company]], wrote an open letter to Dabney House stating that in light of their actions he had decided not to donate one million dollars to Caltech. The Dabney family, being Republicans, disowned Dabney House after hearing of the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandora.caltech.edu/~antognini/tunnels.pdf |title=Caltech's Underground History |publisher=Joe Antognini |accessdate=August 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719160558/http://pandora.caltech.edu/~antognini/tunnels.pdf |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2008, the freshman class was 42% female, a record for Caltech's undergraduate enrollment.&lt;ref name=&quot;at a glance&quot;/&gt; In the same year, the Institute concluded a six-year-long fund-raising campaign. The campaign raised more than $1.4 billion from about 16,000 donors. Nearly half of the funds went into the support of Caltech programs and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://one.caltech.edu/homepage/campaign_brochure.pdf |title=Campaign Summary |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717002058/http://one.caltech.edu/homepage/campaign_brochure.pdf |archivedate=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Caltech, in partnership with [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and headed by Professor [[Nathan Lewis (chemist)|Nathan Lewis]], established a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] [[United States Department of Energy#Energy Innovation Hubs|Energy Innovation Hub]] aimed at developing revolutionary methods to generate fuels directly from sunlight.

[[File:Robert A. Millikan Memorial Library at Caltech.jpg|thumb|The Millikan Library, the tallest building on campus]]
Caltech's {{convert|124|acre|ha|adj=on}} primary campus is located in [[Pasadena, California]], approximately {{convert|11|mi|km}} northeast of [[downtown Los Angeles]]. It is within walking distance of [[Old Town Pasadena]] and the [[Playhouse District, Pasadena, California|Pasadena Playhouse District]] and therefore the two locations are frequent getaways for Caltech students.

In 1917 Hale hired architect [[Bertram Goodhue]] to produce a master plan for the {{convert|22|acre|ha}} campus. Goodhue conceived the overall layout of the campus and designed the physics building, Dabney Hall, and several other structures, in which he sought to be consistent with the local climate, the character of the school, and Hale's educational philosophy. Goodhue's designs for Caltech were also influenced by the traditional [[Architecture of the California Missions|Spanish mission architecture]] of Southern California.

During the 1960s, Caltech underwent considerable expansion, in part due to the philanthropy of alumnus [[Arnold O. Beckman]]. In 1953, Beckman was asked to join the Caltech Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred&quot;/&gt;{{rp|282}} In 1964, he became its chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred&quot; /&gt;{{rp|275}} Over the next few years, as Caltech's president emeritus [[David Baltimore]] describes it, Arnold Beckman and his wife Mabel &quot;shaped the destiny of Caltech&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred&quot;&gt;{{cite book |ISBN = 978-0-941901-23-9 |author1=Arnold Thackray  |author2 = Minor Myers, Jr.  |lastauthoramp=yes |others = foreword by James D.

In 1971 a [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|magnitude-6.6 earthquake]] in [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] caused some damage to the Caltech campus. Engineers who evaluated the damage found that two historic buildings dating from the early days of the Institute—Throop Hall and the Goodhue-designed Culbertson Auditorium—had cracked.

New additions to the campus include the Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the [[Walter Annenberg|Walter]] and [[Leonore Annenberg]] Center for Information Science and Technology, which opened in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/students-student-life/12035174-1.html |title=Quantum leap: Caltech facility combines astronomy, astrophysics |publisher=[[AllBusiness]] |date=January 26, 2009 |access-date=July 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909233944/http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/students-student-life/12035174-1.html |archive-date=September 9, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=37963 |title=Walter and Leonore Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology |publisher=Caltech |date=August 10, 2009 |access-date=July 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610072708/http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=37963 |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Warren and Katherine Schlinger Laboratory for Chemistry and Chemical Engineering followed in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=42903 |title=Caltech Cuts the Ribbon on Schlinger Laboratory |publisher=Caltech |date=March 9, 2010 |access-date=July 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702055447/http://today.caltech.edu/today/story-display.tcl?story_id=42903 |archive-date=July 2, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also concluded an upgrading of the [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#South Houses|south houses]] in 2006.

Prior to the entering class of 2013, Caltech required students to take a core curriculum of five terms of mathematics, five terms of physics, two terms of chemistry, one term of biology, two terms of lab courses, one term of scientific communication, three terms of physical education, and 12 terms of humanities and social science. Since 2013, only three terms each of mathematics and physics have been required by the institute, with the remaining two terms each required by certain options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalog.caltech.edu/documents/2651/catalog_12_13_part3.pdf |title=Caltech Catalog 2012–13, Section Three (Information for Undergraduate Students) |publisher=California Institute of Technology |access-date=April 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404045433/http://catalog.caltech.edu/documents/2651/catalog_12_13_part3.pdf |archive-date=April 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/content/learning |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: Core Curriculum |publisher=California Institute of Technology |access-date=April 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002091104/http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/content/learning |archive-date=October 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical class is worth 9 academic units and given the extensive core curriculum requirements in addition to individual options' degree requirements, students need to take an average of 40.5 units per term (more than four classes) in order to graduate in four years. 36 units is the minimum full-time load, 48 units is considered a heavy load, and registrations above 51 units require an overload petition.&lt;ref name=&quot;fah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url = http://www.deans.caltech.edu/PDF/FAHOct09.pdf |title=Information for Freshman Advisors, 2009–2010 |date=October 2009 |last1=Hall |first1=John D. |last2=Green |first2=Barbara C. |publisher=California Institute of Technology |access-date=May 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100628065458/http://www.deans.caltech.edu//PDF/FAHOct09.pdf |archive-date=June 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20 percent of students double-major.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/faqs |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: FAQ |publisher=California Institute of Technology |access-date=June 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100606164917/http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/faqs |archive-date=June 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achievable since the humanities and social sciences majors have been designed to be done in conjunction with a science major.

About 80% of the class of 2010 did research through the annual [http://surf.caltech.edu/ Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)] program at least once during their stay, and many continued during the school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surf.caltech.edu/history/SURFAR2010.pdf |title=SURF Annual Report 2010 |publisher=Caltech |access-date=March 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161225/http://www.surf.caltech.edu/history/SURFAR2010.pdf |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students write and submit SURF proposals for research projects in collaboration with professors, and about 70 percent of applicants are awarded SURFs. The program is open to both Caltech and non-Caltech undergraduate students. It serves as preparation for graduate school and helps to explain why Caltech has the highest percentage of alumni who go on to receive a PhD of all the major universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08311/?govDel=USNSF_178http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsf.gov%2Fstatistics%2Finfbrief%2Fnsf08311%2F%3FgovDel%3DUSNSF_178#tab2 |title = nsf.gov – NCSES Baccalaureate Origins of S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients – US National Science Foundation (NSF) |author=National Science Foundation |access-date=July 3, 2015|url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704080248/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08311/?govDel=USNSF_178http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsf.gov%2Fstatistics%2Finfbrief%2Fnsf08311%2F%3FgovDel%3DUSNSF_178#tab2 |archive-date=July 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== House system ===
{{Main|House System at the California Institute of Technology}}

During the early 20th century, a Caltech committee visited several universities and decided to transform the undergraduate housing system from regular [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] to a [[residential college|house system]]. Four south houses (or ''hovses'') were built: [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Blacker House|Blacker House]], [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Dabney House|Dabney House]], [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Fleming House|Fleming House]] and [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Ricketts House|Ricketts House]]. In the 1960s, three north houses were built: [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Lloyd House|Lloyd House]], [[Page House (Caltech)|Page House]], and [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Ruddock House|Ruddock House]], and during the 1990s, [[House System at the California Institute of Technology#Avery House|Avery House]]. The four south houses closed for renovation in 2005 and reopened in 2006. The latest addition to residential life at Caltech is Bechtel Residence, which opened in 2018. It is not affiliated with the house system. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dandc.caltech.edu/_projects/complete-capital-projects/bechtel-residence|title=Bechtel Residence {{!}} Design and Construction|website=dandc.caltech.edu|access-date=2019-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112183605/http://dandc.caltech.edu/_projects/complete-capital-projects/bechtel-residence|archive-date=November 12, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;All first year students live in the house system and 95% of undergraduates remain affiliated with a house.&lt;ref name=&quot;cds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;houses&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.caltech.edu/living/houses |title=Caltech Undergraduate Admissions: The Houses |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606230813/http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/living/houses |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track and field team plays at the South Athletic Field in [[Tournament Park]], the site of the first [[Rose Bowl Game]].

The school also sponsored a football team prior to 1976, which played part of its home schedule at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], or, as Caltech students put it, &quot;to the largest number of empty seats in the nation&quot;.

=== Performing and visual arts ===
The Caltech/[[Occidental College]] Orchestra is a full seventy-piece orchestra composed of students, faculty, and staff at Caltech and nearby Occidental College. The orchestra gives three pairs of concerts annually, at both Caltech and Occidental College. There are also two Caltech Jazz Bands and a Concert Band. For vocal music, Caltech has a mixed voice [[Glee Club]] and a smaller [[Chamber Singer]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.music.caltech.edu/gleeclub/ |title=Caltech Glee Clubs |access-date=May 13, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160604061921/http://www.music.caltech.edu/gleeclub/ |archive-date=June 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater program at Caltech is known as TACIT, or Theater Arts at the California Institute of Technology. There are two to three plays organized by TACIT per year, and they were involved in the production of the [[PHD Comics#Piled Higher and Deeper: the Movie|PHD Movie]], released in 2011.

=== Student life traditions ===
==== Annual events ====
Every [[Halloween]], Dabney House conducts the infamous &quot;Millikan pumpkin-drop experiment&quot; from the top of Millikan Library, the highest point on campus. According to tradition, a claim was once made that the shattering of a pumpkin frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] and dropped from a sufficient height would produce a [[triboluminescence|triboluminescent]] spark. This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous [[oil-drop experiment|Millikan oil-drop experiment]] which measured ''e'', the [[elementary charge|elemental unit of electrical charge]].

On Ditch Day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a &quot;stack&quot; to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.

Another long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot; at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of ''[[The Ring Cycle]]''), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed.

==== Pranks ====
[[File:Fleming cannon firing.jpg|thumb|The Fleming cannon]]

Caltech students have been known for the many [[Student prank|prank]]s (also known as &quot;RFs&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Caltech1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiszpanski|first=Anna|title=Fleming Cannon Gone|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014|newspaper=The California Tech|date=April 3, 2006|volume=107|number=21|page=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419014754/http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most famous in recent history are the changing of the [[Hollywood Sign]] to read &quot;Caltech&quot;, by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the [[1984 Rose Bowl|1984 Rose Bowl Game]]. But the most famous of all occurred during the [[1961 Rose Bowl|1961 Rose Bowl Game]], where Caltech students altered the flip-cards that were raised by the stadium attendees to display &quot;Caltech&quot;, and several other &quot;unintended&quot; messages. This event is now referred to as the [[Great Rose Bowl Hoax]].

In recent years, pranking has been officially encouraged by Tom Mannion, Caltech's Assistant VP for Student Affairs and Campus Life. &quot;The grand old days of pranking have gone away at Caltech, and that's what we are trying to bring back,&quot; reported the ''Boston Globe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In December 2011, Caltech students went to New York and pulled a prank on Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]]. The prank involved making [[Alamo (sculpture)|The Cube]] sculpture look like the [[Aperture Science]] Weighted Companion Cube from the video game ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5867982/california-pulls-portal-prank-on-new-york California Pulls Portal Prank on New York] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110053522/http://kotaku.com/5867982/california-pulls-portal-prank-on-new-york |date=January 10, 2012 }}.

===== Rivalry with MIT =====
{{Main|Caltech–MIT rivalry}}

In 2005, a group of Caltech students pulled a string of pranks during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend for admitted students. These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the &quot;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&quot; engraving on the main building façade with a banner so that it read &quot;That Other Institute of Technology&quot;. A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read &quot;The Only Institute of Technology.&quot; Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and &quot;...{{nbsp}}because not everyone can go to Caltech&quot; along with an image of a palm tree on the back.

MIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe &amp; Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.

On April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included &quot;MIT Invents the Interweb&quot;, &quot;Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'&quot;, and &quot;[[Infinite Corridor]] Not Actually Infinite&quot;.

In December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A &quot;sold&quot; banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a &quot;Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities&quot; banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the &quot;curriculum change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202233541/http://east.caltech.edu/ |date=December 2, 2009 }}, December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212234513/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 |date=December 12, 2009 }}, ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], the time machine from the BBC's ''[[Doctor Who]]'', onto a roof. Caught in midact, the prank was aborted.

In April 2014, during MIT's Campus Preview Weekend, a group of Caltech students handed out mugs emblazoned with the MIT logo on the front and the words &quot;The Institute of Technology&quot; on the back. When heated, the mugs turn orange, display a palm tree, and read &quot;Caltech The Hotter Institute of Technology.&quot; Identical mugs continue to be sold at the Caltech campus store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=Drinkware&amp;Sku=1*100985&amp;Delc=Merchandise|title=CatalogProductITems – Caltech Bookstore|publisher=|accessdate=July 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930081159/https://bookstore.caltech.edu/catalogs/CatalogProductItems?Title=Drinkware&amp;Sku=1*100985&amp;Delc=Merchandise|archive-date=September 30, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Honor code ====
Life in the Caltech community is governed by the [[honor code]], which simply states: &quot;No member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community.&quot; This is enforced by a Board of Control, which consists of undergraduate students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |title=The Honor System Handbook from the Board of Control at Caltech.edu |publisher=Donut.caltech.edu |accessdate=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106150251/http://donut.caltech.edu/about/boc/ug_handbook.php |archive-date=November 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a similar body at the graduate level, called the Graduate Honor Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc |title=Graduate Studies Office – The Honor Code |publisher=www.gradoffice.caltech.edu |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408100956/http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/current/hc |archive-date=April 8, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The honor code aims at promoting an atmosphere of respect and trust that allows Caltech students to enjoy privileges that make for a more relaxed atmosphere. For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.

Through the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Richard Feynman]] was among the most well-known physicists associated with Caltech, having published the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', an undergraduate physics text, and a few other popular science texts such as ''[[Six Easy Pieces#Six Easy Pieces (1994)|Six Easy Pieces]]'' for the general audience. The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in [[quantum electrodynamics]] was already very established in the scientific community. [[Murray Gell-Mann]], a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of [[hadrons]] and went on to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, which is currently accepted as part of the [[Standard Model]]. Long-time Caltech President [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] was the first to calculate the charge of the [[electron]] with his well-known [[oil-drop experiment]], while [[Richard Chace Tolman]] is remembered for his contributions to [[cosmology]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] winner [[H. David Politzer]] is a current professor at Caltech, as is astrophysicist and author [[Kip Thorne]] and eminent mathematician [[Barry Simon]]. [[Linus Pauling]] pioneered [[quantum chemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. Seismologist [[Charles Richter]], also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the [[Richter magnitude scale]] for measuring the power of earthquakes. One of the founders of the geochemistry department, [[Clair Patterson]] was the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites. In engineering, [[Theodore von Kármán]] made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling [[vortices]] is named after him, the [[von Kármán vortex street]]. Participants in von Kármán's GALCIT project included [[Frank Malina]], who helped develop the [[WAC Corporal]] which was the first U.S. rocket to reach the edge of space, [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]], a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and [[Qian Xuesen]], who was dubbed the &quot;Father of Chinese Rocketry&quot;. More recently, [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]], a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, most notably the [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which prompted the [[International Astronomical Union]] to redefine the term &quot;[[planet]]&quot;.

[[David Baltimore]], the Robert A. Millikan Professor of Biology, and [[Alice S. Huang|Alice Huang]], Senior Faculty Associate in Biology, have served as the President of [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] from 2007–2008 and 2010–2011 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.aaas.org/people/plist.php?type=President |title=AAAS Presidents |publisher=AAAS |year=2011 |access-date=January 12, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724213136/http://archives.aaas.org/people/plist.php?type=President |archive-date=July 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

33% of the faculty are members of the [[National Academy of Science]] or [[National Academy of Engineering|Engineering]] and/or fellows of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. This is the highest percentage of any faculty in the country with the exception of the graduate institution [[Rockefeller University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/learning/faculty |title=Faculty |publisher=Caltech |year=2010 |access-date=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233207/http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/learning/faculty |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alumni have participated in scientific research. Some have concentrated their studies on the very small universe of atoms and molecules. [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Carl D. Anderson]] (BS 1927, PhD 1930) proved the existence of [[positron]]s and [[muon]]s, Nobel laureate [[Edwin McMillan]] (BS 1928, MS 1929) synthesized the first [[transuranium element]], Nobel laureate [[Leo James Rainwater]] (BS 1939) investigated the non-spherical shapes of atomic nuclei, and Nobel laureate [[Douglas D. Osheroff]] (BS 1967) studied the [[superfluid]] nature of [[helium-3]]. [[Donald Knuth]] (PhD 1963), the &quot;father&quot; of the [[analysis of algorithms]], wrote ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' and created the [[TeX]] computer typesetting system, which is commonly used in the scientific community. [[Bruce Reznick]] (BS 1973) is a mathematician noted for his contributions to [[number theory]] and the combinatorial-algebraic-analytic investigations of polynomials. [[Narendra Karmarkar]] (MS 1979) is known for the interior point method, a polynomial algorithm for linear programming known as [[Karmarkar's algorithm]].

Other alumni have turned their gaze to the universe. [[C. Gordon Fullerton]] (BS 1957, MS 1958) piloted the third [[Space Shuttle]] mission. Astronaut (and later, [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]) [[Harrison Schmitt]] (BS 1957) was the only geologist to have ever walked on the surface of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/AstroHistory/schmitt.html |title=USGS Astrogeology: Astronaut Harrison H.

The Celestis Flight Capsule, containing a symbolic portion of Shoemaker's cremated remains, was attached to NASA's Lunar Prospector spacecraft and launched on a one-year mission orbiting the moon. On July 31, 1999, at the completion of Lunar Prospector's mission, the spacecraft was intentionally crashed into the moon's south pole, making Shoemaker the first human to be laid to rest on another celestial body. NASA called the memorial &quot;a special honor for a special human being.&quot;&quot;{{cite web|publisher=[[Space.com]]|url=http://www.space.com/news/080328-moon-burial.html|title=Fly Me to the Moon ...

== Caltech startups ==
Over the years Caltech has actively promoted the commercialization of technologies developed within its walls. Through its Office of Technology Transfer &amp; Corporate Partnerships,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.innovation.caltech.edu/ |title=Office of Technology Transfer &amp; Corporate Partnerships |access-date=November 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118135544/http://www.innovation.caltech.edu/ |archive-date=November 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; scientific breakthroughs have led to the transfer of numerous technologies in a wide variety of scientific-related fields such as [[photovoltaic]], [[radio-frequency identification]] (RFID), [[semiconductor]]s, [[hyperspectral imaging]], [[electronic devices]], [[protein]] design, solid state amplifiers and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universityspinoff.wordpress.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507102529/http://universityspinoff.wordpress.com/|url-status=live|archive-date=2010-05-07|title=University Spinoffs|website=University Spinoffs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies such as Contour Energy Systems, [[Impinj]], Fulcrum Microsystems, Nanosys, Inc., [[Photon etc.]], [[Xencor]], and Wavestream Wireless&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovation.caltech.edu/startups|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106103032/http://innovation.caltech.edu/startups|url-status=live|archive-date=2015-01-06|title=OTTCP's Startups Map}}&lt;/ref&gt; have emerged from Caltech.

== In media and popular culture ==
&lt;!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie Caltech is mentioned on or appears in. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! No one cares about Criminal Minds or Tron; they're no different from 50 other movies where a character went to Caltech. Unless you have an example that is much, much, much better than those already here, don't add it.--&gt;
Caltech has appeared in many works of popular culture, both as itself and in disguised form. On television, it plays a prominent role and is the workplace of all four male lead characters and one female lead character in the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' . Caltech is also the inspiration, and frequent film location, for the California Institute of Science of ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;realgenius&quot;&gt;[http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~erich/real_genius_refs.html Caltech References in &quot;Real Genius&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510204808/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~erich/real_genius_refs.html |date=May 10, 2013 }}.

In nonfiction, two 2007 documentaries examine aspects of Caltech: ''Curious'', its researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirteen.org/curious/ |title=&quot;CURIOUS&quot; from Thirteen/WNET |publisher=[[WNET|Thirteen.org]] |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005183716/http://www.thirteen.org/curious/ |archive-date=October 5, 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR13040.html &quot;Documentary Focuses on Caltech Researchers&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101053532/http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR13040.html |date=November 1, 2007 }} Caltech Press Release, 1 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Quantum Hoops]]'', its men's basketball team.

Given its Los Angeles-area location, the grounds of the Institute are often host to short scenes in movies and television. The [[Athenaeum at Caltech|Athenaeum dining club]] appears in the [[Beverly Hills Cop (film series)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' series]], ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', ''[[True Romance]]'', and ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/bevhills.html |title=Film locations for Beverly Hills Cop |publisher=Movie-locations.com |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103131033/http://movie-locations.com/movies/b/bevhills.html |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
