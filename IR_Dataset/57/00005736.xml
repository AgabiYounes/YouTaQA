Coleman was selected by NASA in 1992 to join the [[NASA Astronaut Corps]]. In 1995, she was a member of the [[STS-73]] crew on the scientific mission USML-2 with experiments including [[biotechnology]], combustion science, and the [[physics]] of [[fluids]]. During the flight, she reported to [[Johnson Space Center|Houston Mission Control]] that she had spotted an [[UFO|unidentified flying object]]. She also trained for the mission [[STS-83]] to be the backup for [[Donald A. Thomas]]; however, as he recovered on time, she did not fly that mission. [[STS-93]] was Coleman's second space flight in 1999. She was mission specialist in charge of deploying the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and its [[Inertial Upper Stage]] out of the shuttle's cargo bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA bio&quot;/&gt;

Coleman launched on December 15, 2010 (December 16 [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Baikonur]] time), aboard [[Soyuz TMA-20]] to join the [[Expedition 26]] mission aboard the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_M10-164A_Soyuz_Update.html NASA Television Will Air Next Soyuz Landing And Launch] – Media Advisory : M10-164A – November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  She retired from NASA on December 1, 2016.

===Spaceflight experience===
[[STS-73]] on Space Shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' (October 20 to November 5, 1995) was the second United States Microgravity Laboratory mission. The mission focused on materials science, [[biotechnology]], combustion science, the physics of [[fluids]], and numerous scientific experiments housed in the pressurized [[Spacelab]] module. In completing her first space flight, Coleman orbited the [[Earth]] 256 times, traveled over 6 million miles, and logged a total of 15 days, 21 hours, 52 minutes and 21 seconds in space.

[[STS-93]] on ''Columbia'' (July 22 to 27, 1999) was a five-day mission during which Coleman was the lead mission specialist for the deployment of the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Designed to conduct comprehensive studies of the [[universe]], the [[telescope]] will enable scientists to study exotic [[phenomena]] such as exploding [[stars]], [[quasars]], and [[black hole]]s. Mission duration was 118 hours and 50 minutes.

[[Soyuz TMA-20]] / Expedition 26/[[Expedition 27|27]] (December 15, 2010, to May 23, 2011) was an extended duration mission to the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceports.blogspot.com/2011/01/blog-post.html|title=Blogger|website=spaceports.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13 of that year, Coleman delivered a taped commencement address to the class of 2011 at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/05/nasa_astronaut_catherine_cady_coleman_2011_umass_commencement.html|title=NASA astronaut Catherine 'Cady' Coleman has message from space for 2011 UMass graduates: Work as a team to solve nation's problems|work=masslive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As do many other astronauts, Coleman holds an [[amateur radio]] license (callsign: KC5ZTH).

As of 2015, she is also a member of the board of directors for the [[Hollywood Science Fiction Museum]].

As of 2015 she is also known to be working as a guest speaker at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], for the children's program 'Saturday Morning Science'.

In 2018 she gave a graduation address to [[Carter Lynch]], the sole graduate of [[Cuttyhunk Elementary School]], on [[Cuttyhunk Island]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Derrick Bryson |title=Jenny Slate Will Give a Graduation Speech to a Class of One |url=https://nyti.ms/2K61dpd |accessdate=5 June 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
