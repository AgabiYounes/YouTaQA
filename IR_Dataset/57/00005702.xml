The tunnel carries high-speed [[Eurostar]] passenger trains, the [[Eurotunnel Shuttle]] for road vehicles—the largest such transport in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Story p xvi-xvii&quot;/&gt;—and international [[Rail freight transport|freight trains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;/&gt; The tunnel connects end-to-end with the [[high-speed rail]]way lines of the [[LGV Nord]] and [[High Speed 1]].

Plans to build a cross-Channel fixed link appeared as early as 1802,&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiteside p17&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://library.thinkquest.org/5983/pages/chunnel.htm | title = The Channel Tunnel | publisher=library.thinkquest.org | accessdate =19 July 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212192247/http://library.thinkquest.org/5983/pages/chunnel.htm | archivedate= 12 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but British political and media pressure over the compromising of national security had disrupted attempts to build a tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt; An early attempt at building a Channel Tunnel was made in the late 19th century, on the English side, &quot;in the hope of forcing the hand of the English Government&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paddy at Home (&quot;Chez Paddy&quot;)|publisher=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]] Covent Garden, London|edition=2nd|date=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual successful [[megaproject|project]], organised by [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]], began construction in 1988 and opened in 1994.

Since its construction, the tunnel has experienced a few mechanical problems. Both fires and cold weather have temporarily disrupted its operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/12/transport.channeltunnel1 | title = Channel tunnel fire worst in service's history | work=The Guardian | accessdate = 21 February 2014 | date = 12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8421875.stm | title = Thousands freed from Channel Tunnel after trains fail | work=BBC News | accessdate = 21 February 2014 | date = 19 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have been attempting to use the tunnel to [[Illegal immigration|illegally travel to the UK]] since at least 1997, creating the ongoing issue of the [[migrants around Calais]] on the French side, causing both diplomatic disagreement and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7171985.stm | title = Four men caught in Channel Tunnel | work=BBC News | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | date = 4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/23/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices1 | title = Sangatte refugee camp |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =19 July 2009 | date=23 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11904605/French-Channel-Tunnel-train-drivers-haunted-by-migrant-deaths.html|title=French Channel Tunnel train drivers 'haunted' by migrant deaths|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph20Jun17&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/20/van-driver-dies-migrants-block-calais-road-tree-trunks/|title=Van driver killed in fireball crash after migrants block Calais road with tree trunks|first=Henry|last=Samuel|date= 20 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|accessdate= 20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, Albert Mathieu-Favier, a French mining engineer, put forward a proposal to tunnel under the English Channel, with illumination from oil lamps, horse-drawn coaches, and an artificial island positioned mid-Channel for changing horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiteside p17&quot;&gt;Whiteside p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu-Favier's design envisaged a bored two-level tunnel with the top tunnel used for transport and the bottom one for [[groundwater]] flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Channel Tunnel History|url=http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/history/|publisher=[[Getlink|Eurotunnel]]|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, [[Aimé Thomé de Gamond]], a Frenchman, performed the first geological and hydrographical surveys on the Channel, between Calais and Dover. Thomé de Gamond explored several schemes and, in 1856, he presented a proposal to [[Napoleon III]] for a mined railway tunnel from Cap [[Gris-Nez]] to Eastwater Point with a port/airshaft on the [[Varne Bank|Varne sandbank]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiteside p18-23&quot;&gt;Whiteside pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of 170&amp;nbsp;million [[French franc|franc]]s, or less than £7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times 1866&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1866/08/07/83456856.pdf |title=The Proposed Tunnel Between England and France |work=The New York Times |date=7 August 1866 |accessdate=3 January 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, a deputation led by [[George Ward Hunt]] proposed the idea of a tunnel to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the day, [[William Ewart Gladstone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;William Gladstone 1888&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladstone |first=William |authorlink=William Ewart Gladstone|editor=A.

Gladstone, M.P. |volume=X|date=1902 |publisher=Methuen And Company|location=London |chapter=[[s:The Channel Tunnel (Gladstone)|The Channel Tunnel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1866, William Low and [[John Hawkshaw|Sir John Hawkshaw]] promoted ideas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beaumont | first = Martin | authorlink = | title = Sir John Hawkshaw 1811-1891 | publisher = The Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway Society www.lyrs.org.uk | year = 2015 | location = | pages = 126–129 | isbn = 978-0-9559467-7-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but apart from preliminary geological studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8842035 |title=Things Worth Recording about Steam Navigation |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=9 October 1866 |accessdate=26 April 2014 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; none were implemented.

An official Anglo-French protocol was established in 1876 for a cross-Channel railway tunnel.

In 1881, the British railway entrepreneur [[Edward Watkin|Sir Edward Watkin]] and [[Alexandre Lavalley]], a French [[Suez Canal]] contractor, were in the Anglo-French Submarine Railway Company that conducted exploratory work on both sides of the Channel. On the English side a {{convert|2.13|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter [[Frederick Beaumont|Beaumont-English boring machine]] dug a {{convert|1893|m|ft|0||adj=on}} pilot tunnel from [[Shakespeare Cliff]]. On the French side, a similar machine dug {{convert|1669|m|ft|abbr=on}} from [[Sangatte]]. The project was abandoned in May 1882, owing to British political and press campaigns asserting that a tunnel would compromise Britain's national defences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt; These early works were encountered more than a century later during the [[TransManche Link|TML]] project.

A 1907 film, ''[[Tunnelling the English Channel]]'' by pioneer filmmaker [[Georges Méliès]],&lt;ref name=MM&gt;{{citation|last=Malthête|first=Jacques|last2=Mannoni|first2=Laurent|title=L'oeuvre de Georges Méliès|year=2008|publication-place=Paris|publisher=Éditions de La Martinière|isbn=9782732437323|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicts [[King Edward VII]] and President [[Armand Fallières]] dreaming of building a tunnel under the [[English Channel]].

In 1919, during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the British prime minister, [[David Lloyd George]], repeatedly brought up the idea of a Channel tunnel as a way of reassuring France about British willingness to defend against another German attack. The French did not take the idea seriously, and nothing came of Lloyd George's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacMillan |first=Margaret |title=Paris 1919 |url=https://archive.org/details/paris1919sixmont00macm |url-access=registration |publisher=Random House |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/paris1919sixmont00macm/page/174 174], 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Winston Churchill]] had advocated for the Channel Tunnel, using that exact name in an essay entitled &quot;Should Strategists Veto The Tunnel?&quot; The essay was published on 27 July 1924 in the ''[[Sunday Dispatch|Weekly Dispatch]]'', and argued vehemently against the idea that the tunnel could be used by a Continental enemy in an invasion of Britain. Churchill expressed his enthusiasm for the project again in an article for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 12 February 1936, &quot;Why Not A Channel Tunnel?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Collected Essays of Sir Winston Churchill, Vol I, Churchill at War|last=Churchill|first=Winston|publisher=Library of Imperial History|year=1976|isbn=0903988429|edition=Centenary|location=|pages=260–264 and 357–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was another proposal in 1929, but nothing came of this discussion and the idea was shelved. Proponents estimated the construction cost at US$150 million. The engineers had addressed the concerns of both nations' military leaders by designing two [[sump]]s—one near the coast of each country—that could be flooded at will to block the tunnel. But this did not appease military leaders, and other concerns about hordes of tourists who would disrupt English life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wN4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA767&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxBvTp7pAoyhtwfhqq33CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=New Plan for Channel Tunnel |magazine=Popular Mechanics |date=May 1929 |pages=767–768 |via=Google Books |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military fears continued during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After the [[fall of France]], as [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|Britain prepared for an expected German invasion]], a [[Royal Navy]] officer in the [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]] calculated that Hitler could use [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labour]] to build two Channel tunnels in 18 months. The estimate caused rumours that Germany had already begun digging.&lt;ref name=&quot;breuer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Spy Who Spent the War in Bed: And Other Bizarre Tales from World War II |publisher=Wiley |author=Breuer, William B. |year=2003 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |page=[https://archive.org/details/spywhospentwarin0000breu/page/40 40] |isbn=0-471-26739-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/spywhospentwarin0000breu/page/40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A British film from [[Gaumont British|Gaumont Studios]], ''The Tunnel'' (also called ''TransAtlantic Tunnel''), was released in 1935 as a futuristic science fiction project concerning the creation of a transatlantic tunnel. It referred briefly to its protagonist, a Mr. McAllan, as having completed a British Channel tunnel successfully in 1940, five years into the future of the film's release.

By 1955, defence arguments had become less relevant due to the dominance of air power, and both the British and French governments supported technical and geological surveys. In 1958 the 1881 workings were cleared in preparation for a £100,000 geological survey by the Channel Tunnel Study Group. 30% of the funding came from the Channel Tunnel Co Ltd, the largest shareholder of which was the [[British Transport Commission]], as successor to the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;''Railway Magazine'' November 1958 p. 805&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed geological survey was carried out in 1964 and 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;halcrow-film-1964–65&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Channel Tunnel Site Investigation – 1964 |publisher=Halcrow Group |date=13 July 2011 |url=http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/ |accessdate=26 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001065054/http://www.halcrow.com/Who-we-are/film_archive/Channel-Tunnel-site-investigation-film/ |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}  Online presentation of a 1964–65 film documentary of a geological survey of the Channel, with a brief summary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the two countries agreed to build a tunnel in 1964, the phase 1 initial studies and signing of a second agreement to cover phase 2 took until 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Illustrated London News|year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction work of this government-funded project to create two tunnels designed to accommodate car shuttle wagons on either side of a service tunnel started on both sides of the Channel in 1974.

On 20 January 1975, to the dismay of their French partners, the now-governing Labour Party in Britain cancelled the project due to uncertainty about [[European Economic Community|EEC]] membership, doubling cost estimates and the general economic crisis at the time.  By this time the British tunnel boring machine was ready and the Ministry of Transport was able to do a {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} experimental drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot; /&gt; This short tunnel was reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the British side.  The cancellation costs were estimated to be £17 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;  On the French side, a tunnel boring machine had been installed underground in a stub tunnel.  It lay there for 14 years until 1988, when it was sold, dismantled, refurbished and shipped to Turkey where it was used to drive the Moda tunnel for the Istanbul Sewerage Scheme, designed and supervised by British Civil Engineers Binnie &amp; Partners, and officially opened by Margaret Thatcher in 1989.

=== Initiation of project ===
{{see also|Premiership of Margaret Thatcher#Channel Tunnel}}
In 1979, the &quot;Mouse-hole Project&quot; was suggested when the Conservatives came to power in Britain. The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but the British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] did not object to a privately funded project, although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains. In 1981, Thatcher and the French president [[François Mitterrand]] agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:

* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M).
* Eurobridge, a {{convert|35|km|abbr=on}} [[suspension bridge]] with a series of {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} spans with a roadway in an enclosed tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zhjOPdmyz1wC&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;ots=fJjwHxaubY&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=''New Scientist'' on Google Books |access-date=12 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Euroroute, a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.
* Channel Expressway, a large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt;

The cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name &quot;Flexilink&quot;. In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt; Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but concerns about ventilation, accident management and driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;&gt;Wilson pp. 14–21&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel, least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.{{sfn|Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}}

The British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France–Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France–Manche (CTG/F–M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&amp;nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt;

The design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was done by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was done by the five British construction companies in the ''Translink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by a bi-national project organisation called [[TransManche Link]] (TML).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt; The ''Maître d'Oeuvre'' was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.10–11&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project had widespread approval. The French National Assembly approved it unanimously in April 1987, and after a public inquiry, the Senate approved it unanimously in June. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and passed by 94&amp;nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into law in July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt; Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162022/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&amp;nbsp;96–97&lt;/ref&gt; TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993){{sfn|Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}} to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and [[SNCF]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.

Private funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale. An initial equity of £45&amp;nbsp;million was raised by CTG/F-M, increased by £206&amp;nbsp;million private institutional placement, £770&amp;nbsp;million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements, a syndicated bank loan and [[letter of credit]] arranged £5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson pp. 14–21&quot;/&gt; Privately financed, the total investment costs at 1985 prices were £2.6&amp;nbsp;billion. At the 1994 completion actual costs were, in 1985 prices, £4.65&amp;nbsp;billion: an 80% [[cost overrun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 12&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety, security, and environmental demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot;/&gt; Financing costs were 140% higher than forecast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 3&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction ===
Working from both the English side and the French side of the Channel, eleven [[tunnel boring machine]]s or TBMs cut through chalk [[marl]] to construct two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. The vehicle shuttle terminals are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (part of [[Folkestone]]) and Coquelles, and are connected to the English [[M20 motorway|M20]] and French [[A16 motorway (France)|A16]] motorways respectively.

Tunnelling commenced in 1988, and the tunnel began operating in 1994.&lt;ref name ='BBConthisday'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/1/newsid_2516000/2516473.stm |title=On this day: Tunnel links UK and Europe |work=BBC News |accessdate=19 July 2009 |date=1 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 prices, the total construction cost was £4.65&amp;nbsp;billion (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|4.65|1985|2015}}&amp;nbsp;billion in 2015), an 80% cost overrun. At the peak of construction 15,000&amp;nbsp;people were employed with daily expenditure over £3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Story p xvi-xvii&quot;&gt;Anderson, pp. xvi–xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Ten workers, eight of them British, were killed during construction between 1987 and 1993, most in the first few months of boring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harlow&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Harlow |title=Phantom Trains Wreak Havoc in Channel Tunnel |work=The Times |location=UK |date=2 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ingenious 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingenious.org.uk/Read/Identity/RailwaysandIdentity/Navvies/ |title=Navvies |date=11 March 2008 |publisher=ingenious |accessdate=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727195547/http://www.ingenious.org.uk/Read/Identity/RailwaysandIdentity/Navvies/ |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/thirteen-workers-die-as-safety-standards-are-ignored-in-race-to-build-olympic-sites-558698.html |title=Thirteen workers die as safety standards are ignored in race to build Olympic sites |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=26 September 2008 |date=3 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-inch (50-mm) diameter pilot hole allowed the service tunnel to break through without ceremony on 30 October 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain and France Link Up-at Last |first=Glenn |last=Frankel |work=The Washington Post |date=31 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 1990, Englishman Graham Fagg and Frenchman Phillippe Cozette broke through the service tunnel with the media watching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evening Mail birthday&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Chunnel birthday |work=Evening Mail |publisher=Birmingham Post &amp; Mail Ltd |date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurotunnel completed the tunnel on time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 96/97&quot;/&gt; (A [[BBC TV]] television commentator called Graham Fagg &quot;the first man to cross the Channel by land [[Last Glacial Period#Deglaciation|for 8000 years]]&quot;.)

The tunnel was officially opened, one year later than originally planned, by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and the French president, [[François Mitterrand]], in a ceremony held in [[Calais]] on 6 May 1994. The Queen travelled through the tunnel to Calais on a [[Eurostar]] train, which stopped nose to nose with the train that carried President Mitterrand from Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC openingceremony&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=On This Day – 1994: President and Queen open Chunnel |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/6/newsid_2511000/2511653.stm |work=BBC News |date=6 May 1994 |accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ceremony President Mitterrand and the Queen travelled on [[Eurotunnel Shuttle|Le Shuttle]] to a similar ceremony in [[Folkestone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC openingceremony&quot;/&gt; A full public service did not start for several months. The first freight train, however, ran on 1 June 1994 and carried Rover and Mini cars being exported to Italy.

The Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), now called [[High Speed 1]], runs {{convert|69|mi|km|0|}} from [[St Pancras railway station]] in London to the tunnel portal at Folkestone in Kent. It cost £5.8&amp;nbsp;billion. On 16 September 2003 the prime minister, [[Tony Blair]], opened the first section of High Speed 1, from Folkestone to north Kent. On 6 November 2007 the Queen officially opened High Speed 1 and St Pancras International station,&lt;ref name=&quot;High-speed Newswire&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Woodman |title=High-speed Rail Link Finally Completed |work=Press Association National Newswire |date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the original slower link to [[Waterloo International railway station]].

Also visible is the segmented tunnel lining]]

Surveying undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk [[marl]] stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.

Between the portals at Beussingue and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] the tunnel is {{convert|50.5|km|mi|0}} long, with {{convert|3.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the French side and {{convert|9.3|km|mi|0}} on the UK side, and {{convert|37.9|km|mi|0}} under sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICE p. 95&quot;&gt;Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95{{inconsistent|reason=The book has only 65 pages: please verify the source.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the third-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] in Switzerland and the [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Post 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = 'Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average depth is {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below the seabed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.13&quot;&gt;Kirkland p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; On the UK side, of the expected {{convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on}} of spoil approximately {{convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd}} was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] {{convert|74|acre|ha|0}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson Story p xvi-xvii&quot;/&gt; of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICE p. 208&quot;&gt;Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; This land was then made into the [[Samphire Hoe Country Park]]. Environmental impact assessment did not identify any major risks for the project, and further studies into safety, noise, and air pollution were overall positive. However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 51&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geology ===
[[File:Channel Tunnel geological profile 1.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Geological profile along the tunnel as constructed. For most of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk [[marl]] stratum (layer)]]

Successful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:

* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1605.
* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90–100&amp;nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay.
* A {{convert|25|–|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30–40% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eng Geol&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0-7277-2045-7 | page = 57 |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the English side, the stratum [[Strike and dip|dip]] is less than 5°; on the French side this increases to 20°. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist; on the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.21–50&quot;/&gt;

The Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964–65 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage [[adit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.21–50&quot;/&gt; The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.21–50&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 21–50&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveying ===
Marine soundings and samplings by Thomé de Gamond were carried out during 1833–67, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&amp;nbsp;marine and 70&amp;nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.22–26&quot;/&gt; Surveys were undertaken in 1958–1959, 1964–1965, 1972–1974 and 1986–1988.

The surveying in 1958–59 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964–65 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&amp;nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.22–26&quot;/&gt;

Given the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972–73 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986–87 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.22–26&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 22–26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tunnelling ===
[[File:Eurotunnel schema (empty service).svg|thumb|Typical cross section, with the service tunnel between the two rail tunnels; shown linking the rail tunnels is a piston relief duct, necessary to manage changes in air pressure caused by the very fast movement of trains]]

Tunnelling was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, which opened in 1988. A serious health and safety risk with building tunnels underwater is major water inflow due to the high [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic pressure]] from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.

The objective was to construct two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}}  service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} in diameter connecting the rail tunnels {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 63–128&lt;/ref&gt; with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in [[Seattle]]; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.

Precast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson p.38&quot;&gt;Wilson p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff – same place as the marine tunnels – not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the [[Isle of Grain]] in the Thames estuary,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot;/&gt; which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the [[Foster Yeoman]] coastal super quarry at [[Glensanda]] in [[Loch Linnhe]] on the west coast of Scotland.

On the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance [[Tunnel boring machine|TBMs]] with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot;/&gt; This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland geol pp.29&quot;&gt;Kirkland p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.63–128&quot;/&gt; Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson p. 44&quot;&gt;Wilson p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.117–128&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 117–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the English machines, which were given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, Séverine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | first = Pierre-Jean | last = Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher = pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate = 19 July 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326113849/http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | archive-date = 26 March 2009 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the tunnelling, one machine was on display at the side of the M20 motorway in [[Folkestone]] until [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] sold it on eBay for £39,999 to a scrap metal merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotunnel.com/build/ |title=How the Channel Tunnel was Built |publisher=Eurotunnel Le Shuttle |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another machine (T4 &quot;Virginie&quot;) still survives on the French side, adjacent to Junction 41 on the [[A16 autoroute|A16]], in the middle of the D243E3/D243E4 roundabout. On it are the words &quot;hommage aux bâtisseurs du tunnel&quot;, meaning &quot;tribute to the builders of the tunnel&quot;.

=== TBM Design ===
The 11 TBM's were designed and manufactured through a joint venture between Robbins Company of Kent, [[Markham &amp; Co.]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]].

=== Railway design ===

====Loading Gauge====

The loading gauge height is {{convert|5.75|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.273361.1397150299!/Menu/general/column-content/attachment/Fran-Scan%20(G2%20PC%20450)%20-%20A%20Hi-Cube%20Intermodal%20Corridor%20to%20Link%20Britain,%20France%20and%20Scandinavia%20-%20KTH%20Boysen%202011-11-30%20rev%201930.pdf |title= Fran-Scan (G2, P/C 450) – A Hi-Cube Intermodal Corridor to Link the UK, France and Scandinavia |last= Boysen |first= Hans |year= 2011 |department= Department of Transport Science Royal Institute of Technology |publisher= KTH Railway Group, Center for research and education in railway technology |page= 16 |access-date= 8 February 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124034/https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.273361.1397150299!/Menu/general/column-content/attachment/Fran-Scan%20(G2%20PC%20450)%20-%20A%20Hi-Cube%20Intermodal%20Corridor%20to%20Link%20Britain,%20France%20and%20Scandinavia%20-%20KTH%20Boysen%202011-11-30%20rev%201930.pdf |archive-date= 9 February 2019 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communications ====
There are three communication systems: concession radio (CR) for mobile vehicles and personnel within Eurotunnel's Concession (terminals, tunnels, coastal shafts); track-to-train radio (TTR) for secure speech and data between trains and the railway control centre; Shuttle internal radio (SIR) for communication between shuttle crew and to passengers over car radios.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.129–132&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt; This service was discontinued within one year of opening because of drivers' difficulty setting their radios to the correct frequency (88.8&amp;nbsp;MHz).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==== Power supply ====
Power is delivered to the locomotives via an [[overhead line]] (catenary)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.134–148&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 134–148&lt;/ref&gt; at [[25 kV AC railway electrification|{{nowrap|25 kV 50 Hz}}]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki_railelectric&quot;&gt;Article: Railway electric traction 9 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with a normal overhead clearance of {{convert|6.3|m|ftin}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.273361.1397150299!/Menu/general/column-content/attachment/Fran-Scan%20(G2%20PC%20450)%20-%20A%20Hi-Cube%20Intermodal%20Corridor%20to%20Link%20Britain,%20France%20and%20Scandinavia%20-%20KTH%20Boysen%202011-11-30%20rev%201930.pdf |title= Fran-Scan (G2, P/C 450) – A Hi-Cube Intermodal Corridor to Link the UK, France and Scandinavia |last= Boysen |first= Hans |year= 2011 |department= Department of Transport Science Royal Institute of Technology |publisher= KTH Railway Group, Center for research and education in railway technology |page= 16 |access-date= 8 February 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124034/https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.273361.1397150299!/Menu/general/column-content/attachment/Fran-Scan%20(G2%20PC%20450)%20-%20A%20Hi-Cube%20Intermodal%20Corridor%20to%20Link%20Britain,%20France%20and%20Scandinavia%20-%20KTH%20Boysen%202011-11-30%20rev%201930.pdf |archive-date= 9 February 2019 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; All tunnel services run on electricity, shared equally from English and French sources. There are two sub-stations fed at 400 kV at each terminal, but in an emergency the tunnel's lighting (about 20,000 light fittings) and plant can be powered solely from either England or France.{{sfn|Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|1994|p=9}}

The traditional railway south of London uses a 750&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;DC [[third rail]] to deliver electricity, but since the opening of [[High Speed 1]] there is no longer any need for tunnel trains to use the third rail system. High Speed 1, the tunnel and the [[LGV Nord]] all have power provided via overhead catenary at 25&amp;nbsp;kV&amp;nbsp;50&amp;nbsp;Hz. The railways on &quot;classic&quot; lines in Belgium are also electrified by overhead wires, but at 3000&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;DC.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki_railelectric&quot;/&gt;

==== Signalling ====
A cab signalling system gives information directly to train drivers on a display. There is a [[train protection system]] that stops the train if the speed exceeds that indicated on the in-cab display. [[Transmission Voie-Machine|TVM430]], as used on [[LGV Nord]] and [[High Speed 1]], is used in the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.149–155&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 149–155&lt;/ref&gt; The TVM signalling is interconnected with the signalling on the high-speed lines either side, allowing trains to enter and exit the tunnel system without stopping. The maximum speed is {{nowrap|160 km/h}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiki_de-eurotunnel&quot;&gt;Article-de: Eurotunnel#Betrieb 9 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Signalling in the tunnel is coordinated from two control centres:  The main control centre at the Folkestone terminal, and a backup at the Calais terminal, which is staffed at all times and can take over all operations in the event of a breakdown or emergency.

==== Track system ====
{{Technical|section|date=May 2014}}
Conventional ballasted tunnel-track was ruled out owing to the difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision.  The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100&amp;nbsp;kg support the rails every 60&amp;nbsp;cm and are held by 12&amp;nbsp;mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.&lt;ref name=&quot;bonnett782&quot;&gt;Bonnett 2005, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60&amp;nbsp;kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on {{convert|6|mm|1|abbr=on}} rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.

Maintenance activities are less than projected. Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built; 150 m long, 10 m high and 18 m wide. The English crossover is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from Sangatte.{{sfn|Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|1994|p=14}}

==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====
The ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.{{sfn|Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|1994|p=8}}

==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====
{{Main|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}

Initially 38&amp;nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train. The shuttles have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and 12 carrier wagons. Eurotunnel's original order was for nine tourist shuttles.

[[Heavy goods vehicle]] (HGV) shuttles also have two halves, with each half containing one loading wagon, one unloading wagon and 14&amp;nbsp;carrier wagons. There is a [[Lounge car|club car]] behind the leading locomotive. Eurotunnel originally ordered six HGV shuttle rakes.

==== Freight locomotives ====
{{See also|British Rail Class 92}}

Forty-six Class 92 locomotives for hauling freight trains and overnight passenger trains (the [[Nightstar (train)|Nightstar]] project, which was abandoned) were commissioned, running on both overhead AC and [[third rail|third-rail]] DC power. However, [[Réseau Ferré de France|RFF]] does not let these run on French railways, so there are plans to certify Alstom [[Prima II]] locomotives for use in the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/freight/single-view/view/prima-ii-tested-in-the-channel-tunnel.html|accessdate=1 October 2012|title=Prima II tested in the Channel Tunnel|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International passenger ====
{{Main|British Rail Class 373|British Rail Class 374}}
Thirty-one [[Eurostar]] trains, based on the [[Train à Grande Vitesse|French TGV]], built to UK [[loading gauge]] with many modifications for safety within the tunnel, were commissioned, with ownership split between British Rail, [[SNCF|French national railways]] (SNCF) and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian national railways]] (SNCB). [[British Rail]] ordered seven more for services north of London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.175–211&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 175–211&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2010, Eurostar ordered ten trains from [[Siemens]] based on its [[Siemens Velaro|Velaro]] product.

Germany (DB) has since around 2005 tried to get permission to run train services to London. At the end of 2009, extensive fire-proofing requirements were dropped and DB received permission to run German [[Intercity-Express]] (ICE) test trains through the tunnel. In June 2013 DB was granted access to the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/passenger/single-view/view/igc-grants-deutsche-bahn-access-to-channel-tunnel.html |title = IGC grants Deutsche Bahn access to Channel Tunnel| publisher = railwaygazette.com|date = 13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 the plans were shelved, because there are special safety rules that requires custom made trains (DB calls them [[ICE 3#Class 407|Class 407]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/high-speed/db-puts-london-%E2%80%93-frankfurt-high-speed-plans-on-ice.html|title=DB puts London – Frankfurt plans on ice|publisher=railjournal.com|date=19 February 2014|access-date=31 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728104513/http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/high-speed/db-puts-london-%E2%80%93-frankfurt-high-speed-plans-on-ice.html|archive-date=28 July 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Service locomotives ====
[[Diesel locomotive]]s for rescue and shunting work are [[Eurotunnel Class 0001]] and [[Eurotunnel Class 0031]].

[[File:Folkestone White Horse cropped.jpg|thumb|The [[Folkestone White Horse]] viewed at Cheriton terminal]]

Transport services offered by the tunnel are as follows:

* [[Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Le Shuttle]] roll-on roll-off shuttle service for road vehicles and their drivers and passengers,
* [[Eurostar]] passenger trains,
* through freight trains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Britain on the edge of Europe | last = Chisholm | first = Michael | year = 1995 | publisher=Routledge | location = London | isbn = 0-415-11921-9 | page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the freight and passenger traffic forecasts that led to the construction of the tunnel were overestimated; in particular, Eurotunnel's commissioned forecasts were over-predictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 22&quot;/&gt; Although the captured share of Channel crossings was forecast correctly, high competition (especially from budget airlines which expanded rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s) and reduced tariffs led to low revenue. Overall cross-Channel traffic was overestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anguera 2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/geographyandenvironmentalscience/GP172.pdf |title=The Channel Tunnel and its impact on Tourism in the United Kingdom|last=Sen|first=Soutetsu |date=February 2004|website=|series=Geographical Paper No. 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[European Union|EU's]] liberalisation of international rail services, the tunnel and [[High Speed 1]] have been open to competition since 2010. There have been a number of [[High Speed 1#Future operations|operators interested in running trains]] through the tunnel and along High Speed 1 to London. In June 2013, after several years, [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] obtained a licence to operate Frankfurt – London trains, not expected to run before 2016 because of delivery delays of the custom-made trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/igc-grants-deutsche-bahn-access-to-channel-tunnel.html |title=IGC grants Deutsche Bahn access to Channel Tunnel|author=DVV Media UK|work=Railway Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Passenger traffic volumes ====
Cross-tunnel passenger traffic volumes peaked at 18.4&amp;nbsp;million in 1998, dropped to 14.9&amp;nbsp;million in 2003 and has increased substantially since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETtraffic6yr&quot;/&gt;

At the time of the decision about building the tunnel, 15.9&amp;nbsp;million passengers were predicted for Eurostar trains in the opening year. In 1995, the first full year, actual numbers were a little over 2.9&amp;nbsp;million, growing to 7.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2000, then dropping to 6.3&amp;nbsp;million in 2003. Eurostar was initially limited by the lack of a high-speed connection on the British side. After the completion of High Speed 1 in two stages in 2003 and 2007, traffic increased. In 2008, Eurostar carried 9,113,371 passengers, a 10% increase over the previous year, despite traffic limitations due to the [[2008 Channel Tunnel fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ETreport2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurotunnel.com | title = Eurotunnel 2008 traffic and revenue figures | date = 15 January 2009 | publisher=[[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] | accessdate =15 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurostar passenger numbers continued to increase.

==== Freight traffic volumes ====
Freight volumes have been erratic, with a major decrease during 1997 due to a closure caused by a fire in a freight shuttle. Freight crossings increased over the period, indicating the substitutability of the tunnel by sea crossings. The tunnel has achieved a market share close to or above Eurotunnel's 1980s predictions but Eurotunnel's 1990 and 1994 predictions were overestimates.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

For through freight trains, the first year prediction was 7.2&amp;nbsp;million gross tonnes; the actual 1995 figure was 1.3M gross tonnes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 22&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Through freight volumes peaked in 1998 at 3.1M tonnes. This fell back to 1.21M tonnes in 2007, increasing slightly to 1.24M tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETreport2008&quot;/&gt; Together with that carried on freight shuttles, freight growth has occurred since opening, with 6.4M tonnes carried in 1995, 18.4M tonnes recorded in 2003&lt;ref name=&quot;Anguera 2006&quot;/&gt; and 19.6M tonnes in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ETtraffic5yr&quot;/&gt; Numbers fell back in the wake of the 2008 fire.

Eurotunnel's freight subsidiary is [[Europorte 2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AFX Europorte&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Eurotunnel gets backing for freight service |work=AFX | agency=Agence France-Presse | date = 28 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006 EWS, the UK's largest rail freight operator, announced that owing to cessation of UK-French government subsidies of £52&amp;nbsp;million per annum to cover the tunnel &quot;Minimum User Charge&quot; (a subsidy of around £13,000 per train, at a traffic level of 4,000&amp;nbsp;trains per annum), freight trains would stop running after 30 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times cash row&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article626416.ece | title = Chunnel cash row threatens freight trains | first=Dominic | last=O'Connell |work=The Times |location=UK | date = 3 September 2006 | accessdate =3 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economic performance ====
Shares in Eurotunnel were issued at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price had risen to £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during demonstration runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.josephcoates.com/pdf_files/268_Megaprojects_and_Risk.pdf | title = Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition | publisher=josephcoates.com | accessdate =19 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34&amp;nbsp;years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg p. 32–34&quot;&gt;Flyvbjerg et al. pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt; A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would have been better off if it had not been constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anguera 2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyvbjerg&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Flyvbjerg, B. Buzelius |author2=N. Rothengatter, W | year = 2003 | title = Megaprojects and Risk | location = Cambridge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | pages = 68–69 | isbn = 0-521-00946-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the Concession, Eurotunnel was obliged to investigate a cross-Channel road tunnel. In December 1999 road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the British and French governments, but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Link Birm&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Eurotunnel unveils plans for second link | work=[[Birmingham Post]] | date = 6 January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-way treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Belgium governs border controls, with the establishment of ''control zones'' wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers. For most purposes these are at either end of the tunnel, with the French border controls on the UK side of the tunnel and vice versa. For some city-to-city trains, the train is a control zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPS zones&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section2/chapter_f.html#_Toc44570638 |title=The CPS: Channel Tunnel |accessdate=11 March 2008 |work=Crown Prosecution Service |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220234954/http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/section2/chapter_f.html |archivedate=20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A binational emergency plan coordinates UK and French emergency activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.311&quot;&gt;Kirkland p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Security ====
There is a need for full [[passport]] controls, since this is the border between the [[Schengen Area]] and the [[Common Travel Area]]. There are [[juxtaposed controls]], meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are placed only at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]], while British officials operate at [[Gare de Calais-Fréthun|Calais-Fréthun]], [[Lille-Europe]], [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] and [[Gare du Nord|Paris-Gare du Nord]].  There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.

For Eurostar trains travelling from places south of Paris, there is no passport and security check before departure, and those trains must stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are done on board. There have been plans for services from [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille. A direct service from London to Amsterdam started on 4 April 2018; following the building of check-in terminals at Amsterdam and Rotterdam and intergovernmental agreement, a direct service from the two Dutch cities to London will start on 30 April 2020.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

The reason for juxtaposed controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because a check of all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates long queues if done at arrival.

===No-deal Brexit plan===

Under a planned legislation which was published on 12 February 2019, it will give the UK and France time to renegotiate the terms under which the railway service operates. Trains will be permitted to use the Channel Tunnel for three months if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, under a proposed [[European Commission]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-47215904|title=Brexit: No-deal plan for Channel Tunnel operations|work=BBC News|date=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminals ==
{{Main|Eurotunnel Calais Terminal|Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal}}

[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|Car being driven onto a shuttle carriage at the French terminal in [[Coquelles]]]]

The terminals' sites are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and [[Coquelles]] (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&amp;nbsp;cars and 113&amp;nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]] for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging.

The French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.255–270&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 255–270&lt;/ref&gt; At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of main-line track, 45&amp;nbsp;turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track and 44&amp;nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.157–174&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 157–174&lt;/ref&gt; There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].

== Regional impact ==
A 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU reg impact 220-222&quot;&gt;European Commission pp. 220–222&lt;/ref&gt; Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of [[Ashford International railway station]], without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU reg impact 248-252&quot;&gt;European Commission pp. 248–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'.

== Illegal immigration ==
{{see also|Migrants around Calais|Calais Jungle}}
[[Illegal immigration|Illegal immigrants]] and would-be [[asylum seeker]]s have used the tunnel to attempt to enter Britain. By 1997, the problem had attracted international press attention, and by 1999, the [[French Red Cross]] opened the first migrant centre at [[Sangatte]], using a [[warehouse]] once used for tunnel construction; by 2002, it housed up to 1,500&amp;nbsp;people at a time, most of them trying to get to the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2002_2/sangatte.html | title = Sangatte: A place of hope and despair | first=Pierre | last=Kremer | publisher=The Magazine of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] |date = February 2002| accessdate =4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, most came from [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], and [[Iran]], but African countries were also represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strangers&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,595996,00.html | title = Strangers in a strange land | first=Caryl | last=Phillips |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 17 November 2001 | accessdate =4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurotunnel, the company that operates the crossing, said that more than 37,000 migrants were intercepted between January and July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/30/world/europe/britain-and-france-scramble-as-channel-crossing-attempts-by-migrants-continue.html|title=Britain and France Scramble as Channel Becomes Choke Point in Migration Crisis|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 3,000 migrants, mainly from [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Sudan]] and [[Afghanistan]], were living in the temporary camps erected in Calais at the time of an official count in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/29/calais-one-dead-1500-migrants-storm-eurotunnel-terminal|title=Calais: man killed as migrants make 1,500 attempts to enter Eurotunnel site|last=Singapore|first=Jessica Elgot Patrick Wintour in|date=29 July 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=7 September 2017|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 migrants were waiting in Calais for a chance to get to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/more-refugees-attempt-to-reach-britain-through-channel-tunnel/a-18617292|title=More refugees attempt to reach Britain through Channel Tunnel {{!}} News {{!}} DW {{!}} 30 July 2015|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain and France operate a system of [[juxtaposed controls]] on immigration and customs, where investigations happen before travel. France is part of the [[Schengen Agreement]], which has largely abolished border checks between member nations, but the United Kingdom is not.

Most illegal immigrants and would-be asylum seekers who got into Britain found some way to ride a freight train. Trucks are loaded onto freight trains. In a few instances, groups of migrants were able to [[stowaway|stow away]] in the cargo area of a tanker truck carrying liquid [[chocolate]] and managed to survive, though they did not enter the UK in one attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the facilities were fenced, airtight security was deemed impossible; migrants would even jump from bridges onto moving trains. In several incidents people were injured during the crossing; others tampered with railway equipment, causing delays and requiring repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/07/31/immigration.daring/index.html | title = Desperate journeys fraught with danger | first = Avril | last = Stephens | publisher = CNN | date = 31 July 2007 | accessdate = 4 August 2006 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070624230120/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/07/31/immigration.daring/index.html | archivedate = 24 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurotunnel said it was losing £5m per month because of the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Notorious&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://212.58.226.40/1/hi/uk/2003977.stm | title = Europe's most notorious refugee camp |work=BBC News   | date = 12 July 2002 | accessdate =5 August 2006 }} {{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 and 2002, several riots broke out at Sangatte, and groups of migrants (up to 550 in a December 2001 incident) stormed the fences and attempted to enter ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/27/immigration.uk | title = Police braced for new tunnel raid | first=Paul | last=Webster |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 27 December 2007 | accessdate =4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other migrants use the Eurostar passenger train.

=== Diplomatic efforts ===
Local authorities in both France and the UK called for the closure of the Sangatte migrant camp, and [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] twice sought an injunction against the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Cross&quot;/&gt; The United Kingdom blamed France for allowing Sangatte to open, and France blamed both the UK for its lax asylum rules, and the EU for not having a uniform immigration policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Notorious&quot;/&gt; The ''[[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]]'' nature of the problem even included journalists detained as they followed migrants onto railway property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=/KW0001/KW0003/KW0060/&amp;year=2001  | title = 2001 World Press Freedom Review: France  | publisher = International Press Institute  | accessdate = 4 August 2006  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024205028/http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/freedom_detail.html?country=%2FKW0001%2FKW0003%2FKW0060%2F&amp;year=2001  | archivedate = 24 October 2007  | url-status = dead  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, after the [[European Commission]] told France that it was in breach of [[European Union]] rules on the free transfer of goods because of the delays and closures as a result of its poor security, a double fence was built at a cost of £5&amp;nbsp;million, reducing the numbers of migrants detected each week reaching Britain on goods trains from 250 to almost none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2282306.stm | title = Sangatte asylum talks due |work=BBC News | date = 26 September 2002 | accessdate =4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other measures included [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras and increased police patrols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2017789.stm | title = Tunnel security to be tightened |work=BBC News | date = 31 May 2002 | accessdate =4 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2002, the Sangatte centre was closed after the UK agreed to absorb some migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1408494/Blunkett-reaches-deal-to-shut-Sangatte-camp.html | title = Blunkett reaches deal to shut Sangatte camp |first1=Philip Delves |last1=Broughton |first2=Andrew |last2=Sparrow |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = 27 September 2002 | accessdate =25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Calais mayor threatens to block port if UK fails to help deal with migrants  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/03/calais-mayor-threatens-block-port-uk-fails-help-migrants |work=The Guardian |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds seeking to reach Britain made use of the situation to attempt to stow away inside and underneath transport trucks destined for the United Kingdom. Extra security measures included a £2 million upgrade of detection technology, £1 million extra for dog searches, and £12 million (over three years) towards a joint fund with France for security surrounding the Port of Calais.

=== Fires ===
{{Main|1996 Channel Tunnel fire|2008 Channel Tunnel fire}}

There have been three fires in the tunnel, all on the heavy goods vehicle (HGV) shuttles, that were significant enough to close the tunnel, as well as other more minor incidents.

On 9 December 1994, during an &quot;invitation only&quot; testing phase, a fire broke out in a [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] car whilst its owner was loading it onto the upper deck of a tourist shuttle. The fire started at about 10:00,{{when|date=March 2017}} with the shuttle train stationary in the Folkestone terminal and was put out about 40 minutes later with no passenger injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/fire-raises-channel-tunnel-fears-1389084.html | title = Fire raises Channel Tunnel fears | first = Christian | last = Wolmar | date = 10 December 1994 | accessdate =25 December 2009|work=The Independent | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 1996, a fire broke out on an HGV shuttle wagon in the tunnel, but nobody was seriously hurt.

=== Train failures ===
On the night of 19/20 February 1996, about 1,000 passengers became trapped in the Channel Tunnel when [[Eurostar]] [[British Rail Class 373|trains]] from London broke down owing to failures of electronic circuits caused by snow and ice being deposited and then melting on the circuit boards.&lt;ref name=&quot;1996-snow&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/wrong-kind-of-snow-in-tunnel-1320248.html | title = Wrong kind of snow in tunnel... | last = Wolmar | first = Christian | date = 22 February 1996 |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate =21 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
The [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]] is responsible for some aspects of safety regulation in the tunnel; it reports to the [[Intergovernmental Commission]] (IGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channeltunneligc.co.uk/The-CTSA.html?lang=en |title=The Channel Tunnel Safety Authority |work=Channel Tunnel Intergovernmental Commission |year=2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service tunnel is used for access to technical equipment in cross-passages and equipment rooms, to provide fresh-air ventilation and for emergency evacuation. The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. &quot;Pods&quot; with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|–|5|tonne}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to {{convert|1|tonne}} can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.247–254&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 247–254&lt;/ref&gt;

The three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.212–230&quot;/&gt;

Trains travelling at high speed create [[piston effect]] pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.212–230&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 212–230&lt;/ref&gt; Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&amp;nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT experience&quot;&gt;The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station – now part of the [[Building Research Establishment]] – to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland pp.231–240&quot;&gt;Kirkland pp. 231–240&lt;/ref&gt; The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&amp;nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&amp;nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or [[ultraviolet radiation]], smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |work=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel, unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome. Eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel. Two STTS (Service Tunnel Transportation System)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/glossary/#s | title = Glossary | access-date = 24 August 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120815011501/http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uk/the-channel-tunnel/glossary/#s | archive-date = 15 August 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times, with a maximum delay of 10&amp;nbsp;minutes before they reach a burning train.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirkland fire&quot;/&gt;

== Mobile network coverage ==
Since 2012, French operators [[Bouygues Telecom]], [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] and [[SFR]] have covered Running Tunnel South, the tunnel bore normally used for travel from France to Britain.

In January 2014, UK operators [[EE Limited|EE]] and [[Vodafone UK|Vodafone]] signed ten-year contracts with [[Eurotunnel]] for Running Tunnel North.  The agreements will enable both operators' subscribers to use [[2G]] and [[3G]] services. Both EE and Vodafone planned to offer [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services on the route; EE said it expected to cover the route with LTE connectivity by summer 2014. EE and Vodafone will offer Channel Tunnel network coverage for travellers from the UK to France. Eurotunnel said it also held talks with [[Three UK]] but has yet to reach an agreement with the operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.telecoms.com/210882/ee-and-vodafone-offer-channel-tunnel-network-coverage/ | title =EE and Vodafone offer Channel Tunnel network coverage | first=Dawinderpal | last=Sahota |publisher=Telecoms.com | date = 9 January 2014 | accessdate =11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Eurotunnel announced that they had installed equipment from [[Alcatel-Lucent]] to cover Running Tunnel North and simultaneously to provide mobile service ([[GSM]] 900/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz and [[UMTS]] 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz) by EE, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Vodafone. The service of EE and Vodafone commenced on the same date as the announcement. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; service was expected to be available soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uploadedFiles/assets-uk/Media/Press-Releases/2014-Press-Releases/060514.TelMobileTunnelSud.pdf |title=Eurotunnel completes mobile telephone and internet connections in Channel Tunnel |format=PDF |publisher=Eurotunnel |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=7 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030404/http://www.eurotunnelgroup.com/uploadedFiles/assets-uk/Media/Press-Releases/2014-Press-Releases/060514.TelMobileTunnelSud.pdf |archive-date=8 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, EE announced that it had previously switched on LTE earlier in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ee.co.uk/our-company/newsroom/2014/11/21/4g-from-ee-live-in-the-channel-tunnel |title=4G From EE Live in the Channel Tunnel |publisher=EE |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; turned on 2G, 3G and [[4G]] services in November 2014, whilst Vodafone's 4G was due to go live later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2014/11/21/o2-first-uk-operator-to-provide-full-network-access-in-eurotunnel/ |title=EE and O2 now providing full 2G, 3G, and 4G access in Eurotunnel |first=Michael |last=Garwood |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205162247/http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2014/11/21/o2-first-uk-operator-to-provide-full-network-access-in-eurotunnel/ |archive-date=5 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
