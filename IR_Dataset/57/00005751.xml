'''Chinese''' ({{zh |s = 汉语 |t = 漢語 |p = Hànyǔ |l = [[Han Chinese|Han]] language }}; or especially though not exclusively for written Chinese: {{zh |c = 中文 |p = Zhōngwén |l = Chinese writing |links = no |labels = no }}) is a group of '''languages''' that forms the [[Varieties of Chinese|Sinitic]] branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. Chinese languages are spoken by the ethnic [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] majority and many minority ethnic groups in [[China]]. About 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their [[first language]]. 

The [[varieties of Chinese]] are usually considered by native speakers to be regional variants of ethnic Chinese speech, without consideration of whether they are [[mutually intelligible]]. Due to their lack of mutual intelligibility, linguists generally describe them as distinct languages, perhaps hundreds, sometimes noting that they are more varied than the [[Romance languages]].{{efn|Various examples include:
* David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 312. &quot;The mutual unintelligibility of the varieties is the main ground for referring to them as separate languages.&quot;
* Charles N. Li, Sandra A. Thompson. ''Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar'' (1989), p.&amp;nbsp;2. &quot;The Chinese language family is genetically classified as an independent branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family.&quot;
* {{harvp|Norman|1988|p=1}}. &quot;[...] the modern Chinese dialects are really more like a family of languages [...]&quot;
* {{harvp|DeFrancis|1984|p=56}}. &quot;To call Chinese a single language composed of dialects with varying degrees of difference is to mislead by minimizing disparities that according to Chao are as great as those between English and Dutch. To call Chinese a family of languages is to suggest extralinguistic differences that in fact do not exist and to overlook the unique linguistic situation that exists in China.&quot;
Linguists in China often use a formulation introduced by [[Fu Maoji]] in the ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'': “{{Lang|zh|汉语在语言系属分类中相当于一个语族的地位。}}” (&quot;In language classification, Chinese has a status equivalent to a language family.&quot;){{sfnp|Mair|1991|pp=10, 21}}
}} Investigation of the historical relationships among the Sinitic languages is just getting started. Currently, most classifications posit 7 to 13 main regional groups, based on often superficial phonetic developments, of which the most populous by far is [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (about 800 million speakers, e.g. [[Southwestern Mandarin]]), followed by [[Min Chinese|Min]] (75 million, e.g. [[Southern Min]]), [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (74 million, e.g. [[Shanghainese]]), [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (68 million, e.g. [[Cantonese]]).{{sfnp|Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|2012|pp=3, 125}} These groups are unintelligible to each other, and generally many of their subgroups are mutually unintelligible as well (e.g., not only is Min Chinese a family of mutually unintelligible languages, but [[Southern Min]] itself is not a single language). There are, however, several transitional areas, where languages and dialects from different branches share enough features for some limited intelligibility between neighboring areas. Examples are [[New Xiang]] and [[Southwest Mandarin]], [[Xuanzhou Wu]] and [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] and [[Central Plains Mandarin]], and certain divergent dialects of [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] with [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] (though these are unintelligible with mainstream Hakka). All varieties of Chinese are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] to at least some degree and largely [[Analytic language|analytic]].

[[Standard Chinese]] ''(Pǔtōnghuà/Guóyǔ/Huáyǔ)'' is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the [[Beijing dialect]] of Mandarin. It is an official language of [[China]], similar to one of the national languages of [[Taiwan]] ([[Taiwanese Mandarin]]) and one of the four [[Languages of Singapore|official languages]] of [[Singapore]]. It is one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]]. The [[written Chinese|written form]] of the standard language ({{lang|zh|中文}}; ''Zhōngwén''), based on the [[logograms]] known as [[Chinese characters]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|汉字}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|漢字}}; ''Hànzì''), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.

The earliest Chinese written records are [[Shang dynasty]]-era oracle inscriptions, which can be traced back to 1250 BCE. The phonetic categories of [[Archaic Chinese]] can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. During the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period, [[Middle Chinese]] went through several [[sound changes]] and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. ''[[Qieyun]]'', a [[rime dictionary]], recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated using a [[koiné language]] ([[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Guanhua]]) based on [[Nanjing dialect]] of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]]. [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted in the 1930s, and is now an official language of both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.

== Classification ==
Linguists classify all varieties of Chinese as part of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]], together with [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] and many other languages spoken in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Southeast Asian Massif]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=12–13}} Although the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]. Difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of [[inflection]] in many of them, and the effects of language contact. In addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, and are often also sensitive [[border zone]]s.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=422, 434–436}} Without a secure reconstruction of proto-Sino-Tibetan, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=426}} A top-level branching into Chinese and [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] is often assumed, but has not been convincingly demonstrated.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=431}}

== History ==
{{main|History of the Chinese language}}
The first written records appeared over 3,000 years ago during the [[Shang dynasty]]. As the language evolved over this period, the various local varieties became mutually unintelligible. In reaction, central governments have repeatedly sought to promulgate a unified standard.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183–185}}

=== Old and Middle Chinese ===
The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on [[oracle bone]]s from around 1250 BCE in the late [[Shang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=1}} [[Old Chinese]] was the language of the [[Western Zhou]] period (1046–771 BCE), recorded in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|inscriptions on bronze artifacts]], the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and portions of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'' and ''[[I Ching]]''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=2–3}} Scholars have attempted to reconstruct the [[phonology of Old Chinese]] by comparing later varieties of Chinese with the rhyming practice of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and the phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=42–45}} Although many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differs from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial [[consonant cluster]]s of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=177}} Most recent reconstructions also describe an atonal language with consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] distinctions in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=181–183}}  Several [[derivational affix]]es have also been identified, but the language lacks [[inflection]], and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and [[grammatical particle]]s.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=12}}

[[Middle Chinese]] was the language used during [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] and the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties (6th through 10th centuries CE). It can be divided into an early period, reflected by the ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[Rime dictionary|rime book]] (601 CE), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by [[rhyme table]]s such as the ''[[Yunjing]]'' constructed by ancient Chinese philologists as a guide to the ''Qieyun'' system.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=14–15}} These works define phonological categories, but with little hint of what sounds they represent.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=125}} Linguists have identified these sounds by comparing the categories with pronunciations in modern [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowed Chinese words]] in Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean, and transcription evidence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34–42}} The resulting system is very complex, with a large number of consonants and vowels, but they are probably not all distinguished in any single dialect. Most linguists now believe it represents a [[diasystem]] encompassing 6th-century northern and southern standards for reading the classics.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=24}}

=== Classical and literary forms ===
{{main|Classical Chinese}}

The relationship between spoken and written Chinese is rather complex. Its spoken varieties have evolved at different rates, while written Chinese itself has changed much less. [[Classical Chinese]] [[literature]] began in the [[Spring and Autumn period]].

=== Rise of northern dialects ===
After the fall of the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] (Jurchen) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech (now called [[Old Mandarin]]) developed based on the dialects of the [[North China Plain]] around the capital.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=48}}
The ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324) was a dictionary that codified the rhyming conventions of new ''[[sanqu]]'' verse form in this language.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48–49}}
Together with the slightly later ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', this dictionary describes a language with many of the features characteristic of modern [[Mandarin dialects]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49–51}}

Up to the early 20th century, most of the people in China spoke only their local variety.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=133, 247}}
As a practical measure, officials of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Guānhuà'' ({{zh|s=官话|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=官話|labels=no}}, literally &quot;language of officials&quot;).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}
For most of this period, this language was a [[Koiné language|koiné]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=549–550}}
By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=540–541}}

In the 1930s a [[Standard Chinese|standard national language]] ''Guóyǔ'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|国语}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|國語}} &quot;national language&quot;) was adopted.
After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic founded in 1949 retained this standard, calling it ''pǔtōnghuà'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|普通话}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|普通話}} &quot;common speech&quot;).{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3–15}} The national language is now used in education, the media, and formal situations in both Mainland China and Taiwan.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=133}} In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the language used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]], although the standard language has become very influential and is being taught in schools.{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}}

=== Influence ===
{{see also|Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sino-Xenic vocabularies}}

[[File:Tripitaka Koreana.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'', a Korean collection of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]]]

The Chinese language has spread to neighbouring countries through a variety of means. Northern Vietnam was incorporated into the [[Han empire]] in 111 BCE, marking the beginning of a [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|period of Chinese control]] that ran almost continuously for a millennium. The [[Four Commanderies of Han|Four Commanderies]] were established in northern Korea in the first century BCE, but disintegrated in the following centuries.{{sfnp|Sohn|Lee|2003|p=23}} [[Chinese Buddhism]] spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, and with it the study of scriptures and literature in [[Literary Chinese]].{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=29–30}} Later Korea, Japan, and Vietnam developed strong central governments modeled on Chinese institutions, with Literary Chinese as the language of administration and scholarship, a position it would retain until the late 19th century in Korea and (to a lesser extent) Japan, and the early 20th century in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=75–77}} Scholars from different lands could communicate, albeit only in writing, using Literary Chinese.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}

Although they used Chinese solely for written communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also extensively imported into the [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages, and today comprise over half of their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98–99}} This massive influx led to changes in the phonological structure of the languages, contributing to the development of [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]ic structure in Japanese{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|pp=120–121}} and the disruption of [[vowel harmony]] in Korean.{{sfnp|Sohn|2001|p=89}}

Borrowed Chinese morphemes have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts, in a similar way to the use of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] roots in European languages.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=146}} Many new compounds, or new meanings for old phrases, were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to name Western concepts and artifacts. These coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages. They have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form. Often different compounds for the same concept were in circulation for some time before a winner emerged, and sometimes the final choice differed between countries.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|p=43}} The proportion of vocabulary of Chinese origin thus tends to be greater in technical, abstract, or formal language. For example, in Japan, [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese words]] account for about 35% of the words in entertainment magazines, over half the words in newspapers, and 60% of the words in science magazines.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=143}}

Vietnam, Korea, and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, initially based on [[Chinese characters]], but later replaced with the ''[[Hangul]]'' alphabet for Korean and supplemented with ''[[kana]]'' syllabaries for Japanese, while Vietnamese continued to be written with the complex ''[[Chữ nôm]]'' script. However, these were limited to popular literature until the late 19th century. Today Japanese is written with a composite script using both Chinese characters (''[[Kanji]]'') and kana. Korean is written exclusively with Hangul in North Korea, and supplementary Chinese characters (''[[Hanja]]'') are increasingly rarely used in South Korea. Vietnamese is written with [[Vietnamese alphabet|a Latin-based alphabet]].

Examples of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|loan words in English]] include &quot;[[tea]]&quot;, from [[Hokkien]] (Min Nan) {{Zh|c=|s=|t=|poj={{linktext|tê}}|labels=no}} ({{Linktext|茶|lang=zh}}), &quot;[[dim sum]]&quot;, from Cantonese ''dim&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' and &quot;[[kumquat]]&quot;, from Cantonese ''gam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;gwat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' ({{Linktext|金橘|lang=zh}}).

== Varieties ==
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese}}
[[File:Map of sinitic languages full-en.svg|upright=2|thumb|right|Range of Chinese dialect groups in China and Taiwan according to the ''Language Atlas of China''{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}]]
&lt;!--This is a summary. Please add new information to [[Varieties of Chinese]].--&gt;
[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}} These varieties form a [[dialect continuum]], in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=189–190}} Generally, mountainous South China exhibits more linguistic diversity than the [[North China Plain]]. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. For instance, [[Wuzhou]] is about {{convert|120|mi|km}} upstream from [[Guangzhou]], but the [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] variety spoken there is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], {{convert|60|mi|km|round=5}} southwest of Guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=23}} In parts of [[Fujian]] the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=188}}

Until the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects are spoken.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}
The vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America spoke the [[Taishan dialect]], from a small coastal area southwest of [[Guangzhou]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}}

Local varieties of Chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely on the basis of the different evolution of [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=53–55}}
* [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], including [[Standard Chinese]], [[Beijing dialect|Pekinese]], [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]], and also the [[Dungan language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]]
* [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], including [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]], [[Suzhou dialect|Suzhounese]], and [[Wenzhounese]]
* [[Gan Chinese|Gan]]
* [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]]
* [[Min Chinese|Min]], including [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhounese]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hokkien]]/[[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]
* [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]
* [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], including [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]]

The classification of [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]], which is used in the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987), distinguishes three further groups:{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55–56}}
* [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], previously included in Mandarin.
* [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]], previously included in Wu.
* [[Pinghua Chinese|Pinghua]], previously included in Yue.

Some varieties remain unclassified, including [[Danzhou dialect]] (spoken in [[Danzhou]], on [[Hainan]] Island), [[Waxianghua]] (spoken in western [[Hunan]]) and [[Shaozhou Tuhua]] (spoken in northern [[Guangdong]]).{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=72–73}}

{{Main|Standard Chinese}}
{{See also|List of territorial entities where Chinese is an official language}}
&lt;!-- This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Standard Chinese]]. --&gt;
[[Standard Chinese]], often called Mandarin, is the official [[standard language]] of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]] (where it is called &quot;Huáyŭ&quot; {{lang|zh-Hans|华语}} or simply Chinese). Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect]], the dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as spoken in [[Beijing]]. The governments of both China and Taiwan intend for speakers of all Chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. Therefore, it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.

In [[mainland China]] and Taiwan, [[diglossia]] has been a common feature. For example, in addition to Standard Chinese, a resident of [[Shanghai]] might speak [[Shanghainese]]; and, if he or she grew up elsewhere, then he or she is also likely to be fluent in the particular dialect of that local area. A native of [[Guangzhou]] may speak both Cantonese and Standard Chinese. In addition to Mandarin, most [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] also speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Minnan]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]], or an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klöter |first=Henning |date=2004 |journal=China Perspectives |volume=56 |issn=1996-4617 |url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/442 |title=Language Policy in the KMT and DPP eras |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Taiwanese may commonly mix pronunciations, phrases, and words from Mandarin and other [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]], and this mixture is considered normal in daily or informal speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kuo |first=Yun-Hsuan |date=2005 |title=New dialect formation : the case of Taiwanese Mandarin |type=PhD |trans-title= |chapter= |publisher=University of Essex |docket= |oclc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/YUN-HSUAN_KUO |access-date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nomenclature ===
The official Chinese designation for the major branches of Chinese is ''fāngyán'' ({{lang|zh|方言}}, literally &quot;regional speech&quot;), whereas the more closely related varieties within these are called ''dìdiǎn fāngyán'' ({{lang|zh-hans|地点方言}}/{{lang|zh-hant|地點方言}} &quot;local speech&quot;).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}} Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use ''dialect'' for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) and ''dialect group'' for a regional grouping such as Mandarin or Wu.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}} Because varieties from different groups are not [[mutually intelligible]], some scholars prefer to describe Wu and others as separate languages.{{sfnp|Thomason|1988|pp=27–28}}{{better source|reason=This claim needs a source specifically saying that scholars do this and for this reason|date=June 2015}} [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] called this practice misleading, pointing out that Wu, which itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties, could not be properly called a single language under the same criterion, and that the same is true for each of the other groups.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}}

Mutual intelligibility is considered by some linguists to be the main criterion for determining whether varieties are separate languages or dialects of a single language,{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=17}} although others do not regard it as decisive,{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=54}}{{sfnp|Romaine|2000|pp=13, 23}}{{sfnp|Wardaugh|Fuller|2014|pp=28–32}}{{sfnp|Liang|2014|pp=11–14}}{{sfnp|Hymes|1971|p=64}} particularly when cultural factors interfere as they do with Chinese.{{sfnp|Thomason|1988|p=27}} As {{Harvcoltxt|Campbell|2008}} explains, linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety (i.e. [[prestige variety]], such as [[Standard Mandarin]]), as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity.{{sfnp|Campbell|2008|p=637}} [[John DeFrancis]] argues that it is inappropriate to refer to Mandarin, Wu and so on as &quot;dialects&quot; because the mutual unintelligibility between them is too great. On the other hand, he also objects to considering them as separate languages, as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive &quot;religious, economic, political, and other differences&quot; between speakers that exist, for example, between [[French language in Canada|French Catholics]] and English Protestants in Canada, but not between speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin in China, owing to China's near-uninterrupted history of centralized government.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=55–57}}

Because of the difficulties involved in determining the difference between language and dialect, other terms have been proposed. These include ''vernacular'',{{sfnp|Haugen|1966|p=927}} ''[[lect]]'', &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|1973|p=11}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Groves|2008|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''regionalect'',{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}} ''topolect'',{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=7}} and ''[[language variety|variety]]''.{{sfnp|Hudson|1996|p=22}}

Most Chinese people consider the spoken varieties as one single language because speakers share a common culture and history, as well as a shared national identity and a common written form.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=7–8}} To Chinese nationalists, the idea of Chinese as a language family may suggest that the Chinese identity is much more fragmented and disunified than their belief and as such is often looked upon as culturally and politically provocative.

== Phonology ==
{{Further|Standard Chinese phonology|Historical Chinese phonology|Varieties of Chinese#Phonology}}

[[File:Edmund Yeo - voice - ch 150127 1828.wav|thumb|Spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]]]]

The [[phonology|phonological]] structure of each syllable consists of a [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] that has a [[vowel]] (which can be a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or even a [[triphthong]] in certain varieties), preceded by an [[syllable onset|onset]] (a single [[consonant]], or consonant+[[semivowel|glide]]; zero onset is also possible), and followed (optionally) by a [[syllable coda|coda]] consonant; a syllable also carries a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. An example of this is in [[Cantonese]], where the [[nasal stop|nasal]] [[sonorant]] consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} can stand alone as their own syllable.

In Mandarin much more than in other spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda (assuming that a final [[semivowel|glide]] is not analyzed as a coda), but syllables that do have codas are restricted to nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, the retroflex approximant {{IPA|/ɻ /}}, and voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, or {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as [[Standard Chinese]], are limited to only {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ɻ /}}.

The number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from [[Middle Chinese]]. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as English.{{efn|{{harvp|DeFrancis|1984|p=42}} counts Chinese as having 1,277 tonal syllables, and about 398 to 418 if tones are disregarded; he cites Jespersen, Otto (1928) ''Monosyllabism in English''; London, p.&amp;nbsp;15 for a count of over 8000 syllables for English.|name=DeFrancis p42}}

=== Tones ===
All varieties of spoken Chinese use [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] to distinguish words.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=52}}{{efn|A word pronounced in a wrong tone or inaccurate tone sounds as puzzling as if one said ''bud'' in English, meaning 'not good' or 'the thing one sleeps in.'&quot;{{sfnp|Chao|1948|p=24}}|name=Chao p24}} A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 12 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]] which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned [[pitch accent]] system much like modern Japanese.

A very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese is the application of the four tones of [[Standard Chinese]] (along with the neutral tone) to the syllable ''ma''. The tones are exemplified by the following five Chinese words:

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Chinese grammar}}
{{See also|Chinese classifiers}}

Chinese is often described as a &quot;monosyllabic&quot; language. However, this is only partially correct. It is largely accurate when describing [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]; in Classical Chinese, for example, perhaps 90% of words correspond to a single syllable and a single character. In the modern varieties, it is usually the case that a [[morpheme]] (unit of meaning) is a single syllable; In contrast, English has plenty of multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as &quot;seven&quot;, &quot;elephant&quot;, &quot;para-&quot; and &quot;-able&quot;.

Some of the conservative southern varieties of modern Chinese have largely monosyllabic words, especially among the more basic vocabulary. In modern Mandarin, however, most [[noun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[verb]]s are largely disyllabic. A significant cause of this is [[Phonetic erosion|phonological attrition]]. [[Sound change]] over time has steadily reduced the number of possible syllables. In modern Mandarin, there are now only about 1,200 possible syllables, including tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (still largely monosyllabic) and over 8,000 in English.{{efn|name=DeFrancis p42}}

This phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of [[homophone]]s. As an example, the small Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary |editor-first= Peter |editor-last= Terrell |publisher= Langenscheidt KG |location= Berlin and Munich |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-1-58573-057-5 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/langenscheidtpoc00lang }}&lt;/ref&gt; lists six words that are commonly pronounced as ''shí'' (tone 2): {{Lang|zh|十}} &quot;ten&quot;; {{zh|s=实|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=實|labels=no}} &quot;real, actual&quot;; {{zh|s=识|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=識|labels=no}} &quot;know (a person), recognize&quot;; {{Lang|zh|石}} &quot;stone&quot;; {{zh|s=时|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時|labels=no}} &quot;time&quot;; {{Lang|zh|食}} &quot;food, eat&quot;. These were all pronounced differently in [[Early Middle Chinese]]; in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|William H. Baxter's transcription]] they were ''dzyip'', ''zyit'', ''syik'', ''dzyek'', ''dzyi'' and ''zyik'' respectively. They are still pronounced differently in today's [[Cantonese]]; in [[Jyutping]] they are ''sap9'', ''sat9'', ''sik7'', ''sek9'', ''si4'', ''sik9''. In modern spoken Mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is; [[Yuen Ren Chao]]'s modern poem [[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]] exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced ''shi''. As such, most of these words have been replaced (in speech, if not in writing) with a longer, less-ambiguous compound. Only the first one, {{Lang|zh|十}} &quot;ten&quot;, normally appears as such when spoken; the rest are normally replaced with, respectively, ''shíjì'' {{zh|s=实际|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=實際|labels=no}} (lit. &quot;actual-connection&quot;); ''rènshi'' {{zh|s=认识|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=認識|labels=no}} (lit. &quot;recognize-know&quot;); ''shítou'' {{zh|s=石头|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=石頭|labels=no}} (lit. &quot;stone-head&quot;); ''shíjiān'' {{zh|s=时间|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時間|labels=no}} (lit. &quot;time-interval&quot;); ''shíwù'' {{Lang|zh|食物}} (lit. &quot;food-thing&quot;). In each case, the homophone was disambiguated by adding another morpheme, typically either a synonym or a generic word of some sort (for example, &quot;head&quot;, &quot;thing&quot;), the purpose of which is simply to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable should be selected.

However, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is generally dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. For example, ''shí'' {{Lang|zh|石}} alone, not ''shítou'' {{zh|s=石头|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=石頭|labels=no}}, appears in compounds meaning &quot;stone-&quot;, for example, ''shígāo'' {{Lang|zh|石膏}} &quot;plaster&quot; (lit. &quot;stone cream&quot;), ''shíhuī'' {{Lang|zh|石灰}} &quot;lime&quot; (lit. &quot;stone dust&quot;), ''shíkū'' {{Lang|zh|石窟}} &quot;grotto&quot; (lit. &quot;stone cave&quot;), ''shíyīng'' {{Lang|zh|石英}} &quot;quartz&quot; (lit. &quot;stone flower&quot;), ''shíyóu'' {{Lang|zh|石油}} &quot;petroleum&quot; (lit. &quot;stone oil&quot;).

Most modern varieties of Chinese have the tendency to form new words through disyllabic, trisyllabic and tetra-character [[compound word|compounds]]. In some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic without compounding, as in ''kūlong'' {{Lang|zh|窟窿}} from ''kǒng'' 孔; this is especially common in [[Jin Chinese|Jin]].

Chinese [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is strictly bound to a set number of [[syllable]]s with a fairly rigid construction. Although many of these single-syllable morphemes (''zì'', {{Lang|zh|字}}) can stand alone as individual [[word (linguistics)|words]], they more often than not form multi-syllabic [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], known as ''cí'' ({{zh|s=词|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=詞|labels=no}}), which more closely resembles the traditional Western notion of a word. A Chinese ''cí'' (&quot;word&quot;) can consist of more than one character-morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.

For example:
* ''yún'' {{zh|s=云|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=雲|labels=no}} – &quot;cloud&quot;
* ''hànbǎobāo'', ''hànbǎo'' {{zh|s=汉堡包|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢堡包|labels=no}}, {{zh|s=汉堡|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢堡|labels=no}} – &quot;hamburger&quot;
* ''wǒ'' {{Lang|zh|我}} – &quot;I, me&quot;
* ''rén'' {{Lang|zh|人}} – &quot;people, human, mankind&quot;
* ''dìqiú'' {{Lang|zh|地球}} – &quot;The Earth&quot;
* ''shǎndiàn'' {{zh|s=闪电|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=閃電|labels=no}} – &quot;lightning&quot;
* ''mèng'' {{zh|s=梦|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=夢|labels=no}} – &quot;dream&quot;

All varieties of modern Chinese are [[analytic language]]s, in that they depend on [[syntax]] (word order and sentence structure) rather than [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]—i.e., changes in form of a word—to indicate the word's function in a sentence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}} In other words, Chinese has very few [[grammatical inflection]]s—it possesses no [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], no [[grammatical voice|voices]], no [[grammatical number|number]]s (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few [[Article (grammar)|articles]] (i.e., equivalents to &quot;the, a, an&quot; in English).{{efn|A distinction is made between {{Lang|zh|他}} as &quot;he&quot; and {{Lang|zh|她}} as &quot;she&quot; in writing, but this is a 20th-century introduction, and both characters are pronounced in exactly the same way.}}

They make heavy use of [[grammatical particle]]s to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. In Mandarin Chinese, this involves the use of particles like ''le'' {{Lang|zh|了}} (perfective), ''hái'' {{zh|s=还|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=還|labels=no}} (&quot;still&quot;), ''yǐjīng'' {{zh|s=已经|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=已經|labels=no}} (&quot;already&quot;), and so on.

Chinese has a [[subject–verb–object]] [[word order]], and like many other [[languages of East Asia]], makes frequent use of the [[topic–comment]] construction to form sentences. Chinese also has an extensive system of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] and [[measure word]]s, another trait shared with neighboring languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]. Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of [[serial verb construction]], [[pro-drop language|pronoun dropping]] and the related [[null subject language|subject dropping]].

Although the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.

== Vocabulary ==
The entire Chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 20,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are now commonly in use. However Chinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words. Because most Chinese words are made up of two or more characters, there are many more Chinese words than characters. A more accurate equivalent for a Chinese character is the [[morpheme]], as characters represent the smallest grammatical units with individual meanings in the Chinese language.

Estimates of the total number of Chinese words and lexicalized phrases vary greatly. The ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', a compendium of Chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including [[bone oracle]] versions. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'' (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions, and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. The [[CC-CEDICT]] project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms and names of political figures, businesses and products. The 2009 version of the Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary (WDCD),&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Timothy Uy and Jim Hsia, Editors, ''Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary – Advanced Reference Edition, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[CC-CEDICT]], contains over 84,000 entries.

The most comprehensive pure linguistic Chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volume ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', records more than 23,000 head Chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. The 1999 revised ''[[Cihai]]'', a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 Chinese characters, including proper names, phrases and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific and technical terms.

The 7th (2016) edition of ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]]'', an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard Chinese language as used in [[mainland China]], has 13,000 head characters and defines 70,000 words.

=== Loanwords ===
Like any other language, Chinese has absorbed a sizable number of [[loanwords]] from other cultures. Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese [[morphemes]], including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.

Some early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] loanwords in Chinese have been proposed, notably {{linktext|蜜|lang=zh}} ''mì'' &quot;honey&quot;, {{linktext|狮|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|獅|lang=zh-Hant}} ''shī'' &quot;lion,&quot; and perhaps also {{linktext|马|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|馬|lang=zh-Hant}} ''mǎ'' &quot;horse&quot;, {{linktext|猪|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|豬|lang=zh-Hant}} ''zhū'' &quot;pig&quot;, {{Lang|zh|犬}} ''quǎn'' &quot;dog&quot;, and {{linktext|鹅|lang=zh-Hans}}/{{linktext|鵝|lang=zh-Hant}} ''é'' &quot;goose&quot;.{{efn|[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] s.v. &quot;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-75039/Chinese-languages Chinese languages]&quot;: &quot;Old Chinese vocabulary already contained many words not generally occurring in the other Sino-Tibetan languages. The words for 'honey' and 'lion', and probably also 'horse', 'dog', and 'goose', are connected with Indo-European and were acquired through trade and early contacts. (The nearest known Indo-European languages were Tocharian and Sogdian, a middle Iranian language.) A number of words have Austroasiatic cognates and point to early contacts with the ancestral language of Muong–Vietnamese and Mon–Khmer.&quot;; Jan Ulenbrook, ''Einige Übereinstimmungen zwischen dem Chinesischen und dem Indogermanischen'' (1967) proposes 57 items; see also Tsung-tung Chang, 1988 [http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp007_old_chinese.pdf Indo-European Vocabulary in Old Chinese].}}
Ancient words borrowed from along the [[Silk Road]] since [[Old Chinese]] include {{Lang|zh|葡萄}} ''pútáo'' &quot;[[grape]]&quot;, {{Lang|zh|石榴}} ''shíliu''/''shíliú'' &quot;[[pomegranate]]&quot; and {{zh|s=狮子|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=獅子|labels=no}} ''shīzi'' &quot;[[lion]]&quot;. Some words were borrowed from Buddhist scriptures, including {{Lang|zh|佛}} ''Fó'' &quot;Buddha&quot; and {{zh|s=菩萨|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=菩薩|labels=no}} ''Púsà'' &quot;bodhisattva.&quot; Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as {{Lang|zh|胡同}} ''hútòng'' &quot;[[hutong]]&quot;. Words borrowed from the peoples along the Silk Road, such as {{Lang|zh|葡萄}} &quot;grape,&quot; generally have [[Persia]]n etymologies. Buddhist terminology is generally derived from [[Sanskrit]] or [[Pāli]], the [[liturgical language]]s of [[North India]]. Words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the [[Gobi]], Mongolian or northeast regions generally have [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] etymologies, such as {{Lang|zh|琵琶}} ''pípá'', the Chinese lute, or {{Lang|zh|酪}} ''lào''/''luò'' &quot;cheese&quot; or &quot;yoghurt&quot;, but from exactly which source is not always clear.{{sfnp|Kane|2006|p=161}}

=== Modern borrowings ===
{{See also|Translation of neologisms into Chinese|Transcription into Chinese characters}}
Modern neologisms are primarily translated into Chinese in one of three ways: free translation (''[[calque]]'', or by meaning), phonetic translation (by sound), or [[phono-semantic matching|a combination of the two]]. Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and [[international scientific vocabulary]]. Any [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] etymologies are dropped and converted into the corresponding Chinese characters (for example, ''anti-'' typically becomes &quot;{{Lang|zh|反}}&quot;, literally ''opposite''), making them more comprehensible for Chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. For example, the word ''telephone'' was loaned phonetically as {{zh|s=德律风|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=德律風|labels=no}} (Shanghainese: ''télífon'' {{IPA|[təlɪfoŋ]}}, Mandarin: ''délǜfēng'') during the 1920s and widely used in Shanghai, but later {{zh|s=电话|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=電話|labels=no}} ''diànhuà'' (lit. &quot;electric speech&quot;), built out of native Chinese morphemes, became prevalent ({{Lang|zh|電話}} is in fact from the Japanese {{lang|ja|電話}} ''denwa''; see below for more Japanese loans). Other examples include {{zh|s=电视|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=電視|labels=no}} ''diànshì'' (lit. &quot;electric vision&quot;) for television, {{zh|s=电脑|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=電腦|labels=no}} ''diànnǎo'' (lit. &quot;electric brain&quot;) for computer; {{zh|s=手机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=手機|labels=no}} ''shǒujī'' (lit. &quot;hand machine&quot;) for mobile phone, {{zh|s=蓝牙|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=藍牙|labels=no}} ''lányá'' (lit. &quot;blue tooth&quot;) for [[Bluetooth]], and {{zh|s=网志|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=網誌|labels=no}} ''wǎngzhì'' (lit. &quot;internet logbook&quot;) for blog in Hong Kong and Macau Cantonese. Occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as {{zh|s=汉堡包|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢堡包|labels=no}} ''hànbǎobāo'' ({{Lang|zh|漢堡}} ''hànbǎo'' &quot;Hamburg&quot; + {{Lang|zh|包}} ''bāo'' &quot;bun&quot;) for &quot;hamburger&quot;. Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes ([[phono-semantic matching]]), such as {{zh|s=拖拉机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=拖拉機|labels=no}} ''tuōlājī'' &quot;tractor&quot; (lit. &quot;dragging-pulling machine&quot;), or {{zh|s=马利奥|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=馬利奧|labels=no}} Mǎlì'ào for the video game character [[Mario]]. This is often done for commercial purposes, for example {{zh|s=奔腾|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=奔騰|labels=no}} ''bēnténg'' (lit. &quot;dashing-leaping&quot;) for [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] and {{zh|s=赛百味|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=賽百味|labels=no}} ''Sàibǎiwèi'' (lit. &quot;better-than hundred tastes&quot;) for [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurants]].

Foreign words, mainly [[proper nouns]], continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations. For example, &quot;Israel&quot; becomes {{Lang|zh|以色列}} ''Yǐsèliè'', &quot;Paris&quot; becomes {{Lang|zh|巴黎}} ''Bālí''. A rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including {{zh|s=沙发|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=沙發|labels=no}} ''shāfā'' &quot;sofa&quot;, {{zh|s=马达|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=馬達|labels=no}} ''mǎdá'' &quot;motor&quot;, {{Lang|zh|幽默}} ''yōumò'' &quot;humor&quot;, {{zh|s=逻辑|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=邏輯|labels=no}} ''luóji''/''luójí'' &quot;logic&quot;, {{zh|s=时髦|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時髦|labels=no}} ''shímáo'' &quot;smart, fashionable&quot;, and {{Lang|zh|歇斯底里}} ''xiēsīdǐlǐ'' &quot;hysterics&quot;. The bulk of these words were originally coined in the Shanghai dialect during the early 20th century and were later loaned into Mandarin, hence their pronunciations in Mandarin may be quite off from the English. For example, {{zh|s=沙发|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=沙發|labels=no}} &quot;sofa&quot; and {{zh|s=马达|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=馬達|labels=no}} &quot;motor&quot; in Shanghainese sound more like their English counterparts. Cantonese differs from Mandarin with some transliterations, such as {{Lang|zh|梳化}} ''so&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; faa&lt;sup&gt;3*2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &quot;sofa&quot; and {{Lang|zh|摩打}} ''mo&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; daa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &quot;motor&quot;.

Western foreign words representing Western concepts have influenced Chinese since the 20th century through transcription. From [[French language|French]] came {{Lang|zh|芭蕾}} ''bālěi'' &quot;ballet&quot; and {{Lang|zh|香槟}} ''xiāngbīn'', &quot;champagne&quot;; from [[Italian language|Italian]], {{Lang|zh|咖啡}} ''kāfēi'' &quot;caffè&quot;. English influence is particularly pronounced. From early 20th century Shanghainese, many English words are borrowed, such as {{zh|s=高尔夫|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=高爾夫|labels=no}} ''gāoěrfū'' &quot;golf&quot; and the above-mentioned {{zh|s=沙发|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=沙發|labels=no}} ''shāfā'' &quot;sofa&quot;. Later, the United States [[soft power|soft influences]] gave rise to {{Lang|zh|迪斯科}} ''dísikē''/''dísīkē'' &quot;disco&quot;, {{zh|s=可乐|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=可樂|labels=no}} ''kělè'' &quot;cola&quot;, and {{Lang|zh|迷你}} ''mínǐ'' &quot;mini [skirt]&quot;. Contemporary colloquial Cantonese has distinct loanwords from English, such as {{Lang|zh|卡通}} ''kaa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; tung&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt;'' &quot;cartoon&quot;, {{Lang|zh|基佬}} ''gei&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; lou&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &quot;gay people&quot;, {{Lang|zh|的士}} ''dik&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;6*2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &quot;taxi&quot;, and {{Lang|zh|巴士}} ''baa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;6*2&lt;/sup&gt;'' &quot;bus&quot;. With the rising popularity of the Internet, there is a current vogue in China for coining English transliterations, for example, {{zh|s=粉丝|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=粉絲|labels=no}} ''fěnsī'' &quot;fans&quot;, {{Lang|zh|黑客}} ''hēikè'' &quot;hacker&quot; (lit. &quot;black guest&quot;), and {{Lang|zh|博客}} ''bókè'' &quot;blog&quot;. In Taiwan, some of these transliterations are different, such as {{Lang|zh|駭客}} ''hàikè'' for &quot;hacker&quot; and {{Lang|zh|部落格}} ''bùluògé'' for &quot;blog&quot; (lit. &quot;interconnected tribes&quot;).

Another result of the English influence on Chinese is the appearance in Modern Chinese texts of so-called {{zh|s=字母词|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=字母詞|labels=no}} ''zìmǔcí'' (lit. &quot;lettered words&quot;) spelled with letters from the English alphabet. This has appeared in magazines, newspapers, on web sites, and on TV: {{zh|s=三G手机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=三G手機|labels=no}} &quot;3rd generation cell phones&quot; ({{Lang|zh|三}} ''sān'' &quot;three&quot; + G &quot;generation&quot; + {{zh|s=手机|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=手機|labels=no}} ''shǒujī'' &quot;mobile phones&quot;), {{Lang|zh|IT界}} &quot;IT circles&quot; (IT &quot;information technology&quot; + {{Lang|zh|界}} ''jiè'' &quot;industry&quot;), HSK (''Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì'', {{zh|s=汉语水平考试|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=漢語水平考試|labels=no}}), GB (''Guóbiāo'', {{zh|s=国标|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=國標|labels=no}}), {{zh|s=CIF价|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=CIF價|labels=no}} (CIF &quot;Cost, Insurance, Freight&quot; + {{zh|s=价|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=價|labels=no}} ''jià'' &quot;price&quot;), {{Lang|zh|e家庭}} &quot;e-home&quot; (e &quot;electronic&quot; + {{Lang|zh|家庭}} ''jiātíng'' &quot;home&quot;), {{zh|s=W时代|labels=off}}/{{zh|t=W時代|labels=off}} &quot;wireless era&quot; (W &quot;wireless&quot; + {{zh|s=时代|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時代|labels=no}} ''shídài'' &quot;era&quot;), {{Lang|zh|TV族}} &quot;TV watchers&quot; (TV &quot;television&quot; + {{Lang|zh|族}} ''zú'' &quot;social group; clan&quot;), {{zh|s=后РС时代|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=後PC時代|labels=no}} &quot;post-PC era&quot; ({{zh|s=后|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=後|labels=no}} ''hòu'' &quot;after/post-&quot; + PC &quot;personal computer&quot; + {{zh|s=时代|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=時代|labels=no}}), and so on.

Since the 20th century, another source of words has been [[Japanese language|Japanese]] using existing [[kanji]] (Chinese characters used in Japanese). Japanese re-molded European concepts and inventions into {{nihongo|''[[wasei-kango]]''|和製漢語||lit. &quot;Japanese-made Chinese&quot;}}, and many of these words have been re-loaned into modern Chinese. Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature. For example, ''jīngjì'' ({{zh|s=经济|labels=no}}/{{zh|t=經濟|labels=no}}; {{lang|ja|経済}} ''keizai'' in Japanese), which in the original Chinese meant &quot;the workings of the state&quot;, was narrowed to &quot;economy&quot; in Japanese; this narrowed definition was then re-imported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this loaning, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese share a corpus of linguistic terms describing modern terminology, paralleling the similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin and shared among European languages.

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Written Chinese|Mainland Chinese Braille|Taiwanese Braille}}
&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY.--&gt;

The Chinese [[orthography]] centers on [[Chinese characters]], which are written within imaginary square blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns, despite alternative arrangement with rows of characters from left to right within a row and from top to bottom across rows bave become more popular since the 20th century (like English and other Western writing system).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/ |title = Requirements for Chinese Text Layout 中文排版需求}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese characters denote [[morpheme]]s independent of phonetic variation in different languages. Thus the character {{Lang|zh|[[wikt:一|一]]}} (&quot;one&quot;) is uttered ''yī'' in [[Standard Chinese]], ''yat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' in [[Cantonese]] and ''it'' in [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]] (form of Min). 

Most written Chinese documents in the modern time, especially the more formal ones, are created using the grammar and syntax of the [[Standard Mandarin Chinese]] variants, regardless of dialectical background of the author or targeted audience. This replaced the old writing language standard of [[Literary Chinese]] before 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/21c/media/articles/c142-201309003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, vocabularies from different Chinese-speaking area have diverged, and the divergence can be observed in written Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://stedu.stheadline.com/sec/article/628/%E7%B2%B5%E6%99%AE%E4%B9%8B%E7%88%AD-%E7%82%BA%E4%BD%A0%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E8%A7%A3%E6%AF%92 |title = 粵普之爭 為你中文解毒}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, colloquial forms of various Chinese language variants have also been written down by their users, especially in less formal settings. The most prominent example of this is the [[written Cantonese|written colloquial form of Cantonese]], which has become quite popular in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]], [[instant messaging]] applications, and on the internet amongst Hong-Kongers and Cantonese-speakers elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://m.thepaper.cn/wifiKey_detail.jsp?contid=1298257&amp;from=wifiKey |title = 粤语：中国最强方言是如何炼成的_私家历史_澎湃新闻-The Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some Chinese variants have diverged and developed a number of unique morphemes that are not found in Standard Mandarin (despite all other common morphemes), unique characters rarely used in Standard Chinese have also been created or inherited from archaic literary standard to represent these unique morphemes. For example, characters like {{Lang|zh|冇}} and {{Lang|zh|係}} for Cantonese and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], are actively used in both languages while being considered archaic or unused in standard written Chinese.

The Chinese had no uniform phonetic transcription system for most of its speakers until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early [[rime book]]s and dictionaries. Early [[India]]n translators, working in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of Chinese in a foreign language. After the 15th century, the efforts of Jesuits and Western court missionaries resulted in some Latin character transcription/writing systems, based on various variants of Chinese languages. Some of these latin character based systems are still being used to write various Chinese variants in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://newmsgr.pct.org.tw/Magazine.aspx?strTID=1&amp;strISID=125&amp;strMagID=M2011081602899|title=白話字滄桑}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hunan]], women in certain areas write their local Chinese language variant in [[Nü Shu]], a [[syllabary]] derived from [[Chinese characters]]. The [[Dungan language]], considered by many a dialect of Mandarin, is nowadays written in [[Cyrillic]], and was previously written in the [[Arabic script]]. The [[Dungan people]] are primarily Muslim and live mainly in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Russia]]; some of the related [[Hui people]] also speak the language and live mainly in China.

&lt;!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Chinese characters]].--&gt;

[[File:XingshuLantingxv.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;[[Lantingji Xu|Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion]]&quot; by [[Wang Xizhi]], written in [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive style]]]]
Each Chinese character represents a monosyllabic Chinese word or morpheme. In 100 CE, the famed [[Han dynasty]] scholar [[Xu Shen]] [[Chinese character classification|classified characters]] into six categories, namely [[pictograph]]s, simple [[ideograph]]s, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. Of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as ''rén'' {{lang|zh|人}} (human), ''rì'' {{lang|zh|日}} (sun), ''shān'' {{lang|zh|山}} (mountain; hill), ''shuǐ'' {{lang|zh|水}} (water). Between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as ''chōng'' {{lang|zh|沖}} (pour), combining a phonetic component ''zhōng'' {{lang|zh|中}} (middle) with a semantic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|氵}} (water). Almost all characters created since have been made using this format. The 18th-century [[Kangxi Dictionary]] recognized 214 radicals.

Modern characters are styled after the [[kaishu|regular script]]. Various other written styles are also used in [[Chinese calligraphy]], including [[seal script]], [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] and [[clerical script]]. Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.

There are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional system]], used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]] and Chinese speaking communities (except [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]) outside [[mainland China]], takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The [[Simplified Chinese character]] system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass [[literacy]], simplifies most complex traditional [[glyph]]s to fewer strokes, many to common cursive [[shorthand]] variants. [[Singapore]], which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the ''de facto'' standard for younger ethnic Chinese in [[Malaysia]].

The [[Internet]] provides the platform to practice reading these alternative systems, be it traditional or simplified. Most Chinese users in the modern era are capable of, although not necessarily comfortable with, reading (but not writing) the alternative system, through experience and guesswork.&lt;ref&gt;http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/compete/writing/big5event_winner2-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a [[Newspapers of the People's Republic of China|Mainland newspaper]]. The PRC government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. School-children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmermann|first=Basile|year=2010|title=Redesigning Culture: Chinese Characters in Alphabet-Encoded Networks|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=1|pages=27–43|doi=10.2752/175470710X12593419555126|url=https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:87901}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large unabridged [[dictionary]], like the Kangxi Dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.

=== Romanization ===
{{Main|Romanization of Chinese}}

[[File:Gwoyu.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|&quot;National language&quot; ({{lang|zh-Hant|國語}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|国语}}; ''Guóyǔ'') written in Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, followed by various romanizations.]]

[[Romanization]] is the process of transcribing a language into the [[Latin script]]. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese varieties, due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western [[Christianity in China|Christian missionaries]] in the 16th century.

Today the most common romanization standard for Standard Chinese is ''[[Hanyu Pinyin]]'', often known simply as pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the [[People's Republic of China]], and later adopted by [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]. Pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken Chinese in schools and universities across [[Americas|America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]. Chinese parents also use Pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. In school books that teach Chinese, the Pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the Chinese character alongside.

The second-most common romanization system, the [[Wade–Giles]], was invented by Thomas Wade in 1859 and modified by Herbert Giles in 1892. As this system approximates the phonology of Mandarin Chinese into English consonants and vowels, i.e. it is an [[Anglicization]], it may be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers of an English-speaking background. Wade–Giles was found in academic use in the [[United States]], particularly before the 1980s, and [[Chinese language romanization in Taiwan|until 2009]] was widely used in Taiwan.

When used within European texts, the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] transcriptions in both pinyin and Wade–Giles are often left out for simplicity; Wade–Giles' extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with ''Beijing'' than they will be with ''Běijīng'' (pinyin), and with ''Taipei'' than ''T'ai²-pei³'' (Wade–Giles). This simplification presents syllables as homophones which really are none, and therefore exaggerates the number of homophones almost by a factor of four.

Here are a few examples of ''Hanyu Pinyin'' and Wade–Giles, for comparison:&lt;!-- Please feel free to add Yale, Postal or whatever other examples you know, but I don't know those systems. [[User:Jiawen|Jiawen]] 07:27, 3 June 2005 (UTC) --&gt;

Other systems of romanization for Chinese include [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]], the French [[EFEO Chinese transcription|EFEO]], the [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale system]] (invented during WWII for U.S. troops), as well as separate systems for [[Cantonese]], [[Min Nan]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and other Chinese varieties.

=== Other phonetic transcriptions ===
Chinese varieties have been phonetically transcribed into many other writing systems over the centuries. The [['Phags-pa script]], for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of premodern forms of Chinese.

[[Zhuyin]] (colloquially ''bopomofo''), a [[semi-syllabary]] is still widely used in Taiwan's [[elementary school]]s to aid standard pronunciation. Although zhuyin characters are reminiscent of [[katakana]] script, there is no source to substantiate the claim that Katakana was the basis for the zhuyin system. A comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the [[Bopomofo#Comparison|zhuyin article]]. Syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:
* [[Pinyin table]]
* [[Zhuyin table]]

There are also at least two systems of [[cyrillization]] for Chinese. The most widespread is the [[Cyrillization of Chinese from Pinyin|Palladius system]].

[[File:Chinese Language Training at CASA.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|Yang Lingfu, former curator of the [[National Museum of China]], giving Chinese language instruction at the [[Civil Affairs Staging Area]] in 1945.]]

With the growing importance and influence of China's economy globally, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] instruction is gaining popularity in schools in the United States, and has become an increasingly popular subject of study amongst the young in the Western world, as in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4617646.stm |work = BBC News |title = How hard is it to learn Chinese? |date = 17 January 2006 |accessdate = 28 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 there were 2,000 foreign learners taking China's official [[Chinese Proficiency Test]] (also known as HSK, comparable to the English [[University of Cambridge ESOL examination|Cambridge Certificate]]), while in 2005, the number of candidates had risen sharply to 117,660.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|zh}} &quot;汉语水平考试中心：2005年外国考生总人数近12万&quot;,&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2006-01/16/content_160707.htm Gov.cn]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Xinhua News Agency]], 16 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, 750,000 people had taken the Chinese Proficiency Test. By 2017, 6.5 million candidates had taken the [[Chinese Proficiency Test]] of various kinds.

According to the Modern Language Association, there were 550 elementary, junior high and senior high schools providing Chinese programs in the United States in 2015, which represented a 100% increase in two years. At the same time, enrollment in Chinese language classes at college level had an increase of 51% from 2002 to 2015. On the other hand, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages also had figures suggesting that 30,000 – 50,000 students were studying Chinese in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://america.cgtn.com/2015/03/03/chinese-as-a-second-language-growing-in-popularity|title=Chinese as a second language growing in popularity|date=2015-03-03|website=CGTN America|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, more than half a million Chinese students pursued post-secondary education overseas, whereas 400,000 international students came to China for higher education. Tsinghua University hosted 35,000 students from 116 countries in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://america.cgtn.com/2017/03/17/china-is-third-most-popular-destination-for-international-students|title=China is third most popular destination for international students|date=2017-03-18|website=CGTN America|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increase in demand for Chinese as a second language, there are 330 institutions teaching Chinese language globally according to the Chinese Ministry of Education. The establishment of Confucius Institutes, which are the public institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China, aims at promoting Chinese language and culture as well as supporting Chinese teaching overseas. There were more than 480 Confucius Institutes worldwide as of 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
