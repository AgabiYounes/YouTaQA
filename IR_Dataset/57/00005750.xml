CBT is based on the combination of the basic principles from [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name=CBT/&gt; It is different from historical approaches to [[psychotherapy]], such as the [[psychoanalytic]] approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors and then formulates a diagnosis. Instead, CBT is a &quot;problem-focused&quot; and &quot;action-oriented&quot; form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. The therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and decrease symptoms of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Schacter&gt;{{citation|vauthors=Schacter DL, Gilbert DT, Wegner DM|year=2010|title=Psychology|edition=2nd|pages = 600|location=New York|publisher=Worth Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBT is based on the belief that [[cognitive distortions|thought distortions]] and [[maladaptive]] behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of [[Psychological Disorders|psychological disorders]],&lt;ref name=ABCs/&gt; and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Handbook6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schacter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brewin CR | title = Theoretical foundations of cognitive-behavior therapy for anxiety and depression | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 47 | issue =  | pages = 33–57 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8624137 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.47.1.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Mainstream cognitive [[behavioral therapy]] assumes that changing [[maladaptive]] thinking leads to change in [[behavior]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]],&lt;ref name=&quot;HassettAL&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hassett AL, Gevirtz RN | title = Nonpharmacologic treatment for fibromyalgia: patient education, cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, and complementary and alternative medicine | journal = Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 393–407 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19647150 | pmc = 2743408 | doi = 10.1016/j.rdc.2009.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent variants emphasize changes in one's relationship to maladaptive thinking rather than changes in thinking itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;HayesSC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayes SC, Villatte M, Levin M, Hildebrandt M | title = Open, aware, and active: contextual approaches as an emerging trend in the behavioral and cognitive therapies | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–68 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21219193 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104449 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13d38d023e16320e4c78ea904e7bb0cf04ed29fb }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy is not to diagnose a person with a particular disease, but to look at the person as a whole and decide what can be altered.

===Cognitive distortions===
Therapists or computer-based programs use CBT techniques to help people challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace errors in thinking, known as [[cognitive distortions]], such as &quot;overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing&quot; with &quot;more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HassettAL&quot; /&gt; Cognitive distortions can be either a pseudo-discrimination belief or an over-generalization of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Dawes RM |title=COGNITIVE DISTORTION Monograph Supplement 4-V14|journal=Psychological Reports|date=April 1964|volume=14|issue=2|pages=443–459|doi=10.2466/pr0.1964.14.2.443}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBT techniques may also be used to help individuals take a more open, mindful, and aware posture toward cognitive distortions so as to diminish their impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;HayesSC&quot; /&gt;

===Skills===
Mainstream CBT helps individuals replace &quot;maladaptive... coping skills, cognitions, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchelRJ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gatchel RJ, Rollings KH | title = Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with cognitive behavioral therapy | journal = The Spine Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–4 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18164452 | pmc = 3237294 | doi = 10.1016/j.spinee.2007.10.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by challenging an individual's way of thinking and the way that they react to certain habits or behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Kozier B|title = Fundamentals of nursing: concepts, process and practice|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_0_pRyy9McQC|year = 2008|publisher = Pearson Education|isbn = 978-0-13-197653-5|pages =  187}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is still controversy about the degree to which these traditional cognitive elements account for the effects seen with CBT over and above the earlier behavioral elements such as exposure and skills training.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongmoreRJ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Longmore RJ, Worrell M | title = Do we need to challenge thoughts in cognitive behavior therapy? | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–87 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17157970 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phases in therapy===
CBT can be seen as having six phases:&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchelRJ&quot; /&gt;
# Assessment or [[psychological assessment]];
# Reconceptualization;
# Skills acquisition;
# Skills consolidation and application training;
# [[Generalization]] and maintenance;
# Post-treatment assessment follow-up.

These steps are based on a system created by Kanfer and Saslow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Psychological Testing&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Robert|last2=Saccuzzo|first2=Dennis | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychological Testing|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=415}}&lt;/ref&gt; After identifying the behaviors that need changing, whether they be in excess or deficit, and treatment has occurred, the psychologist must identify whether or not the intervention succeeded. For example, &quot;If the goal was to decrease the behavior, then there should be a decrease relative to the baseline. If the critical behavior remains at or above the baseline, then the intervention has failed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Psychological Testing&quot;/&gt;

The steps in the assessment phase include:
:Step 1: Identify critical behaviors
:Step 2: Determine whether critical behaviors are excesses or deficits
:Step 3: Evaluate critical behaviors for frequency, duration, or intensity (obtain a baseline)
:Step 4: If excess, attempt to decrease frequency, duration, or intensity of behaviors; if deficits, attempt to increase behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Robert|last2=Saccuzzo|first2=Dennis| name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychological Testing|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=415, Table 15.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-conceptualization phase makes up much of the &quot;cognitive&quot; portion of CBT.&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchelRJ&quot; /&gt; A summary of modern CBT approaches is given by Hofmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Hofmann SG|title = An Introduction to Modern CBT. Psychological Solutions to Mental Health Problems|year = 2011|location = Chichester, UK|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|isbn = 978-0-470-97175-8}}{{page needed|date = April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delivery protocols===
There are different protocols for delivering cognitive behavioral therapy, with important similarities among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;HofmannSG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofmann SG, Sawyer AT, Fang A | title = The empirical status of the &quot;new wave&quot; of cognitive behavioral therapy | journal = The Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 701–10 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20599141 | pmc = 2898899 | doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the term ''CBT'' may refer to different interventions, including &quot;self-instructions (e.g. distraction, imagery, motivational self-talk), relaxation and/or [[biofeedback]], development of adaptive coping strategies (e.g. minimizing negative or self-defeating thoughts), changing maladaptive beliefs about pain, and [[goal setting]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GatchelRJ&quot; /&gt; Treatment is sometimes manualized, with brief, direct, and time-limited treatments for individual psychological disorders that are specific technique-driven. CBT is used in both individual and group settings, and the techniques are often adapted for [[self-help]] applications. Some clinicians and researchers are cognitively oriented (e.g. [[cognitive restructuring]]), while others are more behaviorally oriented (e.g. ''[[in vivo]]'' [[exposure therapy]]). Interventions such as imaginal exposure therapy combine both approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Foa|first1 = Edna B.|last2 = Rothbaum|first2 = Barbara O.|last3 = Furr|first3 = Jami M. | name-list-format = vanc |title = Augmenting exposure therapy with other CBT procedures|journal = Psychiatric Annals|volume = 33|issue = 1|date = Jan 2003|pages = 47–53 |doi=10.3928/0048-5713-20030101-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Jessamy|first1 = Hibberd|last2 = Jo|first2 = Usmar | name-list-format = vanc |url = http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20553738-this-book-will-make-you-happy|title = This book will make you happy|publisher = Quercus|isbn = 9781848662810|access-date = 15 July 2014|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===
{{Further|Major depressive disorder#Talking therapies|Management of depression#Psychotherapy}}

Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;DriessenE&quot; /&gt; The [[American Psychiatric Association]] Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirschfeld |first=Robert M.A. | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Guideline Watch: Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar Disorder, 2nd Edition|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-89042-336-3|volume = 1|title=APA Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders: Comprehensive Guidelines and Guideline Watches|chapter-url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/bipolar-watch.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date = April 2013}} One [[Etiology|etiological]] theory of depression is [[Aaron T. Beck]]'s cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale247&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors = Neale JM, Davison GC|title = Abnormal psychology|edition = 8th|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|location = New York|year = 2001|pages = [https://archive.org/details/abnormalpsycholo00gera/page/247 247]|isbn = 978-0-471-31811-8|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/abnormalpsycholo00gera/page/247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck also described a negative [[Beck's cognitive triad|cognitive triad]]. The cognitive triad is made up of the depressed individual's negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Beck suggested that these negative evaluations derive from the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person. According to this theory, depressed people have views such as &quot;I never do a good job&quot;, &quot;It is impossible to have a good day&quot;, and &quot;things will never get better&quot;. A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: [[arbitrary inference]], [[selective abstraction]], over-generalization, magnification, and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]]. These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale247&quot; /&gt;

A 2001 meta-analysis comparing CBT and [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]] suggested the approaches were equally effective in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leichsenring|first=F.|date=2001|title=Comparative effects of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy in depression: a meta-analytic approach|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=21|issue=3|pages=401–419|issn=0272-7358|pmid=11288607|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, meta-analyses of larger trials of different psychotherapeutic treatments that CBT, [[interpersonal therapy]], and [[problem-solving therapy]] for depression outperform psychodynamic psychotherapy and [[behavioral activation]] in terms of robustness of effects.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barth_2013&quot; /&gt;

=== Anxiety disorders ===
{{further|Anxiety disorder#Treatment}}
CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adults with anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofmann SG, Smits JA | title = Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adult anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 621–32 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18363421 | pmc = 2409267 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v69n0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic concept in some CBT treatments used in anxiety disorders is ''in vivo'' [[Exposure therapy|exposure]]. The term refers to the direct confrontation of feared objects, activities, or situations by a patient. For example, a woman with PTSD who fears the location where she was assaulted may be assisted by her therapist in going to that location and directly confronting those fears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.div12.org/sites/default/files/WhatIsExposureTherapy.pdf|title=What is Exposure Therapy?|last=American Psychological Association {{!}} Division 12|date=|website=div12.org/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a person with social anxiety disorder who fears public speaking may be instructed to directly confront those fears by giving a speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ptsd.about.com/od/glossary/g/invivo.htm|title = Definition of In Vivo Exposure|publisher = Ptsd.about.com|date = 2014-06-09|access-date = 2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;two-factor&quot; model is often credited to [[Orval Hobart Mowrer|O. Hobart Mowrer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Wiley|location = New York|author = Mowrer OH|title = Learning theory and behavior|year = 1960|isbn = 978-0-88275-127-6}}{{Page needed|date = April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through exposure to the stimulus, this harmful conditioning can be &quot;unlearned&quot; (referred to as [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] and [[habituation]]). Studies have provided evidence that when examining animals and humans that [[glucocorticoid]]s may possibly lead to a more successful extinction learning during exposure therapy. For instance, glucocorticoids can prevent aversive learning episodes from being retrieved and heighten reinforcement of memory traces creating a non-fearful reaction in feared situations. A combination of glucocorticoids and exposure therapy may be a better improved treatment for treating patients with anxiety disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bentz D, Michael T, de Quervain DJ, Wilhelm FH | title = Enhancing exposure therapy for anxiety disorders with glucocorticoids: from basic mechanisms of emotional learning to clinical applications | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–30 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19962269 | doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2009.10.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 Cochrane review also found that CBT for symptomatic management of non-specific chest pain is probably effective in the short term. However, the findings were limited by small trials and the evidence was considered of questionable quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kisely SR, Campbell LA, Yelland MJ, Paydar A | title = Psychological interventions for symptomatic management of non-specific chest pain in patients with normal coronary anatomy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD004101 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26123045 | pmc = 6599861 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd004101.pub5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosis ===

In long-term [[Psychosis|psychoses]], CBT is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs. Interventions particularly related to these conditions include exploring reality testing, changing delusions and hallucinations, examining factors which precipitate relapse, and managing relapses.&lt;ref name=&quot;GutierrezM&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===

Several meta-analyses suggested that CBT is effective in schizophrenia,&lt;ref name=&quot;RathodS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wykes T, Steel C, Everitt B, Tarrier N | title = Cognitive behavior therapy for schizophrenia: effect sizes, clinical models, and methodological rigor | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 523–37 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 17962231 | pmc = 2632426 | doi = 10.1093/schbul/sbm114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochrane reviews reported CBT had &quot;no effect on long‐term risk of relapse&quot; and no evidence that CBT had an additional effect above standard care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones C, Hacker D, Xia J, Meaden A, Irving CB, Zhao S, Chen J, Shi C | display-authors = 6 | title = Cognitive behavioural therapy plus standard care versus standard care for people with schizophrenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD007964 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30572373 | pmc = 6517137 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007964.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Schizophrenia Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2015 [[systematic review]] investigated the effects of CBT compared with other psychosocial therapies for people with schizophrenia and determined that there's no clear advantage over other, often less expensive interventions but acknowledged that better quality evidence is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Christopher|last2=Hacker|first2=David|last3=Meaden|first3=Alan|last4=Cormac|first4=Irene|last5=Irving|first5=Claire B.|last6=Xia|first6=Jun|last7=Zhao|first7=Sai|last8=Shi|first8=Chunhu|last9=Chen|first9=Jue|date=15 November 2018|title=Cognitive behavioural therapy plus standard care versus standard care plus other psychosocial treatments for people with schizophrenia|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=11|pages=CD008712|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008712.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6516879|pmid=30480760}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== With older adults ===
CBT is used to help people of all ages, but the therapy should be adjusted based on the age of the patient with whom the therapist is dealing.

=== Smoking cessation ===
CBT looks at the habit of smoking cigarettes as a learned behavior, which later evolves into a coping strategy to handle daily stressors. Because smoking is often easily accessible, and quickly allows the user to feel good, it can take precedence over other coping strategies, and eventually work its way into everyday life during non-stressful events as well. CBT aims to target the function of the behavior, as it can vary between individuals, and works to inject other coping mechanisms in place of smoking. CBT also aims to support individuals suffering from strong cravings, which are a major reported reason for relapse during treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=fs_TOBACCO|title=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies; Tobacco Dependence | date=|website=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 controlled study out of Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;!-- Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305-5705, USA. --&gt;, suggested CBT may be an effective tool to help maintain abstinence. The results of 304 random adult participants were tracked over the course of one year. During this program, some participants were provided medication, CBT, 24 hour phone support, or some combination of the three methods. At 20 weeks, the participants who received CBT had a 45% abstinence rate, versus non-CBT participants, who had a 29% abstinence rate. Overall, the study concluded that emphasizing cognitive and behavioral strategies to support smoking cessation can help individuals build tools for long term smoking abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killen JD, Fortmann SP, Schatzberg AF, Arredondo C, Murphy G, Hayward C, Celio M, Cromp D, Fong D, Pandurangi M | display-authors = 6 | title = Extended cognitive behavior therapy for cigarette smoking cessation | journal = Addiction | volume = 103 | issue = 8 | pages = 1381–90 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18855829 | pmc = 4119230 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02273.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavior therapy roots ===
[[File:John Broadus Watson.JPG|right|upright|thumb|[[John B. Watson]]]]
The modern roots of CBT can be traced to the development of [[behavior therapy]] in the early 20th century, the development of cognitive therapy in the 1960s, and the subsequent merging of the two. Groundbreaking work of behaviorism began with [[John B. Watson]] and [[Rosalie Rayner]]'s studies of [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trull&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Trull TJ | date = 2007 | title = Clinical psychology | edition = 7th | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = [[Thomson/Wadsworth]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorally-centered therapeutic approaches appeared as early as 1924&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Rachman S| veditors = Clark D, Fairburn CG, Gelder MG |title = Science and practice of cognitive behaviour therapy|chapter = The evolution of cognitive behaviour therapy|pages = 1–26|year = 1997|publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|isbn = 978-0-19-262726-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Mary Cover Jones]]' work dedicated to the unlearning of fears in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/h0072283|title = The Elimination of Children's Fears|year = 1924| vauthors = Jones MC |journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume = 7|issue = 5|pages = 382–390}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the antecedents of the development of [[Joseph Wolpe]]'s behavioral therapy in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trull&quot; /&gt; It was the work of Wolpe and Watson, which was based on [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s work on learning and conditioning, that influenced [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Arnold Lazarus]] to develop new behavioral therapy techniques based on [[classical conditioning]].&lt;ref name = Trull/&gt;&lt;ref name = Corsini&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Corsini RJ, Wedding D | date = 2008 | title = Current psychotherapies | edition = 8th | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, behavioral therapy became widely utilized by researchers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and South Africa, who were inspired by the [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] learning theory of [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[Clark L. Hull]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt; In Britain, [[Joseph Wolpe]], who applied the findings of animal experiments to his method of [[systematic desensitization]],&lt;ref name = Trull/&gt; applied behavioral research to the treatment of neurotic disorders. Wolpe's therapeutic efforts were precursors to today's fear reduction techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt; British psychologist [[Hans Eysenck]] presented behavior therapy as a constructive alternative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eysenck HJ | title = The effects of psychotherapy: an evaluation | journal = Journal of Consulting Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 319–24 | date = October 1952 | pmid = 13000035 | doi = 10.1037/h0063633 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Eysenck's work, [[B. F. Skinner]] and his associates were beginning to have an impact with their work on [[operant conditioning]].&lt;ref name = Trull/&gt;&lt;ref name = Corsini/&gt; Skinner's work was referred to as [[radical behaviorism]] and avoided anything related to cognition.&lt;ref name = Trull/&gt; However, [[Julian Rotter]], in 1954, and [[Albert Bandura]], in 1969, contributed behavior therapy with their respective work on [[social learning theory]], by demonstrating the effects of cognition on learning and behavior modification.&lt;ref name = Trull/&gt;&lt;ref name = Corsini/&gt; The work of the Australian [[Claire Weekes]] dealing with anxiety disorders in the 1960s was also seen as a prototype of behavior therapy.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

The emphasis on behavioral factors constituted the &quot;first wave&quot; of CBT.&lt;ref name = Wilson&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wilson GT | date = 2008 | chapter = Behavior therapy | veditors = Corsini RJ, Wedding D | title = Current psychotherapies | edition = 8th | pages = 63–106 | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive therapy roots ===
One of the first therapists to address cognition in psychotherapy was [[Alfred Adler]] with his notion of [[Classical Adlerian psychology|basic mistakes]] and how they contributed to creation of unhealthy or useless behavioral and life goals.&lt;ref name = AP&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Mosak HH, Maniacci M | date = 2008 | chapter = Adlerian psychotherapy | veditors = Corsini RJ, Wedding D | title = Current psychotherapies | edition = 8th | pages = 63–106 | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adler's work influenced the work of [[Albert Ellis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AP&quot; /&gt; who developed the earliest cognitive-based psychotherapy, known today as [[rational emotive behavior therapy]], or REBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ellis A | date = 2008 | chapter = Rational emotive behavior therapy | pages = 63–106 | veditors = Corsini RJ, Wedding D | title = Current psychotherapies | edition = 8th | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time that rational emotive therapy, as it was known then, was being developed, [[Aaron T. Beck]] was conducting [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] sessions in his [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;EABH&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Oatley K | date = 2004 | title = Emotions: A brief history | page = 53 | location = Malden, MA | publisher = Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; During these sessions, Beck noticed that thoughts were not as unconscious as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] had previously theorized, and that certain types of thinking may be the culprits of emotional distress.&lt;ref name=&quot;EABH&quot; /&gt; It was from this hypothesis that Beck developed [[cognitive therapy]], and called these thoughts &quot;automatic thoughts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EABH&quot; /&gt; Beck has been referred to as &quot;the father of cognitive behavioral therapy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Folsom, Timothy D., et al. &quot;Profiles in history of neuroscience and psychiatry.&quot; The Medical Basis of Psychiatry. Springer, New York, NY, 2016. 925-1007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was these two therapies, rational emotive therapy and cognitive therapy, that started the &quot;second wave&quot; of CBT, which was the emphasis on cognitive factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;

=== Behavior and cognitive therapies merge - &quot;third wave&quot; CBT ===
Although the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trull&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thorpe GL, Olson SL | date = 1997 | title = Behavior therapy: Concepts, procedures, and applications | edition = 2nd | location = Boston, MA | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorism was also losing in popularity due to the so-called &quot;[[cognitive revolution]]&quot;. The therapeutic approaches of [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and Aaron T. Beck gained popularity among behavior therapists, despite the earlier behaviorist rejection of &quot;[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]]&quot; concepts like thoughts and cognitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trull&quot; /&gt; Both of these systems included behavioral elements and interventions and primarily concentrated on problems in the present.

In initial studies, cognitive therapy was often contrasted with behavioral treatments to see which was most effective. During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy. Pivotal to this merging was the successful development of treatments for [[panic disorder]] by [[David M. Clark]] in the UK and [[David H. Barlow]] in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rachman_1997&quot; /&gt;

Over time, cognitive behavior therapy became to be known not only as a therapy, but as an umbrella term for all cognitive-based psychotherapies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trull&quot; /&gt; These therapies include, but are not limited to, [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|rational emotive therapy (REBT)]], cognitive therapy, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], [[dialectical behavior therapy]], [[reality therapy]]/[[Glasser's choice theory|choice theory]], [[cognitive processing therapy]], [[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], and [[multimodal therapy]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Trull&quot; /&gt; All of these therapies are a blending of cognitive- and behavior-based elements.

This blending of theoretical and technical foundations from both [[Behaviour therapy#Third generation|behavior]] and cognitive therapies constituted the &quot;third wave&quot; of CBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayes SC, Hofmann SG | title = The third wave of cognitive behavioral therapy and the rise of process-based care | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 245–246 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28941087 | pmc = 5608815 | doi = 10.1002/wps.20442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt; The most prominent therapies of this third wave are dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;

Despite increasing popularity of &quot;third-wave&quot; treatment approaches, reviews of studies reveal there may be no difference in the effectiveness compared with &quot;non-third wave&quot; CBT for the treatment of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunot V, Moore TH, Caldwell DM, Furukawa TA, Davies P, Jones H, Honyashiki M, Chen P, Lewis G, Churchill R | display-authors = 6 | title = 'Third wave' cognitive and behavioural therapies versus other psychological therapies for depression | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 10 | pages = CD008704 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24142844 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008704.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/84f7b1d8c3384e8ab17d4a828faff947fd7002f3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of access ==

=== Therapist ===
A typical CBT programme would consist of face-to-face sessions between patient and therapist, made up of 6-18 sessions of around an hour each with a gap of 1–3 weeks between sessions. This initial programme might be followed by some booster sessions, for instance after one month and three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Cognitive behavioural therapy for the management of common mental health problems|url = http://www.nice.org.uk/media/878/F7/CBTCommissioningGuide.pdf|publisher = [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]]|date = April 2008|access-date = 2013-11-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105200545/http://www.nice.org.uk/media/878/f7/cbtcommissioningguide.pdf|archive-date = 2013-11-05|url-status = dead}}{{page needed|date = April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBT has also been found to be effective if patient and therapist type in real time to each other over computer links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler D, Lewis G, Kaur S, Wiles N, King M, Weich S, Sharp DJ, Araya R, Hollinghurst S, Peters TJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Therapist-delivered Internet psychotherapy for depression in primary care: a randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9690 | pages = 628–34 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19700005 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61257-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollinghurst S, Peters TJ, Kaur S, Wiles N, Lewis G, Kessler D | title = Cost-effectiveness of therapist-delivered online cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 197 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–304 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20884953 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.109.073080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive behavioral therapy is most closely allied with the [[scientist–practitioner model]] in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear [[operationalization]] of the problem, and an emphasis on [[measurement]], including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of [[goal]]s. These are often met through &quot;[[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]]&quot; assignments in which the patient and the therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date = April 2012}} {{cite web |author = Martin, Ben|title = In-Depth: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|url = http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/in-depth-cognitive-behavioral-therapy/all/1/|publisher = PsychCentral|access-date = March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of these assignments&amp;nbsp;– which can be as simple as a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event&amp;nbsp;– indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot; /&gt; The therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot; /&gt; Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a [[Therapeutic relationship|therapeutic alliance]] between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = BAT&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bender S, Messner E | year = 2003 | title = Becoming a therapist: What do I say, and why? | pages = 24, 34–35 | location = New York, NY | publisher = The Guilford Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot; /&gt; For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she can work out an easier assignment first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot; /&gt; The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot; /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Computerized}} Computerized or Internet-delivered ===
Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) has been described by [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] as a &quot;generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;NiceTA97&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/TA97|title = Depression and anxiety&amp;nbsp;– computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT)|publisher = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|date = 2012-01-12|access-date = 2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nordgren LB, Hedman E, Etienne J, Bodin J, Kadowaki A, Eriksson S, Lindkvist E, Andersson G, Carlbring P | display-authors = 6 | title = Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of individually tailored Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety disorders in a primary care population: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 59 | pages = 1–11 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24933451 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2014.05.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marks IM, Mataix-Cols D, Kenwright M, Cameron R, Hirsch S, Gega L | title = Pragmatic evaluation of computer-aided self-help for anxiety and depression | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 183 | pages = 57–65 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12835245 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.183.1.57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it is important not to confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as [[e-Learning]].

CCBT has been found in meta-studies to be cost-effective and often cheaper than usual care,&lt;ref name=&quot;journals.cambridge.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Musiat P, Tarrier N | title = Collateral outcomes in e-mental health: a systematic review of the evidence for added benefits of computerized cognitive behavior therapy interventions for mental health | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 15 | pages = 3137–50 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25065947 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291714000245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MoodGYM was superior to informational websites in terms of psychological outcomes or service use&lt;/ref&gt; including for anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adelman CB, Panza KE, Bartley CA, Bontempo A, Bloch MH | title = A meta-analysis of computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy for the treatment of DSM-5 anxiety disorders | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 75 | issue = 7 | pages = e695-704 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25093485 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.13r08894 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880c72012177255211acbebdaa08c45ca2bfa2c9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that individuals with social anxiety and depression experienced improvement with online CBT-based methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews G, Cuijpers P, Craske MG, McEvoy P, Titov N | title = Computer therapy for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care: a meta-analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13196 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20967242 | pmc = 2954140 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013196 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513196A }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of current CCBT research in the treatment of OCD in children found this interface to hold great potential for future treatment of OCD in youths and adolescent populations.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014 /&gt; Additionally, most [[Internet Interventions for Posttraumatic Stress|internet interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder]] use CCBT. CCBT is also predisposed to treating mood disorders amongst non-heterosexual populations, who may avoid face-to-face therapy from fear of stigma. However presently CCBT programs seldom cater to these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rozbroj T, Lyons A, Pitts M, Mitchell A, Christensen H | title = Assessing the applicability of e-therapies for depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders among lesbians and gay men: analysis of 24 web- and mobile phone-based self-help interventions | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = e166 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24996000 | pmc = 4115263 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.3529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key issue in CCBT use is low uptake and completion rates, even when it has been clearly made available and explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Twomey C, O'Reilly G, Byrne M, Bury M, White A, Kissane S, McMahon A, Clancy N | display-authors = 6 | title = A randomized controlled trial of the computerized CBT programme, MoodGYM, for public mental health service users waiting for interventions | journal = The British Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–50 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24831119 | doi = 10.1111/bjc.12055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Musiat P, Goldstone P, Tarrier N | title = Understanding the acceptability of e-mental health--attitudes and expectations towards computerised self-help treatments for mental health problems | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 14 | pages = 109 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24725765 | pmc = 3999507 | doi = 10.1186/1471-244X-14-109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CCBT completion rates and treatment efficacy have been found in some studies to be higher when use of CCBT is supported personally, with supporters not limited only to therapists, than when use is in a self-help form alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;journals.cambridge.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spurgeon JA, Wright JH | title = Computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral therapy | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 547–52 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20872100 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-010-0152-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach to improving uptake and completion rate, as well as treatment outcome, is to design software that supports the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance between the user and the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Duggan GB | title = Applying psychology to understand relationships with technology: from ELIZA to interactive healthcare |journal = Behaviour and Information Technology|date = 2016|volume = 35|issue = 7|pages = 536–547|doi=10.1080/0144929X.2016.1141320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006 NICE recommended that CCBT be made available for use within the [[National Health Service|NHS]] across England and Wales for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate depression, rather than immediately opting for antidepressant medication,&lt;ref name=&quot;NiceTA97&quot; /&gt; and CCBT is made available by some health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devonpartnership.nhs.uk/uploads/tx_mocarticles/CCBT_Leaflet.pdf|title=Devon Partnership NHS Trust: Home|publisher=NHS UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 NICE guideline recognized that there are likely to be a number of computerized CBT products that are useful to patients, but removed endorsement of any specific product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG91/NICEGuidance/pdf/English|title = CG91 Depression with a chronic physical health problem|date = 28 October 2009|publisher = National Institute for Health and Care Excellence}}{{page needed|date = April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively new avenue of research is the combination of artificial intelligence and CCBT. It has been proposed to use modern technology to create CCBT that simulates face-to-face therapy. This might be achieved in cognitive behavior therapy for a specific disorder using the comprehensive domain knowledge of CBT.&lt;ref name=&quot;helgadottir2009a&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1375/bech.26.4.245|title = Online CBT I: Bridging the Gap Between Eliza and Modern Online CBT Treatment Packages|year = 2009|last1 = Helgadóttir|first1 = Fjóla Dögg|last2 = Menzies|first2 = Ross G|last3 = Onslow|first3 = Mark|last4 = Packman|first4 = Ann|last5 = O'Brian|first5 = Sue | name-list-format = vanc |journal = Behaviour Change|volume = 26|issue = 4|pages = 245–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area where this has been attempted is the specific domain area of social anxiety in those who stutter.&lt;ref name=&quot;helgadottir2009b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1375/bech.26.4.254|title = Online CBT II: A Phase I Trial of a Standalone, Online CBT Treatment Program for Social Anxiety in Stuttering|year = 2009|last1 = Helgadóttir|first1 = Fjóla Dögg|last2 = Menzies|first2 = Ross G|last3 = Onslow|first3 = Mark|last4 = Packman|first4 = Ann|last5 = O'Brian|first5 = Sue| name-list-format = vanc|journal = Behaviour Change|volume = 26|issue = 4|pages = 254–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smartphone app-delivered ===
Another new method of access is the use of [[mobile app]] or smartphone applications to deliver self-help or guided CBT. Technology companies are developing mobile-based artificial intelligence [[chatbot]] applications in delivering CBT as an early intervention to support [[mental health]], to build [[psychological resilience]] and to promote [[emotional well-being]]. [[Artificial intelligence]] (AI) text-based conversational application delivered securely and privately over smartphone devices have the ability to scale globally and offer contextual and always-available support. Active research is underway including real world data studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inkster B, Sarda S, Subramanian V | title = An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being: Real-World Data Evaluation Mixed-Methods Study | journal = JMIR mHealth and uHealth | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = e12106 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30470676 | pmc = 6286427 | doi = 10.2196/12106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that measure effectiveness and engagement of text-based smartphone chatbot apps for delivery of CBT using a text-based conversational interface.

=== BCBT ===
Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) is a form of CBT which has been developed for situations in which there are time constraints on the therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;RuddDM&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1080/08995605.2012.736325|title = Brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) for suicidality in military populations|year = 2012|last1 = Rudd|first1 = M.

=== Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy ===
{{Main|Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy}}
Cognitive emotional behavioral therapy (CEBT) is a form of CBT developed initially for individuals with eating disorders but now used with a range of problems including [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and anger problems. It combines aspects of CBT and [[dialectical behavioral therapy]] and aims to improve understanding and tolerance of emotions in order to facilitate the therapeutic process. It is frequently used as a &quot;pretreatment&quot; to prepare and better equip individuals for longer-term therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing workplace stress: the cognitive behavioural way|last=Choudhury|first=Koushiki| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer India|year=2013|isbn=9788132206835|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structured cognitive behavioral training ===
{{Main|Structured cognitive behavioral training}}
Structured cognitive behavioral training (SCBT) is a cognitive-based process with core philosophies that draw heavily from CBT. Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities in the fields of [[behavioral health]] and [[psychology]]: most notably, [[Albert Ellis]]'s [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} alcohol and food, and to manage [[diabetes]] and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of [[criminal psychology]] in the effort to reduce recidivism.

=== {{anchor|MRT}}Moral reconation therapy ===
Moral reconation therapy, a type of CBT used to help felons overcome [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD), slightly decreases the risk of further offending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson LM, Wormith JS | title = A meta-analysis of moral reconation therapy | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 57 | issue = 9 | pages = 1076–106 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 22744908 | doi = 10.1177/0306624x12447771 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/31fa19211d9de465d216bccfeba51e25d86cb406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally implemented in a group format because of the risk of offenders with ASPD being given one-on-one therapy reinforces narcissistic behavioral characteristics, and can be used in correctional or outpatient settings. Groups usually meet weekly for two to six months.&lt;ref name=SAMHSA&gt;{{cite web|last1=SAMHSA|title=Moral Reconation Therapy|url=http://legacy.nreppadmin.net/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=34|access-date=22 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629064635/http://legacy.nreppadmin.net/ViewIntervention.aspx?id=34|archive-date=2017-06-29|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stress inoculation training ===
This type of therapy uses a blend of cognitive, behavioral and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meichenbaum 1996 4–7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Meichenbaum D |title = Stress Inoculation Training for Coping with Stressors| journal = The Clinical Psychologist | year = 1996|volume = 69|pages = 4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, and a variety of reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meichenbaum 1996 4–7&quot;/&gt; Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meichenbaum 1996 4–7&quot;/&gt;

The second phase emphasizes the aspect of skills acquisition and rehearsal that continues from the earlier phase of conceptualization. The client is taught skills that help them cope with their stressors. These skills are then practised in the space of therapy. These skills involve self-regulation, problem-solving, interpersonal communication skills, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meichenbaum 1996 4–7&quot;/&gt;

The third and final phase is the application and following through of the skills learned in the training process. This gives the client opportunities to apply their learned skills to a wide range of stressors. Activities include role-playing, imagery, modeling, etc. In the end, the client will have been trained on a preventive basis to inoculate personal, chronic, and future stressors by breaking down their stressors into problems they will address in long-term, short-term, and intermediate coping goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meichenbaum 1996 4–7&quot;/&gt;

=== Activity-Guided CBT: Group-Knitting  ===
A newly developed group therapy model based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) integrates knitting into the therapeutical process and has been proven to yield reliable and promising results. The foundation for this novel approach to CBT is the frequently emphasized notion that therapy success depends on the embeddedness of the therapy method in the patients' natural routine. Similar to standard group-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, patients meet once a week in a group of 10 to 15 patients and knit together under the instruction of a trained psychologist or mental health professional. Central for the therapy is the patient’s imaginative ability to assign each part of the wool to a certain thought. During the therapy, the wool is carefully knitted, creating a knitted piece of any form. This therapeutical process teaches the patient to meaningfully align thought, by (physically) creating a coherent knitted piece. Moreover, since CBT emphasizes the behavior as a result of cognition, the knitting illustrates how thoughts (which are tried to be imaginary tight to the wool) materialize into the reality surrounding us. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Corkhill, B., Hemmings, J., Maddock, A., &amp; Riley, J. (2014). Knitting and Well-being. Textile, 12(1), 34-57.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dugas, M. J., Ladouceur, R., Léger, E., Freeston, M. H., Langolis, F., Provencher, M. D., &amp; Boisvert, J.

=== Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy ===
Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy (MCBH) is a form of CBT focusing on awareness in reflective approach with addressing of subconscious tendencies. It is more the process that contains basically three phases that are used for achieving wanted goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tencl |first=Jakub | name-list-format = vanc |date=25 July 2017 |title=Perception from a multicultural perspective |url=http://explore.bl.uk/BLVU1:LSCOP-ALL:BLL01018446240 |location=London |publisher=Create Space |pages = 83 |isbn=9781537639000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unified Protocol ===
The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) is a form of CBT, developed by [[David H. Barlow]] and researchers at [[Boston University]], that can be applied to a range of depression and anxiety disorders. The rationale is that anxiety and depression disorders often occur together due to common underlying causes and can efficiently be treated together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unifiedprotocol.com/About/Rationale/67/ | title = Rationale for the Development of the UP | website = unifiedprotocol.com | publisher = Unified Protocol Institute | access-date = 22 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UP includes a common set of components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201101/the-future-therapy-unified-treatment-approach | title = The Future of Therapy: A Unified Treatment Approach | magazine = Psychology Today | date = 9 January 2011 | access-date = 22 April 2018 | last = Shpancer | first = Noam | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Psycho-education
# Cognitive reappraisal
# Emotion regulation
# Changing behaviour

The UP has been shown to produce equivalent results to single-diagnosis protocols for specific disorders, such as [[OCD]] and [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlow DH, Farchione TJ, Bullis JR, Gallagher MW, Murray-Latin H, Sauer-Zavala S, Bentley KH, Thompson-Hollands J, Conklin LR, Boswell JF, Ametaj A, Carl JR, Boettcher HT, Cassiello-Robbins C | display-authors = 6 | title = The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders Compared With Diagnosis-Specific Protocols for Anxiety Disorders: A Randomized Clinical Trial | journal = JAMA Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 9 | pages = 875–884 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28768327 | pmc = 5710228 | doi = 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.2164 | author1-link = David H. Barlow }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several studies have shown that the UP is easier to disseminate as compared to single-diagnosis protocols.

===Relative effectiveness===
The research conducted for CBT has been a topic of sustained controversy. While some researchers write that CBT is more effective than other treatments,&lt;ref name = &quot;Tolin_2010&quot; /&gt; many other researchers&lt;ref name = &quot;Barth_2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wampold BE, Flückiger C, Del Re AC, Yulish NE, Frost ND, Pace BT, Goldberg SB, Miller SD, Baardseth TP, Laska KM, Hilsenroth MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = In pursuit of truth: A critical examination of meta-analyses of cognitive behavior therapy | journal = Psychotherapy Research | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–32 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27884095 | doi = 10.1080/10503307.2016.1249433 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/69e341a94bea0b747ba26d6c4ea7397ba499223f }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baardseth_2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Cuijpers_2008&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glenn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glenn CR, Franklin JC, Nock MK | title = Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in youth | journal = Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–29 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25256034 | pmc = 4557625 | doi = 10.1080/15374416.2014.945211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and practitioners&lt;ref name=Slife&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Slife BD, William RN | date = 1995 | title = What's behind the research? Discovering hidden assumptions in the behavioral sciences | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | publisher = Sage }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fancher&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fancher RT | date = 1995 | title = Cultures of healing: Correcting the image of American mental health care | location = New York | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the validity of such claims. For example, one study&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolin_2010&quot; /&gt; determined CBT to be superior to other treatments in treating anxiety and depression. However, researchers&lt;ref name=&quot;Baardseth_2013&quot; /&gt; responding directly to that study conducted a re-analysis and found no evidence of CBT being superior to other bona fide treatments, and conducted an analysis of thirteen other CBT clinical trials and determined that they failed to provide evidence of CBT superiority.  In cases where CBT has been reported to be statistically better than other psychological interventions in terms of primary outcome measures, effect sizes were small and suggested that those differences were clinically meaningless and insignificant.  Moreover, on secondary outcomes (i.e., measures of general functioning) no significant differences have been typically found between CBT and other treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baardseth_2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marcus DK, O'Connell D, Norris AL, Sawaqdeh A | title = Is the Dodo bird endangered in the 21st century? A meta-analysis of treatment comparison studies | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 519–30 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25238455 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2014.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychiatrictimes.com&quot; /&gt;

The importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of CBT when placebo control and blindedness were factored in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch D, Laws KR, McKenna PJ | title = Cognitive behavioural therapy for major psychiatric disorder: does it really work? A meta-analytical review of well-controlled trials | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–24 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19476688 | doi = 10.1017/S003329170900590X | url = http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/2299/5741/3/903449.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pooled data from published trials of CBT in [[schizophrenia]], [[major depressive disorder|major depressive disorder (MDD)]], and [[bipolar disorder]] that used controls for non-specific effects of intervention were analyzed. This study concluded that CBT is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates; treatment effects are small in treatment studies of MDD, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. For MDD, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. Nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lincoln TM | title = Letter to the editor: a comment on Lynch et al. (2009) | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 877–80 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 19917145 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291709991838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kingdon D | title = Over-simplification and exclusion of non-conforming studies can demonstrate absence of effect: a lynching party? | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–7 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19570315 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291709990201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wood AM, Joseph S | title = Letter to the Editor: An agenda for the next decade of psychotherapy research and practice | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 1055–6 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20158935 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291710000243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declining effectiveness===
Additionally, a 2015 meta-analysis revealed that the positive effects of CBT on depression have been declining since 1977.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name = Johnsen2015/&gt; --&gt; The overall results showed two different declines in [[effect size]]s: 1) an overall decline between 1977 and 2014, and 2) a steeper decline between 1995 and 2014. Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name = Johnsen2015/&gt; --&gt; The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.&lt;ref name = Johnsen2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnsen TJ, Friborg O | title = The effects of cognitive behavioral therapy as an anti-depressive treatment is falling: A meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 141 | issue = 4 | pages = 747–68 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25961373 | doi = 10.1037/bul0000015 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ba5fa04b5f4556cc6ccdc3e4004fe0ec28f6a188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High drop-out rates===
Furthermore, other researchers&lt;ref name = &quot;Cuijpers_2008&quot; /&gt; write that CBT studies have high drop-out rates compared to other treatments. At times, the CBT drop-out rates can be more than five times higher than other treatment groups.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cuijpers_2008&quot; /&gt; This high drop-out rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders, particularly the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], which is commonly treated with CBT. Those treated with CBT have a high chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their anorexia behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nolen-Hoeksema | first = Susan | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2014 | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | publisher = McGraw-Hill Education | page = 357 | isbn = 9781259060724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers&lt;ref name = Glenn/&gt; conducting an analysis of treatments for youths who self-injure found similar drop-out rates in CBT and [[Dialectical behavioral therapy|DBT]] groups. In this study, the researchers analyzed several clinical trials that measured the efficacy of CBT administered to youths who self-injure. The researchers concluded that none of them were found to be efficacious&lt;ref name = Glenn/&gt;

===Philosophical concerns with CBT methods===
The methods employed in CBT research have not been the only criticisms; some individuals have called its theory and therapy into question.&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R. T. (1995). ''Cultures of healing: Correcting the image of American mental health care (p. 231)''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slife and Williams&lt;ref name = Slife/&gt; write that one of the hidden assumptions in CBT is that of [[determinism]], or the absence of [[free will]]. They argue that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states: nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for.

Another criticism of CBT theory, especially as applied to major depressive disorder (MDD), is that it confounds the symptoms of the disorder with its causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;psychiatrictimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Doug | last = Berger | name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-escape-binds-tight-methodology/page/0/1?cid=fb#sthash.ti9rtA48.dpuf|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Escape From the Binds of Tight Methodology - Psychiatric Times|date=30 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side effects===
CBT is generally seen as having very low if any side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/details/risks/cmc-20186935|title=Risks - Mayo Clinic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23590545|title=Can cognitive behavioural therapy really change our brains?|date=6 August 2013|via=bbc.co.uk|newspaper=BBC Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whatyoushouldknow.depression-alliance.co.uk/non-drug-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302043906/http://whatyoushouldknow.depression-alliance.co.uk/non-drug-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy |archive-date=2015-03-02 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls have been made for more appraisal of CBT side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalelfservice.net/treatment/psychotherapy/psychotherapy-trials-should-report-the-side-effects-of-treatment/|title=Psychotherapy trials should report on the side effects of treatment|date=30 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072481/|title=Cognitive behavioral therapy|last=pmhdev|date=8 September 2016|publisher=Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG)|via=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-political concerns===

The writer and group analyst Farhad Dalal questions the socio-political assumptions behind the introduction of CBT. According to one reviewer, Dalal connects the rise of CBT with 'the parallel rise of [[neoliberalism]], with its focus on marketization, efficiency, quantification and [[managerialism]]', and he questions the scientific basis of CBT, suggesting that that 'the ‘science’ of psychological treatment is often less a scientific than a political contest'. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://melbournelacanian.wordpress.com/2018/12/18/review-of-cbt-the-cognitive-behavioural-tsunami-by-farhad-dalal/|title=Review of CBT: The Cognitive Behavioural Tsunami|publisher=|date=2018-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/CBT-The-Cognitive-Behavioural-Tsunami-Managerialism-Politics-and-the/Dalal/p/book/9781782206644|title=CBT: The Cognitive Behavioural Tsunami. Managerialism, Politics and the Corruptions of Science, 1st Edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Dalal also questions the ethical basis of CBT.

== Society and culture ==
The UK's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] announced in 2008 that more therapists would be trained to provide CBT at government expense&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurence&quot; /&gt; as part of an initiative called [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT).&lt;ref name=&quot;Leader&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/09/psychology.humanbehaviour|author = Leader D|title = A quick fix for the soul|date = September 8, 2008|work = The Guardian|access-date = April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] said that CBT would become the mainstay of treatment for non-severe depression, with medication used only in cases where CBT had failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurence&quot; /&gt; Therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding CBT receives. Psychotherapist and professor [[Andrew Samuels]] stated that this constitutes &quot;a coup, a power play by a community that has suddenly found itself on the brink of corralling an enormous amount of money&amp;nbsp;... Everyone has been seduced by CBT's apparent cheapness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Laurence&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/the-big-question-can-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-help-people-with-eating-disorders-1128229.html|date = December 16, 2008|access-date = April 22, 2012|title = The big question: can cognitive behavioral therapy help people with eating disorders?|work = [[The Independent]]|author = Laurance J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;conf1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2008/july/CBT+superiority+questioned+at+conference|title = CBT superiority questioned at conference|publisher = University of East Anglia|date = July 7, 2008|access-date = April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK Council for Psychotherapy]] issued a press release in 2012 saying that the IAPT's policies were undermining traditional psychotherapy and criticized proposals that would limit some approved therapies to CBT,&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCP&quot; /&gt; claiming that they restricted patients to &quot;a watered down version of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), often delivered by very lightly trained staff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCP&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/article1488.html|title = UKCP response to Andy Burnham's speech on mental health|date = February 1, 2012|publisher = UK Council for Psychotherapy|access-date = April 22, 2012|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130221020422/http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/article1488.html|archive-date = February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
