He graduated from the [[Turkish Military Academy]] as an engineer officer in 1958, from the [[Army War College (Turkey)|Army Staff College]] in 1970 and from the [[Armed Forces College (Turkey)|Armed Forces College]] in 1971. He graduated from [[NATO Defense College]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

From 1973 to 1985, he served at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]], NATO's headquarters in Belgium. He was promoted to [[brigadier general (Turkey)|brigadier general]] and commanded an armed brigade and division in Turkey.

After the dictator [[Siad Barre]]’s ousting, conflicts between the General [[Mohammed Farah Aidid]] party and other clans in [[Somalia]] had led to famine and lawlessness throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 people had died from starvation. A combined military force of [[United States]] and [[United Nations]] (under the name &quot;UNOSOM&quot;) were deployed to [[Mogadishu]], to monitor the ceasefire and deliver food and supplies to the starving people of Somali. Çevik Bir, who was then a lieutenant-general of [[Turkey]], became the force commander of [[UNOSOM II]] in April 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) |publisher=Department of Public Information |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosom2b.htm |date=1997-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the retreat of US and UN forces after several deaths due to local hostilities mainly led by Aidid, the introduction of a powerful military force opened the transportation routes, enabling the provision of supplies and ended the famine quickly. He was succeeded as Force Commander by a Malaysian general in January 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unosom2b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a four-star general and served three years as vice chairman of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]], then appointed commander of the [[Turkish First Army]], in Istanbul. While he was vice chairman of the TAF, he signed the Turkish-Israeli Military Coordination agreement in 1996.

Çevik Bir became the Turkish army's deputy chief of general staff shortly after the Somali operation and played a vital role in establishing a Turkish-[[Israel]]i entente.
Çevik Bir retired from the army on August 30, 1999.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; He is a former member of the [[Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa]] (ASMEA).

On April 12, 2012, Bir and 30 other officers were taken in custody for their role in the [[1997 military memorandum (Turkey)|1997 military memorandum]] that forced the then Turkish government, led by the Refah Partisi ([[Welfare Party]]), to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkish Military Leaders Held for Role in ’97 Coup |first=Sebnem |last=Arsu |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/world/middleeast/turkey-detains-military-leaders-for-role-in-1997-coup.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Çevik Bir, one of the generals who planned the process, said &quot;In Turkey we have a marriage of Islam and democracy. (…) The child of this marriage is secularism. Now this child gets sick from time to time. The Turkish Armed Forces is the doctor which saves the child. Depending on how sick the kid is, we administer the necessary medicine to make sure the child recuperates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/22/col/102/art/2855 |title=Türkiye’de 'Demokrasi Ayarı' Şart! |publisher=Kibrispostasi.com |date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713150604/http://www.kibrispostasi.com/index.php/cat/22/col/102/art/2855 |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
