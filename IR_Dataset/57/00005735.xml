{{conscription}}
'''Conscription''', sometimes called '''the draft''', is the compulsory enlistment of people in a [[national service]], most often a [[military service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mw&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conscription |title=Conscription |dictionary= Merriam-Webster Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].

Conscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as ''[[Siviilipalvelus]]'' (alternative civil service) in Finland, ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (compulsory community service) in Austria and Switzerland. Several countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces, but also for paramilitary agencies, which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service like [[Internal Troops|internal troops]], [[Border Guard|border guards]] or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] like [[civil defence]].

As of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]]. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription still, therefore, reserve the power to resume conscription during wartime or times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ &lt;!--Bot repaired link--&gt; |title=World War II |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, and democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

==History==

===In pre-modern times===

====Ilkum====
Around the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (1791–1750 [[Before Christ|BC]]), the [[Babylonian Empire]] used a system of conscription called ''Ilkum''. Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land ''per se'' but specific land supplied by the state.&lt;ref name=JN242&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 242] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.&lt;ref name=JN243&gt;{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/243 243] |url=https://archive.org/details/earlymesopotamia00post/page/243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval levies====
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2010}}

In medieval [[Scandinavia]] the ''leiðangr'' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), ''leidang'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''leding'', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''ledung'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''lichting'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''expeditio'' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes ''leþing'' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.

The bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the ''[[fyrd]]'', was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the freemen of each county. In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.&lt;ref&gt;Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52
&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a &quot;ridiculous fantasy&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Medieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.

====Military slavery====
[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[janissaries]]]]

The system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.

In the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kapıkulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[devşirme]]'' (translated &quot;gathering&quot; or &quot;converting&quot;). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kapıkulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kapıkulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeniçeri (Turkish military)|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250 to 1517.

From 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online |access-date=2008-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163316/http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  &quot;the Bloodthirsty&quot; (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]]. He used them to coerce the country into submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern times===
[[File:Branka 1863.JPG|thumb|left|Conscription of Poles to the Russian Army in 1863 (by [[Aleksander Sochaczewski]]).]]
{{see also|Remplacement}}
Modern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French First Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: &quot;Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.&quot;  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Armée]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called &quot;the nation in arms&quot;, which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. More than 2.6&amp;nbsp;million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Conscription |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028164817/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/Conscription.html |archivedate=2009-10-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]]. The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[levée en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Krümpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.&lt;ref&gt;Dierk Walter. ''Preussische Heeresreformen 1807–1870: Militärische Innovation und der Mythos der &quot;Roonschen Reform&quot;''. 2003, in Citino, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russian Empire]], the military service time &quot;owed&quot; by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1834 it was decreased to 20 years. The recruits were to be not younger than 17 and not older than 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |title=Military service in Russia Empire |publisher=roots-saknes.lv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072619/http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Army/military_service_.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Russia introduced universal conscription in the modern pattern, an innovation only made possible by the abolition of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfdom]] in 1861. New military law decreed that all male Russian subjects, when they reached the age of 20, were eligible to serve in the military for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |title=Conscription and Resistance: The Historical Context archived from the original |date=2008-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603141235/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/tcimo/tulp/Research/ARMING.htm |archivedate=2008-06-03 |url-status=dead |access-date=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades prior to World War I universal conscription along broadly Prussian lines became the norm for European armies, and those modeled on them. By 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of Britain and the United States. Some colonial powers such as France reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.

====World Wars====
[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription during [[World War I]], New York City, June 5, 1917.]]

The range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.
In the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility. Expanded-age conscription was common during the Second World War: in Britain, it was commonly known as &quot;call-up&quot; and extended to age 51. [[Nazi Germany]] termed it ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (&quot;People's Storm&quot;) and included children as young as 16 and men as old as 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/volkssturm/index.html |title=The German Volkssturm from Intelligence Bulletin |date = February 1945|publisher=lonesentry.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, both Britain and the Soviet Union conscripted women. The United States was on the verge of drafting women into the Nurse Corps because it anticipated it would need the extra personnel for its planned invasion of Japan. However, the Japanese surrendered and the idea was abandoned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |work=[[CBC News]] |title=CBC News Indepth: International military |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518040804/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ |archivedate=18 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an abrogation of rights. It negates man's fundamental right—the right to life—and establishes the fundamental principle of statism: that a man's life belongs to the state, and the state may claim it by compelling him to sacrifice it in battle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/draft.html|title=Draft|work=aynrandlexicon.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a number of radicals and anarchists, including [[Emma Goldman]], challenged the new draft law in federal court arguing that it was a direct violation of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]'s prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the case of ''[[Arver v. United States]]'' on 7 January 1918. The decision said the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] gave [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[declare war]] and to raise and support armies. The Court emphasized the principle of the reciprocal rights and duties of citizens:
:&quot;It may not be doubted that the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need and the right to compel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Whiteclay Chambers II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987) pp. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
It can be argued that in a [[benefit–cost ratio|cost-to-benefit ratio]], conscription during peacetime is not worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, David R. &quot;[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-2-august-2005 The Role of Economists in Ending the Draft]&quot; (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Months or years of service performed by the most fit and capable subtract from the productivity of the economy; add to this the cost of training them, and in some countries paying them. Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration.

The cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&amp;chapter=195469&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=Milton Friedman |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review|author-link=Milton Friedman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of conscription==

===Political and moral motives===

[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]

[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, believing that it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society, and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals. He based this belief upon the development of the [[Roman republic]], which came to an end at the same time as the Roman army changed from a conscript to professional force.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Social Contract|Rousseau, J-J. Social Contract.]] Chapter &quot;The Roman Comitia&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Aristotle]] linked the division of armed service among the populace intimately with the political order of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 6|Aristotle, Politics, Book 6]] Chapter VII and [[s:Politics (Aristotle)/Book 4|Book 4]] Chapter XIII.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] argued strongly for conscription,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Machiavelli, Marketing and Management|author1=Phil Harris|author2=Andrew Lock |author3=Patricia Rees |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=9781134605682 |pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the professional armies as the cause of the failure of societal unity in Italy.

Other proponents, such as [[William James]], consider both mandatory military and [[national service]] as ways of instilling maturity in young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow.htm |title=The Moral Equivalent of War |author= William James |year=1906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents, such as [[Jonathan Alter]] and [[Mickey Kaus]], support a draft in order to reinforce social equality, create social consciousness, break down class divisions and for young adults to immerse themselves in public enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1995/07/30/cop-out-on-class.html |title=Cop Out on Class |first=Jonathan |last=Alter |newspaper=Newsweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/03/12/interview_with_mickey_kaus_104743.html |title=Interview with Mickey Kaus |publisher=realclearpolitics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/archives/1995/10/01/overcoming-merit |title=Overcoming Merit |first=Virginia |last=Postrel |authorlink=Virginia Postrel }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Rangel]] called for the reinstatement of the draft during the Iraq war, not because he seriously expected it to be adopted, but to stress how the socioeconomic restratification meant that very few children of upper-class Americans served in the all-volunteer American armed forces.

It is estimated by the British military that in a professional military, a company deployed for active duty in peacekeeping corresponds to three inactive companies at home. Salaries for each are paid from the military budget. In contrast, volunteers from a trained reserve are in their civilian jobs when they are not deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Traditionally conscription has been limited to the male population of a given body. Women and [[disabled]] men have been exempt from conscription. Many societies have considered, and continue to consider, military service as a [[initiation rite|test of manhood]] and a [[rite of passage]] from boyhood into manhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

A [[conscientious objector]] is an individual whose personal beliefs are incompatible with [[Armed forces|military service]], or, more often, with any role in the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;On July 30, 1993, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

For example, Sweden used to allow (and once again, with the re-introduction of conscription, allows) conscientious objectors to choose a service in the &quot;weapons-free&quot; branch, such as an airport fireman, nurse, or telecommunications technician.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The reasons for refusing to serve in the military are varied. Some people are conscientious objectors for religious reasons. In particular, the members of the historic [[peace churches]] are [[pacifism|pacifist]] by doctrine, and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on the ground that they believe that Christians should be neutral in international conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/legal-resources/information/packet-conscientious-objection-military-service/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austria ===
Every male citizen of the Republic of Austria up to the age of 35 can be drafted for a six-month long basic military training in the [[Austrian Armed Forces|Bundesheer]]. For men refusing to undergo this training, a nine-month lasting [[Zivildienst in Austria|community service]] is mandatory.

=== Belgium ===
Belgium abolished the conscription in 1994. The last conscripts left active service in February 1995. To this day (2019), a strong minority of the Belgian citizens (especially in [[Flanders]]) supports the idea of reintroducing military conscription, for both men and women.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria had mandatory military service for males above 18 until conscription was ended in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wri-irg.org/en/story/2008/bulgaria-conscription-ended | title=Bulgaria: conscription ended – War Resisters' International | website=www.wri-irg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a shortfall in the army of some 5500 soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.plovdiv24.bg/novini/Bylgaria/Purva-stupka-kum-vrushtaneto-na-kazarmata-769722 | title=Първа стъпка към връщането на казармата | publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of the current ruling coalition have expressed their support for the return of mandatory military service, most notably [[Krasimir Karakachanov]]. Opposition towards this idea from the main coalition partner, GERB, has seen a compromise, where instead of mandatory military service, Bulgaria could possibly introduce a voluntary military service by 2019 where young citizens can volunteer for a period of 6 to 9 months, and will receive a basic wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dnes.bg/politika/2018/01/29/staroto-se-uvolniava-zaicite-revat-i-eto-idva-karakachanova-kazarma.366403 | title=Старото се уволнява, зайците реват...

Universal conscription in China dates back to the State of Qin, which eventually became the Qin Empire of 221 BC. Following unification, historical records show that a total of 300,000 conscript soldiers and 500,000 conscript labourers constructed the [[Great Wall of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html Great Wall&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718184726/http://www.chinapage.com/friend/goh/beijing/greatwall/greatwall.html | date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Conscription in Cyprus}}
Military service in the [[Cypriot National Guard]] is mandatory for all male citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as any male non-citizens born of a parent of [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] descent, lasting from the January 1 of the year in which they turn 18 years of age to December 31, of the year in which they turn 50.

[[File:Copenhagen royal guard waiting.jpg|thumb|Conscription duty as [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] in Copenhagen.]]
Conscription is known in Denmark since the [[Viking Age]], where one man out of every 10 had to serve the king. [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] changed the law in 1710 to every 4th man. The men were chosen by the landowner and it was seen as a penalty.

Since 12 February 1849, every physically fit man must do military service. According to §81 in the [[Constitution of Denmark]], which was promulgated in 1849: &lt;blockquote&gt;Every male person able to carry arms shall be liable with his person to contribute to the defence of his country under such rules as are laid down by Statute.

=== Finland ===
{{Main|Conscription in Finland}}
[[File:Suomalainen sotilasvala.jpg|left|thumb|Finnish conscripts swearing their [[oath of office#Military oath|military oath]] at the end of their basic training period.]]

Conscription in Finland is part of a general compulsion for [[national service|national military service]] for all adult males ({{lang-fi|maanpuolustusvelvollisuus}}; {{lang-sv|totalförsvarsplikt}}) defined in the 127§ of the [[Constitution of Finland]].

Conscription can take the form of military or of civilian service. According to [[Finnish Defence Forces]] 2011 data slightly under 80% of Finnish males turned 30 had entered and finished the military service. The number of female volunteers to annually enter armed service had stabilised at approximately 300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puolustusvoimat.fi/wcm/a2fcbb004bc4f18dabeeef82feb3371d/PV_vuke_2011_ENG.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Annual Report 2011.

The length of civilian service is always twelve months. Those electing to serve unarmed in duties where unarmed service is possible serve either nine or twelve months, depending on their training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2007/20071446 Siviilipalveluslaki (1446/2007)] (''Civilian service act''), 4§.

Any Finnish male citizen who refuses to perform both military and civilian service faces a penalty of 173 days in prison, minus any served days.

The inhabitants of the demilitarized [[Åland Islands]] are exempt from military service. By the Conscription Act of 1951, they are, however, required to serve a time at a local institution, like the coast guard. However, until such service has been arranged, they are freed from service obligation. The non-military service of Åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of Åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.

The military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]]. All services of the Finnish Defence Forces train conscripts. However, the Border Guard trains conscripts only in land-based units, not in coast guard detachments or in the Border Guard Air Wing. Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinjärvi (municipality)|Lapinjärvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.

=== Germany ===
{{Main|Conscription in Germany}}
Between 1956 and 2011 conscription was mandatory for all male citizens in the German [[Bundeswehr|federal armed forces]] (German: ''Bundeswehr''), as well as for the [[Bundesgrenzschutz|Federal Border Guard]] (German: ''Bundesgrenzschutz'') in the 1970s (see [[Compulsory Border Guard Service|Border Guard Service]]). With the end of the [[Cold War]] the [[Cabinet of Germany|German government]] drastically reduced the size of its armed forces. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then, only volunteer professionals serve in the ''Bundeswehr''.

=== Greece ===
{{update section|date=March 2017}}
{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}
[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb| [[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]
Since 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1–10 days at irregular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | title=Archived copy | accessdate=2012-04-10 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf | archivedate=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).

The period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12–36 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are employed by the Greek army as officers and petty officers, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.

Since 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread abuse of the deferment process, resulting in two-thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.

=== Israel ===
{{Main|Conscription in Israel}}
There is a mandatory service for all men and women who are fit and 18 years old. Men must serve 32 months while women serve 24 months with some exempt from mandatory service:
* Muslim and Christian Arabs
* permanent residents such as the [[Druze]] of the Golan Heights
* Ultra-Orthodox Jews can apply for deferment to study in [[Yeshiva]] and the deferment tends to become an exemption
* Female religious Jews, if they declare they are unable to serve due to religious grounds. Many choose to volunteer in the national service [[Sherut Leumi]].

All of the above can choose to volunteer to the IDF. Relatively large numbers of [[Bedouin]] choose to volunteer.

Male [[Druze]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] Israeli citizens are liable, by agreement with their community leaders (Female Druze and Circassian are exempt from service).

=== Netherlands ===
{{Unreferenced section | date=May 2015}}
{{Main|Conscription in the Netherlands}}
Conscription, which was called &quot;Service Duty&quot; ({{lang-nl|dienstplicht}}) in the [[Netherlands]], was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. [[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.

Later on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.

In the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force. However, to this day, every male and – from January 2020 onward – female&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/02/02/kaderwet-dienstplicht-wordt-aangepast-voor-vrouwen | title=Kaderwet dienstplicht wordt aangepast voor vrouwen | first=Ministerie van | last=Defensie | work=rijksoverheid.nl | accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service.

In addition to the military service, the Norwegian government draft a total of 8,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/Aktuelt/Sistenytt/Sivilforsvaret-75-ar--klar-for-nye-oppgaver | title=Sivilforsvaret 75 år – klar for nye oppgaver – Sivilforsvaret.no | website=www.sivilforsvaret.no | language=no | access-date=2018-08-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822214352/http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/Aktuelt/Sistenytt/Sivilforsvaret-75-ar--klar-for-nye-oppgaver/ | archive-date=2018-08-22 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; men and women between 18 and 55 to non-military [[Civil defense|Civil defence]] duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/s/English | title=The Norwegian Civil Defence – Sivilforsvaret.no | website=www.sivilforsvaret.no | access-date=2018-08-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822214030/http://www.sivilforsvaret.no/s/English/ | archive-date=2018-08-22 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Not to be confused with [[Alternative civilian service]].)

=== Serbia ===
{{Main|Conscription in Serbia}}
{{as of|2011|January|1}}, [[Serbia]] no longer practises mandatory military service. Prior to this, mandatory military service lasted 6 months for men. [[Conscientious objector]]s could however opt for 9 months of [[civil service]] instead.

On 15 December 2010, the [[Parliament of Serbia]] voted to suspend mandatory military service. The decision fully came into force on January 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/Vojska-Srbije-od-sutra-i-zvanicno-profesionalna.lt.html Vojska Srbije od sutra i zvanično profesionalna.] – ''[[Politika]]'' {{in lang|sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
{{Main|Conscription in Sweden}}
[[File:Swedish Soldiers Aiming.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish conscripts in 2008.]]
[[Sweden]] had conscription ({{lang-sv|värnplikt}}) for men between 1901 and 2010. During the last few decades it was selective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/information-och-fakta/var-historia/artiklar/varnplikt-under-109-ar | title=Värnplikten genom åren | language=sv | publisher=[[Swedish Armed Forces]] | accessdate=29 March 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329170317/http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/information-och-fakta/var-historia/artiklar/varnplikt-under-109-ar | archivedate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, women have been allowed to sign up by choice, and, if passing the tests, do military training together with male conscripts. Since 1989 women have been allowed to serve in all military positions and units, including combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

In 2010, conscription was made gender-neutral, meaning both women and men would be conscripted –on equal terms. The conscription system was simultaneously deactivated in peacetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Seven years later, referencing increased military threat, the Swedish Government reactivated military conscription. Beginning in 2018, both men and women are conscripted.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] introduced conscription to full-time military service for the first time in January 1916 (the eighteenth month of [[World War I]]) and abolished it in 1920. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, was exempted from the original 1916 military service legislation, and although further legislation in 1918 gave power for an extension of conscription to Ireland, the power was never put into effect.

Conscription was reintroduced in 1939, in the lead up to [[World War II]], and continued in force until 1963. [[Northern Ireland]] was exempted from conscription legislation throughout the whole period.

In all, eight million men were conscripted during both World Wars, as well as several hundred thousand younger single women.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Broad, ''Conscription in Britain 1939–1964: The Militarization of a Generation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of conscription in May 1939, before the war began, was partly due to pressure from the French, who emphasized the need for a large British army to oppose the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hucker, &quot;Franco-British Relations and the Question of Conscription in Britain, 1938–1939,&quot; ''Contemporary European History'', November 2008, Vol. 17 Issue 4, pp 437–56&lt;/ref&gt; From early 1942 unmarried women age 19–30 were conscripted. Most were sent to the factories, but they could volunteer for the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) and other women's services. Some women served in the [[Women's Land Army]]: initially volunteers but later conscription was introduced. However, women who were already working in a skilled job considered helpful to the war effort, such as a [[General Post Office]] telephonist, were told to continue working as before. None was assigned to combat roles unless she volunteered. By 1943 women were liable to some form of directed labour up to age 51. During the Second World War, 1.4&amp;nbsp;million British men volunteered for service and 3.2&amp;nbsp;million were conscripted. Conscripts comprised 50% of the [[Royal Air Force]], 60% of the [[Royal Navy]] and 80% of the [[British Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy A. Crang, &quot;'Come into the Army, Maud': Women, Military Conscription, and the Markham Inquiry,&quot; ''Defence Studies'', November 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp. 381,–95; statistics from pp. 392–93&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of conscription in Britain was announced on 4 April 1957, by new prime minister [[Harold Macmillan]], with the last conscripts being recruited three years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1957.html | title=Those were the days | work=expressandstar.com | accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Conscription in the United States}}
Conscription in the United States ended in 1973, but males aged between 18 and 25 are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] to enable a reintroduction of conscription if necessary. President [[Gerald Ford]] had suspended mandatory draft registration in 1975; but, President [[Jimmy Carter]] reinstated that requirement when the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan]] five years later. Consequently, Selective Service registration is still required of almost all young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Gill | first=Linda | title=Military Conscription, Recruiting and the Draft | publisher=About.com US Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been no prosecutions for violations of the draft registration law since 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Resistance Committee&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last1=Hasbrouck | first1=Edward | title=Prosecutions of Draft Registration Resisters | url=https://hasbrouck.org/draft/prosecutions.html | website=Resisters.info | publisher=National Resistance Committee | accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males between the ages of 17 and 45, and female members of the [[US National Guard]] may be conscripted for federal militia service pursuant to 10 U.S. Code § 246 and the [[Militia Clause]]s of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/246 | title=10 U.S. Code § 246 – Militia: composition and classes | website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2019, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that male-only conscription breached the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. In ''[[National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System]]'', a case brought by non-profit men's rights organisation the [[National Coalition for Men]] against the U.S. Selective Service System, judge [[Gray H. Miller]] issued a declaratory judgement that the male-only registration requirement is unconstitutional, though did not specify what action the government should take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/24/military-draft-judge-rules-male-only-registration-unconstitutional/2968872002 | title= With women in combat roles, a federal court rules the male-only draft unconstitutional | last1= Korte | first1=Gregory | date=Feb 24, 2019 | work= [[USA Today]] | publisher= | accessdate= February 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
