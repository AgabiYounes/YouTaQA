'''Carlton Douglas Ridenhour''' (born August 1, 1960), known professionally as '''Chuck D''', is an American rapper, author, and producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D|first=Chuck|title=Chuck D: Lyrics of a Rap Revolutionary|year=2007|publisher=Offda|location=Gardena, Calif.|isbn=978-0-9749484-1-6|author2=Jah, Yusuf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the leader of the rap group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], he helped create politically and socially conscious [[hip hop music]] in the mid-1980s. ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' ranked him at No. 12 on their list of the Top 50 Hip-Hop Lyricists of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapgenius.com/discussions/8591-The-source-top-50-lyricists-magazine-scans|title=The Source: Top 50 Lyricists [Magazine Scans] - Genius|work=Genius|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malmö 1991.jpg|thumb|Chuck D. [[Malmö]] 1991.]]

==Early life==
Ridenhour was born in [[Queens|Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/chuck-d/|title=Chuck D biography|work=MTV Artists|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began writing rhymes after the [[New York City blackout of 1977]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang 237-238&quot;/&gt; After graduating from [[Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School]], he went to [[Adelphi University]] on [[Long Island]] to study [[graphic design]], where he met William Drayton ([[Flavor Flav]]).  He received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]] from Adelphi in 1984 and later received an honorary doctorate from Adelphi in 2013.

While at Adelphi, Ridenhour co-hosted hip hop radio show the ''Super Spectrum Mix Hour'' as Chuck D on Saturday nights at Long Island rock radio station [[WLIR]], designed flyers for local hip-hop events, and drew a cartoon called ''Tales of the Skind'' for Adelphi student newspaper ''The Delphian''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang 237-238&quot;&gt;Chang 2005, pp. 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Upon hearing Ridenhour's [[Demo (music)|demo track]] &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;, fledgling producer/upcoming music-mogul [[Rick Rubin]] insisted on signing him to his [[Def Jam]] [[Record Label|label]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795958,00.html |title=Hip-hop, you don't stop |work=the Guardian |accessdate=September 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516232352/https://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0%2C%2C1795958%2C00.html |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their major label albums were ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'' ([[1987 in music|1987]]), ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'' ([[1988 in music|1988]]), ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'' ([[1990 in music|1990]]), ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' ([[1991 in music|1991]]), ''[[Greatest Misses]]'' ([[1992 in music|1992]]), and ''[[Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age]]'' ([[1994 in music|1994]]).  They also released a [[He Got Game (soundtrack)|full-length album soundtrack]] for the film ''[[He Got Game]]'' in 1998. Ridenhour also contributed (as Chuck D) to several episodes of the [[PBS]] [[Television documentary|documentary]] series ''[[The Blues]]''. He has appeared as a featured artist on many other songs and albums, having collaborated with artists such as [[Janet Jackson]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[The Dope Poet Society]], [[Run–D.M.C.]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Boom Boom Satellites]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[John Mellencamp]] and many others. In 1990, he appeared on &quot;[[Kool Thing]]&quot;, a song by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Sonic Youth]], and along with [[Flavor Flav]], he sang on [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s song &quot;Tweakin'&quot;, which appears on his 1989 album ''[[The Cinderella Theory]]''. In 1993, he executive produced ''Got 'Em Running Scared'', an album by [[Ichiban Records]] group Chief Groovy Loo and the Chosen Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Chief+Groovy+Loo+And+The+Chosen+Tribe |title=Chief Groovy Loo And The Chosen Tribe |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
In 1996, Ridenhour released ''[[Autobiography of Mistachuck]]'' on [[Mercury Records]]. Chuck D made a rare appearance at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], presenting the [[Video Vanguard Award]] to the [[Beastie Boys]], whilst commending their musicianship. In November 1998, he [[settlement (law)|settled out of court]] with Christopher &quot;[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]&quot; Wallace's estate over the latter's [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of his voice in the song &quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot;. The specific sampling is Ridenhour counting off the numbers one to nine on the track &quot;Shut 'Em Down&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiss |first=Randy |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/504067/chuck-d-settles-big-copyright-suit.jhtml |title=Public Enemy's Chuck D Settles B.I.G. Copyright Suit |publisher=MTV |date=November 17, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described the decision to sue as &quot;stupid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=paul.arnold|title=Chuck D Explains Why Suing The Notorious B.I.G. Was &quot;Stupid&quot; And Why Jay-Z And Kanye West's Bases Are &quot;Corrupt To Rap&quot;|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.18962/title.chuck-d-explains-why-suing-the-notorious-b-i-g-was-stupid-and-why-jay-z-and-kanye-wests-bases-are-corrupt-to-rap#|accessdate=23 June 2017|work=HipHopDX|date=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, he launched a multi-format &quot;supersite&quot; on the web site Rapstation.com. The site includes a TV and radio station with original programming, prominent hip hop DJs, celebrity interviews, free [[MP3]] downloads (the first was contributed by multi-platinum rapper [[Coolio]]), downloadable [[ringtone]]s by [[ToneThis]], social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living.  Since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] in the music industry.

He loaned his voice to ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' as DJ Forth Right MC for the radio station [[Playback FM]].  In 2000, he collaborated with Public Enemy's Gary G-Whiz and MC Lyte on the theme music to the television show ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]''.  He appeared with [[Henry Rollins]] in a cover of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s &quot;Rise Above&quot; for the album ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''. In 2003, he was featured in the PBS documentary [[The Blues: Godfathers and Sons|''Godfathers and Sons'']] in which he recorded a version of [[Muddy Waters]]' song &quot;[[Mannish Boy]]&quot; with [[Common (rapper)|Common]], Electrik Mud Cats, and [[Kyle Jason]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2003/tv/reviews/godfathers-sons-1200539628/|title=Godfathers &amp; Sons|last=Gallo|first=Phil|date=September 2, 2003|website=Variety|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured on [[Z-Trip]]'s album ''[[Shifting Gears (DJ Z-Trip album)|Shifting Gears]]'' on a track called &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;; a 12-inch of the track was released featuring artwork by [[Shepard Fairey]]. In 2008 he contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]], and also turned up on [[The Go! Team]]'s album ''[[Proof of Youth]]'' on the track &quot;Flashlight Fight.&quot; He also fulfilled his childhood dreams of being a sports announcer by performing the play-by-play commentary in the video game ''[[NBA Ballers: Chosen One]]'' on [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]].

In 2009, Ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book ''The Love Ethic: The Reason Why You Can't Find and Keep Beautiful Black Love'' by Kamau and Akilah Butler.  He also appeared on [[Brother Ali]]'s album, ''[[Us (Brother Ali album)|Us]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Williams, Kam |title=The Love Ethic |url=http://www.kamwilliams.com/2009/06/by-kamau-and-akilah-butler-foreword-by.html|date=June 30, 2009 |publisher=KamWilliams.com |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck D duetted with Rock singer [[Meat Loaf]] on his 2011 album ''[[Hell in a Handbasket]]'' on the song &quot;Mad Mad World/The Good God Is a Woman and She Don't Like Ugly&quot;.

In 2016 Chuck D joined the band [[Prophets of Rage]] along with [[B-Real]] and former members of [[Rage Against the Machine]].

In July 2019, Ridenhour sued Terrordome Music Publishing and Reach Music Publishing for $1 million for withholding royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8526817/chuck-d-sues-publishing-company-reach-music-for-withholding-royalties|title=Chuck D Sues Publishing Company Reach Music for Withholding Royalties|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rapping technique and creative process==
Chuck D is known for his powerful [[rapping]]. ''How to Rap'' says he &quot;has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated248&quot;&gt;Edwards, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck says this was based on listening to [[Melle Mel]] and sportscasters such as [[Marv Albert]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated248&quot;/&gt;

Chuck often comes up with a title for a song first.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies]]''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-8129-7775-2}}. p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes on paper, though sometimes edits using a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZemzPXFgeEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 143.]&lt;/ref&gt; He prefers to not [[Punch in/out|punch in]]&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[overdub]] vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chuck listed his favourite rap albums in ''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'': 10. [[N.W.A]], ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' 9. [[Boogie Down Productions]], ''[[Criminal Minded]]'' 8. [[Run-DMC]], ''[[Tougher Than Leather]]'' 7. [[Big Daddy Kane]], ''[[Looks Like a Job For...]]'' 6. Stetsasonic, ''[[In Full Gear]]'' 5. [[Ice Cube]], ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' 4. [[Dr. Dre]], ''[[The Chronic]]'' 3. [[De La Soul]], ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'' 2. [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]], ''[[Follow the Leader (Eric B. &amp; Rakim album)|Follow the Leader]]'' 1. [[Run-DMC]], ''[[Raising Hell (album)|Raising Hell]]'' (&quot;It was the first record that made me realise this was an album-oriented genre&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Mansel |last= Fletcher |title= 100 Best Albums Ever |magazine= [[Hip Hop Connection]] |date= March 2000 |page= 21-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Chuck D identifies as Black, as opposed to African or African-American. In a 1993 issue of DIRT Magazine covering a taping of [[In the Mix (TV series)|In the Mix]] hosted by [[Alimi Ballard]] at the Apollo, Dan Field writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;At one point, Chuck bristles a bit at the term &quot;African-American.&quot; He thinks of himself as Black and sees nothing wrong with the term. Besides, he says, having been born in the United States and lived his whole life here, he doesn't consider himself African. Being in Public Enemy has given him the chance to travel around the world, an experience that really opened his eyes and his mind. He says visiting Africa and experiencing life on a continent where the majority of people are Black gave him a new perspective and helped him get in touch with his own history. He also credits a trip to the ancient Egyptian pyramids at Giza with helping him appreciate the relative smallness of man. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Dan|date=1993|title=New York, New York; Chuck D, Public Enemy's Mouthpiece|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7489q3mv/|journal=DIRT Magazine|type=Zine|volume=|pages=|via=Online Archive of California; University of California, Los Angeles Library Special Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted ''[[Unfiltered]]'' on [[Air America Radio]], testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in support of [[peer-to-peer]] MP3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention.  He has continued to be an [[activism|activist]], publisher, lecturer, and producer. 

Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book ''Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality'' with Yusuf Jah. He argues that &quot;music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality&quot;, but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when &quot;things could lead a young mind in a direction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html |title=Chuck D: The D is for Dangerous |publisher=Crave Online |date=August 6, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130807110142/http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html |archivedate=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard's short film ''Bling: Consequences and Repercussions'', which examines the role of [[conflict diamonds]] in [[bling]] fashion. Despite Chuck D and Public Enemy's success, Chuck D claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. He is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' that, &quot;The key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. The creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in America, Europe and Asia. It gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Thorpe | first= David |  url= http://bombsite.com/issues/68/articles/2251 | title= Chuck D | work= [[BOMB Magazine]] | date=Summer 1999| accessdate= June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' published January 29, 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;monde&quot;&gt;{{cite news|  title= Chuck D : let rap sans strass| language= French| trans-title= Chuck D: Rap Without Rhinestones| work= [[Le Monde]]|  date= January 29, 2008 | first= Véronique | last= Mortaigne| url= http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2008/01/29/chuck-d-le-rap-sans-strass_1004960_3246.html#ens_id=1005052| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131062649/http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2008/01/29/chuck-d-le-rap-sans-strass_1004960_3246.html#ens_id=1005052 | archivedate= January 31, 2008| accessdate= June 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master. He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He stated that French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa. In this article, he defended a comment made by [[Professor Griff]] in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people. Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.&lt;ref name=&quot;monde&quot; /&gt;

In an interview with the magazine ''N'Digo'' published in June 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of [[materialism]] and [[sexism]], perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However, he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying &quot;It's only going to be dead if it doesn't talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement&quot;, citing artists such as [[NYOil]], [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] and [[The Roots]] as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. &quot;A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They're just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad, Cinque. &quot;[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1jc28ghXquEJ:www.ndigo.com/coverstory.asp+Chuck+D+N'DIGO&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk Hip-Hop Conspiracy? Critics charge conscious rap is silenced.]&quot; ''N'Digo Online''. June 26 - July 2, 2008. Retrieved July 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Chuck D released a track, &quot;Tear Down That Wall&quot;. He said, &quot;I talked about the wall not only just dividing the U.S. and Mexico but the states of California, New Mexico and Texas. But Arizona, it's like, come on. Now they're going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957694/chuck-d-takes-aim-at-arizona-public-enemy-in-the-studio|title=Chuck D Takes Aim at Arizona; Public Enemy In the Studio|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
