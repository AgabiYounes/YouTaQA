[[File:Andy Warhol 1975.jpg|thumb|[[Andy Warhol]] coined the phrase &quot;[[15 minutes of fame]]&quot;]]
'''Celebrity''' is the [[fame]] and public attention accorded by the [[mass media]] to individuals or groups or, occasionally, animals, but is usually applied to the persons or groups of people (celebrity couples, families, etc.) themselves who receive such a status of fame and attention. Celebrity status is often associated with [[wealth]] (commonly referred to as ''fame and fortune''), while fame through entertainment are commonly associated with celebrity status,&lt;ref name = &quot;I want to be famous &quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= I want to be famous|url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/17/i-want-to-be-famous |publisher= Celebbuzz|date= April 17, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2011|location=London|first=Emma|last=Brockes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Western world kids want to grow up to be famous Children in developing countries want to be doctors &quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Western world kids want to grow up to be famous |url=http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/304123--western-world-kids-want-to-grow-up-to-be-famous |publisher=[[News1130]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 25, 2011 |location=Vancouver |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101230510/http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/304123--western-world-kids-want-to-grow-up-to-be-famous |archivedate=January 1, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[political leaders]] often become celebrities. People may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or for their connection to a famous person.

==History==
[[File:Choregos actors MAN Napoli Inv9986.jpg|thumb|[[Choregos]] and theater actors, from the [[House of the Tragic Poet]], [[Pompeii]], Italy. [[Naples National Archeological Museum]]]]
[[Athlete]]s in [[Ancient Greece]] were welcomed home as heroes, had songs and poems written in their honor, and received free food and gifts from those seeking [[celebrity endorsement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ancient Greek Athletics|last = Miller|first = Stephen|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-300-11529-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome]] similarly lauded actors and notorious gladiators, and [[Julius Caesar]] appeared on a coin in his own lifetime (a departure from the usual depiction of battles and divine lineage).&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1777554.stm|title = A brief history of celebrity|date = April 4, 2003|accessdate = June 8, 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 12th century, [[Thomas Becket]] became famous following his murder. He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started out as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.

The cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|last = Inglis |first = Fred|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010 | isbn = 9780691135625}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.

The [[Film industry|movie industry]] spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and now, the familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity was not always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting out as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', &quot;in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of [[movie star]]s and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.

The second half of the century saw [[television]] and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: &quot;We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |newspaper = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a beatle live}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and news readers. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into wider stardom.

In the '60s and early '70s, the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases, the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Becoming a celebrity==
[[File:The Chief Guest and renowned actor Shahrukh Khan addressing at the inauguration of the 38th International Film Festival of India (IFFI-2007) at Panaji, Goa on November 23, 2007.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Shah Rukh Khan]] is an Indian actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, host and much more. ]]
People may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. The term &quot;instant celebrity&quot; describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a &quot;B-grade celebrity&quot;. Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.

===Success===
There are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.

Though glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102034806/http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boxall |first=Natalie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &amp;#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&amp;A: Career options in the music industry &amp;#124; Guardian careers &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219081012/http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, [[invention]], [[medicine]], and courtroom law which is not fictional. American microbiologist [[Maurice Hilleman]] is credited with saving more lives than any other medical [[scientist]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Maurice R. Hilleman, 85; Scientist Developed Many Vaccines That Saved Millions of Lives|author=Maugh, Thomas H.

His anonymity, in comparison with Madonna, Michael Jackson, [[Jose Canseco]], or an assortment of grade B actors, tells something about our society's and media's concepts of celebrity; much less of the heroic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://counterpunch.org/nader04162005.html |accessdate=2009-11-13 |date=2005-04-16 |last=Nader |first=Ralph |title=Scientists or celebrities? |work=Counterpunch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulty===

A number of [[Sportsperson|athletes]] who are unable to turn professional take a second job or even sometimes abandon their athletic aspirations in order to make ends meet. A small percentage of entertainers and athletes are able to make a decent living but a vast majority will spend their careers toiling from hard work, determination, rejection, and frequent unemployment. For minor league to amateur athletes, earnings are usually on the lower end of the pay-scale. Many of them take second jobs on the side or even venture into other occupations within the field of sports such as coaching, [[general management]], [[referee]]ing, or recruiting and scouting up-and-coming athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=E.

===Becoming a celebrity in the U.S.===

The [[Screen Actors Guild]], a union representing actors and actresses throughout [[Hollywood]] reports that the average television and film actor earns less than US$50,000 annually; the median hourly wage for actors was $18.80 in May 2015.&lt;ref name = &quot;Actors, Producers, and Directors &quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Actors|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/actors.htm |publisher= U.S. Bureau of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2015 Edition|date= |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redbirdstudio.com/AWOL/life.html |title=An Actor's Life |publisher=Redbirdstudio.com |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111040742/http://www.redbirdstudio.com/AWOL/life.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegegrad.com/careers/proft23.shtml |title=Career Information – Actors, Producers, and Directors |publisher=Collegegrad.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors sometimes alternate between theater, television, and film or even branch into other occupations within the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]] such as becoming a singer, comedian, producer, or a television host in order to be monetarily diversified, as doing one gig pays comparatively very little. For instance, [[David Letterman]] is well known for branching into [[late night television]] as a [[talk show host]] while honing his skills as a stand-up comedian, [[Barbra Streisand]] ventured into acting while operating as a singer, or [[Clint Eastwood]], who achieved even greater fame in Hollywood for being a film director and a producer than for his acting credentials.

According to American entertainment magnate [[Master P]], entertainers and professional athletes make up less than 1% of all millionaires in the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/p-miller-formerly-master-p-says-if-you-have-computer-500-i-can-show-you-how-make-millions-912343.htm | title=P.

According to the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the median wage for commercial and print models was only $11.22 per hour in 2006 and was also listed one of the top ten worst jobs in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;worst jobs&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Mantell | first = Ruth | title = The 10 worst jobs in America: Low pay, no benefits put these workers in a tough spot | work = MarketWatch | publisher = Dow Jones | date = November 1, 2007 | url = http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/10-worst-jobs-america/story.aspx?guid=%7B6345DDB1%2D03BA%2D4760%2DB763%2D4F98BA9D9145%7D&amp;dist=MostReadHome | accessdate = 2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Forbes'' Celebrity 100===

''[[Forbes]]'' Magazine releases an annual [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] list of the highest paid celebrities in the world. The total earnings for all top celebrity 100 earners totaled $4.5 billion over the course of 2010 alone.

For instance, Forbes ranked [[media mogul]] and [[talk show host]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] as the top earner &quot;Forbes magazine’s annual ranking of the most powerful celebrities&quot;, with earnings of $290 million in the past year. Forbes cites that [[Lady Gaga]] reportedly earned over $90 million in 2010.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lady Gaga Tops Celebrity 100 List&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Lady Gaga Tops Celebrity 100 List |url= https://www.forbes.com/2011/05/16/lady-gaga-tops-celebrity-100-11.html/= |work=Forbes|date= May 16, 2016|accessdate=October 13, 2019 |first=Dorothy |last=Pomerantz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, golfer [[Tiger Woods]] was one of highest-earning celebrity athletes, with an income of $74 million and is consistently ranked one of the highest paid [[sportsperson|athlete]]s in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lady Gaga Tops Celebrity 100 List&quot;/&gt; In 2013, Madonna was ranked as the fifth most powerful and the highest earning celebrity of the year with earnings of $125 million.

Celebrity endorsements have proven very successful around the world where, due to increasing [[consumerism]], an individual is considered to own a status symbol when they purchase a celebrity-endorsed product{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Although it has become commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their names and have put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. Along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, a number of celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country's economy.

Numerous celebrities have ventured into becoming [[business mogul]]s and established themselves as entrepreneurs, idolizing many well known American business leaders such as [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]]. For instance, basketball legend [[Michael Jordan]] became an active entrepreneur involved with many sports related ventures including investing a minority stake in the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Paul Newman]] started his own [[salad dressing]] business after leaving behind a distinguished acting career, and rap musician [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] started his own [[record label]], clothing line, and an [[oil well|oil business]] while maintaining a career as a rap artist. Brazilian football legend and World Cup winner [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] became the majority owner of La Liga club [[Real Valladolid]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ronaldo: Former Brazil striker buys controlling stake in Real Valladolid |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45397137 |accessdate=6 September 2018 |agency=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other celebrities such as [[Tyler Perry]], [[George Lucas]], and Steven Spielberg have become successful entrepreneurs through starting their own film production companies and running their own [[movie studio]]s beyond their traditional activities of screenwriting, directing, animating, producing, and acting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul Newman Donates Salad Dressing Ownership To Charity &quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Paul Newman Donates Salad Dressing Ownership To Charity|url= http://www.looktothestars.org/news/890-paul-newman-donates-salad-dressing-value-to-charity|publisher= Look to the Stars|date= June 11, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabloid magazines and talk TV shows bestow a great deal of attention on celebrities. To stay in the public eye and build wealth in addition to their salaried labor, numerous celebrities have participating and branching into various business ventures and endorsements. Many celebrities have participated in many different endorsement opportunities that include: animation, publishing, fashion designing, cosmetics, [[consumer electronics]], household items and [[home appliance|appliance]]s, cigarettes, [[soft drink]]s and alcoholic beverages, hair care, hairdressing, [[jewelry design]], fast food, credit cards, video games, writing, and toys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses &quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/stars-biz-successful-forbeslife-cx_dp_0722style_2.html= |work=Forbes |date=July 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118190511/http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/22/stars-biz-successful-forbeslife-cx_dp_0722style_2.html%3D |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to various endorsements, a number of celebrities have been involved with some business and investment related ventures also include:  and toddler related items, [[List of professional sports team owners|sports team ownership]], [[fashion design|fashion retailing]], establishments such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, and casinos, movie theaters, advertising and event planning, management related ventures such as [[sports management]], financial services, [[modeling agency|model management]], and [[talent management]], [[record label]]s, [[film production]], [[television producer|television production]], publishing such as [[book publisher|book]] and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]], massage therapy, [[Beauty salon|salon]]s, health and fitness, and real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best And Worst Celebrity Side Businesses &quot;/&gt;

Although some celebrities have achieved additional financial success from various business ventures, the vast majority of celebrities are not successful businesspeople and still rely on salaried labored wages in order to earn a living. Most businesses and investments are well known to have a 90 to 95 percent failure rate within the first five years of operation. Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their own businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such a validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to general public does not the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor. This means they can have an unfair advantage to expose their business ventures and endorsements and can easily capture a more significant amount of market share than the average entrepreneur.&lt;ref name=&quot;7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=7 Most Embarrassing Celebrity Business Failures |url=http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |publisher=Growthink |year=2007 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702110650/http://www.growthink.com/business-plan/7_Most_Embarrassing_Celebrity_Business_Plan_Failures.html |archivedate=July 2, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a mass media phenomenon==
[[File:Kim Kardashian 2017 (cropped).png|thumb|[[Kim Kardashian]], reality TV star]]

Celebrities often have fame comparable to [[royal family|royalty]]. As a result, there is a strong public curiosity about their private affairs. The release of [[Kim Kardashian]]'s [[Celebrity sex tape|sex tape]] with rapper [[Ray J]] in 2003 brought her to a new level of fame, leading to magazine covers, book deals, and [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|reality TV]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=&quot;Kim Kardashian Superstar Featuring Ray J&quot; 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | last=Hirsch | first=S | journal=Vivid Entertainment LLC. – 18 U.S.C. 2257 Compliance Records | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vivid&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|title= Vivid Entertainment Spends $1-Million To Acquire Notorious Video 'Starring' Sexy Socialite Kim Kardashian And Hip Hop Star Ray J|accessdate= 2008-10-06|author= [[Vivid Entertainment]]|date= 2007-02-07|publisher= Hip Hop Press|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923231924/http://www.hiphoppress.com/2007/02/vivid_entertain.html|archivedate= September 23, 2008|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities may be resented for their accolades, and the public may have a love/hate relationship with celebrities. Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal with their political views. For example, [[Matt Damon]] expressed his displeasure with 2008 US vice presidential nominee [[Sarah Palin]], as well as with the 2011 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|United States debt-ceiling crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,420621,00.html |title=Matt Damon: Sarah Palin Presidency Would Be Like a 'Really Bad Disney Movie' |publisher=Fox News |date=2008-09-08 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young |first=Kevin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/8617149.stm |title=Election 2010: Political celebrities – then and now |work=BBC News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous for being famous==
{{Main|Famous for being famous}}
[[File:Paris Hilton 2009.jpg|thumb|American [[socialite]] [[Paris Hilton]] was one of the first celebrities to be described as '[[#Famous for being famous|famous for being famous]]', she has since expanded her brand into a  multibillion-dollar empire]]
Famous for being famous, in [[popular culture]] terminology, refers to someone who attains celebrity status for no particular identifiable reason, or who achieves fame through association with a celebrity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Joe|title=Contemporary moral issues|publisher=Heinemann|year=2002|edition=4, illustrated|series=Examining Religions |page=178|isbn=978-0-435-30309-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is a [[pejorative]], suggesting that the individual has no particular talents or abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;JenJones&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jen|title=Being Famous|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2007|series=Snap Books: 10 Things You Need to Know about|page=20|isbn=978-1-4296-0126-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when their fame arises from a particular talent or action on their part, the term will sometimes still apply if their fame is perceived as disproportionate to what they earned through their own talent or work.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The coinages &quot;[[famesque]]&quot; and &quot;[[celebutante]]&quot; are of similar pejorative gist.

==Internet celebrities==
Also known as being ''[[Internet celebrity|internet famous]]'', contemporary fame does not always involve a physical red carpet.

===Online fame in Asia===
A report by [[BBC]] highlighted a longtime trend of Asian internet celebrities such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]] celebrity [[Wang Hong]] (birth name Ling Ling).&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Internet Fame&quot;&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/36802769 &quot;Wang Hong: China's online stars making real cash&quot;] ''[[BBC News]]''. May 1, 2017. Retrieved May 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC, there are two kinds of online celebrities in China—those who create original content, such as [[Papi Jiang]], who is regularly censored by Chinese authorities for cussing in her videos, and those such as Wang Hong and Zhang Dayi, who fall under the second category, as they have clothing and cosmetics businesses on Taobao, China's equivalent of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Internet Fame&quot;/&gt;

===Social networking and video hosting===
Most high-profile celebrities participate in [[social networking]] and photo or video hosting platforms such as [[List of YouTubers|YouTube]], Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.&lt;ref&gt;Murad, Ahmed [http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5641893.ece &quot;The 50 most popular celebs on Twitter&quot;], The Sunday Times, February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites allow celebrities to communicate directly with their fans, removing the middle-man known as traditional media. Social media humanizes celebrities in a way that arouses public fascination as evident by the success of magazines such as ''[[Us Weekly]]'' and ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]''. Celebrity blogging have also spawned stars such as [[Perez Hilton]] who is well known for not only blogging, but also [[outing]] celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Anne|date=Spring 2007|title=Celebrity juice, not from concentrate: Perez Hilton, gossip blogs, and the new star production|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc49.2007/PerezHilton/index.html|journal=Jump Cut|volume=49|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media and the rise of the smartphone has changed how celebrities are treated and how people gain the platform of fame. Not everything is as concealed as it was back in old Hollywood because now everything is put out on the internet by fans or even the celebrity themselves. Websites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube allow people to become a celebrity overnight. For example, [[Justin Bieber]] got his start on YouTube by posting videos of him singing and got discovered. All of his fans got direct contact to his content and were able to interact with him on several social media platforms. Social media has substantially changed what it means to be a celebrity. Instagram and YouTube gives regular people an opportunity to become rich and famous all from inside their home. It also gives fans the opportunity to connect with their favorite celebrity without ever meeting them in person. Everything is being shared on social media so it makes it harder for celebrities to live private lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/celebrity-social-media-anger/|title=How social media has changed what it means to be a celebrity|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media sites have also contributed to the fame of some celebrities, such as [[Tila Tequila]] who became known through MySpace.&lt;ref&gt;Trebay, Guy [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/fashion/28fame.html &quot;She's Famous (and So Can You)&quot;], The New York Times, October 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Families==
[[File:The British royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.JPG|thumb|right|Members of the House of Windsor on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, 15 June 2013.]]
Another example of celebrity is a family that has notable ancestors or is known for its wealth. In some cases, a well-known family is associated with a particular field. For example, the [[Kennedy family]] is associated with US politics; The [[House of Windsor]] with royalty; The [[Hilton family|Hilton]] and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families with business; the [[Jackson family]] with popular music; and the [[The Osbournes|Osbourne]], [[Chaplin family|Chaplin]], [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian]], [[Baldwin family|Baldwin]], and [[Barrymore family|Barrymore]] families with television and film.

==Restricted access==
Access to celebrities is strictly controlled by their entourage of staff which includes [[Talent manager|manager]]s, [[publicist]]s, [[Talent agent|agent]]s, [[personal assistant]]s, and [[bodyguard]]s. Even journalists find it difficult to access celebrities for interviews.  Writer and actor [[Michael Musto]] said, &quot;You have to go through many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. You have to get past three different sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[n:An interview with gossip columnist Michael Musto on the art of celebrity journalism|en.wikinews.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities often hire one or more bodyguards (or close protection officer) to protect themselves and their families from threats ranging from the mundane (intrusive [[paparazzi|paparazzi photographers]] or [[autograph]]-seeking [[Fan (person)|fans]]) to serious ([[assault]], [[kidnapping]], [[assassination]], or [[stalking]]). The bodyguard travels with the celebrity during professional activities (movie shoots or concerts) and personal activities such as recreation and errands.

Celebrities also typically have security staff at their home, to protect them from similar threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iacpo.org/ |title=International Association of Close Protection Officers |access-date=September 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115032219/http://www.iacpo.org/ |archive-date=January 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Celebrity-stalking has common threads &quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Celebrity-stalking has common threads|url= http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=6730960= |publisher= ABC|date= March 26, 2009|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==15 minutes of fame==
{{see also|15 minutes of fame|One-hit wonder}}

[[Andy Warhol]] famously coined the phrase &quot;[[15 minutes of fame]]&quot; in reference to a short-lived publicity. Certain &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot; celebrities can be average people seen with an A-list celebrity, who are sometimes noticed on entertainment news channels such as [[E! News]]. These persons are ordinary people becoming celebrities, often based on the ridiculous things they do.  &quot;In fact, many reality show contestants fall into this category: the only thing that qualifies them to be on TV is that they're real.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maasik, Sonia, and Jack Solomon. ''Signs of Life in the USA''. 5th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health implications==

[[John Cleese]] said being famous offers some advantages such as financial wealth and easier access to things that are more difficult for non-famous people to access, such as the ability to more easily meet other famous or powerful people, but that being famous also often comes with the disadvantage of creating the conditions in which the celebrity finds themselves acting, at least temporarily (although sometimes over extended periods of time), in a superficial, inauthentic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PJaHSovyZ4 John Cleese Speaking at the American School in London] (beginning at about 44:25 into the video)&lt;/ref&gt;

Common threats such as [[stalking]] have spawned [[celebrity worship syndrome]] where a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity's personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumaker&quot;&gt;Schumaker, John F., 'Star Struck' New Internationalist; Issue 363, p34-35, 2p, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;    Psychologists have indicated that though many people obsess over glamorous film, television, sport and music stars, the disparity in salaries in society seems to value [[professional athlete]]s and [[list of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry based professional]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=The good, bad and ugly of America's celeb obsession|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2003-12-19-celeb_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=May 5, 2012|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Obsession with Celebrities|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahradio/Americas-Obsession-with-Celebrities|work=June 4th 2007|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that singers, musicians, actors and athletes die younger on average than writers, composers, academics, politicians and businesspeople, with a greater incidence of cancer and especially lung cancer. However, it was remarked that the reasons for this remained unclear, with theories including [[innate]] tendencies towards risk-taking as well as the pressure or opportunities of particular types of fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22189177|title=Fame may 'lead to a shorter life'|date=April 18, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some have said fame might have negative [[psychological]] effects, and may lead to increasingly selfish tendencies and psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/health/psychology/22fame.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=March 2019}}{{better source|date=March 2019}} An academic study on the subject said that fame has an [[addiction|addictive]] quality to it.  When a celebrity's fame recedes over time, the celebrity may find it difficult to adjust psychologically.&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, Donna &amp; Giles, David. (2009). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233667622_Being_a_Celebrity_A_Phenomenology_of_Fame Being a Celebrity: A Phenomenology of Fame]. Journal of Phenomenological Psychology. 40. 178-210. 10.1163/004726609X12482630041889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, there has been more attention toward the impact celebrities have on health decisions of the population at large.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, C. Tan. 2015. “Biological, psychological and social processes that explain celebrities' influence on patients' health-related behaviors,” Archives of Public Health 73(3): 1-11. {{doi|10.1186/2049-3258-73-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the public will follow celebrities' health advice to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Hoffman, C. Tan. 2013. “Why Do So Many People Follow Celebrities’ Medical Advice? A Meta-Narrative Review,” British Medical Journal 347: f7151. {{doi|10.1136/bmj.f7151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This can have positive impacts when the celebrities give solid, evidence informed health advice, however it can also have detrimental affects if the health advice is not accurate enough.
