The '''Cthulhu Mythos''' is a [[shared universe|shared fictional universe]], originating in the works of American [[Horror fiction|horror writer]] [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. The term was coined by [[August Derleth]], a contemporary correspondent and [[protégé]] of Lovecraft, to identify the settings, tropes, and lore that were employed by Lovecraft and his literary successors. The name ''[[Cthulhu]]'' derives from the central creature in Lovecraft's seminal short story, &quot;[[The Call of Cthulhu]]&quot;, first published in the [[pulp magazine]] ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovecraft|first1=H.P.|title=Tales|date=2005|publisher=Library of America|location=New York|isbn=1931082723|edition=2nd|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56068806|accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard L. Tierney]], a writer who also wrote Mythos tales, later applied the term &quot;Derleth Mythos&quot; to distinguish Lovecraft's works from Derleth's later stories, which modify key tenets of the Mythos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Robert M.|title=Cthulhu Elsewhere in Lovecraft|journal=Crypt of Cthulhu|date=November 1982|issue=9|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1309608|accessdate=5 July 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweitzer|first1=Darrell|title=Discovering H.

==History==
In his essay &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, [[Robert M. Price]] described two stages in the development of the Cthulhu Mythos. Price called the first stage the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos proper.&quot; This stage was formulated during Lovecraft's lifetime and was subject to his guidance. The second stage was guided by August Derleth who, in addition to publishing Lovecraft's stories after his death, attempted to categorize and expand the Mythos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloch&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovecraft|first1=H. P.|last2=Bloch|first2=Robert|title=The Best of H. P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre|date=1987|publisher=Ballantine Pub. Group|location=New York|isbn=0345350804|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert M. Price|title=H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos|date=1990|publisher=Starmont House|location=Mercer Island, Washington|isbn=1557421528}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

===First stage===
An ongoing theme in Lovecraft's work is the complete irrelevance of mankind in the face of the cosmic horrors that apparently exist in the universe. Lovecraft made frequent references to the &quot;[[Great Old Ones]]&quot;, a loose pantheon of ancient, powerful [[deity|deities]] from space who once ruled the Earth and have since fallen into a deathlike sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harms&quot;/&gt;{{rp|viii}} While these monstrous deities have been present in almost all of Lovecraft's published work (his second short story &quot;[[Dagon (short story)|Dagon]]&quot;, published in 1919, is considered the start of the mythos), the first story to really expand the pantheon of Great Old Ones and its themes is &quot;[[The Call of Cthulhu]]&quot;, which was published in 1928.

Lovecraft broke with other pulp writers of the time by having his main characters' minds deteriorate when afforded a glimpse of what exists outside their perceived reality. He emphasized the point by stating in the opening sentence of the story that &quot;The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovecraft|first1=H. P.|title=The Call of Cuthulhu|date=2014|publisher=Start Publishing LLC|location=Lanham|isbn=1609772695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Dirk W. Mosig]] notes that Lovecraft was a &quot;mechanistic materialist&quot; who embraced the philosophy of ''[[Cosmicism#Cosmic indifferentism|cosmic indifference]]'' ([[Cosmicism]]). Lovecraft believed in a purposeless, mechanical, and uncaring universe. Human beings, with their limited faculties, can never fully understand this universe, and the [[cognitive dissonance]] caused by this revelation leads to insanity, in his view.&lt;ref&gt;Mosig, Yozan Dirk W. &quot;Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in imaginary Literature&quot; (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mariconda&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mariconda|first1=Steven J.|title=On the Emergence of &quot;Cthulhu&quot; &amp; Other Observations|date=1995|publisher=Necronomicon Press|location=West Warwick, Rhode Island|isbn=9780940884816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts at categorizing this fictional group of beings.  Phillip A. Schreffler argues that by carefully scrutinizing Lovecraft's writings, a workable framework emerges that outlines the entire &quot;pantheon&quot;{{mdash}}from the unreachable &quot;Outer Ones&quot; (e.g. [[Azathoth]], who occupies the centre of the universe) and &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; (e.g. Cthulhu, imprisoned on Earth in the sunken city of [[R'lyeh]]) to the lesser castes (the lowly slave [[shoggoth]]s and the [[Mi-go]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shreffler|first1=Philip A.|title=The H. P. Lovecraft Companion.|date=1977|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=9780837194820|pages=156–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David E. Schultz, however, believes that Lovecraft never meant to create a canonical Mythos but rather intended his imaginary pantheon to merely serve as a background element.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connors&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connors|first1=Scott|title=A Century Less a Dream: Selected Criticism on H. P. Lovecraft|date=2002|publisher=Wildside Press|location=Holikong, Pennsylvania|isbn=9781587152153|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46, 54}} Lovecraft himself humorously referred to his Mythos as &quot;Yog Sothothery&quot; (Dirk W. Mosig coincidentally suggested the term ''Yog-Sothoth Cycle of Myth'' be substituted for ''Cthulhu Mythos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosig|first1=Yōzan Dirk W.|title=Mosig at Last: A Psychologist looks at H. P. Lovecraft|date=1997|publisher=Necronomicon Press|location=West Warwick, Rhode Island|isbn=9780940884908|page=28|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timpratt.org/611.html|title=Yog-Sothothery|publisher=Timpratt.org|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, Lovecraft even had to remind his readers that his Mythos creations were entirely fictional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mariconda&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33–34}}

The view that there was no rigid structure is expounded upon by [[S. T. Joshi]], who said
{{quote|&quot;Lovecraft's imaginary [[wikt:cosmogony|cosmogony]] was never a static system but rather a sort of aesthetic construct that remained ever adaptable to its creator's developing personality and altering interests... There was never a rigid system that might be posthumously appropriated... The essence of the mythos lies not in a pantheon of imaginary deities nor in a cobwebby collection of forgotten tomes, but rather in a certain convincing cosmic attitude.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joshi|first1=S.T.|title=Miscellaneous Writings|date=1995|publisher=[[Arkham House|Arkham House Publishers]]|location=[[Sauk City, Wisconsin]]|isbn=9780870541681|pages=165–66|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Price, however, believed that Lovecraft's writings could at least be divided into categories and identified three distinct themes: the &quot;Dunsanian&quot; (written a similar style as [[Lord Dunsany]]), &quot;[[Arkham]]&quot; (occurring in Lovecraft's fictionalized [[New England]] setting), and &quot;Cthulhu&quot; (the cosmic tales) cycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} Writer Will Murray noted that while Lovecraft often used his fictional pantheon in the stories he ghostwrote for other authors, he reserved Arkham and its environs exclusively for those tales he wrote under his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Hise|first1=James|title=The Fantastic Worlds of H. P. Lovecraft|date=1999|publisher=James Van Hise|location=Yucca Valley, California|pages=105–07|edition=1st}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Mythos was not formalized or acknowledged between them, Lovecraft did correspond and share story elements with other contemporary writers including [[Clark Ashton Smith]], [[Robert E. Howard]], [[Robert Bloch]], [[Frank Belknap Long]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Henry S. Whitehead]], and [[Fritz Leiber]]{{mdash}}a group referred to as the &quot;Lovecraft Circle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joshi|first1=S. T.|authorlink=S.T. Joshi|title=H.P. Lovecraft: Four Decades of Criticism|date=1980|publisher=[[Ohio University Press]]|location=Athens, Ohio|isbn=9780821405772}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweitzer|first1=Darrell|title=Discovering Classic Fantasy Fiction: Essays on the Antecedents of Fantastic Literature|date=1996|publisher=Wildside Press|location=Gillette, New Jersey|isbn=9781587150043}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

For example, Robert E. Howard's character [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Von Junzt, Friedrich Wilheim|Friedrich Von Junzt]] reads Lovecraft's ''[[Necronomicon]]'' in the short story &quot;The Children of the Night&quot; ([[1931 in literature|1931]]), and in turn Lovecraft mentions Howard's ''[[Unaussprechlichen Kulten]]'' in the stories &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot; ([[1935 in literature|1935]]) and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; ([[1936 in literature|1936]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;/&gt;{{rp|6–7}} Many of Howard's original unedited ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]]'' stories also involve parts of the Cthulhu Mythos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=Robert E.|last2=Schultz|first2=Mark|title=The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian|date=2003|publisher=Del Rey/Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0345461517|page=436|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second stage===
Price denotes the second stage's commencement with August Derleth. The principal difference between Lovecraft and Derleth being Derleth's use of hope and development of the idea that the Cthulhu mythos essentially represented a struggle between good and evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloch&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} Derleth is credited with creating the &quot;Elder Gods.&quot; He stated:

{{bquote|As Lovecraft conceived the deities or forces of his mythos, there were, initially, the Elder Gods . . . These Elder Gods were benign deities, representing the forces of good, and existed peacefully . . . very rarely stirring forth to intervene in the unceasing struggle between the powers of evil and the [[race (fantasy)|races]] of Earth. These powers of evil were variously known as the Great Old Ones or the Ancient Ones...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Derleth|first1=August|title=The Cthulhu Mythos|date=1997|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=0760702535|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Price believes that the basis for Derleth's system is found in Lovecraft: &quot;Was Derleth's use of the rubric 'Elder Gods' so alien to Lovecraft's in ''At the Mountains of Madness''? Perhaps not. In fact, this very story, along with some hints from &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;, provides the key to the origin of the 'Derleth Mythos'. For in ''At the Mountains of Madness'' is shown the history of a conflict between interstellar races, first among them the Elder Ones and the Cthulhu-spawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crypt-of-cthulhu.com/lovecraftderleth.htm |title=Lovecraft-Derleth Connection |publisher=Crypt-of-cthulhu.com |accessdate=2012-11-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217054944/http://www.crypt-of-cthulhu.com/lovecraftderleth.htm |archivedate=2013-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Derleth himself believed that Lovecraft wished for other authors to actively write about the Mythos as opposed to it being a discrete plot device within Lovecraft's own stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connors&quot;/&gt;{{rp|46–7}} Derleth expanded the boundaries of the Mythos by including any passing reference to another author's story elements by Lovecraft as part of the genre. Just as Lovecraft made passing reference to Clark Ashton Smith's ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Book of Eibon|Book of Eibon]]'', Derleth in turn added Smith's [[Outer God#Ubbo-Sathla|Ubbo-Sathla]] to the Mythos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Derleth also attempted to connect the deities of the Mythos to the [[Classical element|four elements]] (&quot;air&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, and &quot;water&quot;), creating new beings representative of certain elements in order to legitimize his system of classification. Derleth created &quot;Cthugha&quot; as a sort of fire elemental when a fan, Francis Towner Laney, complained that he had neglected to include the element in his schema. Laney, the editor of ''[[The Acolyte]]'', had categorized the Mythos in an essay that first appeared in the Winter 1942 issue of the magazine.

Impressed by the glossary, Derleth asked Laney to rewrite it for publication in the Arkham House collection ''Beyond the Wall of Sleep'' ([[1943 in literature|1943]]).&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price, &quot;Editorial Shards&quot;, ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'', p. 2.)&lt;/ref&gt; Laney's essay (&quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;) was later republished in ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'' (1985). In applying the elemental theory to beings that function on a cosmic scale (e.g. [[Yog-Sothoth]]) some authors created a fifth element that they termed ''aethyr''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
