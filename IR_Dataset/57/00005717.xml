The '''Canary Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛər|i}}; {{lang-es|Islas Canarias}}, {{IPA-es|ˈizlas kaˈnaɾjas|pron}}) are a Spanish [[archipelago]] and the southernmost [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Spain]] located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in a region known as [[Macaronesia]], {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} west of [[Morocco]] at the closest point. The Canary Islands, which are also known informally as ''the Canaries'', are among the [[Special Member State territories and the European Union#Outermost regions|outermost regions (OMR)]] of the [[European Union]] proper. It is also one of eight regions with special consideration of [[nationalities and regions of Spain|historical nationality]] as recognized by the [[Spanish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobcan.es/reformaestatuto/index.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515081511/http://www.gobcan.es/reformaestatuto/index.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 May 2006|title=GOBIERNO DE CANARIAS :: Reforma del Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias|date=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coloquioscanariasamerica.casadecolon.com/index.php/CHCA/article/viewFile/7612/6583|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707222523/http://coloquioscanariasamerica.casadecolon.com/index.php/CHCA/article/viewFile/7612/6583|url-status=dead|title=Canarias en la España contemporánea: La formación de una nacionalidad histórica|archivedate=7 July 2016|accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canary Islands belong to the [[African Plate]] like the Spanish cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], the two on the African mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamaimos.com/2009/10/14/canarias-esta-en-africa/|title=Canarias está en África|last=Tamaimos|website=tamaimos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight main islands are (from largest to smallest in area) [[Tenerife]], [[Fuerteventura]], [[Gran Canaria]], [[Lanzarote]], [[La Palma]], [[La Gomera]], [[El Hierro]] and [[La Graciosa]]. The archipelago includes many smaller islands and islets: [[Alegranza]], [[Islote de Lobos|Isla de Lobos]], [[Montaña Clara]], [[Roque del Oeste]] and [[Roque del Este]]. It also includes a series of adjacent roques (those of Salmor, Fasnia, Bonanza, [[Roque de Garachico|Garachico]] and [[Roques de Anaga|Anaga]]). In ancient times, the island chain was often referred to as &quot;the Fortunate Isles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benjamin|first1=Thomas|title=The Atlantic World: Europeans, Africans, Indians and Their Shared HIstory, 1400–1900|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521850995|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canary Islands are the most southerly region of [[Spain]] and the largest and most populated archipelago of Macaronesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;catalogo.museosdetenerife.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://catalogo.museosdetenerife.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/MACAMONO/id/16/rec/1 |title=La Macaronesia.

As of 2019, the Canary Islands have a population of 2,153,389 inhabitants&lt;ref name=&quot;BOE_pop_2019&quot;/&gt; and a density of 287.39 inhabitants/km², being the eighth most populous autonomous community. The population of the archipelago is mostly concentrated in the two capital islands, around 43% on the island of [[Tenerife]] and 40% on the island of [[Gran Canaria]].

The archipelago's beaches, climate and important natural attractions, especially [[Maspalomas]] in [[Gran Canaria]] and [[Teide National Park]] and Mount [[Teide]] (a World Heritage Site) in [[Tenerife]] (the third tallest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor), make it a major tourist destination with over 12&amp;nbsp;million visitors per year, especially Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobiernodecanarias1&quot;&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/turismo/area_11a_frame.html Página web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829205532/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/turismo/area_11a_frame.html |date=29 August 2010 }} del ISTAC sobre entrada de turistas en Canarias.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webtenerife1&quot;&gt;[none#'Menú Principal'!A1 Estadísticas de Turismo de Tenerife] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands have a [[subtropical climate]], with long hot summers and moderately warm winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/51/climate/Europe/Canary-Islands.html |title=Canary Islands Weather and Climate |website=Worldtravelguide.net |date= |accessdate=21 January 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531201416/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/51/climate/Europe/Canary-Islands.html |archivedate=31 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precipitation levels and the level of maritime moderation vary depending on location and elevation. Green areas as well as desert exist on the archipelago. Due to their location above the [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] layer, the high mountains of these islands are ideal for astronomical observation. For this reason, two professional observatories, [[Teide Observatory]] on the island of Tenerife and [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory]] on the island of La Palma, have been built on the islands.

In 1927, the [[Province of Canary Islands]] was split into two provinces. The autonomous community of the Canary Islands was established in 1982. Its capital is shared by the cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;es.wikisource.org&quot;&gt;[http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Real_Decreto_de_30_de_noviembre_de_1833 ''Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833''] en wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gobiernodecanarias.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/docs/1833-12-03%20Decreto%20de%20division%20provincial.pdf ''Real Decreto de 30 de noviembre de 1833''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722105020/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/docs/1833-12-03%20Decreto%20de%20division%20provincial.pdf |date=22 July 2012 }} en el sitio web oficial del Gobierno de Canarias&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn are the capitals of the [[Spanish provinces|provinces]] of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Province of Las Palmas|Las Palmas]].

During the time of the [[Spanish Empire]], the Canaries were the main stopover for [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish galleons]] on their way to the [[Americas]], which came south to catch the prevailing north-easterly [[trade winds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Florida Department of State |url=http://info.flheritage.com/galleon-trail/platefleets.cfm |title=1733 Spanish Galleon Trail, Plate Fleets |website=flheritage.com |date= |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Calspace, University of California, San Diego |url=http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/08_1.shtml |title=Trade Winds and the Hadley Cell |website=earthguide.ucsd.edu |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Islas Canarias'' is likely derived from the Latin name ''Canariae Insulae'', meaning &quot;Islands of the Dogs&quot;, a name that was applied only to Gran Canaria.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} According to the historian [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[Mauretania]]n king [[Juba II]] named the island ''Canaria'' because it contained &quot;vast multitudes of dogs of very large size&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', [http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&amp;getid=1&amp;query=Plin.%20Nat.%206.37 Book 6, Chap. 37. (32.)] —The Fortunate Islands&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, it is said that the original inhabitants of the island, [[Guanches]], used to worship dogs, mummified them and generally treated them as holy animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;10 facts&quot;&gt;[http://www.touropia.com/facts-about-the-canary-islands/ 10 Facts about the Canary Islands] – Touropia.com – Retrieved 22 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better citation needed|date=January 2020}} Some hypothesize that the Canary Islands' dog-worship and the ancient Egyptian cult of the dog-headed god [[Anubis]] are closely connected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Joseph|title=The Atlantis Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvgPxA62KkC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2005|publisher=New Page Books|isbn=978-1-56414-795-0|page=131|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623191418/https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvgPxA62KkC|archive-date=23 June 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no explanation given as to which one was first.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Other theories speculate that the name comes from the [[Nukkari]] Berber tribe living in the Moroccan Atlas, named in Roman sources as ''Canarii'', though Pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''The Natural History'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D1 Book 5, Chap. 1.] —The Two Mauritanias.&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands' coat-of-arms.

It is considered that the aborigines of Gran Canaria called themselves &quot;Canarios&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COOK|first=ALICE CARTER|date=1900-07-09|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=2|issue=3|pages=451–493|doi=10.1525/aa.1900.2.3.02a00040|issn=0002-7294|title=The Aborigines of the Canary Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that after being conquered, this name was used in plural in Spanish, i.e., as to refer to all of the islands as the Canarii-as.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

What is certain is that the name of the islands does not derive from the [[Atlantic Canary|canary bird]]; rather, the birds are named after the islands.

== Physical geography ==

[[Tenerife]] is the largest and most populous island of the archipelago. [[Gran Canaria]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after [[Majorca]] and Tenerife. The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.

The islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. The Canary Islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region.&lt;ref name=&quot;catalogo.museosdetenerife.org&quot;/&gt; The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html (Universidad de Las Palmas,) José Mangas Viñuela, &quot;The Canary Islands Hot Spot&quot;] This is the source for the geological history that follows.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east [[trade winds]], the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.

As a consequence, the individual islands in the Canary archipelago tend to have distinct [[microclimate]]s. Those islands such as [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist [[Canary Current]]. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]], the islands which are closest to the African mainland, are effectively desert or semi desert. [[Gran Canaria]] is known as a &quot;continent in miniature&quot; for its diverse landscapes like [[Maspalomas]] and [[Roque Nublo]]. In terms of its climate [[Tenerife]] is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]] is arid. The island rises to almost {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]], ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' are endemic, as noted by [[Sabin Berthelot]] and [[Philip Barker Webb]] in their epic work, ''L'Histoire Naturelle des Îles Canaries'' (1835–50).

=== Climate ===
The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and [[desert climate|desertic]], moderated by the sea and in summer by the [[trade winds]]. There are a number of [[microclimate]]s and the classifications range mainly from [[Hot semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[Desert climate|desert]]. According to the [[Köppen climate classification]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824032611/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/World_Koppen_Map.png |date=24 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of the Canary Islands have a [[desert climate|hot desert climate]] represented as [[Köppen climate classification|BWh]]. There also exists a subtropical humid climate which is very influenced by the ocean in the middle of the islands of [[La Gomera]], [[Tenerife]] and [[La Palma]]; where the [[laurisilva]] forests grow.

=== Geology ===
{{Main|Geology of the Canary Islands}}
The seven major islands, one minor island, and several small islets were originally volcanic islands, formed by the [[Canary hotspot]]. The Canary Islands is the only place in Spain where [[volcanic eruption]]s have been recorded during the [[Modern Era]], with some volcanoes still active (El Hierro, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fomento.es/MFOM/LANG_CASTELLANO/DIRECCIONES_GENERALES/INSTITUTO_GEOGRAFICO/Geofisica/volcanologia/C20_ERUPCIONES_HISTORICAS.htm |title=Instituto Geográfico Nacional |website=Fomento.es |date=10 November 1949 |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401163421/http://www.fomento.es/MFOM/LANG_CASTELLANO/DIRECCIONES_GENERALES/INSTITUTO_GEOGRAFICO/Geofisica/volcanologia/C20_ERUPCIONES_HISTORICAS.htm |archivedate=1 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Volcanic islands such as those in the Canary chain often have steep ocean cliffs caused by catastrophic debris avalanches and [[landslide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pararas-Carayannis, G. (2002). &quot;Evaluation of the Threat of Mega Tsunami Generation from Postulated Massive Slope Failure of Island Stratovolcanoes on La Palma, Canary Islands, and on The Island of Hawaii, George&quot;. Science of Tsunami Hazards 20 (5): 251–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Teide]] [[volcano]] on Tenerife is the highest mountain in Spain, and the third tallest volcano on Earth on a volcanic ocean island. All the islands except La Gomera have been active in the last million years; four of them (Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma and El Hierro) have historical records of eruptions since European discovery. The islands rise from Jurassic [[oceanic crust]] associated with the opening of the Atlantic. Underwater [[magmatism]] commenced during the Cretaceous, and reached the ocean's surface during the [[Miocene]]. The islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the [[Atlas Mountains]] province, which in turn is part of the larger African Alpine System division.

In the summer of 2011 a series of low-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath El Hierro. These had a linear trend of northeast-southwest. In October a submarine eruption occurred about {{convert|2|km|mi|frac=4|abbr=on}} south of Restinga. This eruption produced gases and pumice, but no explosive activity was reported.

The following table shows the highest mountains in each of the islands:

[[Teide National Park]] is the oldest and largest national park in the Canary Islands and one of the oldest in Spain. Located in the geographic centre of the island of Tenerife, it is the most visited national park in Spain. In 2010, it became the most visited national park in Europe and second worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;diariodeavisos.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sanborondon.info&quot;/&gt; The park's highlight is the [[Teide]] volcano; standing at an altitude of {{convert|3718|m}}, it is the highest elevation of the country and the third largest volcano on Earth from its base. In 2007, the Teide National Park was declared one of the [[12 Treasures of Spain]].

===Governance===
The regional executive body, the {{ill|Government of the Canary Islands|es|Gobierno de Canarias}}, is presided over by [[Ángel Víctor Torres]] ([[PSOE]]), the current [[President of the Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laprovincia.es/multimedia/fotos/canarias/2019-07-12-163994-investidura-angel-victor-torres-como-presidente-canarias.html|title=Investidura de Ángel Víctor Torres como presidente de Canarias|last=laprovincia.es|website=www.laprovincia.es|language=es|access-date=2019-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is invested by the members of the regional legislature, the [[Parliament of the Canary Islands]], that consists of 70 elected legislators. The [[2019 Canarian regional election|last regional election]] took place in May 2019.

The islands have 14 seats in the [[Senate of Spain|Spanish Senate]]. Of these, 11 seats are directly elected (3 for Gran Canaria, 3 for Tenerife, and 1 each for Lanzarote (including La Graciosa), Fuerteventura, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro) while the other 3 are appointed by the regional legislature.&lt;ref name=compsenado&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senado.es/web/composicionorganizacion/senadores/composicionsenado/senadoresenactivo/consultaprocedenciageografica/detallecomunidad/index.html?lang=en&amp;id1=12 |title=Senators by geographical origin, Comunidad Autónoma de Canarias |website=[[Senate of Spain]] |access-date=2020-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political geography ===
The '''Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands''' consists of two [[provinces of Spain|provinces]] (''provincias''), [[Province of Las Palmas|Las Palmas]] and [[Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], whose capitals ([[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]) are capitals of the autonomous community. Each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named ''Cabildo Insular''. Each island is subdivided into smaller [[Municipalities of Spain|municipalities]] (''municipios''); [[List of municipalities in Las Palmas|Las Palmas is divided into 34 municipalities]], and [[List of municipalities in Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz de Tenerife is divided into 54 municipalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herms |first1=Franziska |title=Alternative Tourism on Gran Canaria: The diversification of tourism products as an alternative to mass tourism |date=2006 |publisher=diplom.de |isbn=9783832492816 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WZZvAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=province%20of%20las%20palmas%20canary%20islands&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=province%20of%20las%20palmas%20canary%20islands&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 February 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international boundary of the Canaries is the subject of dispute between Spain and Morocco. Morocco's official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise Spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the Canaries, since the Canary Islands enjoy a large degree of autonomy. In fact, the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the Spanish regions is considered an [[autonomous community]] with equal status to the European ones. {{citation needed span|text=Under the [[Law of the Sea]], the only islands not granted territorial waters or an [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own, which is not the case of the Canary Islands.|date=October 2013}}

The boundary determines the ownership of seabed oil deposits and other ocean resources. Morocco and Spain have been unable to agree on a compromise regarding the territorial boundary, since neither nation wants to cede its claimed right to the vast resources whose ownership depends upon the boundary. In 2002, for example, Morocco rejected a unilateral Spanish proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html|title=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canarian nationalism===
{{main|Canarian nationalism}}
There are some pro-independence political parties, like the [[National Congress of the Canaries]] (CNC) and the [[Popular Front of the Canary Islands]], but these parties are non-violent, and their popular support is almost insignificant, with no presence in either the autonomous parliament or the ''cabildos insulares''.

According to a 2012 study by the [[Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas]], when asked about national identity, the majority of respondents from the Canary Islands (49.3%) consider themselves Spanish and Canarian in equal measures, followed by 37.1% who consider themselves more Canarian than Spanish. Only 6.1% of the respondents consider themselves only Canarian.

Before the arrival of humans, the Canaries were inhabited by prehistoric animals; for example, the giant lizard (''[[Gallotia goliath]]''), the [[Tenerife giant rat|Tenerife]] and [[Gran Canaria giant rat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cmayot/medioambiente/lagartodelagomera/gatos.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228151643/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cmayot/medioambiente/lagartodelagomera/gatos.html|url-status=dead|title=Según la Página Web del Gobierno de Canarias|archivedate=28 December 2009|accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and giant prehistoric tortoises, ''[[Geochelone burchardi]]'' and ''[[Geochelone vulcanica]]''.

The islands may have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, the [[Greeks]], and the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]]. King [[Juba II]], Caesar [[Augustus]]'s [[Numidia]]n protégé, is credited with discovering the islands for the Western world.

[[File:Pueblochico guanches A.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[Guanches|Guanche]] settlement of Tenerife]]
When the Europeans began to explore the islands in the late Middle Ages, they encountered several [[indigenous peoples]] living at a [[Neolithic]] level of technology. Although the prehistory of the settlement of the Canary Islands is still unclear, linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the [[Berbers]] on the nearby North African coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary |title=Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603042341/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary |archive-date=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precolonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the [[Guanches]], although ''Guanches'' had been the name for only the indigenous inhabitants of Tenerife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benjamin |first1=Thomas |date=2009 |title=The Atlantic World: Europeans, Africans, Indians and their shared history, 1400–1900 |page=73 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th&amp;nbsp;century onward, numerous visits were made by sailors from [[Majorca]], [[Portugal]] and [[Genoa]]. [[Lancelotto Malocello]] settled on Lanzarote in 1312. The Majorcans established a [[missionary|mission]] with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 1350 to 1400.

=== Castilian conquest ===
{{Main|Conquest of the Canary Islands|Kingdom of the Canary Islands|Crown of Castile|Kingdom of Portugal}}
In 1402, the Castilian conquest of the islands began, with the expedition of the French explorers [[Jean de Béthencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]], nobles and [[vassal]]s of [[Henry III of Castile]], to Lanzarote. From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. Béthencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord.  It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the Crown against the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;John Mercer, ''The Canary Islanders: their prehistory, conquest, and survival''  (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] presenting the captured native Guanche kings of [[Tenerife]] to the [[Catholic Monarchs]]]]
Historians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the Canary Islands:

Aristocratic conquest (''Conquista señorial''). This refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the Crown of Castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the Crown. One can identify within this period an early phase known as the Betancurian or Norman Conquest, carried out by [[Jean de Bethencourt]] (who was originally from Normandy) and [[Gadifer de la Salle]] between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of [[Lanzarote]], [[El Hierro]] and [[Fuerteventura]]. The subsequent phase is known as the Castilian Conquest, carried out by Castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of [[La Gomera]] around 1450.

Royal conquest (''Conquista realenga''). This defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the Crown of Castile, during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered: [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. This phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of Tenerife, bringing the entire Canarian Archipelago under the control of the Crown of Castile.

[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|Casa de Colón (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), which Christopher Columbus visited during his first trip.]]
Béthencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448 Maciot de Béthencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the Castilians. Despite [[Pope Nicholas V#cite ref-8|Pope Nicholas V]] ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]], which settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic. This treaty recognized Castilian control of the Canary Islands but also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde islands]], and gave the Portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the Atlantic that might be discovered.

The Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].

=== After the conquest ===
[[File:Canary Islands map by William Dampier 1699 - Project Gutenberg eText 15675.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maps of the Canary Islands drawn by [[William Dampier]] during his voyage to [[Dutch West India Company|New Holland]] in 1699.]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of the Realm of Canary Islands.svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the Castilian and Spanish Realm of Canary Islands]]
After the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugarcane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. In this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. Gran Canaria, a colony of the [[Crown of Castile]] since 6 March 1480 (from 1556, of Spain), and Tenerife, a Spanish colony since 1495, each had its own governor. There has been speculation that the abundance of [[roccella tinctoria]] on the Canary Islands offered a profit motive for [[Jean de Béthencourt]] during his conquest of the islands. Lichen has been used for centuries to make dyes. This includes royal purple colors derived from roccella tinctoria, also known as orseille.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2006/12/12/dyeing-with-lichens-mushrooms/|work=blog.mycology.cornell.edu|author=Randi W.|title=Dyeing with Lichens &amp; Mushrooms|date=December 12, 2006|accessdate=August 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] became a stopping point for the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, traders, and missionaries on their way to the [[New World]]. This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century. Civilian architecture survives in forms such as [[Casas de los Sánchez-Ochando]] or [[Casa Quintana]].

The Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.

The most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Pieter van der Does]], attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.

The Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Brígida. 300 Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged [[Maspalomas]], on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, [[San Sebastián de La Gomera|San Sebastián]] on La Gomera, and [[Santa Cruz de La Palma|Santa Cruz]] on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew.

In 1618 the [[Barbary pirates]] attacked Lanzarote and La Gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mercer (archaeologist)|John Mercer]] (1980), ''The Canary Islanders : their prehistory, conquest, and survival'', p. 236, Collings.&lt;/ref&gt; Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] was attacked by a British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.

=== 18th to 19th century ===
[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|[[Amaro Pargo]] (1678–1741), [[Piracy|corsair]] and [[merchant]] from Tenerife who participated in the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] (the Spanish-American trade route).]]
The sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's [[Caribbean]] colonies. Low   sugar prices in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, [[cochineal]] (''cochinilla''), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum were sold in American ports such as [[Veracruz]], [[Campeche]], [[La Guaira]] and [[Havana]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte|title=El comercio canario-americano en el siglo XVIII (I parte)|website=Canariascnnews.com|access-date=8 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707091632/http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 18th century, Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as [[Havana]], [[Veracruz]], and [[Santo Domingo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm |title= The Spanish of the Canary Islands |website=Personal.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Antonio, Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/poc01 |title= Handbook of Texas Online – Canary Islanders |website=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losislenos.org/ |title=Los Isleños Heritage &amp; Cultural Society website |website=Losislenos.org |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507222938/http://www.losislenos.org/ |archive-date=7 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |title=Isleños Society of St. Bernard Parish |website=Americaslibrary.gov |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007110753/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |archivedate=7 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration during the 19th and first half of the 20th century, primarily to the Americas. Between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 Canary Islanders emigrated to [[Venezuela]]. Also, thousands of Canarians moved to [[Puerto Rico]] where the Spanish monarchy felt that Canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of Spain. Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico. Similarly, many thousands of Canarians emigrated to the shores of [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm|title=THE SPANISH OF THE CANARY ISLANDS|website=www.personal.psu.edu|accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, the Spanish fortified the islands against a possible American attack, but no such event took place.

=== Romantic period and scientific expeditions ===
[[File:Coast El Golfo.JPG|thumb|Coast El Golfo, El Hierro]]
Sirera and Renn (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/10b.monte_en.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060131191143/http://humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/10b.monte_en.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 January 2006 |title=Montesinos Sirera, Jose Luis and Jurgen Renn (2004) ''Expeditions to the Canary Islands in the romantic period (1770–1830)'' |website=Humboldt.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish two different types of expeditions, or voyages, during the period 1770–1830, which they term &quot;the Romantic period&quot;:

First are &quot;expeditions financed by the States, closely related with the official scientific Institutions. characterised by having strict scientific objectives (and inspired by) the spirit of Illustration and progress&quot;. In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:
* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.
* [[Louis Feuillée]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.
* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide
* the [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]]-Ledru expedition (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects.

The second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:
* [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1799)
* [[Christian Leopold von Buch|Buch]] and [[Christen Smith (botanist)|Smith]] (1815)
* [[Broussonet]]
* [[Philip Barker Webb|Webb]]
* [[Sabin Berthelot]].

Sirera and Renn identify the period 1770–1830 as one in which &quot;In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase&quot;.

=== Early 20th century ===
[[File:Bahia luz las palmas 1912 jordao da luz perestello.jpg|thumb|The [[port of Las Palmas]] in 1912.]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new [[cash-crop]], the [[banana]], the export of which was controlled by companies such as [[Fyffes]].

The rivalry between the elites of the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the [[archipelago]] into two provinces in 1927. This has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities, which continues to this day.

During the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and [[Guillermo Ascanio]]. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organisations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

=== Franco regime ===
{{Main|Francoist Spain}}
In 1936, [[Francisco Franco]] was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of [[Vallehermoso, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Vallehermoso]], on La Gomera. Though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the Canaries was most severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=León Álvarez|first1=Aarón|title=La represión franquista en Canarias: una guerra de 40 años |language=es |url=http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/sociedad/represion-franquista-Canarias-guerra-anos_0_379012266.html |website=canariasahora |via=eldiario.es |accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a [[naval base]], in the event of [[Gibraltar]] being invaded from the Spanish mainland.

Opposition to Franco's regime did not begin to organise until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.

After the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in [[Algeria]], the [[Canary Islands Independence Movement|Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago]] (MAIAC). In 1968, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] recognized the MAIAC as a legitimate [[African independence movements|African independence movement]], and declared the Canary Islands as an African territory still under foreign rule.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Minahan (2002), ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World'', p. 377, Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]] in Spain, [[self-governance|autonomy]] was granted to the Canaries via a law passed in 1982, with a newly established autonomous devolved government and parliament. In 1983, the first autonomous elections were held. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) won. In the 2007 elections, the PSOE gained a plurality of seats, but the nationalist [[Canarian Coalition]] and the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) formed a ruling coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parcan.es/|title=Parlamento de Canarias - Parlamento de Canarias|website=www.parcan.es|accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capitality ===
At present, the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain that has two capitals: [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], since the {{ill|Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands|es|Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias}} was created in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;es.wikisource.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gobiernodecanarias.org&quot;/&gt;

The political capital of the archipelago did not exist as such until the nineteenth century. The first cities founded by the [[Europeans]] at the time of the conquest of the Canary Islands in the 15th century were: [[Telde]] (in [[Gran Canaria]]), [[San Marcial del Rubicón]] (in [[Lanzarote]]) and [[Betancuria]] (in [[Fuerteventura]]). These cities boasted the first European institutions present in the archipelago, including [[Catholic]] [[bishoprics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/san_marcial.pdf |title=San Marcial de Rubicón y los obispados de Canarias |accessdate=24 May 2016 |author=Julio Sánchez Rodríguez |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, because the period of splendor of these cities developed before the total conquest of the archipelago and its incorporation into the [[Crown of Castile]] never had a political and real control of the entire Canary archipelago.

[[File:Las Palmas panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Overview of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.]]
[[File:Vista de Santa Cruz de Tenerife.png|thumb|upright=1.25|View of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.]]
The function of a Canarian city with full jurisdiction for the entire archipelago only exists after the conquest of the Canary Islands, although originally ''[[De facto]]'', that is, without legal and real meaning and linked to the headquarters of the [[Canary Islands General Captaincy]].

Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was the first city that exercised this function. This is because the residence of the Captain General of the Canary Islands was in this city during part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;junta&quot;&gt;La Junta Suprema de Canarias.

Real Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País de Tenerife, Editorial: Editorial Interinsular Canaria SA, publicado en Santa Cruz de Tenerife en 1980 (reedición de 1948) Páginas 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1661, the Captain General of the Canary Islands, [[Jerónimo de Benavente y Quiñones]], moved the headquarters of the captaincy to the city of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] on the island of [[Tenerife]].&lt;ref name=&quot;portalcultura.mde_1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portalcultura.mde.es/cultural/archivos/canarias/archivo_156.html |title=Archivo Intermedio Militar de Canarias.

Already in 1723, the Captain General of the Canary Islands [[Lorenzo Fernandez de Villavicencio]] had moved the headquarters of the General Captaincy of the Canary Islands from San Cristóbal de La Laguna to Santa Cruz de Tenerife. This decision continued without pleasing the society of the island of Gran Canaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gevic.net/info/contenidos/mostrar_contenidos.php?idcat=1&amp;idcap=197&amp;idcon=717|title=Su Origen |work=Gran Enciclopedia Virtual Islas Canarias |language=es |via=www.gevic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be after the creation of the [[Province of Canary Islands]] in November 1833 in which Santa Cruz would become the first fully official capital of the Canary Islands (''[[De jure]]'' and not of ''De facto'' as happened previously).&lt;ref name=&quot;Real Decreto wikisource&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Real Decreto Canarias&quot;/&gt; Santa Cruz de Tenerife would be the capital of the Canary archipelago until during the Government of General [[Primo de Rivera]] in 1927 the Province of Canary Islands was split in two provinces: [[Province of Las Palmas|Las Palmas]] with capital in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, and [[Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] with capital in the homonymous city.

Finally, with the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands in 1982 and the creation of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands, the capital of the archipelago between Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife is fixed, which is how it remains today.

{{Main|Religion in Canary Islands}}
[[File:Candelaria Basilica.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of Candelaria|Basilica of the Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patroness of the Canary Islands) in [[Candelaria, Tenerife|Candelaria]], Tenerife]]
The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] branch of [[Christianity]] has been the majority religion in the archipelago for more than five centuries, ever since the [[Conquest of the Canary Islands]]. There are also several other religious communities.

==== Roman Catholic Church ====
The overwhelming majority of native Canarians are [[Roman Catholic]] (85%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vangdata/20150402/54429637154/interactivo-creencias-y-practicas-religiosas-en-espana.html|title=Interactivo: Creencias y prácticas religiosas en España|website=Lavanguardia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with various smaller foreign-born populations of other Christian beliefs such as [[Protestants]] from northern Europe.

The appearance of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] (Patron of Canary Islands) was credited with moving the Canary Islands toward Christianity. Two Catholic saints were born in the Canary Islands: [[Peter of Saint Joseph de Betancur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.catholic.net/op/articulos/35981/pedro-de-san-jos-betancurt-santo.html|title=Pedro de San José Betancurt, Santo|website=Es.catholic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[José de Anchieta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://es.catholic.net/op/articulos/35379/jos-de-anchieta-santo.html|title=José de Anchieta, Santo|website=Es.catholic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both born on the island of Tenerife, they were respectively missionaries in [[Guatemala]] and [[Brazil]].

The Canary Islands are divided into two Catholic dioceses, each governed by a bishop:
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias|Diócesis Canariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Province of Las Palmas|Eastern Province]]: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Its capital was San Marcial El Rubicón (1404) and [[Las Palmas|Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] (1483–present). There was a previous bishopric which was based in [[Telde]], but it was later abolished.
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna|Diócesis Nivariense]]: Includes the islands of the [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province)|western province]]: Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro. Its capital is [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (1819–present).

==== Other religions ====
Separate from the overwhelming Christian majority are a minority of [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laopinion.es/sociedad/2008/10/03/sociedad-canarios-profesa-religion-minoritaria/173826.html|title=Un 5% de canarios profesa una religión minoritaria|first=La Opinión de|last=Tenerife|website=Laopinion.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the followers of [[Islam]], the [[Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands]] exists to represent the Islamic community in the Canary Islands as well as to provide practical support to members of the Islamic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laopinion.es/tenerife/2015/04/16/musulmanes-isla-constituyen-primera-federacion/601084.html|title=Los musulmanes de la Isla constituyen la primera Federación Islámica de Canarias|first=La Opinión de|last=Tenerife|website=Laopinion.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other religious faiths represented include [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] as well as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt; Minority religions are also present such as the [[Church of the Guanche People]] which is classified as a [[Modern Paganism|neo-pagan]] native religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt; Also present are [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt; [[Judaism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt; [[Baha'i]],&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt; [[African religion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt; and [[Chinese religions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;laopinion.es&quot;/&gt;

Two of the islands' principal cities are located on it: The capital, [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] (a World Heritage Site). San Cristóbal de La Laguna, the second city of the island is home to the oldest university in the Canary Islands, the [[University of La Laguna]]. The [[Teide]], with its {{convert|3718|m|abbr=off}} is the highest peak of Spain and also a World Heritage Site. Tenerife is the site of the [[Tenerife airport disaster|worst air disaster]] in the history of aviation, in which 583 people were killed in the collision of two Boeing 747s on 27 March 1977.

=== La Graciosa ===
{{main|La Graciosa}}
Graciosa Island or commonly La Graciosa is a volcanic island in the Canary Islands of Spain, located 2 km (1.2 mi) north of the island of Lanzarote across the Strait of El Río. It was formed by the Canary hotspot. The island is part of the Chinijo Archipelago and the Chinijo Archipelago Natural Park (Parque Natural del Archipiélago Chinijo). It is administrated by the municipality of Teguise. In 2018 La Graciosa officially became the eighth Canary Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monzón2019&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author1=Agustín Monzón |title=La Graciosa se convierte en la octava isla de Canarias |url=https://www.elindependiente.com/politica/2018/06/26/graciosa-convierte-octava-isla-canarias/ |accessdate=3 December 2019 |work=El Independiente |publisher=El Independiente |date=26 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416090007/https://www.elindependiente.com/politica/2018/06/26/graciosa-convierte-octava-isla-canarias/ |archivedate=16 April 2019 |language=es |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/lanzarote/articles/la-graciosa-why-visit-facts/|title=Nine fascinating facts about the newest Canary Island|last=Hugh Morris|first=Travel news editor|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180626/45418824885/el-senado-reconoce-a-la-graciosa-como-la-octava-isla-canaria-habitada.html|title=El Senado reconoce a La Graciosa como la octava isla canaria habitada|date=2018-06-26|website=La Vanguardia|language=es|access-date=2019-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest and least populated of the main islands, with a population of about 700 people.

[[File:Dunas de Maspalomas.jpg|left|thumb|The dunes of [[Maspalomas]] in [[Gran Canaria]] is one of the tourist attractions]]

The economy is based primarily on [[Tourism in Spain|tourism]], which makes up 32% of the GDP. The Canaries receive about 12&amp;nbsp;million tourists per year. Construction makes up nearly 20% of the GDP and tropical agriculture, primarily bananas and tobacco, are grown for export to Europe and the Americas. Ecologists are concerned that the resources, especially in the more [[arid]] islands, are being [[overexploited]] but there are still many agricultural resources like [[tomato]]es, [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[cochineal]], [[sugarcane]], [[grape]]s, [[vine]]s, [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[lemon]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s, [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[maize]], [[apricot]]s, [[peach]]es and [[almond]]s.

Water resources are also being overexploited, due to the high water usage by tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255948730_INTRODUCTION_TO_WATER_PROBLEMS_IN_CANARY_ISLANDS|title=INTRODUCTION TO WATER PROBLEMS IN CANARY ISLANDS|first1=Juan|last1=Santamarta|first2=Jesica|last2=Rodríguez-Martín|date=1 January 2013|pages=169–179|accessdate=31 January 2020|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some islands (such as Gran Canaria and Tenerife) [[Groundwater extraction|overexploit the ground water]]. This is done in such degree that, according to European and Spanish legal regulations, the current situation is not acceptable. To address the problems, good governance and a change in the water use paradigm have been proposed. These solutions depend largely on [[Water_conservation|controlling water use]] and on demand management. As this is administratively difficult and politically unpalatable, most action is currently directed at increasing the public offer of water through import from outside; a decision which is economically, politically and environmentally questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40899-017-0099-2|title=Groundwater mining: benefits, problems and consequences in Spain|first1=Emilio|last1=Custodio|first2=José|last2=Albiac|first3=Manuel|last3=Cermerón|first4=Marta|last4=Hernández|first5=M.

To bring in revenue for environmental protection, innovation, training and water sanitation a [[tourist tax]] was considered in 2018, along with a doubling of the [[ecotax]] and restrictions on holiday rents in the zones with the greatest pressure of demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/canary-islands/news/canary-islands-tourism-tax/|title=The Canary Islands could become the next holiday hotspot to introduce a tourist tax|first=Travel writer|last=Soo Kim|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy is [[Euro|€]] 25&amp;nbsp;billion (2001 GDP figures). The islands experienced continuous growth during a 20-year period, up until 2001, at a rate of approximately 5% annually. This growth was fueled mainly by huge amounts of [[foreign direct investment]], mostly to develop tourism real estate (hotels and apartments), and European Funds (near €11&amp;nbsp;billion in the period from 2000 to 2007), since the Canary Islands are labelled Region Objective 1 (eligible for euro structural funds).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Additionally, the EU allows the Canary Islands Government to offer special tax concessions for investors who incorporate under the Zona Especial Canaria (ZEC) regime and create more than five jobs.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Spain gave permission in August 2014 for [[Repsol]] and its partners to explore [[oil]] and [[gas]] prospects off the Canary Islands, involving an investment of €7.5&amp;nbsp;billion over four years, to commence at the end of 2016. Repsol at the time said the area could ultimately produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, which would meet 10 percent of Spain's energy needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;RepsolCanary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain's Repsol gets long awaited green signal to explore off Canary Islands|url=http://www.spainnews.net/index.php/sid/224721995|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014|website=Spain News.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the analysis of samples obtained did not show the necessary volume nor quality to consider future extraction, and the project was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.repsol.com/es_en/corporacion/prensa/notas-de-prensa/ultimas-notas/16012015-repsol-finaliza-el-sondeo-exploratorio-en-canarias.aspx|title=Repsol completes its exploration well in the Canary Islands - repsol.com|website=Repsol.com|access-date=8 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220075026/https://www.repsol.com/es_en/corporacion/prensa/notas-de-prensa/ultimas-notas/16012015-repsol-finaliza-el-sondeo-exploratorio-en-canarias.aspx|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canary Islands have great natural attractions, climate and [[beach]]es make the islands a major tourist destination, being visited each year by about 12&amp;nbsp;million people (11,986,059 in 2007, noting 29% of [[United Kingdom|Britons]], 22% of Spanish, not residents of the Canaries, and 21% of [[Germany|Germans]]). Among the islands, Tenerife has the largest number of tourists received annually, followed by Gran Canaria and Lanzarote.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobiernodecanarias1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webtenerife1&quot;/&gt; The archipelago's principal tourist attraction is the [[Teide National Park]] (in Tenerife) where the highest mountain in Spain and third largest [[volcano]] in the world (Mount [[Teide]]), receives over 2.8&amp;nbsp;million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;webtenerife2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta+vacaciones+activas/Ocio/Durante+el+dia/Excursiones/EL+TEIDE.htm?Lang=es |title=Página Web Oficial de Turismo de Tenerife; El Teide |website=Webtenerife.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116025912/http://www.webtenerife.com/PortalTenerife/Home/Disfruta%2Bvacaciones%2Bactivas/Ocio/Durante%2Bel%2Bdia/Excursiones/EL%2BTEIDE.htm?Lang=es |archivedate=16 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of high mountains, proximity to Europe, and clean air has made the [[Roque de los Muchachos]] peak (on La Palma island) a leading location for [[telescope]]s like the [[Grantecan]].

The islands, as an autonomous region of Spain, are in the [[European Union]] and the [[Schengen Area]]. They are in the [[European Union Customs Union]] but outside the [[VAT]] area,&lt;ref name=&quot;territories&quot;&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/territorial-status-eu-countries-certain-territories_en Territorial status of EU countries and certain territories]{{snd}} [[European Commission]], retrieved 18 December 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of VAT there is a local Sales Tax (IGIC) which has a general rate of 7%, an increased tax rate of 13.5%, a reduced tax rate of 3% and a zero tax rate for certain basic need products and services. Consequently, some products are subject to additional VAT if being exported from the islands into mainland Spain or the rest of the EU.

Canarian time is [[Western European Time]] (WET) (or [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]]; in summer one hour ahead of GMT). So Canarian time is one hour behind that of mainland Spain and the same as that of the UK, Ireland and mainland Portugal all year round.

There are large ferry boats that link islands as well as fast ferries linking most of the islands. Both types can transport large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles). Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of {{cvt|30|knot|km/h mph||}}) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some{{clarify|reason=does &quot;some&quot; mean &quot;approximately&quot;? Or does it mean &quot;some of the ferries&quot;?|date=December 2018}} {{cvt|20|kn|km/h mph||}}). A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about two and a half hours and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.

The largest airport is the [[Gran Canaria Airport]].

=== Prehistoric fauna ===
[[File:Canariomys bravoi skull.JPG|thumb|Skull of ''[[Canariomys bravoi]]'' (''Tenerife giant rat''). It was an endemic species that is now extinct.]]
Before the arrival of the Aborigines, the Canary Islands was inhabited by endemic animals, such as some extinct; giant lizards (''[[Gallotia goliath]]''), giant rats (''[[Canariomys bravoi]]'' and ''[[Canariomys tamarani]]'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cmayot/medioambiente/lagartodelagomera/gatos.html Algunas extinciones en Canarias] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228151643/http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/cmayot/medioambiente/lagartodelagomera/gatos.html |date=28 December 2009 }} Consejería de Medio Ambiente y Ordenación Territorial del Gobierno de Canarias&lt;/ref&gt; and giant tortoises (''[[Geochelone burchardi]]'' and ''[[Geochelone vulcanica]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepaleontologia.es/revista/anteriores/REP%20Extra%201996/21Castillo.pdf «La Paleontología de vertebrados en Canarias.»] ''Spanish Journal of Palaeontology'' (antes ''Revista Española de Paleontología''). Consultado el 17 de junio de 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

=== Terrestrial wildlife ===
{{See also|List of non-marine molluscs of the Canary Islands|List of reptiles of the Canary Islands|List of Lepidoptera of the Canary Islands}}

With a range of habitats, the Canary Islands exhibit diverse plant species. The bird life includes European and African species, such as the [[black-bellied sandgrouse]]; and a rich variety of [[endemism|endemic]] (local) taxa including the:
* [[Atlantic canary|Canary]]
* Graja, a subspecies of [[red-billed chough]] endemic to La Palma
* [[Blue chaffinch]] (endemic to Tenerife and Gran Canaria)
* [[Canary Islands chiffchaff]]
* [[Fuerteventura chat]]
* [[Tenerife goldcrest]]
* [[La Palma chaffinch]]
* [[Canarian Egyptian vulture]]
* [[Bolle's pigeon]]
* [[Laurel pigeon]]
* [[Plain swift]]
* [[Houbara bustard]]
* [[Spider]]s
* [[Snake]]s
* [[Scorpion]]s
* [[Canary Islands oystercatcher]] (extinct)

Terrestrial fauna includes [[gecko]]s, [[wall lizards]], and three endemic species of recently rediscovered and [[critically endangered]] giant lizard: the [[El Hierro giant lizard]] (or [[Roque Chico de Salmor giant lizard]]), [[La Gomera giant lizard]], and [[La Palma giant lizard]]. Mammals include the [[Canarian shrew]], [[Canary big-eared bat]], the [[Algerian hedgehog]] (which may have been introduced) and the more recently introduced [[mouflon]]. Some endemic mammals, the [[lava mouse]], [[Tenerife giant rat]] and [[Gran Canaria giant rat]], are extinct, as are the [[Canary Islands quail]], [[long-legged bunting]], the [[eastern Canary Islands chiffchaff]] and the giant prehistoric tortoises; [[Geochelone burchardi]] and [[Geochelone vulcanica]].

=== Marine life ===
{{Main|Marine life of the Canary Islands}}
[[File:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[loggerhead sea turtle]], by far the most common species of marine turtle in the Canary Islands.]]
The marine life found in the Canary Islands is also varied, being a combination of [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[endemism|endemic]] species. In recent years, the increasing popularity of both [[scuba diving]] and [[underwater photography]] have provided biologists with much new information on the marine life of the islands.

Fish species found in the islands include many species of [[shark]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[moray eel]], [[Sparidae|bream]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[Grunt-fish|grunt]], [[scorpionfish]], [[triggerfish]], [[grouper]], [[goby]], and [[blenny]]. In addition, there are many invertebrate species, including [[sponge]], [[jellyfish]], [[anemone]], [[crab]], [[mollusc]], [[sea urchin]], [[starfish]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] and [[coral]].

There are a total of five different species of [[marine turtle]] that are sighted periodically in the islands, the most common of these being the [[endangered]] [[loggerhead sea turtle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lissie Wright |author2=Brian Groombridge |title=The IUCN Amphibia-reptilia Red Data Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nw8KKyu32v8C&amp;pg=PA140|year=1982|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-88032-601-2|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other four are the [[green sea turtle]], [[hawksbill sea turtle]], [[leatherback sea turtle]] and [[Kemp's ridley sea turtle]]. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [[wikt:migration|migrating]]. However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback sea turtle on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.

Marine mammals include the large varieties of [[cetacean]]s including rare and not well-known species (see more details in the ''[[Marine life of the Canary Islands]]''). [[Hooded seals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/6204/0|title=Cystophora cristata (Hooded Seal)|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been known to be vagrant in the Canary Islands every now and then. The Canary Islands were also formerly home to a population of the rarest [[pinniped]] in the world, the [[Mediterranean monk seal]].

[[File:Desfile del Sábado de Carnaval, en Santa Cruz de Tenerife.JPG|thumb|left|Parade in the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]].]]
The most famous festivals of the Canary Islands is the carnival. It is the most famous and international festival of the archipelago. The carnival is celebrated in all the islands and all its municipalities, perhaps the two busiest are those of the two Canarian capitals; the [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] (''Tourist Festival of International Interest'') and the [[Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. It is celebrated on the streets between the months of February and March. But the rest of the islands of the archipelago have their carnivals with their own traditions among which stand out: The Festival of the Carneros of [[El Hierro]], the Festival of the Diabletes of [[Teguise (municipality)|Teguise]] in [[Lanzarote]], Los Indianos de [[La Palma]], the Carnival of [[San Sebastián de La Gomera]] and the Carnival of [[Puerto del Rosario]] in [[Fuerteventura]].

==Science and technology==
[[File:Erdfunkstelle Gran Canaria-3.JPG|thumb|Gran Canaria space tracking station]]
In the 1960s, Gran Canaria was selected as the location for one of the 14 [[ground stations]] in the [[Manned Space Flight Network]] (MSFN) to support the [[NASA]] space program. [[Maspalomas Station]], located in the south of the island, took part in a number of space missions including the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landings and [[Skylab]]. Today it continues to support satellite communications as part of the [[ESA]] network.&lt;ref name=&quot;esa-page&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Maspalomas station |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Estrack/Maspalomas_station |website=European Space Agency |accessdate=8 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208113652/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Estrack/Maspalomas_station |archivedate=8 February 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the remote location, a number of [[Observatory|astronomical observatories]] are located in the archipelago, including the [[Teide Observatory]] on Tenerife, the [[Roque de los Muchachos Observatory]] on La Palma, and the [[Temisas Astronomical Observatory]] on Gran Canaria.

A unique form of wrestling known as [[Canarian wrestling]] (''lucha canaria'') has opponents stand in a special area called a &quot;terrero&quot; and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctspanish.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/canarym/canary%20islands.htm |title=The Canary Islands |website=Ctspanish.com |date=21 October 1971 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sport is the &quot;game of the sticks&quot; where opponents fence with long sticks. This may have come about from the shepherds of the islands who would challenge each other using their long walking sticks.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctspanish.com&quot;/&gt;

Furthermore, there is the [[Salto del pastor|shepherd's jump]] (''salto del pastor''). This involves using a long stick to vault over an open area. This sport possibly evolved from the shepherd's need to occasionally get over an open area in the hills as they were tending their sheep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctspanish.com&quot;/&gt;

The two main [[Association football|football]] teams in the archipelago are: the [[CD Tenerife]] (founded in 1912) and [[UD Las Palmas]] (founded in 1949). As if the 2018/2019 season, both Tenerife and Las Palmas play in [[Liga Adelante]]. When in the same division, the clubs contest the [[Canary Islands derby]].
