However, [[Neolithic]] civilizations originated at various cultural centers along both the Yellow River and [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]]. These [[Yellow river civilization|Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze civilization]]s arose millennia before the Shang. With thousands of years of continuous history, China is one of the world's oldest [[civilization]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1287798.stm |title=China country profile |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the [[Cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cradles of Civilization-China: Ancient Culture, Modern Land'', Robert E. Murowchick, gen. ed. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BC) supplanted the Shang, and introduced the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to justify their rule. The central Zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the country eventually splintered into smaller states during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. These states became independent and warred with one another in the following [[Warring States period]]. Much of traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], [[Chinese literature|literature]] and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] first developed during those troubled times.

In 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang]] [[Qin's wars of unification|conquered the various warring states]] and created for himself the title of ''Huangdi'' or &quot;[[Emperor of China|emperor]]&quot; of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]], marking the beginning of imperial China. However, the oppressive government fell soon after his death, and was supplanted by the longer-lived [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD). Successive dynasties developed [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] systems that enabled the emperor to control vast territories directly. In the 21 centuries from 206 BC until AD 1912, routine administrative tasks were handled by a special elite of ''[[scholar-officials]]''. Young men, well-versed in calligraphy, history, literature, and philosophy, were carefully selected through difficult government examinations. China's last dynasty was the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644–1912), which was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, and then in the [[Mainland China|mainland]] by the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.

Chinese history has alternated between periods of political unity and peace, and periods of war and [[failed state]]hood—the most recent being the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927–1949). China was occasionally dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were eventually assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] culture and population. Between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, [[dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] have ruled parts or all of China; in some eras control stretched as far as [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]], as at present. Traditional culture, and influences from other parts of Asia and the [[Western world]] (carried by waves of immigration, [[cultural assimilation]], expansion, and foreign contact), form the basis of the modern culture of China.

The [[Xia dynasty]] of China (from c. 2070 to c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ancient Dynasties&quot;/&gt; The dynasty was considered [[Chinese mythology|mythical]] by historians until scientific excavations found early [[Bronze Age]] sites at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]], Henan in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_bron.shtm &quot;Bronze Age China&quot;].

Archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the [[Shang dynasty]], c. 1600–1046 BC, are divided into two sets. The first set, from the earlier Shang period, comes from sources at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]], and Shangcheng. The second set, from the later Shang or Yin (殷) period, is at [[Anyang]], in modern-day [[Henan]], which has been confirmed as the last of the Shang's nine capitals (c. 1300–1046 BC).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The findings at Anyang include the earliest written record of the Chinese so far discovered: inscriptions of divination records in ancient Chinese writing on the bones or shells of animals—the &quot;[[oracle bone]]s&quot;, dating from around 1250 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;William&quot;/&gt;

A series of thirty-one kings reigned over the Shang dynasty. During their reign, according to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', the capital city was moved six times.&lt;ref name=Shiji_Yinbenji&gt;《史记·殷本纪》：帝陽甲崩，弟盤庚立，是為帝盤庚。帝盤庚之時，殷已都河北，盤庚渡河南，復居成湯之故居，乃五遷，無定處。殷民咨胥皆怨，不欲徙。盤庚乃告諭諸侯大臣曰：「昔高后成湯與爾之先祖俱定天下，法則可修。捨而弗勉，何以成德！」乃遂涉河南，治亳，行湯之政，然後百姓由寧，殷道復興。諸侯來朝，以其遵成湯之德也。&lt;/ref&gt; The final (and most important) move was to [[Yinxu|Yin]] in 1350 BC which led to the dynasty's golden age.&lt;ref name=Shiji_Yinbenji/&gt; The term Yin dynasty has been synonymous with the Shang dynasty in history, although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the Shang dynasty.

Chinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the political situation in early China was much more complicated. Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early Zhou existed at the same time as the Shang.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

For example, archaeological findings at [[Sanxingdui]] suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike Anyang. The evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the Shang realm extended from Anyang. The leading hypothesis is that Anyang, ruled by the same Shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as [[China proper]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The Zhou dynasty (1046 BC to approximately 256 BC) is the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history. By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Zhou dynasty began to emerge in the [[Yellow River]] valley, overrunning the territory of the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]] system. The Zhou lived west of the [[Shang]], and the Zhou leader was appointed Western Protector by the Shang. The ruler of the Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], with the assistance of his brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], as regent, managed to defeat the Shang at the [[Battle of Muye]].

The king of Zhou at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize his rule, a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Like Shangdi, Heaven (''tian'') ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AOu5BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=tian+China+rulers#v=onepage&amp;q=tian%20China%20rulers&amp;f=false|title=The Tradition and Modern Transition of Chinese Law|last=Zhang|first=Jinfan|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3642232664|language=en|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that a ruler lost the Mandate of Heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. In response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the Mandate of Heaven.

The Zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern [[Xi'an]], on the [[Wei River]], a tributary of the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.

In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for [[hegemony]]. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Qin (state)|Qin]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second major phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Some local leaders even started using royal titles for themselves. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some of them only as large as a village with a fort.

As the era continued, larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed suzerainty over smaller ones. By the 6th century BC most small states had disappeared by being annexed and just a few large and powerful principalities dominated China. Some southern states, such as Chu and Wu, claimed independence from the Zhou, who undertook wars against some of them (Wu and Yue). Many new cities were established in this period and Chinese culture was slowly shaped.

Once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions, the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the Warring States period, which began when the three remaining élite families in the Jin state—Zhao, Wei and Han—partitioned the state. Many famous individuals such as [[Laozi]], [[Confucius]] and [[Sun Tzu]] lived during this chaotic period.

The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The first two philosophical thoughts would have an enormous influence on Chinese culture.

After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.

[[File:Qinghuajian, Suan Biao.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|The [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips]], containing the world's earliest [[decimal]] [[multiplication table]], dated 305 BC]]

Numerous developments were made during this period in culture and mathematics.  Examples include an important literary achievement, the [[Zuo zhuan]] on the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', which summarizes the preceding Spring and Autumn period, and the bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips|Tsinghua]] collection, which was invented during this period dated to 305{{nbsp}} BC, are the world's earliest example of a two digit [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips#Decimal multiplication table|decimal multiplication table]], indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature''[http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-times-table-hidden-in-chinese-bamboo-strips-1.14482  The 2,300-year-old matrix is the world's oldest decimal multiplication table]&lt;/ref&gt;

As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period, and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng and Xian]] (province and county).

The final expansion in this period began during the reign of [[Ying Zheng]], the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], Fujian, [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC, enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huang).

{{Redirect2|Empire of China|Chinese Empire|the empire founded by Yuan Shikai|Empire of China (1915–1916)}}
{{see also|Political systems of Imperial China}}
The Imperial China Period can be divided into three sub-periods: Early, Middle, and Late.

Major events in the Early sub-period include the Qin unification of China and their replacement by the Han, the First Split followed by the Jin unification, and the loss of north China. The Middle sub-period was marked by the Sui unification and their supplementation by the Tang, the Second Split, and the Song unification. The Late sub-period included the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

Historians often refer to the period from the Qin dynasty to the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] as Imperial China. Though the unified reign of the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Qin Emperor]] lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] government seated at [[Xianyang]] (close to modern [[Xi'an]]). The doctrine of Legalism that guided the Qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor. This philosophy, while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion, proved unworkable for governing it in peacetime. The Qin Emperor presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition, including the event known as the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]]. This would be the impetus behind the later Han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance.

[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - stone slab with twelve small seal characters.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Stone slab with twelve Qin [[seal characters]] (221–206 BC)]]

Major contributions of the Qin include the concept of a centralized government, and the unification and development of the legal code, the written language, measurement, and currency of China after the tribulations of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Even something as basic as the length of axles for carts—which need to match ruts in the roads—had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire. Also as part of its centralization, the Qin connected the northern border walls of the states it defeated, making the first [[Great Wall of China]].

The tribes of the north, collectively called the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] by the Qin, were free from Chinese rule during the majority of the dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis129&quot;&gt;Lewis 2007, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibited from trading with Qin dynasty peasants, the [[Xiongnu]] tribe living in the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] region in northwest China often raided them instead, prompting the Qin to retaliate. After a [[Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu|military campaign led by General Meng Tian]], the region was conquered in 215 BC and agriculture was established; the peasants, however, were discontented and later revolted. The succeeding Han dynasty also expanded into the Ordos due to overpopulation, but depleted their resources in the process. Indeed, this was true of the dynasty's borders in multiple directions; modern [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Xinjiang]], [[Tibet]], [[Manchuria]], and regions to the southeast were foreign to the Qin, and even areas over which they had military control were culturally distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as Confucius and up until 1912, there was reliance upon a trained intellectual elite, the ''[[scholar-official]]'' (&quot;scholar-gentlemen&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Alexander Moore, ed. 1967 22&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Alexander Moore, ed.|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoyN2h56ucC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=U of Hawaii Press|page=22|isbn=978-0824800758}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were civil servants appointed by the Emperor to handle daily governance. Talented young men were selected through an elaborate process of [[imperial examination]]. They had to demonstrate skill at [[calligraphy]], and had to know Confucian philosophy. Historian Wing-Tsit Chan concludes that:

{{quote|Generally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe.

[[File:Han Expansion.png|thumb|Map showing the expansion of Han dynasty in the 2nd century BC]]

The [[Han dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]], who emerged victorious in the [[Chu–Han Contention]] that followed the fall of the [[Qin dynasty]]. A [[Pax Sinica|golden age]] in Chinese history, the Han dynasty's long period of stability and prosperity consolidated the foundation of China as a unified state under a central imperial bureaucracy, which was to last intermittently for most of the next two millennia. During the Han dynasty, territory of China was extended to most of the [[China proper]] and to areas far west. [[Confucianism]] was officially elevated to orthodox status and was to shape the subsequent Chinese civilization. Art, culture and science all advanced to unprecedented heights. With the profound and lasting impacts of this period of Chinese history, the dynasty name &quot;Han&quot; had been taken as the name of the Chinese people, now the [[Han Chinese|dominant ethnic group]] in modern China, and had been commonly used to refer to Chinese language and [[Chinese characters|written characters]]. The Han dynasty also saw many mathematical innovations being invented such as the method of [[Gaussian elimination]] which appeared in the Chinese mathematical text [[Rod calculus#System of linear equations|Chapter Eight ''Rectangular Arrays'']] of ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''. Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. The first reference to the book by this title is dated to 179 AD, but parts of it were written as early as approximately 150 BC, more than 1500 years before the Europeans came up with the method in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Calinger|1999}}, pp. 234–236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Timothy Gowers|author2=June Barrow-Green|author3=Imre Leader|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|url=https://archive.org/details/princetoncompanio00gowe|date= 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=607}}&lt;!-- |accessdate=28 September 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Huang-Lao|initial laissez-faire policies]] of Emperors [[Emperor Wen of Han|Wen]] and [[Emperor Jing of Han|Jing]], the ambitious [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] brought the empire to its zenith. To consolidate his power, Confucianism, which emphasizes stability and order in a well-structured society, was given exclusive patronage to be the guiding philosophical thoughts and moral principles of the empire. [[Taixue|Imperial Universities]] were established to support its study and further development, while other [[Hundred Schools of Thought|schools of thought]] were discouraged.

[[Han–Xiongnu War|Major military campaigns]] were launched to weaken the nomadic [[Xiongnu|Xiongnu Empire]], limiting their influence north of the Great Wall. Along with the diplomatic efforts led by [[Zhang Qian]], the sphere of influence of the Han Empire extended to the [[Western Regions|states in the Tarim Basin]], opened up the [[Silk Road]] that connected China to the west, stimulating bilateral trade and cultural exchange. To the south, various small kingdoms far beyond the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] Valley were formally incorporated into the empire.

Emperor Wu also dispatched a [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty|series of military campaigns]] against the [[Baiyue]] tribes.

After [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]], the empire slipped into gradual stagnation and decline. Economically, the state treasury was strained by excessive campaigns and projects, while land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. Various [[consort clan]]s exerted increasing control over strings of incompetent emperors and eventually the dynasty was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]].

====Xin dynasty====

In AD 9, the usurper [[Wang Mang]] claimed that the [[Mandate of Heaven]] called for the end of the Han dynasty and the rise of his own, and he founded the short-lived [[Xin dynasty|Xin (&quot;New&quot;) dynasty]]. Wang Mang started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms, including the outlawing of slavery and land nationalization and redistribution. These programs, however, were never supported by the landholding families, because they favored the [[peasant]]s. The instability of power brought about chaos, uprisings, and loss of territories. This was compounded by mass flooding of the [[Yellow River]]; silt buildup caused it to split into two channels and displaced large numbers of farmers. Wang Mang was eventually killed in [[Weiyang Palace]] by an enraged peasant mob in AD 23.

====Eastern Han====

[[File:东汉铜卡尺.jpg|thumb|upright|A bronze caliper from the Eastern Han period]]

[[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] reinstated the Han dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at [[Luoyang]], ''east'' of the former capital Xi'an. Thus, this new era is termed the [[Eastern Han dynasty]]. With the capable administrations of Emperors [[Emperor Ming of Han|Ming]] and [[Emperor Zhang of Han|Zhang]], former glories of the dynasty was reclaimed, with brilliant military and cultural achievements. The [[Xiongnu|Xiongnu Empire]] was [[Han–Xiongnu War#Final stages|decisively defeated]]. The diplomat and general [[Ban Chao]] further expanded the conquests across the [[Pamirs]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao &quot;Ban Chao&quot;], ''Britannica Online Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; thus reopening the [[Silk Road]], and bringing trade, foreign cultures, along with the [[Chinese Buddhism#Traditional accounts|arrival of Buddhism]]. With extensive connections with the west, the first of several [[Romano-Chinese relations|Roman embassies to China]] were recorded in Chinese sources, coming from the sea route in AD 166, and a second one in AD 284.

The Eastern Han dynasty was one of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most prolific era of science and technology]] in ancient China, notably the historic invention of [[papermaking]] by [[Cai Lun]], and the numerous scientific and mathematical contributions by the famous [[polymath]] [[Zhang Heng]].

By the 2nd century, the empire declined amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between [[consort clan]]s and [[Eunuch#China|eunuchs]]. The [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in AD 184, ushering in an era of [[warlord]]s. In the ensuing turmoil, three states tried to gain predominance in the period of the [[Three Kingdoms]]. This time period has been greatly romanticized in works such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

After [[Cao Cao]] reunified the north in 208, his son proclaimed the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty in 220. Soon, Wei's rivals [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] proclaimed their independence, leading China into the Three Kingdoms period. This period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the Qin and Han dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families.

In 266, the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] overthrew the Wei and later unified the country in 280, but this union was short-lived.

The Jin dynasty was severely weakened by [[War of the Eight Princes|internecine fighting among imperial princes]] and lost control of northern China after [[Five Barbarians|non-Han Chinese settlers]] [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians|rebelled]] and captured Luoyang and [[Chang'an]].  In 317, a [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Jin prince]] in modern-day [[Nanjing]] became emperor and continued the dynasty, now known as the Eastern Jin, which held southern China for another century. Prior to this move, historians refer to the Jin dynasty as the Western Jin.

Northern China fragmented into a series of [[Sixteen Kingdoms|independent kingdoms]], most of which were founded by [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], [[Jie people|Jie]], [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] and [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] rulers.  These non-Han peoples were ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Tibetans]]. Many had, to some extent, been &quot;[[Sinicization|sinicized]]&quot; long before their ascent to power. In fact, some of them, notably the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] and the Xiongnu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the Great Wall since late Han times.  During the period of the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], warfare ravaged the north and prompted large-scale Han Chinese migration south to the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] Basin and Delta.

In the early 5th century, China entered a period known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, in which parallel regimes ruled the northern and southern halves of the country.  In the south, the Eastern Jin gave way to the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] and finally [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]. Each of these Southern dynasties were led by Han Chinese ruling families and used [[Jiankang]] (modern Nanjing) as the capital. They held off attacks from the north and preserved many aspects of Chinese civilization, while northern barbarian regimes began to [[sinify]].

In the north, the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms was extinguished in 439 by the [[Northern Wei]], a kingdom founded by the [[Xianbei]], a nomadic people who unified northern China. The Northern Wei eventually split into the [[Eastern Wei|Eastern]] and [[Western Wei]], which then became the [[Northern Qi]] and [[Northern Zhou]]. These regimes were dominated by Xianbei or Han Chinese who had married into Xianbei families. During this period most Xianbei people adopted Han surnames, eventually leading to complete assimilation into the Han.

Despite the division of the country, Buddhism spread throughout the land. In southern China, fierce debates about whether [[Buddhism]] should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. By the end of the era, Buddhists and [[Taoist]]s had become much more tolerant of each other.

The short-lived [[Sui dynasty]] was a pivotal period in Chinese history. Founded by [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] in 581 in succession of the [[Northern Zhou]], the Sui went on to conquer the [[Chen dynasty|Southern Chen]] in 589 to reunify China, ending three centuries of political division. The Sui pioneered many new institutions, including the government system of [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]], [[imperial examination]]s for selecting officials from commoners, while improved on the systems of [[fubing system]] of the army conscription and the [[Equal-field system]] of land distributions. These policies, which were adopted by later dynasties, brought enormous population growth, and amassed excessive wealth to the state. [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Standardized coinage]] were enforced throughout the unified empire. Buddhism took root as a prominent religion and was supported officially. Sui China was known for its numerous mega-construction projects. Intended for grains shipment and transporting troops, the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] was constructed, linking the capitals [[Chang'an|Daxing (Chang'an)]] and [[Luoyang]] to the wealthy [[Southeastern China|southeast region]], and in another route, to the northeast border. The [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] was also expanded, while series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers further pacified its borders. However, the massive invasions of the [[Korean Peninsula]] during the [[Goguryeo–Sui War]] failed disastrously, triggering widespread revolts that led to [[transition from Sui to Tang|the fall of the dynasty]].

The [[Tang dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] on 18 June 618. It was a [[Pax Sinica|golden age of Chinese civilization]] and considered to be the most prosperous period of China with significant developments in culture, art, literature, particularly [[Tang poetry|poetry]], and technology. Buddhism became the predominant religion for the common people. [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), the national capital, was the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world during its time]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, ''China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty'' (2012). [https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Cosmopolitan-Empire-Dynasty-Imperial/dp/0674064011/  excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.]]

The second emperor, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]], is widely regarded as one of the greatest [[Emperor of China|emperors in Chinese history]], who had laid the foundation for the dynasty to flourish for centuries beyond his reign. Combined military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers were implemented to eliminate threats from nomadic tribes, extend the border, and submit neighboring states into [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|a tributary system]]. Military victories in the [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia|Tarim Basin]] kept the [[Silk Road]] open, connecting Chang'an to Central Asia and areas far to the west. In the south, lucrative maritime trade routes began from port cities such as [[Guangzhou]]. There was extensive trade with distant foreign countries, and many foreign merchants settled in China, encouraging a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] culture. The Tang culture and social systems were observed and imitated by neighboring countries, most notably, [[Nara period|Japan]]. Internally the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linked the political heartland in Chang'an to the agricultural and economic centers in the eastern and southern parts of the empire. [[Xuanzang]], a Chinese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]], scholar, traveller, and translator who travelled to [[India]] on his own, and returned with, &quot;over six hundred Mahayana and Hinayana texts, seven statues of the Buddha and more than a hundred [[sarira]] relics.&quot;

Underlying the prosperity of the early Tang dynasty was a strong centralized bureaucracy with efficient policies. The government was organized as &quot;[[Three Departments and Six Ministries]]&quot; to separately draft, review, and implement policies. These departments were run by royal family members as well as [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar officials]] who were selected by [[imperial examination]]s. These practices, which matured in the Tang dynasty, were continued by the later dynasties, with some modifications.

Under the Tang &quot;[[equal-field system]]&quot; all land was owned by the Emperor and granted to people according to household size. Men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year, a military policy known as the &quot;[[Fubing system]]&quot;. These policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury. By the dynasty's midpoint, however, [[Standing army|standing armies]] had replaced conscription, and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners.

The dynasty continued to flourish under the rule of Empress [[Wu Zetian]], the only [[empress regnant]] in Chinese history, and reached its zenith during the long reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who oversaw an empire that stretched from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to the [[Aral Sea]] with at least 50 million people. There were vibrant artistic and cultural creations, including works of the greatest Chinese [[Tang poetry|poets]], [[Li Bai]], and [[Du Fu]].

At the zenith of prosperity of the empire, the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] from 755 to 763 was a watershed event that [[An Lushan Rebellion#Death toll|devastated the population]] and drastically weakened the central imperial government. Upon suppression of the rebellion, regional military governors, known as [[Jiedushi]], gained increasingly autonomous status. With loss of revenue from land tax, the central imperial government relied heavily on [[Salt in Chinese history|salt monopoly]].  Externally, former submissive states raided the empire and the vast border territories were irreversibly lost for subsequent centuries. Nevertheless, civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy.

In late Tang period, the empire was worn out by recurring revolts of [[Jiedushi|regional warlords]], while internally, as scholar-officials engaged in fierce [[Niu–Li factional strife|factional strife]], corrupted [[eunuchs]] [[Sweet Dew incident|amassed immense power]]. Catastrophically, the [[Huang Chao Rebellion]], from 874 to 884, devastated the entire empire for a decade. The sack of the southern port [[Guangzhou]] in 879 was followed by the [[Guangzhou massacre|massacre]] of most of its inhabitants, along with the large foreign merchant enclaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Gabriel Ferrand |year=1922 |title=Voyage du marchand arabe Sulaymân en Inde et en Chine, rédigé en 851, suivi de remarques par Abû Zayd Hasan (vers 916) |url=https://archive.org/details/voyagedumarchand00sirauoft |page=[https://archive.org/details/voyagedumarchand00sirauoft/page/76 76]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html |title=Kaifung Jews |publisher=University of Cumbria, Division of Religion and Philosophy |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028113532/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html |archivedate=28 October 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 881, both capitals, [[Luoyang]] and [[Chang'an]], fell successively. The reliance on ethnic [[Han Chinese|Han]] and [[Shatuo|Turkic]] [[Jiedushi|warlords]] in suppressing the rebellion increased their power and influence. Consequently, the fall of the dynasty following [[Zhu Wen]]'s usurpation led to an [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|era of division]].

According to historian Mark Edward Lewis:
:Most Chinese regard the Tang dynasty (618–907) as the high point of Imperial China, both politically and culturally. The empire reached its greatest size prior to the Manchu Qing dynasty, becoming the center of an East Asian world linked by religion, script, and many economic and political institutions. Moreover, Tang writers produce the [[Tang poetry|finest poetry]] in China's great lyric tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Edward Lewis, ''China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty'' (2012). p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of political disunity between the Tang and the Song, known as the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], lasted from 907 to 960. During this half-century, China was in all respects a multi-state system. Five regimes, namely, (Later) [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Liang]], [[Later Tang|Tang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Jin]], [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han]] and [[Later Zhou|Zhou]], rapidly succeeded one another in control of the traditional Imperial heartland in northern China. Among the regimes, rulers of (Later) [[Later Tang|Tang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Jin]] and [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han]] were [[Sinicization|sinicized]] [[Shatuo|Shatuo Turks]], which ruled over the ethnic majority of [[Han Chinese]]. More stable and smaller regimes of mostly ethnic [[Han Chinese|Han]] rulers coexisted in south and western China over the period, cumulatively constituted the &quot;Ten Kingdoms&quot;.

Amidst political chaos in the north, the strategic [[Sixteen Prefectures]] (region along today's [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]) were ceded to the emerging [[Liao dynasty|Khitan Liao dynasty]], which drastically weakened the defense of the [[China proper]] against northern nomadic empires. To the south, [[Vietnam]] [[Battle of Bạch Đằng (938)|gained lasting independence]] after [[Third Chinese domination of Vietnam|being a Chinese prefecture]] for [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|many centuries]]. With wars dominated in Northern China, there were mass southward migrations of population, which further enhanced the southward shift of cultural and economic centers in China. The [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|era]] ended with the coup of [[Later Zhou]] general [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Zhao Kuangyin]], and the establishment of the [[Song dynasty]] in 960, which eventually annihilated the remains of the &quot;Ten Kingdoms&quot; and reunified China.

In 960, the [[Song dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Emperor Taizu]], with its capital established in [[Kaifeng]] (also known as [[Bianjing]]). In 979, the Song dynasty reunified most of the [[China proper]], while large swaths of the outer territories were occupied by [[Sinicization|sinicized]] [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]], which lasted from 907 to 1125, ruled over [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia]], and parts of [[North China|Northern China]]. Meanwhile, in what are now the north-western Chinese provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Shaanxi]], and [[Ningxia]], the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] tribes founded the [[Western Xia|Western Xia dynasty]] from 1032 to 1227.

Aiming to recover the strategic [[Sixteen Prefectures]] lost in the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|previous dynasty]], [[Battle of Gaoliang River|campaigns]] were launched against the [[Liao dynasty]] in the [[Emperor Taizong of Song|early Song period]], which all ended in failure. Then in 1004, the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] [[cavalry]] swept over the exposed [[North China Plain]] and reached the outskirts of [[Kaifeng]], forcing the Song's submission and then agreement to the [[Chanyuan Treaty]], which imposed heavy annual tributes from the Song treasury. The treaty was a significant reversal of Chinese dominance of the traditional [[imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary system]]. Yet the annual outflow of Song's silver to the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] was paid back through the purchase of Chinese goods and products, which expanded the Song economy, and replenished its treasury. This dampened the incentive for the Song to further campaign against the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]]. Meanwhile, this cross-border trade and contact induced further [[sinicization]] within the [[Liao dynasty|Liao Empire]], at the expense of its military might which was derived from its primitive nomadic lifestyle. Similar treaties and social-economical consequences occurred in Song's relations with the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]].

Within the [[Liao dynasty|Liao Empire]], the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes revolted against their overlords to establish the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] in 1115. In 1125, the devastating [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] [[cataphract]] annihilated the [[Liao dynasty]], while remnants of [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] court members fled to Central Asia to found the [[Qara Khitai|Qara Khitai Empire (Western Liao dynasty)]]. [[Jin–Song Wars|Jin's invasion of the Song dynasty]] followed swiftly. In 1127, [[Kaifeng]] was sacked, a massive catastrophe known as the [[Jingkang Incident]], ending the [[Northern Song dynasty]]. Later the [[Jurchen campaigns against the Song dynasty|entire north of China was conquered]]. The survived members of Song court regrouped in the new capital city of [[Hangzhou]], and initiated the [[Southern Song dynasty]], which ruled territories south of the [[Huai River]]. In the ensuing years, the territory and population of China were divided between the Song dynasty, the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Western Xia|Western Xia dynasty]]. The era ended with the [[Mongol conquest]], as [[Western Xia]] fell in 1227, the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Jin dynasty]] in 1234, and finally the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]] in 1279.

Despite its military weakness, the Song dynasty is widely considered to be the high point of classical Chinese civilization. The [[Economy of the Song dynasty|Song economy]], facilitated by technology advancement, had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time. The population soared to over 100 million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to improvements in rice cultivation and the wide availability of coal for production. The capital cities of [[Kaifeng]] and subsequently [[Hangzhou]] were both the [[List of largest cities throughout history|most populous cities]] in the world for their time, and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous Chinese dynasties. Although land trading routes to the far west were blocked by nomadic empires, there were extensive [[Maritime Silk Route|maritime trade]] with neighboring states, which facilitated the use of Song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange. Giant wooden vessels equipped with [[compass]]es traveled throughout the [[China Seas]] and northern [[Indian Ocean]]. The concept of [[insurance]] was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such long-haul maritime [[shipment]]s. With prosperous economic activities, the historically first use of [[Jiaozi (currency)|paper currency]] emerged in the western city of [[Chengdu]], as a supplement to the existing copper [[coin]]s.

The Song dynasty was considered to be the golden age of great advancements in science and technology of China, thanks to innovative scholar-officials such as [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) and [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095). Inventions such as the hydro-mechanical astronomical clock, the first continuous and endless power-transmitting chain, [[woodblock printing]] and [[paper money]] were all invented during the Song dynasty.

There was court intrigue between the political reformers and conservatives, led by the chancellors [[Wang Anshi]] and [[Sima Guang]], respectively. By the mid-to-late 13th century, the Chinese had adopted the dogma of [[Neo-Confucian]] philosophy formulated by [[Zhu Xi]]. Enormous literary works were compiled during the Song dynasty, such as the historical work, the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' (&quot;Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government&quot;). The invention of [[Woodblock print|movable-type printing]] further facilitated the spread of knowledge. Culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' and ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', along with great Buddhist painters such as the prolific [[Lin Tinggui]].

The [[Song dynasty]] was also a period of major innovation in the [[Military history|history of warfare]]. [[Gunpowder]], while invented in the [[Tang dynasty]], was first put into use in battlefields by the Song army, inspiring a succession of new [[firearm]]s and [[siege engine]]s designs. During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], as its survival hinged decisively on guarding the [[Yangtze]] and [[Huai River]] against the cavalry forces from the north, the first standing navy in China was assembled in 1132, with its [[admiral]]'s headquarters established at [[Dinghai]]. [[Paddle wheel|Paddle-wheel]] warships equipped with [[trebuchet]]s could launch [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] made of gunpowder and lime, as recorded in Song's victory over the invading [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] forces at the [[Battle of Tangdao]] in the [[East China Sea]], and the [[Battle of Caishi]] on the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] in 1161.

The advances in civilization during the Song dynasty came to an abrupt end following the devastating [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Mongol conquest]], during which the population sharply dwindled, with a marked contraction in economy. Despite viciously [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|halting Mongol advance]] for more than three decades, the Southern Song capital [[Hangzhou]] fell in 1276, followed by the final annihilation of the Song standing navy at the [[Battle of Yamen]] in 1279.

[[File:MongolMap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Mongol successor khanates]]

The [[Yuan dynasty]] was formally proclaimed in 1271, when the [[List of Mongol rulers|Great Khan of Mongol]], [[Kublai Khan]], one of the grandsons of [[Genghis Khan]], assumed the additional title of [[Emperor of China]], and considered [[Division of the Mongol Empire|his inherited part]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] as a [[Chinese dynasty]]. In the preceding decades, the Mongols had conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] in Northern China, and the [[Southern Song dynasty]] fell in 1279 after a [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|protracted and bloody war]]. The [[Mongols|Mongol]] Yuan dynasty became the first [[conquest dynasty]] in Chinese history to rule the entire [[China proper]] and [[List of ethnic groups in China|its population]] as an [[Mongols in China|ethnic minority]]. The dynasty also directly controlled the [[Mongolia]]n heartland and other regions, inheriting the largest share of territory of the [[Division of the Mongol Empire|divided Mongol Empire]], which roughly coincided with the modern area of China and nearby regions in [[East Asia]]. Further expansion of the empire was halted after defeats in the [[Mongol invasions of Japan|invasions of Japan]] and [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Vietnam]]. Following the previous [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], the capital of Yuan dynasty was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (also known as [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]], modern-day [[Beijing]]). The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] was reconstructed to connect the remote capital city to economic hubs in southern part of China, setting the precedence and foundation where [[Beijing]] would largely remain as the [[Historical capitals of China|capital]] of the successive regimes that unified China mainland.

After the peace treaty in [[Kaidu–Kublai war|1304]] that ended a series of [[Division of the Mongol Empire#Civil war|Mongol civil wars]], the emperors of the Yuan dynasty were upheld as the nominal [[Khagan|Great Khan]] ([[Khagan]]) of the greater [[Mongol Empire]] over other [[Khamag Mongol|Mongol Khanates]], which nonetheless remained [[Division of the Mongol Empire|de facto autonomous]]. The era was known as ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', when much of the [[Asia|Asian continent]] was ruled by the Mongols. For the first and only time in history, the [[Silk Road|silk road]] was controlled entirely by a single state, facilitating the flow of people, trade, and cultural exchange. Network of roads and a [[Yam (route)|postal system]] were established to connect the vast empire. Lucrative maritime trade, developed from the previous [[Song dynasty]], continued to flourish, with [[Quanzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]] emerging as the largest ports in the world. Adventurous travelers from the far west, most notably the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], [[Marco Polo]], would have settled in China for decades. Upon his return, his detail [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travel record]] inspired generations of [[High Middle Ages|medieval Europeans]] with the splendors of the far East. The Yuan dynasty was the first ancient economy, where [[paper currency]], known at the time as [[Jiaochao]], was used as the predominant medium of exchange. Its unrestricted issuance in the late Yuan dynasty inflicted [[hyperinflation]], which eventually brought the downfall of the dynasty.

While the Mongol rulers of the Yuan dynasty adopted substantially to Chinese culture, their [[sinicization]] was of lesser extent compared to earlier [[Conquest dynasty|conquest dynasties]] in Chinese history. For preserving racial superiority as the conqueror and ruling class, traditional nomadic customs and heritage from the [[Mongolian Steppe|Mongolian steppe]] were held in high regard. On the other hand, the Mongol rulers also adopted flexibly to a variety of cultures from many advanced civilizations within the [[Mongol Empire|vast empire]]. Traditional social structure and culture in China underwent immense transform during the Mongol dominance. Large group of [[Semu|foreign migrants]] settled in China, who enjoyed elevated social status over the majority [[Han Chinese]], while enriching Chinese culture with foreign elements. The class of [[Scholar-official|scholar officials]] and intellectuals, traditional bearers of elite Chinese culture, lost substantial social status. This stimulated the development of culture of the common folks. There were prolific works in [[zaju|zaju variety shows]] and [[Sanqu|literary songs]] ([[sanqu]]), which were written in a distinctive [[Yuan poetry|poetry style]] known as [[Qu (poetry)|qu]]. [[Novel]]s of vernacular style gained unprecedented status and popularity.

Before the Mongol invasion, Chinese dynasties reported approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest had been completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ping-ti |last= Ho | title=An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China | journal = Études Song | series= 1 | issue=1 | year=1970 | pages=33–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This major decline is not necessarily due only to Mongol killings. Scholars such as Frederick W. Mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease; others such as [[Timothy Brook]] argue that the Mongols created a system of [[serfdom|enserfment]] among a huge portion of the Chinese populace, causing many to disappear from the census altogether; other historians including William McNeill and David Morgan consider that [[Plague (disease)|plague]] was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period. In the 14th century China suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague, estimated to have killed 25 million people, 30% of the population of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&amp;topic=1 |title = Course: Plague |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118121009/http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&amp;topic=1 | archivedate = 18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Yuan dynasty, there was some general sentiment among the populace against the Mongol dominance. Yet rather than the nationalist cause, it was mainly strings of natural disasters and incompetent governance that triggered widespread peasant uprisings since the 1340s. After the [[Largest naval battle in history|massive naval engagement]] [[Battle of Lake Poyang|at Lake Poyang]], [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] prevailed over other rebel forces in the south. He proclaimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor|emperor]] and founded the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368. The same year his northern expedition army captured the capital [[Khanbaliq]]. The Yuan remnants fled back to [[Mongolia]] and [[Northern Yuan dynasty|sustained the regime]]. Other [[Mongol Empire|Mongol Khanates]] in [[Central Asia]] continued to exist after the fall of [[Yuan dynasty]] in China.

The [[Ming dynasty]] was founded by [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] in 1368, who proclaimed himself as the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. The capital was initially set at [[Nanjing]], and was later moved to [[Beijing]] from [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle Emperor's]] reign onward.

Urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.

Despite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the [[Treasure voyages|voyages of Zheng He]].

The [[Hongwu Emperor]], being the only founder of a [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasty]] who was also of peasant origin, had laid the foundation of a state that relied fundamentally in agriculture. Commerce and trade, which flourished in the previous [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties, were less emphasized. Neo-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were expropriated by the Ming rulers. Land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. Private slavery was forbidden. Consequently, after the death of the [[Yongle Emperor]], independent peasant landholders predominated in Chinese agriculture. These laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes. Towards later era of the [[Ming dynasty]], with declining government control, commerce, trade and private industries revived.

The dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. The emperor's role became more autocratic, although [[Hongwu Emperor]] necessarily continued to use what he called the &quot;[[Grand Secretariat]]&quot; to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including [[memorial to the throne|memorials]] (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. It was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the Ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.

The Yongle Emperor strenuously tried to extend China's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to China to present tribute. A large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500&amp;nbsp;tons. A standing army of 1 million troops was created. The Chinese armies [[Ming–Hồ War|conquered]] and [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|occupied Vietnam]] for around 20 years, while the [[Treasure voyages|Chinese fleet sailed]] the China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. The Chinese gained influence in eastern [[Moghulistan]]. Several maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. Domestically, the Grand Canal was expanded and became a stimulus to domestic trade. Over 100,000&amp;nbsp;tons of iron per year were produced. Many books were printed using movable type. The imperial palace in Beijing's [[Forbidden City]] reached its current splendor. It was also during these centuries that the potential of south China came to be fully exploited. New crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.

In 1449 [[Esen Tayisi]] led an [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongol invasion of northern China which culminated in the capture of the [[Emperor Yingzong of Ming|Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Tumu Crisis|Tumu]]. Since then, the Ming became on the defensive on the northern frontier, which led to the [[Ming Great Wall]] being built. Most of what remains of the Great Wall of China today was either built or repaired by the Ming. The brick and granite work was enlarged, the watchtowers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.

At sea, the Ming became increasingly isolationist after the death of the Yongle Emperor. The treasure voyages which sailed Indian Ocean were discontinued, and the [[Haijin|maritime prohibition]] laws were set in place banning the Chinese from sailing abroad. European traders who reached China in the midst of the [[Age of Discovery]] were repeatedly rebuked in their requests for trade, with the Portuguese being [[Battle of Tunmen|repulsed by the Ming navy]] at [[Tuen Mun]] in 1521 and again [[Second Battle of Tamao|in 1522]]. Domestic and foreign demands for overseas trade, deemed illegal by the state, led to widespread ''[[wokou]]'' piracy attacking the southeastern coastline during the rule of the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (1507–1567), which only subsided after the opening of ports in [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]] and [[Jiajing wokou raids|much military suppression]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;China &gt; History &gt; The Ming dynasty &gt; Political history &gt; The dynastic succession&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese were allowed to settle in [[Macau]] in 1557 for trade, which remained in Portuguese hands until 1999. The Dutch entry into the Chinese seas was also met with fierce resistance, with the Dutch being chased off the [[Penghu|Penghu islands]] in the [[Sino-Dutch conflicts]] of 1622–1624 and were forced to settle in Taiwan instead. [[Dutch Formosa|The Dutch in Taiwan]] fought with the Ming in the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]] in 1633 and lost, and eventually surrendered to the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]] in 1662, after the fall of the Ming dynasty.

In 1556, during the rule of the [[Jiajing Emperor]], the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake|Shaanxi earthquake]] killed about 830,000 people, the deadliest earthquake of all time.

The [[Ming dynasty]] intervened deeply in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]], which ended with the withdrawal of all invading Japanese forces in [[Korea]], and the restoration of the [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]], its traditional ally and [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary state]]. The [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|regional hegemony]] of the Ming dynasty was preserved at a toll on its resources. Coincidentally, with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]'s control in [[Manchuria]] in decline, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] ([[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]) tribes, under their chieftain [[Nurhaci]], broke away from Ming's rule, and emerged as a powerful, unified state, which was [[Hong Taiji|later proclaimed]] as the [[Qing dynasty]]. It went on to subdue the much weakened [[Joseon dynasty|Korea]] as its [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]], conquered [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Mongolia]], and expanded its territory to the outskirt of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The most elite army of the [[Ming dynasty]] was to station at the [[Shanhai Pass]] to guard the last stronghold against the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], which weakened its suppression of internal [[Li Zicheng|peasants uprisings]].

The [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) was the last imperial dynasty in China. Founded by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], it was the second [[conquest dynasty]] to rule the territory of [[China proper]], and roughly doubled the territory controlled by the Ming. The Manchus were formerly known as [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], residing in the northeastern part of the Ming territory outside the Great Wall. They emerged as the major threat to the late Ming dynasty after [[Nurhaci]] united all Jurchen tribes and declared the founding of the Qing dynasty in 1636. The Qing dynasty set up the [[Eight Banners]] system that provided the basic framework for the Qing military conquest. [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebellion captured Beijing in 1644 and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus allied with the Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] to seize Beijing, which was made the capital of the Qing dynasty. and then proceeded to subdue the [[Southern Ming dynasty|Ming remnants in the south]]. The decades of Manchu conquest caused [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars and armed conflicts|enormous loss of lives]] and the [[Economic history of China before 1912#Qing dynasty (1644–1912)|economic scale of China shrank drastically]]. In total, the [[Transition from Ming to Qing|Qing conquest of the Ming]] (1618–1683) cost as many as 25 million lives.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Roberts (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC A Short History of the World]''. Oxford University Press. p. 272. {{ISBN|0-19-511504-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Manchu emperors combined traditions of Central Asian rule with Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government and were considered a Chinese dynasty.

The Manchus enforced a 'queue order,' forcing Han Chinese men to adopt the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]]. Officials were required to wear Manchu-style clothing ''[[Changshan]]'' ([[Eight Banners|bannermen]] dress and ''[[Tangzhuang]]''), but ordinary Han civilians were allowed to wear [[Ancient Chinese clothing|traditional Han clothing]]. Bannermen could not undertake trade or manual labor; they had to petition to be removed from banner status. They were considered a form of nobility and were given annual pensions, land, and allotments of cloth.The [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered the creation of the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', the most complete dictionary of [[Chinese characters]] that had been compiled.

Over the next half-century, all areas previously under the Ming dynasty were consolidated under the Qing. [[Ten Great Campaigns|conquests in Central Asia]] in the eighteenth century extended territorial control. Between 1673 and 1681, the Kangxi Emperor suppressed the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], an uprising of three generals in Southern China who had been denied hereditary rule of large fiefdoms granted by the [[Shunzhi Emperor|previous emperor]]. In 1683, the Qing staged an amphibious assault on southern [[Taiwan]], bringing down the rebel [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which was founded by the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong) in 1662 after the fall of the Southern Ming, and had served as a base for continued Ming resistance in Southern China. The Qing [[Sino-Russian border conflicts|defeated the Russians at Albazin]], resulting in the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]].

By area it was [[List of largest empires#All empires at their greatest extent|one of the largest empires ever]].

[[File:Li Hung Chang in 1896.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Li Hongzhang]], a Chinese politician, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty.]]

In the 19th century the empire was internally restive and externally threatened by western powers. The defeat by the [[British Empire]] in the [[First Opium War]] (1840) led to the [[Treaty of Nanking]] (1842), under which [[History of Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|Hong Kong]] was ceded to Britain and importation of [[opium]] (produced by British Empire territories) was allowed. Opium usage continued to grow in China, adversely affecting societal stability. Subsequent military defeats and [[unequal treaties]] with other western powers continued even after the fall of the Qing dynasty.

Internally the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851–1864), a Christian religious movement led by the &quot;Heavenly King&quot; [[Hong Xiuquan]] swept from the south to establish the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] and controlled roughly a third of China proper for over a decade. The court in desperation empowered Han Chinese officials such as [[Zeng Guofan]] to raise local armies. After initial defeats, Zeng crushed the rebels in the [[Third Battle of Nanking]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kuhn, ''Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China: Militarization and Social Structure, 1796–1864'' (1970) ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;This was one of the largest wars in the 19th century in terms of troop involvement; there was massive loss of life, with [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars and armed conflicts|a death toll of about 20 million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Matthew | last=White |url = http://necrometrics.com/wars19c.htm | title = Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Nineteenth Century |accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A string of civil disturbances followed, including the [[Punti–Hakka Clan Wars]], [[Nian Rebellion]], [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan Revolt]], and [[Panthay Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Damsan |last=Harper | first2=Steve |last2=Fallon |first3=Katja |last3=Gaskell |first4=Julie |last4=Grundvig |first5= Carolyn |last5=Heller | first6=Thomas |last6=Huhti |first7=Bradley |last7=Maynew |first8=Christopher | last8=Pitts | title=Lonely Planet China | url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetchin00dami_1 | url-access=registration | edition=9 | year=2005 | isbn=1-74059-687-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; All rebellions were ultimately put down, but at enormous cost and with millions dead, seriously weakening the central imperial authority. China never rebuilt a strong central army, and many local officials used their military power to effectively rule independently in their provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''Rebellion and its Enemies'', ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the dynasty appeared to recover in the [[Tongzhi Restoration]] (1860-1872), led by Manchu royal family reformers and Han Chinese officials such as Zeng Guofan and his proteges [[Li Hongzhang]] and [[Zuo Zongtang]]. Their [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] made effective institutional reforms, imported Western factories and communications technology, with prime emphasis on strengthening the military. However, the reform was undermined by official rivalries, cynicism, and quarrels within the imperial family. The defeat of [[Yuan Shikai]]'s modernized &quot;[[Beiyang Fleet]]&quot; in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894–1895) led to the formation of the [[New Army]]. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], advised by [[Kang Youwei]], then launched a comprehensive reform effort, the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (1898). [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], however, feared that precipitous change would lead to bureaucratic opposition and foreign intervention and quickly suppressed it.

In the summer of 1900, the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer Uprising]] opposed foreign influence and murdered Chinese Christians and foreign missionaries. When Boxers entered Beijing, the Qing government ordered all foreigners to leave, but they and many Chinese Christians were [[Siege of the International Legations|besieged in the foreign legations quarter]]. An [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] sent the [[Seymour Expedition]] of Japanese, Russian, British, Italian, German, French, American, and Austrian troops to relieve the siege, but they were forced to retreat by Boxer and Qing troops at the [[Battle of Langfang]]. After [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|the Alliance's attack on the Dagu Forts]], the court declared war on the Alliance and authorized the Boxers to join with imperial armies. After [[Battle of Tientsin|fierce fighting at Tientsin]], the Alliance formed the second, much larger [[Gaselee Expedition]] and [[Battle of Peking (1900)|finally reached Beijing]]; the Empress Dowager evacuated to [[Xi'an]]. The [[Boxer Protocol]] ended the war, exacting a tremendous [[Boxer Indemnity|indemnity]].

The Qing court then instituted &quot;[[New Policies]]&quot; of administrative and legal reform, including abolition of the [[imperial examinations|examination system]]. But young officials, military officers, and students debated reform, perhaps a constitutional monarchy, or the overthrow of the dynasty and the creation of a republic. They were inspired by an emerging public opinion formed by intellectuals such as [[Liang Qichao]] and the revolutionary ideas of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. A localised military uprising, the [[Wuchang Uprising]], began on 10 October 1911, in [[Wuchang]] (Today part of [[Wuhan]]), and soon spread. The Republic of China was proclaimed on 1 January 1912, ending 2,000 years of dynastic rule.

The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|provisional government of the Republic of China]] was formed in [[Nanjing|Nanking]] on 12 March 1912. Sun Yat-sen became [[President of the Republic of China]], but he turned power over to [[Yuan Shikai]], who commanded the [[New Army]]. Over the next few years, Yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies and declared himself as the emperor of [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Empire of China]] in late 1915. Yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the prospect of rebellion, he abdicated in March 1916 and died of natural causes in June.

Yuan's death in 1916 left a power vacuum; the republican government was all but shattered. This opened the way for the [[Warlord Era]], during which much of China was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders and the [[Beiyang government]]. Intellectuals, disappointed in the failure of the Republic, launched the [[New Culture Movement]].  

[[File:Beijing students protesting the Treaty of Versailles (May 4, 1919).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Beijing college students rallied during the [[May Fourth Movement]], dissatisfied with Article 156 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] for China ([[Shandong Problem]]).]]

In 1919, the [[May Fourth Movement]] began as a response to the pro-Japanese terms imposed on China by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following World War I. It quickly became a nationwide protest movement. The protests were a moral success as the cabinet fell and China refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which had awarded German holdings of [[Shandong]] to Japan. Political and intellectual ferment waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to Patricia Ebrey:
:&quot;Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Sun Yat-sen established a revolutionary base in Guangzhou and set out to unite the fragmented nation. He welcomed assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] (itself fresh from Lenin's takeover), he entered into an alliance with the fledgeling [[Communist Party of China]]. After Sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his protégés, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], seized control of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]] (KMT) and succeeded in bringing most of south and central China under its rule in the [[Northern Expedition]] (1926–1927). Having defeated the warlords in the south and central China by [[National Revolutionary Army|military force]], Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North and establish the [[Nationalist government]] in Nanking. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CPC and relentlessly chased the CPC armies in [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and its leaders out of KMT. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], the CPC forces embarked on the [[Long March]] across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at [[Yan'an]] in [[Shaanxi]] Province. During the Long March, the communists reorganized under a new leader, [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao Tse-tung).

The bitter [[Chinese Civil War]] between the Nationalists and the Communists continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year-long Japanese occupation of various parts of the country (1931–1945). The two Chinese parties nominally formed a United Front to oppose the Japanese in 1937, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), which became a part of [[World War II]]. Japanese forces committed numerous [[Japanese war crimes|war atrocities]] against the civilian population, including biological warfare (see [[Unit 731]]) and the [[Three Alls Policy]] (''Sankō Sakusen''), the three alls being: ''&quot;Kill All, Burn All and Loot All&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fairbank |first1=J.K. |last2=Goldman |first2=M. |year=2006 |title=China: A New History |edition=2nd |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=320 |isbn=978-0674018280 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBDC2cqb6I0C&amp;pg=PA320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat of Japan in 1945, the war between the Nationalist government forces and the CPC resumed, after failed attempts at reconciliation and a negotiated settlement. By 1949, the CPC had established control over most of the country. Odd Arne Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; During the civil war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, Rudolph (1994), Death by Government.&lt;/ref&gt; These included deaths from forced conscription and massacres.&lt;ref&gt;Valentino, Benjamin A. (2005). ''Final solutions: mass killing and genocide in the twentieth century''. Cornell University Press.  p. 88 {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Nationalist government forces were defeated by CPC forces in mainland China in 1949, the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan with its forces, along with Chiang and a large number of their supporters; the Nationalist government had taken effective control of Taiwan at the end of WWII as part of the overall Japanese surrender, when Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China troops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwandocuments.org/ghq.htm Surrender Order of the Imperial General Headquarters of Japan], 2 September 1945, &quot;(a) The senior Japanese commanders and all ground, sea, air, and auxiliary forces within China (excluding Manchuria), [[Formosa]], and [[French Indochina]] north of 16 degrees north latitude shall surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 1970s, the ROC was recognized as the [[China and the United Nations|sole legitimate government of China]] by the [[United Nations]], the [[United States]] and most Western nations, refusing to recognize the PRC on account of the Cold War. This changed in 1971 when the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|PRC was seated in the United Nations]], replacing the ROC. The KMT ruled Taiwan under martial law until 1987, with the stated goal of being vigilant against Communist infiltration and preparing to retake mainland China. Therefore, political dissent was not tolerated during that period.

In the 1990s, the ROC underwent a major democratic reform, beginning with the 1991 resignation of the members of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and [[National Assembly]] elected in 1947. These groups were originally created to represent mainland China constituencies. Also lifted were the restrictions on the use of Taiwanese languages in the broadcast media and in schools. This culminated with the first direct [[1996 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 1996 against the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) candidate and former dissident, Peng Min-ming. In 2000, the KMT status as the ruling party ended when the DPP took power, only to regain its status in the [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|2008 election]] by [[Ma Ying-jeou]].

Due to the controversial nature of the [[Political status of Taiwan|Taiwan's political status]], the ROC is currently recognized by [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|14 UN member states and Holy See]] as of {{currentyear}} as the legitimate government of &quot;China&quot;.

Major combat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) pulling out of the mainland, with the government relocating to [[Taipei]] and maintaining control only over a few islands. The [[Communist Party of China]] was left in control of [[mainland China]]. On 1 October 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;[http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/mao490921.htm The Chinese people have stood up].

The PRC was shaped by a [[List of campaigns of the Communist Party of China|series of campaigns]] and [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|five-year plans]]. The economic and social plan known as the [[Great Leap Forward]] caused an estimated 45&amp;nbsp;million deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akbar2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title= Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years'|accessdate=30 October 2010 |newspaper=The Independent|location=London|first=Arifa|last=Akbar|date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's government carried out mass executions of landowners, instituted [[collectivisation]] and implemented the [[Laogai]] camp system. Execution, deaths from forced labor and other atrocities resulted in millions of deaths under Mao. In 1966 Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which continued until Mao's death a decade later. The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [[Soviet Union]], led to a major upheaval in Chinese society.

In 1972, at the peak of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met US president [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing to establish relations with the United States. In the same year, the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|PRC was admitted to the United Nations]] in place of the Republic of China, with permanent membership of the Security Council.

[[File:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|alt=Blue Sky White Sun Wholly Red Earth|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The flag of the People's Republic of China since 1949.]]
A power struggle followed Mao's death in 1976. The [[Gang of Four]] were arrested and blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, marking the end of a turbulent political era in China. [[Deng Xiaoping]] outmaneuvered Mao's anointed successor chairman [[Hua Guofeng]], and gradually emerged as the ''de facto'' leader over the next few years.

Deng Xiaoping was the [[Paramount Leader]] of China from 1978 to 1992, although he never became the head of the party or state, and his influence within the Party led the country to [[Chinese economic reform|significant economic reforms]]. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [[People's commune|communes]] were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. In addition, there were many free market areas opened. The most successful free market areas was Shenzhen. It is located in Guangdong and the property tax free area still exists today. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_e&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Hart-Landsberg | first=Martin | last2=Burkett | first2=Paul | url=https://archive.org/details/chinasocialismma00mart | title=China and Socialism: Market Reforms and Class Struggle | publisher=Monthly Review Press | isbn=978-1-58367-123-8 | date=2010 | accessdate=30 October 2008 | url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;[[market socialism]]&quot;, and officially by the Communist Party of China as &quot;[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot;. The PRC adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on 4 December 1982.

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Tianasquare.jpg|thumb|Left|''[[Tank man]]'' temporarily stops the advance of a column of tanks on 5 June 1989, in Beijing]] --&gt;
In 1989 the death of former general secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] of that year, during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. However, they were eventually put down on 4 June when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, with [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests#Death toll|many fatalities]]. This event was widely reported, and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_f&quot;&gt;Youngs, R.

CPC general secretary and PRC President [[Jiang Zemin]] and PRC Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of Shanghai, led post-Tiananmen PRC in the 1990s. Under Jiang and Zhu's ten years of administration, the PRC's economic performance pulled an estimated 150&amp;nbsp;million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_h&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm | title = Nation bucks trend of global poverty | date=11 July 2003 | newspaper=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_i&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://english.people.com.cn/english/200003/01/eng20000301X115.html | title = China's Average Economic Growth in 90s Ranked 1st in World | date= 1 March 2000 | newspaper = People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country formally joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001. By 1997 and 1999, former European colonies of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] became [[special administrative regions of China]].

Although the PRC needs economic growth to spur its development, the government began to worry that rapid economic growth was degrading the country's resources and environment. Another concern is that certain sectors of society are not sufficiently benefiting from the PRC's economic development; one example of this is the wide gap between urban and rural areas. As a result, under former CPC general secretary and President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]], the PRC initiated policies to address issues of equitable distribution of resources, but the outcome was not known {{As of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_j&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4913622.stm | title = China worried over pace of growth | publisher=BBC | accessdate=16 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40&amp;nbsp;million farmers were displaced from their land,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_k&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3166_0_3_0 | title = China: Migrants, Students, Taiwan | journal = Migration News | date=January 2006 | volume=13 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually for economic development, contributing to 87,000 demonstrations and riots across China in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_l&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/27/AR2006012701588.html |title = In Face of Rural Unrest, China Rolls Out Reforms | newspaper = The Washington Post | date=28 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the PRC's population, living standards improved very substantially and freedom increased, but political controls remained tight and rural areas poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas | first=Antony | url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html | title=''Frontline'': ''The Tank Man'' transcript | accessdate=12 July 2008 |date=11 April 2006 |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;
