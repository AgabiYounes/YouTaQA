'''Dolphin''' is a common name of [[aquatic mammal]]s within the infraorder [[Cetacea]]. The term dolphin usually refers to the extant families [[Delphinidae]] (the oceanic dolphins), [[Platanistidae]] (the Indian [[river dolphin]]s), [[Iniidae]] (the New World river dolphins), and [[Pontoporiidae]] (the [[brackish]] dolphins), and the extinct [[Lipotidae]] (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.

Dolphins range in size from the {{convert|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|50|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|9.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|MT|ST|abbr=on}} [[killer whale]]. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]], in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as [[Pinniped|seal]]s, some dolphins can travel at {{convert|55.5|kph|mph|abbr=on}}. Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the [[right whale dolphin]], prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.

Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as [[dolphin drive hunting]]. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from [[bycatch]], habitat loss, and [[marine pollution]]. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series [[Free Willy (film series)|''Free Willy'']]. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. The most common dolphin species in captivity is the [[bottlenose dolphin]], while there are around 60 [[captive killer whales]].

==Etymology==
The name is originally from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δελφίς}} (''delphís''), &quot;dolphin&quot;,&lt;ref name=Liddel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddelfi%2Fs|title=δελφίς |first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|work=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was related to the Greek {{lang|grc|δελφύς}} (''delphus''), &quot;womb&quot;.&lt;ref name=Liddel/&gt; The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning &quot;a 'fish' with a womb&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term 'dolphin' can be used to refer to, under the [[parvorder]] [[Odontoceti]], all the species in the family [[Delphinidae]] (oceanic dolphins) and the river dolphin families [[Iniidae]] (South American river dolphins), Pontoporiidae ([[La Plata dolphin]]), [[Lipotidae]] (Yangtze river dolphin) and [[Platanistidae]] (Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aquatic Life of the World|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=p5IiaOb5XxgC|page=652}}|accessdate=July 23, 2013|date=November 1, 2000|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7170-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2007&quot;/&gt;

Dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the [[artiodactyl]] [[order (biology)|order]] (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the ''[[Indohyus]]'', an extinct [[chevrotain]]-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.&lt;ref name=science_news&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071220220241.htm |title=Whales Descended From Tiny Deer-like Ancestors |accessdate=December 21, 2007 |author=Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy |website=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestors_Tale&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wojUDAAAQBAJ}}|date=September 6, 2016|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-52512-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeoceti]] is a parvorder comprising ancient whales. These ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales, stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/cetacea/cetacean.html |title=Introduction to Cetacea: Archaeocetes: The Oldest Whales |publisher=University of Berkeley |accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]]|first1=J.

==Anatomy==

[[File:Dolphin Anatomy.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The anatomy of a dolphin showing its skeleton, major organs, tail and body shape]]
Dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack external ear flaps. Dolphins range in size from the {{convert|1.7|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|kg|lbs}} [[Maui's dolphin]] to the {{convert|9.5|m|ft}} and {{convert|10|MT|ST}} [[killer whale]]. Overall, however, they tend to be dwarfed by other [[Cetartiodactyl]]s. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cetus.ucsd.edu/SIO133/PDF/Sexual%20Dimorphism.pdf |title=Sexual Dimorphism |author1=Katherine Ralls |author2=Sarah Mesnick |pages=1005–1011 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cetacean anatomy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACS-Cetacean-Curriculum.pdf |title=Cetacean Curriculum&amp;nbsp;– A teacher's guide to introducing and using whales, dolphins, &amp; porpoises in the classroom |date=November 28, 2004 |publisher=American Cetacean Society |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |quote=Sound production in cetaceans is a complex phenomenon not fully understood by scientists. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807092419/http://acsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACS-Cetacean-Curriculum.pdf |archive-date=August 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to [[porpoise]]s' spade-shaped teeth. These conical teeth are used to catch swift prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cetacean anatomy&quot;/&gt;

Breathing involves expelling stale air from their [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], in an upward blast, which may be visible in cold air, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cetacean anatomy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scholander |first=Per Fredrik |title=Experimental investigations on the respiratory function in diving mammals and birds |year=1940 | journal=Hvalraadets Skrifter | volume=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All dolphins have a thick layer of [[blubber]], thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cetacean anatomy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolphins&quot;/&gt;

Dolphins have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. They have [[Fundic stomach|fundic]] and [[Pyloric stomach|pyloric]] chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stevens, C. Edward |author2=Hume, Ian D. |title=Comparative Physiology of the Vertebrate Digestive System |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=317 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolphins' reproductive organs are located inside the body, with genital slits on the ventral (belly) side. Males have two slits, one concealing the [[penis]] and one further behind for the [[anus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PerrinWursig2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=William F.

Dolphins have two pectoral flippers, containing four digits, a boneless [[dorsal fin]] for stability, and a tail fin for propulsion. Although dolphins do not possess external hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals which typically cruise at {{convert|9|–|28|kph|mph}}; the killer whale (orca), in comparison, can travel at speeds up to {{convert|55.5|kph|mph}}. The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yellowmagpie.com/beluga-whale/ |title=Beluga Whale: The White Melon-headed Creature Of The Cold |publisher=Yellowmagpie.com |date=June 27, 2012 |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |title=About Whales |publisher=Whalesalive.org.au |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812000655/http://whalesalive.org.au/aboutwhales.html |archive-date=August 12, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[River dolphin]]s, however, have non-fused neck vertebrae and are able to turn their head up to 90°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://acsonline.org/fact-sheets/boto-amazon-river-dolphin/|title=Boto (Amazon river dolphin) ''Inia geoffrensis''|journal=American Cetacean Society|year=2002|accessdate=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering.

Some dolphins are adapted for diving to great depths. In addition to their streamlined bodies, some can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen. Some can also re-route blood from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart, brain and other organs.

The dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. In humans, the [[middle ear]] works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] and the [[cochlea]]r fluid's high impedance. In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nummela, Sirpa |title=Sound transmission in archaic and modern whales: Anatomical adaptations for underwater hearing |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=290 |issue=6 |pages=716–733 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ar.20528 |last2=[[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]]|first2=J.G.M |last3=Bajpai |first3=Sunil |last4=Hussain |first4=Taseer |last5=Kumar |first5=Kishor |pmid=17516434|url=http://repository.ias.ac.in/4651/1/321.pdf }}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 29, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a [[melon (cetacean)|melon]].

The dolphin eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mass, Alla M. |author2=Supin, Alexander Y.

They also have glands on the eyelids and [[corneal epithelium|outer corneal layer]] that act as protection for the cornea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolphin senses&quot;/&gt;

The [[olfactory lobes]] are absent in dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolphin senses&quot;/&gt;

Dolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolphin senses&quot;/&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Dolphins gesture language.jpg|thumb|A pod of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in the [[Red Sea]]]]
{{See also|Cetacean surfacing behaviour}}
Dolphins are often regarded as one of Earth's most intelligent animals. Comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. Furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. Compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. See [[cetacean intelligence]] for more details.

===Socialization===
[[File:Dolphinsurfresize.jpg|thumb|Dolphins surfing at [[Snapper Rocks]], [[Queensland]], Australia]]
Dolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a ''superpod''; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. Dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations. Dolphins also use [[nonverbal communication]] by means of touch and [[Posture (psychology)|posturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dolphin Mysteries: Unlocking the Secrets of Communication|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gXV0lUeOV4C|page=83}}|accessdate=March 16, 2014|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-12112-4|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans (and possibly other [[primate]] species). In May 2005, a discovery in Australia found [[Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops aduncus'') teaching their young to use tools. They cover their [[snout]]s with [[sea sponge|sponges]] to protect them while foraging. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters, unlike [[simian]] primates, where knowledge is generally passed on to both sexes. Using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dolphins engage in acts of aggression towards each other. The older a male dolphin is, the more likely his body is to be covered with bite scars. Male dolphins can get into disputes over companions and females. Acts of aggression can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile after losing a fight.

Male bottlenose dolphins have been known to engage in [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]]. Dolphins have also been known to kill [[porpoises]] for reasons which are not fully understood, as porpoises generally do not share the same diet as dolphins and are therefore not competitors for food supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Feeding===
Various methods of feeding exist among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. Orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;FactsDiet&quot;&gt;[http://www.whalefacts.org/dolphins-diet/ Dolphin's diet] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927175656/http://www.whalefacts.org/dolphins-diet/ |date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different breeds of dolphins vary widely in the number of teeth they possess. The orca or killer whale usually carries 40-56 teeth while the popular bottlenose dolphin has anywhere from 72-116 conical teeth and its smaller cousin the common dolphin has 188-268 teeth so that the number of teeth each breed carries varies widely between individuals. Hybrids between common and bottlenose bred in captivity had an intermediate amount of teeth.

One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a [[bait ball]]. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish.&lt;ref name=FactsDiet /&gt; Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily.&lt;ref name=FactsDiet /&gt; Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Vocalization===
[[File:Dolphin1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Spectrogram]] of dolphin vocalizations. Whistles, whines, and clicks are visible as upside down V's, horizontal striations, and vertical lines, respectively.]]

Dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: [[frequency modulated]] whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Viegas |first= Jennifer |title = Dolphins Talk Like Humans |work = Discovery News |year = 2011 |url = http://news.discovery.com/animals/dolphin-talk-communication-humans-110906.html |accessdate = September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the [[Whale sound|loudest sounds made by marine animals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Au2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Au|first=Whitlow W.L.|title=The Sonar of Dolphins|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NEXTBwAAQBAJ}}|date=December 6, 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-4356-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23410137 |title=Dolphins 'call each other by name' |date=July 22, 2013 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janik|first=Vincent|author2=Laela Sayigh|title=Communication in bottlenose dolphins: 50 years of signature whistle research|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology|date=May 7, 2013|volume=199|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1007/s00359-013-0817-7|pmid=23649908}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 30, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. This consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/marinemammalacoustics.html |title=Marine Mammal vocalizations: language or behavior? |date=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2013/08/06/dolphins-keep-lifelong-social-memories-longest-non-human-species |title=Dolphins keep lifelong social memories, longest in a non-human species |date=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. The research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;Emily T. Griffiths (2009). &quot;[http://www.seawatchfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Griffiths2009_SBCDwhistle-repertoire.pdf Whistle repertoire analysis of the short beaked Common Dolphin, ''Delphinus delphis'', from the Celtic Deep and the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean]&quot;, Master's Thesis, School of Ocean Sciences

Because dolphins are generally associated in groups, communication is necessary. Signal masking is when other similar sounds (conspecific sounds) interfere with the original acoustic sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quick|first=Nicola|author2=Vincent Janik|title=Whistle Rates of Wild Bottlenose Dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus''): Influences of Group Size and Behavior|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|year=2008|volume=122|issue=3|pages=305–311|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.122.3.305|pmid=18729659}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 27, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. Dolphins tend to travel in pods, upon which there are groups of dolphins that range from a few to many. Although they are traveling in these pods, the dolphins do not necessarily swim right next to each other. Rather, they swim within the same general vicinity. In order to prevent losing one of their pod members, there are higher whistle rates. Because their group members were spread out, this was done in order to continue traveling together.

===Jumping and playing===

[[Brain size]] was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. [[Allometric]] analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/allometry/allometry.html |title=Allometry |first=Jim |last=Moore| publisher=University of California San Diego |accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an [[encephalization quotient]] that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. [[Killer whale]]s have the second largest brain mass of any animal on earth, next to the [[sperm whale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-03-06/news/os-seaworld-killer-whale-brains-20100302_1_killer-whales-orcas-dolphin-or-porpoise|title=How smart are they?|journal=Orlando Sentinel|date=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[brain to body mass ratio]] in some is second only to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/are-whales-smarter-than-we-are/ |author=Fields, R.

[[Self-awareness]] is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. Self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like [[metacognition|meta-cognitive reasoning]] (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/4272-elephant-awareness-mirrors-humans.html | title=Elephant Self-Awareness Mirrors Humans |publisher=Live Science |date=October 30, 2006 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the [[mirror test]] in which a mirror is introduced to an animal, and the animal is then marked with a temporary dye. If the animal then goes to the mirror in order to view the mark, it has exhibited strong evidence of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror test&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/brainy-dolphins-pass-the-human-mirror-test.html |title=Mirror test |author=Derr, Mark |work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some disagree with these findings, arguing that the results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the [[Clever Hans]] effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror test&quot;/&gt;

In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marten|first1=Ken|last2=Psarakos|first2=Suchi|title=Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|number=2|date=June 1995|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1026|pages=205–224|pmid=8521259}}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror test&quot;/&gt;

Generally, dolphins sleep with only one brain [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]] in [[slow-wave sleep]] at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats.

In captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli.

Dolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries such as [[shark]] bites although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. The [[healing]] process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to [[hemorrhage]] to death.

[[Dolphin safe label]]s attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. The earliest campaigns with &quot;dolphin safe&quot; labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. The dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Time of Truth For US Dolphin Safe Logos |url=http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719 |website=atuna |accessdate=August 29, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015221118/http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=12719 |archivedate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]], and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium]]s. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.

Dolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry.

In [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], dolphins were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the [[Minoans]], judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at [[Knossos]]. During the 2009 excavations of a major [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] city at [[Iklaina]], a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. Dolphins are common in [[Greek mythology]], and many coins from [[ancient Greece]] have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dougsmith.ancients.info/feac50tar.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208015112/http://dougsmith.ancients.info/feac50tar.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |title=Taras |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyers2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Eyers|first=Jonathan|title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=b0fM9aimdooC}}|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4081-3213-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both ancient and later art, [[Cupid]] is often shown [[Cupid#Cupid and dolphins|riding a dolphin]]. A dolphin rescued the poet [[Arion]] from drowning and carried him safe to land, at [[Cape Matapan]], a promontory forming the southernmost point of the [[Peloponnesus]]. There was a temple to [[Poseidon]] and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] I.23; [[Thucydides]] I.128, 133; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] iii.25, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks reimagined the [[Phoenicia]]n god [[Melqart]] as Melikertês ([[Melicertes]]) and made him the son of [[Athamas]] and [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]]. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became [[Leucothea]]. (''cf'' [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]].) At Corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of Poseidon that the [[Isthmian Games]], originally instituted in Poseidon's honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of [[Melicertes]]. [[Phalanthus of Tarentum|Phalanthus]] was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].

[[Dionysus]] was once captured by [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[pirate]]s who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and [[shapeshifting|transformed]] them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both [[Aphrodite]] and [[Apollo]].

When heraldry developed in the [[Middle Ages]], not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the stylised dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with [[fish scale]]s.

Dolphins are present in the [[coat of arms of Anguilla]] and the [[coat of arms of Romania]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hentea2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hentea|first=Călin|title=Brief Romanian Military History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=lwcWDFZWuJgC}}|year=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5820-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[coat of arms of Barbados]] has a dolphin [[supporter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination|last=Ali|first=Arif|year=1996|page=16|isbn=978-1-870518-54-3|publisher=Hansib Publications|location=Hertford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ali1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ali|first=Arif|title=Barbados: Just Beyond Your Imagination|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0k8sAQAAMAAJ|page=16}}|year=1996|page=16|publisher=Hansib|isbn=978-1-870518-54-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known historical example of a dolphin in heraldry, was the arms for the former province of the [[Dauphiné]] in southern France, from which were derived the arms and the title of the [[Dauphin of France]], the heir to the former throne of France (the title literally means &quot;The Dolphin of France&quot;).

&quot;Dolfin&quot; was the name of an aristocratic family in the maritime [[Republic of Venice]], whose most prominent member was the 13th Century [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Giovanni Dolfin]].

In [[Hindu mythology]] the [[Ganges river dolphin]] is associated with [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ganga]], the deity of the [[Ganges]] river. The dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens and her mount, the [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|Makara]], is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Vijay |title=The River Goddess|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VKEKAAAACAAJ}}|year=1997|publisher=Creative Education|isbn=978-0-88682-825-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Boto]], a species of [[river dolphin]] that resides in the [[Amazon River]], are believed to be shapeshifters, or ''[[Encantado (mythology)|encantado]]s'', who are capable of having children with human women.

There are comparatively few surviving myths of dolphins in [[Polynesia]]n cultures, in spite of their maritime traditions and relevance of other marine animals such as [[sharks]] and [[seabirds]]; unlike these, they are more often perceived as food than as totemic symbols. Dolphins are most clearly represented in [[Rapa Nui]] [[Rongorongo]], and in the traditions of the [[Caroline Islands]] they are depicted similarly to the Boto, being sexually active shapeshifters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cressey |first1=Jason |title=Making a Splash in the Pacific: Dolphin and Whale Myths and Legends of Oceania |url=http://islandheritage.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/RNJ_12_3_Cressey.pdf |website=islandheritage.org |publisher=The POD-People, Oceans, Dolphins (Vancouver, Canada) |accessdate=October 19, 2018 |date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Species====
[[File:Sea World1.jpg|thumb|SeaWorld show featuring bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales]]

The renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]] around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. Criticism and [[animal welfare]] laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the United States, the best known are the [[SeaWorld]] [[marine mammal park]]s.
In the Middle East the best known are [[Dolphin Bay]] at [[Atlantis, The Palm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atlantisthepalm.com/marine-water-park/dolphin-bay|author=Atlantis: The Palm, Dubai|title=Swim With the Dolphins in Dubai|work=atlantisthepalm.com|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dubai Dolphinarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaidolphinarium.ae/|author=Dubai Dolphinarium|title=The Dubai Dolphinarium|work= dubaidolphinarium.ae|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Long-finned Pilot Whale (8793172995).jpg|thumb|SeaWorld San Diego pilot whale with trainers]]
Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as [[SeaWorld]], commonly known as a [[dolphinarium]]. [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic spotted dolphin|spotted dolphins]], [[false killer whale]]s and [[common dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's dolphin]]s, as well as [[rough-toothed dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten [[pilot whale]]s, [[Amazon river dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[spinner dolphin]]s, or [[tucuxi]] in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/marine_mammals/case_against_marine_captivity.pdf|first1=Naoimi|last1=Rose|first2=E.C.M.|last2=Parsons|first3=Richard|last3=Farinato |title=The Case Against Marine Mammals in Captivity|edition=4|publisher=Humane Society of the United States|pages=13, 42, 43, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual and very rare [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphin, known as a [[wolphin]], is kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a [[false killer whale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|author=[[Sean B. Carroll]] |title=Remarkable creatures |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/science/14creatures.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[killer whale]]s kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with 60 [[List of captive orcas|captive killer whales]] being held in aquaria {{As of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcastat.htm| title=Orcas in Captivity – A look at killer whales in aquariums and parks |date=November 23, 2009|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The killer whale's [[animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolphins&quot; /&gt;

Organizations such as the [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] rescue and [[Wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitate]] sick, wounded, stranded or orphaned dolphins while others, such as the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] and [[Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society]], work on dolphin conservation and welfare. [[India]] has declared the dolphin as its national aquatic animal in an attempt to protect the [[endangered species|endangered]] [[Ganges river dolphin]]. The [[Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary]] has been created in the [[Ganges]] river for the protection of the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=8|title=National Aquatic Animal|author=india.gov|work=india.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009-Seaworld-Shamu.jpg|thumb|Shamu the killer whale, 2009, with a collapsed dorsal fin]]

There is debate over the welfare of cetaceans in captivity, and often welfare can vary greatly dependent on the levels of care being provided at a particular facility. In the United States, facilities are regularly inspected by federal agencies to ensure that a high standard of welfare is maintained.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Additionally, facilities can apply to become accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which (for accreditation) requires &quot;the highest standards of animal care and welfare in the world&quot; to be achieved. Facilities such as SeaWorld and the Georgia Aquarium are accredited by the AZA. Organizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s, although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas, Corky II and Lolita, are in their mid-40s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rose, N.

Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior. Wild killer whales may travel up to {{convert|160|km|mi|-1}} in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.&lt;ref name=cbs2010&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/01/national/main6255297.shtml|title=Whale Attack Renews Captive Animal Debate|publisher=CBS News|date=March 1, 2010|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of [[stress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Susan J.|last2=Botzler|first2=Richard G.|title=The Animal Ethics Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tBuHDQAAQBAJ}}|date=November 18, 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-42196-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While dolphin attacks occur far less frequently than attacks by other sea animals, such as [[shark attack|sharks]], some scientists are worried about the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. Dr. Andrew J. Read, a biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishingnj.org&quot;/&gt;

Several scientists who have researched dolphin behaviour have proposed that dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins should be seen as [[non-human person]]s who should have their own specific rights and that it is [[morality|morally]] unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch.&lt;ref name=&quot;White2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Thomas I.|title=In Defense of Dolphins: The New Moral Frontier|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tGunrZU6AyEC}}|date=May 18, 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-46969-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dolphinmovie.com/background.pdf |title= Scientists say dolphins should be treated as 'non- human persons' |last1=Leake |first1= Jonathan |last2= Brooks |first2= Helen |date= January 3, 2010 |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |via= dolphinmovie.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160410080701/http://www.dolphinmovie.com/background.pdf | archive-date =April 10, 2016 | access-date =January 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four countries – [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Hungary]], and [[India]] – have declared dolphins to be &quot;non-human persons&quot; and have banned the capture and import of live dolphins for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Land, Graham (July 29, 2013).

A military dolphin is a dolphin trained for military uses. A number of militaries have employed dolphins for various purposes from finding mines to rescuing lost or trapped humans. The [[military dolphins|military use of dolphins]], however, drew scrutiny during the Vietnam War when rumors circulated that the [[United States Navy]] was training dolphins to kill Vietnamese divers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dolphins are still being trained by the United States Navy for other tasks as part of the [[U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program]]. The Russian military is believed to have closed its marine mammal program in the early 1990s. In 2000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the [[Soviet Navy]] had been sold to [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Dolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat is located in a layer of [[blubber]] between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as ''[[sashimi]]'', garnished with onion and either [[horseradish]] or grated garlic, much as with ''sashimi'' of [[whale meat|whale]] or [[horse meat]] (''basashi''). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a ''[[miso]]'' sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to [[beef liver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:イルカの味噌根菜煮 |language=Japanese|trans-title= Dolphin in Miso Vegetable Stew |url= http://cookpad.com/recipe/1073593 |work= Cookpad |year=2010 |accessdate= May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health concerns====

There have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; There are no known cases of [[mercury poisoning]] as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/2003/06/tp0605-1.html|title=平成１５年６月３日に公表した「水銀を含有する魚介類等の 摂食に関する注意事項」について|authors= |work=Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the [[Faroe Islands]], where [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] exposure to [[methylmercury]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] deficits amongst children.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|author= [[World Health Organization]] / [[United Nations Environment Programme]] DTIE Chemicals Branch |year= 2008 |title= Guidance for identifying populations at risk from mercury exposure|page= 36 |url= http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/chem/mercuryexposure.pdf |accessdate= August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotes|width=30%|align=left|quote=The [[Faroe Islands]] population was exposed to [[methylmercury]] largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. However, the Faroe Islands populations also eat significant numbers of fish. The study of about 900 Faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7 years of age|source=[[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;}}
