'''Dia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/Faq|title=Dia Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is [[free and open source software|free and open source]] general-purpose diagramming software, developed originally by Alexander Larsson. Dia uses a controlled [[single document interface]] (SDI) similar to [[GIMP]] and [[Inkscape]].

== Features ==
Dia has a modular design with several shape packages available for different needs: [[flowchart]], [[Computer network diagram|network diagram]]s, [[circuit diagram]]s, and more. It does not restrict symbols and connectors from various categories from being placed together.

Dia has special objects to help draw [[entity-relationship model]]s (obsoleted [http://tedia2sql.tigris.org/ tedia2sql] or newer [https://metacpan.org/module/Parse::Dia::SQL parsediasql] can be used to create the SQL DDL), [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) diagrams, [[flowchart]]s, network diagrams, and simple electrical circuits. It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] files, using a subset of [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) to draw the shape.

Dia loads and saves diagrams in a custom XML format which is, by default, [[gzip]]ped to save space. It can print large diagrams spanning multiple pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.openhub.net/p/dia/links |title=Dia |work=ohloh |publisher=Geeknet, Inc. |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be scripted using the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].

== Exports ==
Dia can export diagrams to various formats including the following:
* [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] (Encapsulated PostScript)
* [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics)
* [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]] (Autocad's Drawing Interchange format)
* [[Computer Graphics Metafile|CGM]] (Computer Graphics Metafile defined by [[ISO standard]]s){{which|date=December 2019}}
* [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] (Windows Meta File)
* [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] (Portable Network Graphics)
* [[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
* [[VDX (file format)|VDX]] (Microsoft's XML for [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] Drawing)

== Development ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Dia was originally created by Alexander Larsson but he moved on to work on [[GNOME]] and other projects. James Henstridge then took over as the lead developer, but he also moved on to other projects. He was followed by Cyrille Chepelov and Lars Ræder Clausen in turn.

Dia is maintained by a group of developers: Hans Breuer, Steffen Macke&lt;!-- windows --&gt;, and Sameer Sahasrabuddhe.

Dia is written in C, and has an extension system, which also supports writing extensions in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
