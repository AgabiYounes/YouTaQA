'''Danny Kaye''' (born '''David Daniel Kaminsky'''; {{Lang-yi|דאַװיד דאַניעל קאַמינסקי}}; January 18, 1911 – March 3, 1987) was an American actor, singer, dancer, comedian, musician, and philanthropist. His performances featured [[physical comedy]], idiosyncratic [[pantomime]]s, and rapid-fire [[novelty song]]s.

Kaye starred in 17 movies, notably ''[[Wonder Man (film)|Wonder Man]]'' (1945), ''[[The Kid from Brooklyn]]'' (1946), ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947), ''[[The Inspector General (1949 film)|The Inspector General]]'' (1949), ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'' (1952), ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954), and ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956).

His films were popular, especially for his performances of [[patter song]]s and favorites such as &quot;[[Inchworm (song)|Inchworm]]&quot; and &quot;The Ugly Duckling.&quot; He was the first ambassador-at-large of [[UNICEF]] in 1954 and received the French [[Legion of Honour]] in 1986 for his years of work with the organization.&lt;ref name=Honor&gt;{{cite news|title=French Honor Danny Kaye|date=February 26, 1986|newspaper=[[The Modesto Bee]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
David Daniel Kaminsky was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, on January 18, 1911 (though he would later say 1913),&lt;ref name=&quot;DK Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Dena|last=Kaye|title=Interview|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|date=January 18, 2013|postscript=.

He was the youngest of three sons. His parents and their older sons Larry and Mac, left [[Dnipropetrovsk]] two years before Danny's birth; he was their only son born in the United States.&lt;ref name=Clowns&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=danny+kaye+cooking#v=onepage&amp;q=danny%20kaye&amp;f=false|title=The Great Clowns of American Television|editor-last=Adir|editor-first=Karen|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2001|page=270|isbn=0-7864-1303-4|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended Public School 149 in [[East New York, Brooklyn]]; the school eventually was renamed to honor him&lt;ref name=School&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome P.S. 149 Danny Kaye| url=http://schools.nyc.gov/schoolportals/19/k149/default.htm|publisher=New York City Dept of Education|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—where he began entertaining his classmates with songs and jokes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kO5VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dOEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7184,629748&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=World-renowned comedian dies|date=March 4, 1987|newspaper=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in Brooklyn, but he did not graduate.&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;

His mother died when he was in his early teens. Not long after, Kaye and his friend Louis ran away to Florida. Kaye sang while Louis played the guitar and the pair eked out a living for a while. When Kaye returned to New York, his father did not pressure him to return to school or work, giving his son the chance to mature and discover his own abilities.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Kaye said that as a young boy, he had wanted to be a surgeon, but the family could not afford a medical  education.&lt;ref name= Clowns/&gt;&lt;ref name= Wife&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Danny Kaye Proves a Genius|last=Battelle|first=Phyllis|date=May 8, 1959|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He held a succession of jobs after leaving school, as a [[soda jerk]], auto insurance investigator, and office clerk. Most ended with his being fired. He lost the insurance job when he made an error that cost the insurance company $40,000 ($600,000 in 2019 adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dannykaye.net/02061949.html|title=Danny Kaye {{!}} Transcript |date=February 6, 1949|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dentist who hired him to look after his office over lunch and run errands also fired him when he found Kaye using his dental [[Dental drill|drill]] on the office woodwork. In 1939, Kaye met the dentist's daughter [[Sylvia Fine]], at an audition and in 1940 they eloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://officialdannykaye.com/bio|title=Bio – Danny Kaye|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clowns&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,776720-1,00.html|title=Git Gat Gittle|date=March 11, 1946|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned his trade in his teenage years in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] as a [[tummler]] in the [[Borscht Belt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

Kaye's first break came in 1933 when he joined the Three [[wikt:terpsichorean|Terpsichoreans]], a vaudeville dance act. They opened in [[Utica, New York]], where he used the [[stage name]] Danny Kaye for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; The act toured the United States, then performed in Asia with the show ''La Vie Paree''.&lt;ref name=Dena/&gt;

The troupe left for a six-month tour of Asia on February 8, 1934. While in Osaka, Japan, a [[typhoon]] hit the city. The hotel where they stayed suffered heavy damage. The strong wind hurled a piece of the hotel's [[cornice]] into Kaye's room; had he been hit, he might have been killed. By evening's performance time, the city was in the grip of the storm. With no power, the audience became restless and nervous. To calm them, Kaye went on stage holding a flashlight to illuminate his face and sang every song he could recall as loudly as he was able.&lt;ref name=Clowns/&gt;

The experience of trying to entertain an audiences who did not speak English inspired him to the [[pantomime]] gestures, songs, and facial expressions that eventually made his reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Sometimes, he found them necessary when ordering a meal. Kaye's daughter, Dena, relates a story her father told about being in a restaurant in China and trying to order chicken. Kaye flapped his arms and clucked, giving the waiter an imitation of a chicken. The waiter nodded in understanding, bringing Kaye two eggs. His interest in cooking began on the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dena&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OwBKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LB4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2332,3334403&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Life With My Zany Father – Danny Kaye|last=Kaye|first=Dena|date=January 19, 1969|newspaper=[[Tri City Herald]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs were in short supply when Kaye returned to the United States, and he struggled for bookings. One job was working in a burlesque revue with [[fan dance]]r [[Sally Rand]]. After the dancer dropped a fan while trying to chase away a fly, Kaye was hired to watch the fans so they were always held in front of her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

==Career==
Danny Kaye made his film debut in a 1935 comedy short ''Moon Over Manhattan''. In 1937, he signed with New York–based [[Educational Pictures]] for a series of two-reel comedies. He usually played a manic, dark-haired, fast-talking Russian in these low-budget shorts, opposite young hopefuls [[June Allyson]] and [[Imogene Coca]]. The Kaye series ended abruptly when the studio shut down in 1938. He was working in the Catskills in 1937 under the name Danny Kolbin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/images/vc53ap1.jpg|title=&quot;Highlights and Shadows&quot;-front of program|date=July 4, 1937|publisher=The President Players|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/bobhope/images/vc53ap2.jpg|title=&quot;Highlights and Shadows&quot; – inside of program|date=July 4, 1937|publisher=The President Players|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next venture was a short-lived Broadway show with Sylvia Fine as the pianist, lyricist, and composer. The ''Straw Hat Revue'' opened on September 29, 1939, and closed after 10 weeks, but critics took notice of Kaye's work.&lt;ref name=Clowns/&gt;&lt;ref name=TV&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T9paAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uWwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5291,8225005&amp;dq=sylvia+fine&amp;hl=en|title=Who Is Sylvia?|date=October 30, 1960|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews brought an offer for both Kaye and his bride Sylvia to work at [[La Martinique]], a New York City nightclub. Kaye performed with Sylvia as his accompanist. At La Martinique, playwright [[Moss Hart]] saw Danny perform, and that led to Hart's casting him in his hit Broadway comedy ''[[Lady in the Dark]]''.&lt;ref name=Clowns/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Kaye scored a triumph at age 30 in 1941 playing Russell Paxton in ''Lady in the Dark'', starring [[Gertrude Lawrence]]. His show-stopping number was &quot;[[Tchaikovsky (song)|Tchaikovsky]]&quot; by [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] in which he sang the names of a string of Russian composers at breakneck speed, seemingly without taking a breath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= King&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rkIqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_E4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3849,3453774&amp;dq=sylvia+fine+dena&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye: King of Comedy|last=Remington|first=Fred|date=January 12, 1964|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next Broadway season, he was the star of a show about a young man who is drafted called ''[[Let's Face It!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X7EtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ppgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4949,1337710&amp;dq=eve+arden+danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye as Musical Draftee Brightens the Broadway Scene|last=Edel|first=Leon|date=November 8, 1941|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His feature-film debut was in producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s [[Technicolor]] 1944 comedy ''Up in Arms'', a remake of Goldwyn's [[Eddie Cantor]] comedy ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]]'' (1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aX8uAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IJkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5349,3577434&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Makes Successful Debut in 'Up in Arms'|date=May 20, 1944|last=Whittaker|first=Herbert|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rival producer [[Robert M. Savini]] cashed in by compiling three of Kaye's Educational Pictures shorts into a patchwork feature entitled ''The Birth of a Star'' (1945). Studio mogul Goldwyn wanted Kaye's prominent nose fixed to look less Jewish,&lt;ref name=Kanfer&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanfer|first=Stefan|title=A summer world: the attempt to build a Jewish Eden in the Catskills from the days of the ghetto to the rise and decline of the Borscht Belt|year=1989|publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0374271800|page=157|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaye site&quot;/&gt; Kaye refused, but he did allow his red hair to be dyed blond, apparently because it looked better in Technicolor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaye site&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Nolan|first=J.

Kaye starred in a radio program, ''[[The Danny Kaye Show (radio program)|The Danny Kaye Show]]'', on CBS in 1945–46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Helen and Danny: O-Kaye! Crowd Howls|date=February 2, 1946|author=Foley, Roy L.|newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program's popularity rose quickly.

Kaye starred in several movies with actress [[Virginia Mayo]] in the 1940s and is known for films such as ''[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]'' (1947), ''[[The Inspector General (1949 film)|The Inspector General]]'' (1949), ''[[On the Riviera]]'' (1951) co-starring [[Gene Tierney]], ''[[Knock on Wood (1954 film)|Knock on Wood]]'' (1954), ''[[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]]'' (1954), ''[[The Court Jester]]'' (1956), and ''[[Merry Andrew (film)|Merry Andrew]]'' (1958). Kaye starred in two pictures based on biographies, ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'' (1952) the Danish storyteller and ''[[The Five Pennies]]'' (1959) about jazz pioneer [[Red Nichols]]. His wife, writer/lyricist Sylvia Fine, wrote many tongue-twisting songs for which Kaye became famous.&lt;ref name=Wife/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fine/&gt; She was also an associate film producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AH4tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8pgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5142,2228369&amp;dq=sylvia+fine&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Film Set At Warner's|author=Brady, Thomas F.|date=November 13, 1947|newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Kaye's films included the theme of doubles, two people who look identical (both Danny Kaye) being mistaken for each other to comic effect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://loc.gov/exhibits/danny-kaye-and-sylvia-fine/danny-kaye-in-film.html|title=Danny Kaye in Film – Danny Kaye and Sylvia Fine: Two Kids from Brooklyn|date=2013-02-14|website=loc.gov {{!}} Exhibitions – Library of Congress|access-date=2019-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}[[Image:Danny Kaye ww2 45.jpg|thumb|right|Danny Kaye on USO tour at Sasebo, Japan, October 25, 1945. Kaye and his friend, Dodgers manager Leo Durocher, made the trip.&lt;ref name=Airwaves/&gt;]] While his wife wrote most of Kaye's material, he created much of it himself, often while performing. Kaye had one character he never shared with the public; Kaplan, the owner of an [[Akron, Ohio]], rubber company, came to life only for family and friends. His wife, Sylvia, described the Kaplan character:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4T01AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FGUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7384,576802&amp;dq=sylvia+fine&amp;hl=en|title=It Happened Last Night|last=Wilson|first=Earl|date=July 4, 1959|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He doesn't have any first name. Even his wife calls him just Kaplan. He's an illiterate, pompous character who advertises his philanthropies. Jack Benny or Dore Schary might say, &quot;Kaplan, why do you hate unions so?&quot; If Danny feels like doing Kaplan that night, he might be off on Kaplan for two hours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When he appeared at the [[London Palladium]] in 1948, he &quot;roused the Royal family to laughter and was the first of many performers who have turned British variety into an American preserve.&quot; ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine described his reception as &quot;worshipful hysteria&quot; and noted that the royal family, for the first time, left the [[royal box]] to watch from the front row of the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ci41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_KULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2305,591697&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Kaye: everyone's favourite|author=Young, Andrew|date= March 4, 1987|newspaper=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TtQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QGoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1357,1943058&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Won't Talk of Royalty|author=Januzzi, Gene|date=October 23, 1949|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s-orAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XmcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1385,2017653&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Is a Real Showoff|author=Handsaker, Gene|date=October 11, 1948|newspaper=[[Kentucky New Era]]|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He related that he had no idea of the familial connections when the [[David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven|Marquess of Milford Haven]] introduced himself after a show and said he would like his cousins to see Kaye perform.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Kaye stated he never returned to the venue because there was no way to recreate the magic of that time.&lt;ref name=London&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1996/12/10/1996-12-10_the_many_lives_of_danny_kaye.html|title=The Many Lives of Danny Kaye|author=Bianculli, David|date=December 10, 1996|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=March 10, 2011}} {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaye had an invitation to return to London for a ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'' in November of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1940s/1948|title=Royal Variety Performance|year=1948|publisher=Entertainment Artistes Benenevolent Fund|accessdate=January 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209133256/http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1940s/1948|archivedate=February 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the invitation arrived, Kaye was busy with ''The Inspector General'' (which had a working title of ''Happy Times''). [[Warner Bros.]] stopped the film to allow their star to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=824rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kJkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4316,3809280&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Royal Invitation for Danny Kaye|date=October 20, 1948|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his Decca co-workers [[the Andrews Sisters]] began their engagement at the London Palladium on the heels of Kaye's successful 1948 appearance there, the trio was well received and [[David Lewin]] of the ''Daily Express'' declared: &quot;The audience gave the Andrews Sisters the Danny Kaye roar!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

He hosted the [[24th Academy Awards]] in 1952. The program was broadcast on radio. Telecasts of the Oscar ceremony came later. During the 1950s, Kaye visited Australia, where he played [[Buttons (pantomime)|Buttons]] in a production of ''[[Cinderella]]'' in Sydney. In 1953, Kaye started a production company, Dena Pictures, named for his daughter. ''Knock on Wood'' was the first film produced by his firm.

He hosted a ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]'' from 1963 to 1967; it won four [[Emmy awards]] and a [[Peabody award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Excelled&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Danny Kaye always excelled as an entertainer and in life|last=Drew|first=Mike|date=March 4, 1987|work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mateas.com/DannyKaye/TV1963Season.htm|title=The Danny Kaye Episode Guide|publisher=Mateas Media Consulting|accessdate=February 2, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029160104/http://www.mateas.com/DannyKaye/TV1963Season.htm|archivedate=October 29, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last cinematic starring role came in 1963's ''[[The Man from the Diners' Club]]''.

Beginning in 1964, he acted as television host to the CBS telecasts of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Kaye did a stint as a ''[[What's My Line?]]'' mystery guest on the Sunday-night CBS-TV quiz program. Kaye was later a guest panelist on that show. He also appeared on the interview program ''[[Here's Hollywood]]''. In the 1970s, Kaye tore a ligament in his leg during the run of the [[Richard Rodgers]] musical ''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]]'', but went on with the show, appearing with his leg in a cast and cavorting on stage in a wheelchair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Excelled&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u64tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iKAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2126,4385316&amp;dq=eve+arden+danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Real people go to matinees and Danny Kaye loves 'em|last=Raidy|first=William A.|date=February 17, 1971|work=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had done much the same on his television show in 1964, when his right leg and foot were burned from a cooking accident. Camera shots were planned so television viewers did not see Kaye in his wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sgBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-uIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3155,3543465&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Accident Confines Danny Kaye to Chair|last=Lowry |first= Cynthia|date=April 17, 1964|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, he played [[Mister Geppetto]] in a television musical adaptation of ''[[Pinocchio (1976 TV musical)|Pinocchio]]'' with [[Sandy Duncan]] in the title role. Kaye portrayed Captain Hook opposite Mia Farrow in a [[Peter Pan (1976 musical)|musical version of ''Peter Pan'']] featuring songs by [[Anthony Newley]] and [[Leslie Bricusse]]. He later guest-starred in episodes of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[The Cosby Show]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette&quot;/&gt; and in the 1980s revival  ''[[The Twilight Zone|New Twilight Zone]]''.

In many films, as well as on stage, Kaye proved to be an able actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. He showed his serious side as ambassador for [[UNICEF]] and in his dramatic role in the memorable TV film ''[[Skokie (film)|Skokie]]'', when he played a [[Holocaust]] survivor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Excelled&quot;/&gt; Before his death in 1987, Kaye conducted an orchestra during a comical series of concerts organized for UNICEF fundraising. Kaye received two [[Academy Awards]]: an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1955 and [[the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] in 1982. That year he received the [[Screen Actors Guild]] Annual Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot;/&gt;

In 1980, Kaye hosted and sang in the 25th anniversary of [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] celebration and hosted the opening celebration for [[Epcot]] in 1982 (EPCOT Center at the time). Both were aired on primetime television in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dizavenue.com/2015/03/disney-documentary-hour-disneylands.html|title=Disney Avenue: Disney Documentary Hour: Disneyland's 25th Anniversary|website=www.dizavenue.com|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisdayindisneyhistory.com/EpcotGrandOpening.html|title=EPCOT Grand Opening|website=www.thisdayindisneyhistory.com|access-date=2018-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career in music===
Kaye was enamored of music. While he claimed an inability to read music, he was said to have [[perfect pitch]]. A flamboyant performer with his own distinctive style, &quot;easily adapting from outrageous novelty songs to tender ballads&quot; (according to critic Jason Ankeny), in 1945, Kaye began hosting his own CBS radio program, launching a number of hit songs including &quot;Dinah&quot; and &quot;[[Minnie the Moocher]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/danny-kaye-mn0000029750/biography|title=Danny Kaye biography at|website=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Kaye teamed with the popular Andrews Sisters (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) on Decca Records, producing the number-three ''Billboard ''hit &quot;Civilization (Bongo, Bongo, Bongo)&quot;. The success of the pairing prompted both acts to record through 1950, producing rhythmically comical fare as &quot;[[Woody Woodpecker#&quot;The Woody Woodpecker Song&quot;|The Woody Woodpecker Song]]&quot; (based on the bird from the [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons and a ''Billboard'' hit for the quartet), &quot;Put 'em in a Box, Tie 'em with a Ribbon (And Throw 'em in the Deep Blue Sea)&quot;, &quot;The Big Brass Band from Brazil&quot;, &quot;It's a Quiet Town (In Crossbone County)&quot;, &quot;Amelia Cordelia McHugh (Mc Who?)&quot;, &quot;Ching-a-ra-sa-sa&quot;, and a duet by Danny and Patty Andrews of &quot;[[Orange Colored Sky]]&quot;. The acts teamed for two yuletide favorites: a frantic, harmonic rendition of &quot;A Merry Christmas at Grandmother's House (Over the River and Through the Woods)&quot; and a duet by Danny and Patty, &quot;[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Sforza, John: ''Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story''. University Press of Kentucky, 2000. {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaye's debut album, ''Columbia Presents Danny Kaye'', had been released in 1942 by Columbia Records with songs performed to the accompaniment of [[Maurice Abravanel]] and [[Johnny Green]]. The album was reissued as a Columbia LP in 1949 and is described by the critic Bruce Eder as &quot;a bit tamer than some of the stuff that Kaye hit with later in the '40s and in the '50s and, for reasons best understood by the public, doesn't attract nearly the interest of his kids' records and overt comedy routines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_1949&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/danny-kaye-mw0001447249|title=Danny Kaye 1949 album review|website=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, a Decca single, &quot;I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts&quot;, was released, his sole big U.S. chart hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; His second Columbia LP album ''Danny Kaye Entertains'' (1953, Columbia) included six songs recorded in 1941 from his Broadway musical ''Lady in the Dark'', most notably &quot;[[Tchaikovsky (song)|Tchaikovsky]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_195o&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Eder|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/danny-kaye-entertains-mw0001452035|title=Danny Kaye Entertains record review|website=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of the film ''Hans Christian Andersen'' (1952), two of its songs written by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by Kaye, &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Copenhagen&quot;, reached the top five on the UK pop charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; In 1953, Decca released ''Danny at the Palace'', a live recording made at the New York Palace Theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Danny-Kaye-Danny-At-The-Palace/master/471611|title=Danny at the Palace|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Knock On Wood'' (Decca, 1954) a set of songs from the movie of the same name sung by Kaye, accompanied by [[Victor Young]] and His Singing Strings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Danny-Kaye-Knock-On-Wood/release/5289812|title=Knock on Wood OST|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Danny Kaye-Nancy Wilson - 1965.JPG|thumb|left|Singer [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]] appearing on his show in 1965]]
In 1956, Kaye signed a three-year recording contract with [[Capitol Records]], which released his single &quot;Love Me Do&quot; in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.45cat.com/record/cl14672 Love Me Do/Ciu Ciu Bella]. Record details @ 45cat&lt;/ref&gt; The B-side, &quot;Ciu Ciu Bella&quot;, with lyrics written by Sylvia Fine, was inspired by an episode in Rome when Kaye, on a mission for UNICEF, befriended a 7-year-old [[polio]] victim in a children's hospital, who sang this song for him in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=egoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=danny+kaye+ciu+ciu+bella+billboard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i0ajqWM5o8&amp;sig=u0-R3_fJjPXOrzAAQD_AxyEaTW0&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tR_AVNSmAeXEygPMgIGoBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=danny%20kaye%20ciu%20ciu%20bella%20billboard&amp;f=false &quot;Kaye Signs 3-Year Pact With Capitol&quot;], ''Billboard Magazine'', December 15, 1956, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Saul Chaplin]] and [[Johnny Mercer]] wrote songs for ''Merry Andrew'', a film starring Kaye as a British teacher attracted to the circus. The score added up to six numbers, all sung by Kaye; conductor Billy May's 1950 composition &quot;Bozo's Circus Band&quot; (renamed &quot;Music of the Big Top Circus Band&quot;) was deposited on the second side of the ''Merry Andrew'' soundtrack, released in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/merry-andrew-original-soundtrack-mw0000417149|title=Merry Andrew soundtrack|website=Allmusic|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, another soundtrack came out, ''The Five Pennies'' (Kaye starred there as 1920s cornet player Loring Red Nichols), featuring [[Louis Armstrong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Danny-Kaye-2-Louis-Armstrong-The-Five-Pennies/master/143201|title=The Five Pennies|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and '70s, Kaye regularly conducted world-famous orchestras, although he had to learn the scores by ear.&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dannykaye.com/bio|title=Danny Kaye official biography|accessdate=2015-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaye's style, even if accompanied by unpredictable antics (he once traded the baton for a fly swatter to conduct &quot;The Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt; was praised by the likes of [[Zubin Mehta]], who once stated that Kaye &quot;has a very efficient conducting style.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyCenter&quot;/&gt; His ability with an orchestra was mentioned by [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], then conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]].

Over his career, he raised over US$5 million in support of musician pension funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyCenter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography of Danny Kaye |publisher=The Kennedy Center |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entitY_id=3748&amp;source_type=A |accessdate=March 28, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226141257/http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entitY_id=3748&amp;source_type=A |archivedate=February 26, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imitations===
Kaye was sufficiently popular to inspire imitations:
* The 1946 [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon ''[[Book Revue]]'' had a sequence with [[Daffy Duck]] wearing a blond wig and impersonating Kaye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrier|first=Michael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDJXnzMh7bkC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;lpg=463|title=Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age|year=2003|page=463|orig-year=1999|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|via=[[Google Books]]|isbn=978-0-1951-6729-0|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Satirical songwriter [[Tom Lehrer]]'s 1953 song &quot;[[Lobachevsky (song)|Lobachevsky]]&quot; was based on a number that Kaye had done, about the Russian director [[Constantin Stanislavski]], with the affected Russian accent. Lehrer mentioned Kaye in an opening monologue, citing him as an &quot;idol since childbirth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Lehrer | first=Tom | title=Lobachevsky Lyrics | work=[[Metrolyrics]] | url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/lobachevsky-lyrics-tom-lehrer.html | access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Superman]] creators [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] fashioned a short-lived superhero title, ''[[Funnyman (comics)|Funnyman]]'', taking inspiration from Kaye's persona.

===Cooking===
In his later years, Kaye entertained at home as chef. He specialized in Chinese and Italian cooking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= Rice&gt;{{cite news| url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-03-12/entertainment/8701190948_1_danny-kaye-world-class-chef-stove| title= Kaye Got Rave Reviews For A Starring Role As An Artist In The Kitchen| date= March 12, 1987| first= William| last= Rice| work= Chicago Tribune| access-date= August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a custom-made Chinese restaurant installed at the rear of his house by its alley, then had a kitchen and dining area built around it.&lt;ref name= Rice /&gt; The stove that Kaye used for his Chinese dishes was fitted with metal rings for the burners to allow the heat to be highly concentrated, and a trough with circulating ice water cooled the area to keep the intense heat tolerable for those who were cooking.&lt;ref name=Today&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/marcella-hazan-memoir-classic-italian-chef-wbna27054074 |title=Marcella Hazan: Memoir of a classic Italian chef| date= October 6, 2008 |work= [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today.com]] |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned &quot;at Johnny Kan's restaurant in San Francisco and with Cecilia Chang at her Mandarin restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles.&quot;&lt;ref name= Rice /&gt; He taught Chinese cooking classes at a San Francisco Chinese restaurant in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O2QtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y4kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2509,4246744&amp;hl=en|title=Danny Kaye Teaches Chinese Cooking|date=January 22, 1974|newspaper=[[Tri-City Herald]] |accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theater and demonstration kitchen under the library at the [[Hyde Park campus of the Culinary Institute of America|Hyde Park, New York campus]] of the [[Culinary Institute of America]] is named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cooking secrets of the CIA|editor=[[Culinary Institute of America]] |publisher= Chronicle Books |year= 1995| page=[https://archive.org/details/cookingsecretsof00culirich/page/131 131] |isbn= 0-8118-1163-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/cookingsecretsof00culirich|url-access=registration|quote=danny kaye cooking.|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaye referred to his kitchen as &quot;Ying's Thing.&quot; While filming ''The Madwoman of Chaillot'' in France, he phoned home to ask his family if they would like to eat at Ying's Thing that evening; Kaye flew home for dinner.&lt;ref name=Dena/&gt; Not all of his efforts in the kitchen went well. After flying to San Francisco for a recipe for sourdough bread, he came home and spent hours preparing loaves. When his daughter asked about the bread, Kaye hit the bread on the kitchen table; his bread was hard enough to chip it.&lt;ref name=Dena/&gt; Kaye approached kitchen work with enthusiasm, making sausages and other foods needed for his cuisine.&lt;ref name=Today/&gt;&lt;ref name=Writer/&gt; His work as a chef earned him the &quot;[[Meilleur Ouvrier de France|Les Meilleurs Ouvriers de France]]&quot; culinary award. Kaye is the only nonprofessional chef to have received this honor.&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;

===Flying===
Kaye was an aviation enthusiast and pilot. His interest was sparked by his longtime friend, choreographer Michael Kidd, who had recently earned his private pilot's license. Kaye began studying for his own pilot's license in 1959. An enthusiastic and accomplished golfer, he gave up golf in favor of flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gk4_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v1AMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3103,2142968&amp;dq=danny+kaye+plane&amp;hl=en|title=Kaye Likes Air|last=Scott|first=Vernon|date=July 14, 1962| work= [[The Windsor Star]] |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first plane Kaye owned was a [[Piper PA-23|Piper Aztec]].&lt;ref name=Fly&gt;{{cite journal| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CSEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=danny+kaye#v=onepage&amp;q=danny%20kaye&amp;f=false|title=If I Can Fly, You Can Fly|last=Kaye|first=Danny|date=January 1967|journal=[[Popular Science]] |accessdate=March 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TSgmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S_4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=990,3305946&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en| title= Danny Kaye Likes Flying, TV, Dodgers|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=September 21, 1965|work=[[Gettysburg Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaye received his first license as a private pilot of multi-engine aircraft, not being certified for operating a single-engine plane until six years later.&lt;ref name=Fly/&gt; He was an accomplished pilot, rated for airplanes ranging from single-engine light aircraft to multi-engine jets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Star&quot;/&gt; Kaye held a commercial pilot's license and had flown every type of aircraft except military planes.&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oKAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bOoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1197,1151876&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=American League's a new act for Danny Kaye |last= Smith| first= Red| work= [[The Miami News]] |date=June 12, 1976|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaye received a [[type rating]] in a [[Learjet]], and he was named vice president of the Learjet company by [[Bill Lear]] as an honorary title (he had no line responsibility at the company).&lt;ref name=&quot;Flyingmag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope|first1=Stephen|title=The Last True Learjet |url= http://www.flyingmag.com/last-true-lear-jet|website=Flying Magazine|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=20 July 2016|date=July 6, 2016|quote=Danny Kaye, by the way, never owned a Learjet, though he did receive a type rating ... his friend Bill Lear made him a vice president this was strictly an honorary and symbolic title}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported many flying projects. In 1968 he was honorary chairman of the Las Vegas International Exposition of Flight, a show that utilized many facets of the city's entertainment industry while presenting an air show. The operational show chairman was well-known aviation figure [[Lynn Garrison]]. Kaye flew a Learjet to 65 cities in five days on a mission to help UNICEF.&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Flyingmag/&gt;

===Business ventures===
In 1958 Kaye and partner Lester Smith formed Kaye–Smith Enterprises. The company owned a chain of radio stations, mostly in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Other Kaye–Smith divisions included a concert promotion company, a video production company, and a recording studio. Kaye sold his share of the company to the Smith family in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.kayesmith.com/about-us/history/| title= History of Kaye-Smith | website= KayeSmith.com| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseball===
A lifelong fan of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, Kaye recorded a song called &quot;The D-O-D-G-E-R-S Song (Oh really? No, O'Malley!),&quot; describing a fictitious encounter with the San Francisco Giants, a hit during the real-life pennant chase of 1962. That song is included on ''[[Baseball's Greatest Hits]]'' compact discs.

Working alongside UNICEF's Halloween fundraiser founder, Ward Simon Kimball Jr., the actor educated the public on impoverished children in deplorable living conditions overseas and assisted in the distribution of donated goods and funds. His involvement with UNICEF came about in an unusual way. Kaye was flying home from London in 1949 when one of the plane's four engines lost its propeller and caught fire. The problem was initially thought serious enough that it might make an ocean landing; life jackets and life rafts were made ready.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The plane was able to head back over 500 miles to land at [[Shannon Airport]], Ireland. On the way back to Shannon, the head of the Children's Fund, [[Maurice Pate]], had the seat next to Danny Kaye and spoke at length about the need for recognition for the fund. Their discussion continued on the flight from Shannon to New York; it was the beginning of the actor's long association with UNICEF.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNICEF 2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicefusa.org/partners/ambassadors/danny-kaye/danny-kaye-bio.html|title=Danny Kaye Biography|accessdate=March 23, 2014|publisher=[[UNICEF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jUIjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O2gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2884,742737&amp;dq=danny+kaye&amp;hl=en|title=Crippled Transport Limps to Safety|date=July 8, 1949|newspaper=[[The Lewiston Daily Sun]] |location=Lewiston, Maine |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/people/people_danny_kaye.html|title=Danny Kaye|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;For all of his success as a performer . . . his greatest legacy remains his tireless humanitarian work—so close were his ties to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) that when the organization received the Nobel Peace Prize, Kaye was tapped to accept it,&quot; according to music critic Jason Ankeny.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;
