'''''Drosophila''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|r|ə|ˈ|s|ɒ|f|ᵻ|l|ə|,_|d|r|ɒ|-|,_|d|r|oʊ|-}}{{refn|{{citation|last=Jones|first=Daniel|author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|orig-year=1917|year=2003|isbn=978-3-12-539683-8 }}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Drosophila}}}}) is a [[genus]] of [[fly|flies]], belonging to the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Drosophilidae]], whose members are often called &quot;small fruit flies&quot; or (less frequently) [[pomace]] flies, [[vinegar]] flies, or [[wine]] flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be confused with the [[Tephritidae]], a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as &quot;true fruit flies&quot;); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe [[fruit]], with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the [[Mediterranean fruit fly]]. 

One species of ''Drosophila'' in particular, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', has been heavily used in research in [[genetics]] and is a common [[model organism]] in [[developmental biology]]. The terms &quot;fruit fly&quot; and &quot;''Drosophila''&quot; are often used synonymously with ''D. melanogaster'' in modern biological literature. The entire genus, however, contains more than 1,500 species&lt;ref name=taxodros&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerhard Bächli|year=1999–2006|url=http://www.taxodros.uzh.ch/|title=TaxoDros: the database on taxonomy of Drosophilidae}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is very diverse in appearance, behavior, and breeding habitat.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;''Drosophila''&quot;, meaning &quot;dew-loving&quot;, is a modern scientific [[Latin]] adaptation from [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|el|δρόσος}}, ''{{lang|el|drósos}}'', &quot;[[dew]]&quot;, and {{lang|el|φίλος}}, ''{{lang|el|phílos}}'', &quot;loving&quot; with the Latin feminine suffix ''-a''.

==Morphology==
''Drosophila'' species are small flies, typically pale yellow to reddish brown to black, with red eyes. When film of lenses (eyes) are removed, the drosophila brain is revealed. ''Drosophila'' brain structure and function develop and age significantly from larval to adult stage. Developing brain structures make these flies a prime candidate for neuro-genetic research.&lt;ref name=pmid29654189&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panikker |first1=Priyalakshmi |last2=Xu |first2=Song-Jun |last3=Zhang |first3=Haolin |last4=Sarthi |first4=Jessica |last5=Beaver |first5=Mariah |last6=Sheth |first6=Avni |last7=Akhter |first7=Sunya |last8=Elefant |first8=Felice |title=Restoring Tip60 HAT/HDAC2 Balance in the Neurodegenerative Brain Relieves Epigenetic Transcriptional Repression and Reinstates Cognition |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |date=9 May 2018 |volume=38 |issue=19 |pages=4569–4583 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2840-17.2018 |pmid=29654189 |pmc=5943982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many species, including the noted Hawaiian picture-wings, have distinct black patterns on the wings. The plumose (feathery) [[arista (biology)|arista]], bristling of the head and thorax, and wing venation are characters used to diagnose the family. Most are small, about 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm long, but some, especially many of the Hawaiian species, are larger than a [[house fly]].

==Lifecycle and ecology==

===Habitat===
''Drosophila'' species are found all around the world, with more species in the tropical regions. ''Drosophila'' made their way to the Hawaiian Islands and [[Adaptive radiation|radiated]] into over 800 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/endangered/about/ep_45_2015.html|title=Endangered Species {{!}} About Us {{!}} Featured Species: Relict Leopard Frog|last=Program|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Ecological Services|website=www.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in [[deserts]], [[tropical rainforest]], [[cities]], [[swamp]]s, and [[alpine climate|alpine zones]]. Some northern species [[hibernation|hibernate]]. The northern species ''[[Drosophila montana|D. montana]]'' is the best cold-adapted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Darren J |last2=Wiberg |first2=R Axel W |last3=Trivedi |first3=Urmi |last4=Tyukmaeva |first4=Venera I |last5=Gharbi |first5=Karim |last6=Butlin |first6=Roger K |last7=Hoikkala |first7=Anneli |last8=Kankare |first8=Maaria |last9=Ritchie |first9=Michael G |last10=Gonzalez |first10=Josefa |title=Inter and Intraspecific Genomic Divergence in Drosophila montana Shows Evidence for Cold Adaptation |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |date=August 2018 |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=2086–2101 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evy147 |pmid=30010752 |pmc=6107330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is primarily found at high altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jarkko |last1=Routtu |year=2007 |url=https://rmbl.org/modules/Downloads/Publications/Routtu_phd_2007.pdf |title=Genetic and Phenotypic Divergence in ''Drosophila virilis'' and ''D. montana'' |location=Jyväskylä |publisher=University of Jyväskylä |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most species breed in various kinds of decaying plant and [[fungus|fungal]] material, including [[fruit]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[slime flux]]es, [[flower]]s, and [[mushroom]]s. The larvae of at least one species, ''[[Drosophila suzukii|D. suzukii]]'', can also feed in fresh fruit and can sometimes be a pest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cisr.ucr.edu/spotted_wing_drosophila_cherry_vinegar_fly.html|author=Mark Hoddle|accessdate=July 29, 2010|title=Spotted Wing Drosophila (Cherry Vinegar Fly) ''Drosophila suzukii''|publisher=[[Center for Invasive Species Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few species have switched to being [[parasitism|parasites]] or [[predator]]s. Many species can be attracted to baits of fermented [[banana]]s or mushrooms, but others are not attracted to any kind of baits. Males may congregate at patches of suitable breeding substrate to compete for the females, or form [[Lek (animal behaviour)|leks]], conducting courtship in an area separate from breeding sites.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

Several ''Drosophila'' species, including ''[[Drosophila melanogaster|D. melanogaster]]'', ''[[Drosophila immigrans|D. immigrans]]'', and ''[[Drosophila simulans|D. simulans]]'', are closely associated with humans, and are often referred to as [[Domestication|domestic]] species.

===Reproduction===
Males of this genus are known to have the longest [[spermatozoon|sperm cells]] of any studied organism on Earth, including one species, ''[[Drosophila bifurca]]'', that has sperm cells that are {{convert|58|mm|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitnick&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pitnick |first1=Scott |last2=Spicer |first2=Greg S. |last3=Markow |first3=Therese A. |authorlink3=Therese Ann Markow|title=How long is a giant sperm? |journal=Nature |date=May 1995 |volume=375 |issue=6527 |pages=109 |doi=10.1038/375109a0 |pmid=7753164 |bibcode=1995Natur.375Q.109P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cells are mostly tail, and are delivered to the females in tangled coils. The other members of the genus ''Drosophila'' also make relatively few giant sperm cells, with that of ''D. bifurca'' being the longest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joly-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joly |first1=Dominique |last2=Luck |first2=Nathalie |last3=Dejonghe |first3=Béatrice |title=Adaptation to long sperm inDrosophila: correlated development of the sperm roller and sperm packaging |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution |date=15 March 2008 |volume=310B |issue=2 |pages=167–178 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21167 |pmid=17377954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''D. melanogaster'' sperm cells are a more modest 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm long, although this is still about 35 times longer than a human sperm. Several species in the ''D. melanogaster'' species group are known to mate by [[traumatic insemination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kamimura&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamimura|first=Yoshitaka|date=2007-08-22|title=Twin intromittent organs of Drosophila for traumatic insemination |journal=Biol. Lett.|volume=3|issue=4|pages=401–404|pmid=17519186|pmc=2391172 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drosophila'' species vary widely in their reproductive capacity. Those such as ''D. melanogaster'' that breed in large, relatively rare resources have [[ovaries]] that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, so that they can be laid together on one site. Others that breed in more-abundant but less nutritious substrates, such as leaves, may only lay one egg per day. The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the anterior end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on the vegetable matter itself, but on the [[yeast]]s and [[microorganism]]s present on the decaying breeding substrate. Development time varies widely between species (between 7 and more than 60 days) and depends on the environmental factors such as [[temperature]], breeding substrate, and crowding. 

Fruit flies lay eggs in response to environmental cycles. Eggs laid at a time (e.g., night) during which likelihood of survival is greater than in eggs laid at other times (e.g., day) yield more larvae than eggs that were laid at those times. ''Ceterus paribus'', the habit of laying eggs at this 'advantageous' time would yield more surviving offspring, and more grandchildren, than the habit of laying eggs during other times. This differential reproductive success would cause ''D. melanogaster'' to adapt to environmental cycles, because this behavior has a major reproductive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Howlader |first1=Gitanjali |last2=Sharma |first2=Vijay Kumar |title=Circadian regulation of egg-laying behavior in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |date=August 2006 |volume=52 |issue=8 |pages=779–785 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.05.001 |pmid=16781727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their median lifespan is 35–45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Broughton |first1=S. J. |last2=Piper |first2=M. D. W. |last3=Ikeya |first3=T. |last4=Bass |first4=T.

=== Mating systems ===

==== Courtship behavior ====

The following section is based on the following ''Drosophila'' species: ''Drosophila simulans'', and ''Drosophila melanogaster''.
 
Courtship behavior of male ''Drosophila'' is an attractive behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pan |first1=Y. |last2=Robinett |first2=C. C. |last3=Baker |first3=B.

These luring songs are sinusoidal in nature and varies within and between species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crossly&quot; /&gt;

The courtship behavior of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' has also been assessed for sex-related genes, which have been implicated in courtship behavior in both the male and female.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pan&quot; /&gt; Recent experiments explore the role of fruitless (''fru'') and doublesex (''dsx''), a group of sex-behaviour linked genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Certel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Certel |first1=S.

====Polyandry====

The following section is based on the following ''Drosophila'' species: ''[[Drosophila serrata]]'', ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'', ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', and ''[[Drosophila neotestacea]]''. [[Polyandry]] is a prominent mating system among ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref name=&quot; Frentiu and Chenoweth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frentiu |first1=F. D. |last2=Chenoweth |first2=S.

Pre-copulatory strategies are the behaviours associated with mate choice and the genetic contributions, such as production of gametes, that are exhibited by both male and female ''Drosophila'' regarding mate choice.&lt;ref name=&quot; Frentiu and Chenoweth &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Puurtinen and Fromhage &quot; /&gt; Post copulatory strategies include sperm competition, mating frequency, and sex-ratio meiotic drive.&lt;ref name=&quot; Frentiu and Chenoweth &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Puurtinen and Fromhage &quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Herrera et al.&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Pinzone and Dyer.&quot; /&gt; 

These lists are not inclusive. [[Polyandry]] among the ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' in North America vary in their number of mating partners.&lt;ref name=&quot; Herrera et al.&quot; /&gt;  There is a connection between the number of time females choose to mate and chromosomal variants of the third chromosome.&lt;ref name=&quot; Herrera et al.&quot; /&gt; It is believed that the presence of the inverted [[Chromosomal polymorphism|polymorphism]] is why re-mating by females occurs.&lt;ref name=&quot; Herrera et al.&quot; /&gt; The stability of these polymorphisms may be related to the sex-ratio meiotic drive.&lt;ref name=&quot; Pinzone and Dyer.&quot;/&gt;

However, for ''[[Drosophila subobscura]],'' the main mating system is monandry, not normally seen in ''Drosophila.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holman |first1=Luke |last2=Freckleton |first2=Robert P. |last3=Snook |first3=Rhonda R. |title=What use is an infertile sperm?

===Laboratory-cultured animals===
''D. melanogaster'' is a popular experimental animal because it is easily cultured en masse out of the wild, has a short generation time, and mutant animals are readily obtainable. In 1906, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] began his work on ''D. melanogaster'' and reported his first finding of a [[White (mutation)|white eyed mutant]] in 1910 to the academic community. He was in search of a model organism to study genetic heredity and required a species that could randomly acquire genetic mutation that would visibly manifest as morphological changes in the adult animal. His work on ''Drosophila'' earned him the 1933 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine for identifying [[chromosome]]s as the vector of inheritance for genes. This and other ''Drosophila'' species are widely used in studies of [[genetics]], [[Drosophila embryogenesis|embryogenesis]], [[Drosophila circadian rhythm|chronobiology]], [[speciation]], [[neurobiology]], and other areas.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

However, some species of ''Drosophila'' are difficult to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. For some, it can be done with particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as [[sterols]] that are found in the natural host; for others, it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal ''Drosophila'' lab medium, but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often simply a matter of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

The [[Drosophila Species Stock Center]] located at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], New York, maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The National Drosophila Species Stock Center |url=http://blogs.cornell.edu/drosophila/ |publisher=College of Agriculture and Life Science, Cornell University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in Genetic Research ===
''Drosophila'' is considered one of the most impeccable genetic model organisms, they have furthered genetic research unlike any other model organisms. ''Drosophila'' is a prime candidate for genetic research because the relationship between human and fruit fly genes is very close. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/why-use-the-fly-in-research |title = Why use the fly in research?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human and fruit fly genes are so similar, that disease-producing genes in humans can be linked to those in flies. The fly has approximately 15,500 genes on its four chromosomes, whereas humans have about 22,000 genes among their 23 chromosomes. Thus the density of genes per chromosome in ''Drosophila'' is higher than the human genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://modencode.sciencemag.org/drosophila/introduction | title=ModENCODE &amp;#124; Drosophila as a model organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low and manageable number of chromosomes make ''Drosophila'' species easier to study. These flies also carry genetic information and pass down traits throughout generations, much like their human counterparts. The traits can then be studied through different ''Drosophila'' lineages and the findings can be applied to deduce genetic trends in humans. Research conducted on ''Drosophila'' help determine the ground rules for transmission of genes in many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jennings |first1=Barbara H. |title=Drosophila – a versatile model in biology &amp; medicine |journal=Materials Today |date=May 2011 |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=190–195 |doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(11)70113-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29654189/&gt;

===Microbiome===
Like other metazoans, ''Drosophila'' is associated with various bacteria in its gut. The fly gut microbiota or microbiome seems to have a central influence on ''Drosophila'' fitness and life history characteristics. The [[Microbiome in the Drosophila gut|microbiota in the gut of ''Drosophila'']] represents an active current research field.

''Drosophila'' species also harbour vertically transmitted endosymbionts such as ''[[Wolbachia]]'' and ''[[Spiroplasma]]''. These endosymbionts can act as reproductive manipulators, such as [[cytoplasmic incompatibility]] induced by ''Wolbachia'' or male-killing induced by the ''D. melanogaster Spiroplasma poulsonii'' (named MSRO). The male-killing factor of the ''D. melanogaster'' MSRO strain was discovered in 2018, solving a decades-old mystery of the cause of male-killing. This represents the first bacterial factor that affects eukaryotic cells in a sex-specific fashion, and is the first mechanism identified for male-killing phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Papageorgiou |first1=Nik |title=Mystery solved: The bacterial protein that kills male fruit flies |url=https://actu.epfl.ch/news/mystery-solved-the-bacterial-protein-that-kills--3/ |date=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, they may protect theirs hosts from infection. ''Drosophila Wolbachia'' can reduce viral loads upon infection, and is explored as a mechanism of controlling viral diseases (''e.g.'' Dengue fever) by transferring these ''Wolbachia'' to disease-vector mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wolbachia |url=http://www.eliminatedengue.com/our-research/wolbachia |website=World Mosquito Program }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''S. poulsonii'' strain of ''[[Drosophila neotestacea]]'' protects its host from parasitic wasps and nematodes using toxins that preferentially attack the parasites instead of the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haselkorn |first1=Tamara S. |last2=Jaenike |first2=John |title=Macroevolutionary persistence of heritable endosymbionts: acquisition, retention and expression of adaptive phenotypes in |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=July 2015 |volume=24 |issue=14 |pages=3752–3765 |doi=10.1111/mec.13261 |pmid=26053523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Phineas T. |last2=Peng |first2=Fangni |last3=Boulanger |first3=Martin J. |last4=Perlman |first4=Steve J. |title=A ribosome-inactivating protein in a defensive symbiont |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=12 January 2016 |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=350–355 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1518648113 |pmid=26712000 |pmc=4720295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ballinger |first1=Matthew J. |last2=Perlman |first2=Steve J. |last3=Hurst |first3=Greg |title=Generality of toxins in defensive symbiosis: Ribosome-inactivating proteins and defense against parasitic wasps in Drosophila |journal=PLOS Pathogens |date=6 July 2017 |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=e1006431 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006431 |pmid=28683136 |pmc=5500355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predators===
''Drosophila'' species are prey for many generalist predators such as [[Asilidae|robber flies]]. In [[Hawaii]], the introduction of [[Vespula|yellowjackets]] from the mainland United States has led to the decline of many of the large species. The larvae are preyed on by other fly larvae, [[Staphylinidae|staphylinid]] [[beetle]]s, and [[ant]]s.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

(S.) melanogaster]]''; around 330 species). 

The Hawaiian species of ''Drosophila'' (estimated to be more than 500, with roughly 380 species described) are sometimes recognized as a separate genus or subgenus, ''Idiomyia'',&lt;ref name=taxodros/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Irina |last1=Brake |first2=Gerhard |last2=Bächli |year=2008 |title=Drosophilidae (Diptera) |series=World Catalogue of Insects |isbn=978-87-88757-88-0 }}{{pn|date=November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not widely accepted. About 250 species are part of the genus ''Scaptomyza'', which arose from the Hawaiian ''Drosophila'' and later recolonized continental areas.

==''Drosophila'' species genome project==
''Drosophila'' species are extensively used as model organisms in genetics (including population genetics), cell biology, biochemistry, and especially developmental biology. Therefore, extensive efforts are made to sequence drosphilid genomes. The genomes of these species have been fully sequenced:&lt;ref name=&quot;LBL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/index.html|title=12 ''Drosophila'' Genomes Project|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|accessdate=July 29, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141042/http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/index.html|archivedate=May 27, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data have been used for many purposes, including evolutionary genome comparisons. ''D. simulans'' and ''D. sechellia'' are sister species, and provide viable offspring when crossed, while ''D. melanogaster'' and ''D. simulans'' produce infertile [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring. The ''Drosophila'' genome is often compared with the genomes of more distantly related species such as the [[honeybee]] ''[[Western honeybee|Apis mellifera]]'' or the [[mosquito]] ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''.

The modEncode consortium is currently sequencing eight more ''Drosophila'' genomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/modENCODE_ComparativeGenomics_WhitePaper.pdf|title=modEncode Comparative Genomics white paper|publisher=[[ENCODE]]|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even more genomes are being sequenced by the [[i5K]] consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/i5K_nominations|title=i5k species nomination summary|accessdate=December 13, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215030402/http://www.arthropodgenomes.org/wiki/i5K_nominations|archivedate=December 15, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
