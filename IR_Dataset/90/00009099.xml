'''Rex David Thomas''' (July 2, 1932 &amp;ndash; January 8, 2002) was an American businessman and philanthropist. Thomas was the founder and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Wendy's]], a [[fast-food restaurant]] chain specializing in [[hamburger]]s.&lt;ref name=wfrel&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4nUnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LIMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6587%2C5867889 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |last=Moore |first=Carrie |title=Wendy's founder relies on old-fashioned quality |date=May 31, 1983 |page=6B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chtrobt&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LrIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ePIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6831%2C5629903 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=''(Chicago Tribune)'' |last=Sachdev |first=Ameet |title=Wendy's founder Thomas dies at 69 |date=January 9, 2002 |page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for appearing in more than 800 commercial advertisements for the chain from 1989 to 2002,&lt;ref name=repaap&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uvYtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I6IFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1280%2C3862993 |work=Reading Eagle |location=(Pennsylvania) |agency=Associated Press |title=Dave Thomas dies at 69; founded Wendy's chain |date=January 9, 2002 |page=B4}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than any other company founder in television history.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wendys.com/dave/davethomas_biography.pdf |title=Dave Thomas Biography |publisher=[[Wendy's|Wendy's International]] |accessdate=2007-06-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628165205/http://www.wendys.com/dave/davethomas_biography.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born&lt;!-- on July 2, 1932--&gt; in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], to a young unmarried woman he never knew, Thomas was adopted at six weeks by Rex and Auleva Thomas,&lt;ref name=&quot;15 Celebs Who Were adopted&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.womansday.com/Articles/Life/15-Celebs-Who-Were-Adopted.html | title=15 Celebs Who Were Adopted | publisher=WomansDay.com | date=May 5, 2010 | accessdate=November 12, 2011 | author=Gekas, Alexandra | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126124108/http://www.womansday.com/Articles/Life/15-Celebs-Who-Were-Adopted.html | archivedate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as an adult became a well-known advocate for [[adoption]], founding the [[Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption]]. After his adoptive mother's death when he was 5, his father moved around the country seeking work. Thomas spent some of his early childhood near [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]], with his grandmother, Minnie Sinclair, whom he credited with teaching him the importance of service and treating others well and with respect, lessons that helped him in his future business life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, R. David (1992). ''Dave's Way''. Berkeley Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-425-13501-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At 12, Thomas had his first job at Regas Restaurant, a fine dining restaurant in downtown [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], then lost it in a dispute with his boss; decades later, Regas Restaurant installed a large autographed poster-photo of Thomas just inside their entrance until the business closed down December 31, 2010. He vowed never to lose another job. Moving with his father, by 15 he was working in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], at the Hobby House Restaurant owned by the Clauss family. When his father prepared to move again, Thomas decided to stay in Fort Wayne, dropping out of high school to work full-time at the restaurant. Thomas, who considered ending his schooling the greatest mistake of his life, did not graduate from high school until 1993, when he obtained a [[General Educational Development|GED]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/01/08/thomas_020108.html|title=Wendy's founder Dave Thomas dead at 69|date=January 8, 2002 |publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010

He subsequently became an education advocate and founded the Dave Thomas Education Center in [[Coconut Creek, Florida]], which offers GED classes to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/wendys-founder-dave-thomas-was-a-high-school-dropout-2013-6 |title=The Founder Of Wendy's Got His GED Because He Didn't Want To Be A Dropout Success Story |last=Giang |first=Vivian |date=June 25, 2013 |website=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/b/104288341123124394353/104288341123124394353/about/ |title=Dave Thomas East Education Center GED ENGLISH CLASSES - Google |date= |accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===U.S. Army===
At the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in 1950, rather than waiting for [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]], he volunteered for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] at age 18 to have some choice in assignments. Having food production and service experience, Thomas requested the [[Quartermaster Center and School|Cook's and Baker's School]] at [[Fort Benning|Fort Benning, Georgia]]. He was sent to [[West Germany]] as a mess sergeant and was responsible for the daily meals of 2,000 soldiers, rising to the rank of [[Staff sergeant#U.S. Army|staff sergeant]]. After his discharge in 1953, Thomas returned to Fort Wayne and the Hobby House.

===Fast food career===
====Kentucky Fried Chicken====
In the mid-1950s, [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] founder [[Colonel Sanders|Col. Harland Sanders]] came to Fort Wayne to find restaurateurs with established businesses in order to try to sell KFC franchises to them. At first, Thomas, who was the head cook at a restaurant, and the Clauss family declined Sanders's offer, but Sanders persisted, and the Clauss family franchised their restaurant with KFC and later also owned many other KFC franchises in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. During this time, Thomas worked with Sanders on many projects to make KFC more profitable and to give it brand recognition. Among other things Thomas suggested to Sanders, that were implemented, was that KFC reduce the number of items on the menu and focus on a signature dish. Thomas also suggested Sanders make commercials that he appear in. Thomas was sent by the Clauss family in the mid-1960s to help turn around four failing KFC stores they owned in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/dave-thomas-of-kentucky-fried-chicken-wendys-1350962|title=How Dave Thomas Built KFC and Wendy's|last=Daszkowski|first=Don|website=The Balance Small Business|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968 Thomas had increased sales in the four [[fried chicken restaurant]]s so much that he sold his share in them back to Sanders for more than $1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-02290.html |title=Thomas, Dave |author=Dennis Wepman |website=[[American National Biography]] |access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience would prove invaluable to Thomas when he began Wendy's about a year later.

====Arthur Treacher's====
After serving as a regional director for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Thomas became part of the investor group which founded [[Arthur Treacher's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/business/dave-thomas-69-wendy-s-founder-dies.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Dave Thomas, 69, Wendy's Founder, Dies | date=January 9, 2002 | first1=Douglas | last1=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His involvement with the new restaurant lasted less than a year before he went on to found Wendy's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-24/features/9102180579_1_real-hamburger-square-patties-kentucky-fried-chicken | work=Sun-Sentinel | title= Wendy's Dad Short-order Cook Dave Thomas Set Out To Build A Better Burger. He Ended Up Founding The Wendy's Chain And Cooking Up A Fast-food Fortune. | date=November 24, 1991 | first1=Lane| last1=Kelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wendy's====
Thomas opened his first Wendy's in [[Columbus, Ohio]], November 15, 1969. This original restaurant remained operational until March 2, 2007, when it was closed due to lagging sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2007/03/03/hundreds_bid_farewell_to_1st_wendys/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Hundreds bid farewell to 1st Wendy's | date=March 3, 2007 | first1=Andrew | last1=Welsh-Huggins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas named the restaurant after his eight-year-old daughter [[Wendy Thomas|Melinda Lou]], whose nickname was &quot;Wendy&quot;, stemming from the child's inability to say her own name at a young age. According to ''Bio TV'', Dave claims that people nicknamed his daughter &quot;Wenda. Not Wendy, but Wenda. 'I'm going to call it Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BIOCNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dave Thomas: Made to Order|series=Biography on CNBC|season=1|number=8|airdate=2009-12-17|network=CNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death in 2002, Thomas admitted regret for naming the franchise after his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.today.com/food/wendy-s-founder-dave-thomas-regretted-using-his-daughter-s-t167624|title=Why Wendyâ€™s founder regretted naming restaurant after his daughter|website=TODAY.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Thomas resigned from his day-to-day operations at Wendy's. However, by 1985, several company business decisions, including an awkward new breakfast menu and loss in brand awareness due to fizzled marketing efforts, caused the company's new president to urge Thomas back into a more active role with Wendy's. Thomas began to visit franchises and espouse his hardworking, so-called &quot;mop-bucket attitude&quot;. In 1989, he took on a significant role as the TV spokesperson in a series of commercials for the brand. Thomas was not a natural actor, and initially, his performances were criticized as stiff and ineffective by advertising critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Foltz, Kim, ''The Media Business: Advertising; At Wendy's, Folksiness Is Effective'', The New York Times, August 22, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, after efforts by Wendy's advertising agency, Backer Spielvolgel Bates, to get humor into the campaign, a decision was made to portray Thomas in a more self-deprecating and folksy manner, which proved much more popular with test audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, Kim, ''The Media Business: Advertising; At Wendy's, Folksiness Is Effective'', August 22, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer brand awareness of Wendy's eventually regained levels it had not achieved since octogenarian [[Clara Peller]]'s wildly popular &quot;[[Where's the beef?]]&quot; campaign of 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

With his natural self-effacing style and his relaxed manner, Thomas quickly became a household name. A company survey during the 1990s, a decade during which Thomas starred in every Wendy's commercial that aired, found that 90% of Americans knew who Thomas was. After more than 800 commercials,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; it was clear that Thomas played a major role in Wendy's status as the third most popular burger restaurant in the U.S.

In 1994, Thomas made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in ''[[Bionic Ever After?]]'', a reunion TV movie based upon ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and ''[[The Bionic Woman]]''.

==Personal life==
Dave Thomas was married for 47 years to Lorraine. She is the mother of their five children. In addition to Melinda they had three more daughters, Pam, Lori, and Molly, and a son, Kenny. Though Kenny died in 2013, Dave's daughters still continue to own and run multiple Wendy's locations.  Thomas founded the chain Sisters Chicken and Biscuits in 1978, named in reference to his other three  daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Start Byline--&gt;&lt;!--End Byline--&gt; |url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/08/companies/wendys_obit/ |title=Wendy's founder Dave Thomas dead at 100Jan. 8, 2002 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2002-01-08 |accessdate=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Thomas had been afflicted with a [[carcinoid]] [[neuroendocrine tumor]] for ten years, before it metastasized to his liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/26/health/cases-rare-tumor-is-deceptive-and-deadly.html|title=CASES; Rare Tumor Is Deceptive And Deadly|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 26, 2002|first=Eric|last=Taub|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on January 8, 2002 at his house in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]] at the age of 69. Thomas was buried in Union Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. At the time of his death, there were more than 6,000 Wendy's restaurants operating in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/business/dave-thomas-69-wendy-s-founder-dies.html|title=Dave Thomas, 69, Wendy's Founder, Dies|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2002-01-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and memberships==
In 1979, Thomas received the [[Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans|Horatio Alger Award]] for his success with his restaurant chain [[Wendy's]], which had reached annual sales of $1 billion with franchises then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://horatioalger.org/members/|title=Members â€“ Horatio Alger Association|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas, realizing that his success as a high school dropout might convince other teenagers to quit school (something he later claimed was a mistake), became a student at [[Coconut Creek High School]]. He earned a [[GED]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;DLeg&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wendys.com/en-us/about-wendys/daves-legacy | title=Dave's Legacy | publisher=Wendy's | accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1999.

Thomas was an honorary [[Kentucky colonel]], as was former boss Colonel Sanders.&lt;ref&gt;[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] - ''American Eats''&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2003.

Thomas was raised a Master Mason in Sol. D. Bayless Lodge No. 359 of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and became a 32Â° Mason, N.M.J., on November 16, 1961, in the Scottish Rite Bodies of Fort Wayne. He affiliated with the Miami, Florida, Scottish Rite Bodies on December 18, 1991; was invested with the Rank and Decoration of Knight Commander Court of Honour on November 13, 1993, in Jacksonville, Florida; and was coroneted an Inspector General Honorary, S.J., on November 25, 1995, in Atlanta, Georgia, and unanimously elected to the Scottish Rite's highest honor, the Grand Cross, by The Supreme Council, 33Â°, in Executive Session on October 3, 1997, in Washington, D.C.
