A '''central processing unit''' ('''CPU'''), also called a '''central processor''' or '''main processor''', is the [[electronic circuit]]ry within a [[computer]] that executes [[Instruction (computing)|instructions]] that make up a [[computer program]]. The CPU performs basic [[arithmetic]], logic, controlling, and [[input/output]] (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry used the term &quot;central processing unit&quot; as early as 1955.&lt;ref name= weik1955&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weik, Martin H. | title = A Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems | publisher = [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] | url = http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL-i.html#IBM-CPC | year = 1955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weik1961&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weik, Martin H. | title = A Third Survey of Domestic Electronic Digital Computing Systems | publisher = [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] | url = http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61.html | year = 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the term &quot;CPU&quot; refers to a [[Processor (computing)|processor]], more specifically to its processing unit and [[control unit]] (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as [[main memory]] and [[I/O]] circuitry.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuck&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1= Kuck|first1= David|title= Computers and Computations, Vol 1|date= 1978|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn= 978-0471027164|page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The form, [[CPU design|design]], and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) that performs arithmetic and [[logic operation]]s, [[processor register]]s that supply [[operand]]s to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.

Most modern CPUs are [[microprocessor]]s, where the CPU is contained on a single [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. An IC that contains a CPU may also contain [[Computer memory|memory]], [[peripheral]] interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called [[microcontroller]]s or [[System on a chip|systems on a chip]] (SoC). Some computers employ a [[multi-core processor]], which is a single chip containing two or more CPUs called &quot;cores&quot;; in that context, one can speak of such single chips  as  [[CPU socket|&quot;sockets&quot;]].&lt;ref name=&quot;intel-pcm&quot; /&gt;

Array processors or [[vector processor]]s have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered central. There also exists the concept of  [[Central processing unit#Virtual CPUs|virtual CPUs]] which are an abstraction of  dynamical aggregated computational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Edvac.jpg|thumb|[[EDVAC]], one of the first stored-program computers]]

Early computers such as the [[ENIAC]] had to be physically rewired to perform different tasks, which caused these machines to be called &quot;fixed-program computers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Regan|first1=Gerard|title=A Brief History of Computing|isbn=978-1848000834|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1848000839|accessdate=26 November 2014|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the term &quot;CPU&quot; is generally defined as a device for [[software]] (computer program) execution, the earliest devices that could rightly be called CPUs came with the advent of the [[stored-program computer]].

The idea of a stored-program computer had been already present in the design of [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John William Mauchly]]'s [[ENIAC]], but was initially omitted so that it could be finished sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bit By Bit|url=http://ds.haverford.edu/bitbybit/bit-by-bit-contents/chapter-five/5-1-stored-program-computing/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013210908/http://ds.haverford.edu/bitbybit/bit-by-bit-contents/chapter-five/5-1-stored-program-computing/|publisher=Haverford College|accessdate=August 1, 2015|archivedate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June&amp;nbsp;30, 1945, before ENIAC was made, mathematician [[John von Neumann]] distributed the paper entitled ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''. It was the outline of a stored-program computer that would eventually be completed in August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC | publisher = [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] | url = https://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/wang_archi/supp/appendix_a.pdf | year = 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EDVAC]] was designed to perform a certain number of instructions (or operations) of various types. Significantly, the programs written for EDVAC were to be stored in high-speed [[Memory (computers)|computer memory]] rather than specified by the physical wiring of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=The Modern History of Computing|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/|author=Stanford University|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This overcame a severe limitation of ENIAC, which was the considerable time and effort required to reconfigure the computer to perform a new task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ENIAC's Birthday |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/eniacs-birthday |publisher=The MIT Press |accessdate=October 17, 2018 |date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With von Neumann's design, the program that EDVAC ran could be changed simply by changing the contents of the memory. EDVAC, however, was not the first stored-program computer; the [[Manchester Baby]], a small-scale experimental stored-program computer, ran its first program on 21 June 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |publisher=The Computer Conservation Society |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/resurrection/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=26 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Manchester Mark 1]] ran its first program during the night of 16–17 June 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Manchester Mark 1|url=http://curation.cs.manchester.ac.uk/digital60/www.digital60.org/birth/manchestercomputers/mark1/manchester.html|work=The University of Manchester|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early CPUs were custom designs used as part of a larger and sometimes distinctive computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Generation|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/birth-of-the-computer/4/92|publisher=Computer History Museum |access-date= September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this method of designing custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development of multi-purpose processors produced in large quantities. This standardization began in the era of discrete [[transistor]] [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and [[minicomputer]]s and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of the [[integrated circuit]]&amp;nbsp;(IC). The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order of [[Nanometre|nanometers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Integrated Circuit|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/educational/physics/integrated_circuit/history/|website=Nobelprize.org |accessdate= September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the presence of digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear in electronic devices ranging from automobiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turley|first1=Jim|title=Motoring with microprocessors|url=http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/significant-bits/4024611/Motoring-with-microprocessors |publisher=Embedded|accessdate=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to cellphones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Processor Guide – Summer 2013|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/mobile-processor-guide-summer-2013-234354/|publisher=Android Authority|accessdate= November 15, 2015|date=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes even in toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Section 250: Microprocessors and Toys: An Introduction to Computing Systems |url=https://eng100.engin.umich.edu/list/sec250/ |publisher=The University of Michigan |accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARM946 Processor |url=https://www.arm.com/products/processors/classic/arm9/arm946.php|publisher=ARM|accessdate=|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015143/https://www.arm.com/products/processors/classic/arm9/arm946.php|archivedate = 17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While von Neumann is most often credited with the design of the stored-program computer because of his design of EDVAC, and the design became known as the [[von Neumann architecture]], others before him, such as [[Konrad Zuse]], had suggested and implemented similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Konrad Zuse|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/konrad-zuse/|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called [[Harvard architecture]] of the [[Harvard Mark I]], which was completed before EDVAC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Computer History: Computers|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Computing - First Generation Computers|url=http://trillian.randomstuff.org.uk/~stephen/history/timeline-GEN1.html|last=White|first=Stephen|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also used a stored-program design using [[Punched tape|punched paper tape]] rather than electronic memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard University Mark - Paper Tape Punch Unit|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102698407|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference between the von Neumann and Harvard architectures is that the latter separates the storage and treatment of CPU instructions and data, while the former uses the same memory space for both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between a von Neumann architecture and a Harvard architecture?|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.faqs/3738.html|publisher=ARM|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern CPUs are primarily von Neumann in design, but CPUs with the Harvard architecture are seen as well, especially in embedded applications; for instance, the [[Atmel AVR]] microcontrollers are Harvard architecture processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Architecture Optimizes the Atmel AVR CPU|url=http://www.atmel.com/technologies/cpu_core/avr.aspx|publisher=Atmel|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Relay]]s and [[vacuum tube]]s (thermionic tubes) were commonly used as switching elements;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switches, transistors and relays|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/electronics/switchesrev5.shtml|publisher=BBC |accessdate= |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161205142752/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/electronics/switchesrev5.shtml|archivedate = 5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing the Vacuum Transistor: A Device Made of Nothing|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/devices/introducing-the-vacuum-transistor-a-device-made-of-nothing|website=IEEE Spectrum|accessdate=27 January 2019|date=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a useful computer requires thousands or tens of thousands of switching devices. The overall speed of a system is dependent on the speed of the switches. Tube computers like EDVAC tended to average eight hours between failures, whereas relay computers like the (slower, but earlier) [[Harvard Mark I]] failed very rarely.&lt;ref name=&quot;weik1961&quot; /&gt; In the end, tube-based CPUs became dominant because the significant speed advantages afforded generally outweighed the reliability problems. Most of these early synchronous CPUs ran at low [[clock rate]]s compared to modern microelectronic designs. Clock signal frequencies ranging from 100 [[Hertz|kHz]] to 4&amp;nbsp;MHz were very common at this time, limited largely by the speed of the switching devices they were built with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=What Is Computer Performance?|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/12980/chapter/5#55|publisher=The National Academies Press|accessdate=May 16, 2016|doi=10.17226/12980|year=2011|isbn=978-0-309-15951-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design complexity of CPUs increased as various technologies facilitated building smaller and more reliable electronic devices. The first such improvement came with the advent of the [[transistor]]. Transistorized CPUs during the 1950s and 1960s no longer had to be built out of bulky, unreliable and fragile switching elements like [[vacuum tube]]s and [[relay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1953: Transistorized Computers Emerge|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/transistorized-computers-emerge/|work=Computer History Museum|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this improvement more complex and reliable CPUs were built onto one or several [[printed circuit board]]s containing discrete (individual) components.

In 1964, [[IBM]] introduced its [[IBM System/360]] computer architecture that was used in a series of computers capable of running the same programs with different speed and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_FS360.html|title=IBM System/360 Dates and Characteristics|publisher=IBM|date=2003-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significant at a time when most electronic computers were incompatible with one another, even those made by the same manufacturer. To facilitate this improvement, IBM used the concept of a [[microprogram]] (often called &quot;microcode&quot;), which still sees widespread usage in modern CPUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;amdahl1964&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amdahl | first1 = G.

Transistor-based computers had several distinct advantages over their predecessors. Aside from facilitating increased reliability and lower power consumption, transistors also allowed CPUs to operate at much higher speeds because of the short switching time of a transistor in comparison to a tube or relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transistors, Relays, and Controlling High-Current Loads|url=https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/electronics/transistors-relays-and-controlling-high-current-loads/|publisher=ITP Physical Computing|work=New York University|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased reliability and dramatically increased speed of the switching elements (which were almost exclusively transistors by this time), CPU clock rates in the tens of megahertz were easily obtained during this period.&lt;ref name = pcgamer&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Lilly |first1=Paul|title=A Brief History of CPUs: 31 Awesome Years of x86|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/a-brief-history-of-cpus-31-awesome-years-of-x86/|magazine=PC Gamer|accessdate=June 15, 2016|date=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally while discrete transistor and IC CPUs were in heavy usage, new high-performance designs like [[SIMD]] (Single Instruction Multiple Data) [[vector processor]]s began to appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=David A.|last1=Patterson|first2=John L.|last2=Hennessy|first3=James R.|last3=Larus|title=Computer Organization and Design: the Hardware/Software Interface|date=1999|publisher=Kaufmann|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1558604285|page=[https://archive.org/details/computerorganiz000henn/page/751 751]|edition=2. ed., 3rd print.|url=https://archive.org/details/computerorganiz000henn/page/751}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early experimental designs later gave rise to the era of specialized [[supercomputer]]s like those made by [[Cray|Cray Inc]] and [[Fujitsu|Fujitsu Ltd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;patterson&quot;/&gt;

===Small-scale integration CPUs===
[[File:PDP-8i cpu.jpg|thumb|CPU, [[Magnetic core memory|core memory]] and [[external bus]] interface of a DEC [[PDP-8]]/I, made of medium-scale integrated circuits]]

During this period, a method of manufacturing many interconnected transistors in a compact space was developed. The [[integrated circuit]] (IC) allowed a large number of transistors to be manufactured on a single [[semiconductor]]-based [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], or &quot;chip&quot;. At first, only very basic non-specialized digital circuits such as [[NOR gate]]s were miniaturized into ICs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1962: Aerospace systems are first the applications for ICs in computers |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/aerospace-systems-are-first-the-applications-for-ics-in-computers/ |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPUs based on these &quot;building block&quot; ICs are generally referred to as &quot;small-scale integration&quot; (SSI) devices. SSI ICs, such as the ones used in the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]], usually contained up to a few dozen transistors. To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of individual chips, but still consumed much less space and power than earlier discrete transistor designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The integrated circuits in the Apollo manned lunar landing program |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/ic-pg3.html |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=October 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM's [[System/370]], follow-on to the System/360, used SSI ICs rather than [[Solid Logic Technology]] discrete-transistor modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System/370 Announcement|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PR370.html|website=IBM Archives|accessdate=October 25, 2017|date=2003-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System/370 Model 155 (Continued)|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP3155B.html|website=IBM Archives|accessdate=October 25, 2017|date=2003-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; DEC's [[PDP-8]]/I and KI10 [[PDP-10]] also switched from the individual transistors used by the PDP-8 and PDP-10 to SSI ICs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/pdp8/models/|title=Models and Options|publisher=The Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their extremely popular [[PDP-11]] line was originally built with SSI ICs but was eventually implemented with LSI components once these became practical.

===Large-scale integration CPUs===
The [[MOSFET]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, was invented by [[Mohamed Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959, and demonstrated in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;&gt;https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/metal-oxide-semiconductor-mos-transistor-demonstrated/&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the development of the [[MOSFET|MOS]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor) integrated circuit, proposed by Atalla in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moskowitz |first1=Sanford L. |title=Advanced Materials Innovation: Managing Global Technology in the 21st century |date=2016 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=9780470508923 |pages=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kahng in 1961, and then fabricated by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at [[RCA]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerhistory&quot;/&gt; With its [[MOSFET scaling|high scalability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Motoyoshi |first1=M. |title=Through-Silicon Via (TSV) |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=43–48 |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2008.2007462 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8a44/93b535463daa7d7317b08d8900a33b8cbaf4.pdf |issn=0018-9219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much lower power consumption and higher density than [[bipolar junction transistor]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transistors Keep Moore's Law Alive |url=https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1334068 |work=EETimes |date=12 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MOSFET made it possible to build [[large-scale integration|high-density]] integrated circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Invented the Transistor? |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-invented-the-transistor/ |website=Computer History Museum |date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hittinger |first1=William C. |title=Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Technology |journal=Scientific American |date=1973 |volume=229 |issue=2 |pages=48–59 |issn=0036-8733|jstor=24923169 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0873-48 |bibcode=1973SciAm.229b..48H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Boysel published influential articles, including a 1967 &quot;manifesto&quot;, which described how to build the equivalent of a 32-bit mainframe computer from a relatively small number of [[large-scale integration]] circuits (LSI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Knox Bassett|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUbB3d2UnaAC|title=To the Digital Age: Research Labs, Start-up Companies, and the Rise of MOS Technology|year=2007|pp=127–128, 256, and 314|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8018-6809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shirriff&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to build LSI chips, which are chips with a hundred or more gates, was to build them using a MOS [[semiconductor manufacturing process]] (either [[PMOS logic]], [[NMOS logic]], or [[CMOS logic]]). However, some companies continued to build processors out of bipolar [[transistor–transistor logic]] (TTL) chips because bipolar junction transistors were faster than MOS chips up until the 1970s (a few companies such as [[Datapoint]] continued to build processors out of TTL chips until the early 1980s).&lt;ref name=&quot;shirriff&quot; /&gt; In the 1960s, MOS ICs were slower and initially considered useful only in applications that required low power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Labs/ddzo/speed.html|title=Speed &amp; Power in Logic Families}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Following the development of [[silicon-gate]] MOS technology by [[Federico Faggin]] at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968, MOS ICs largely replaced bipolar TTL as the standard chip technology in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1968: Silicon Gate Technology Developed for ICs |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/silicon-gate-technology-developed-for-ics/ |website=Computer History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[microelectronic]] technology advanced, an increasing number of transistors were placed on ICs, decreasing the number of individual ICs needed for a complete CPU. MSI and LSI ICs increased transistor counts to hundreds, and then thousands. By 1968, the number of ICs required to build a complete CPU had been reduced to 24 ICs of eight different types, with each IC containing roughly 1000 MOSFETs.&lt;ref&gt;

Advances in [[MOSFET|MOS]] IC technology led to the invention of the [[microprocessor]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1971: Microprocessor Integrates CPU Function onto a Single Chip |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/microprocessor-integrates-cpu-function-onto-a-single-chip/ |website=Computer History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the introduction of the first commercially available microprocessor, the [[Intel 4004]] in 1971, and the first widely used microprocessor, the [[Intel 8080]] in 1974, this class of CPUs has almost completely overtaken all other central processing unit implementation methods. Mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers of the time launched proprietary IC development programs to upgrade their older [[computer architecture]]s, and eventually produced [[instruction set]] compatible microprocessors that were backward-compatible with their older hardware and software. Combined with the advent and eventual success of the ubiquitous [[personal computer]], the term ''CPU'' is now applied almost exclusively{{Efn|Integrated circuits are now used to implement all CPUs, except for a few machines designed to withstand large electromagnetic pulses, say from a nuclear weapon.}} to microprocessors. Several CPUs (denoted ''cores'') can be combined in a single processing chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid80_gci1015740,00.html |publisher=TechTarget |title=Definition: multi-core processor |author=Margaret Rouse |date=March 27, 2007 |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the complexity, size, construction and general form of CPUs have changed enormously since 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=|first1=|title=A detailed history of the processor|url=https://www.techjunkie.com/a-cpu-history/|publisher=Tech Junkie |accessdate=|date = 15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the basic design and function has not changed much at all. Almost all common CPUs today can be very accurately described as von Neumann stored-program machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Von Neumann Computers |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d897/0d51c7a8fd0a18949355b45d1941c80ca630.pdf | first1=Rudolf|last1= Eigenmann |first2= David|last2=Lilja|accessdate=June 15, 2018|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn|The so-called &quot;von Neumann&quot; memo expounded the idea of stored programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Aspray|first1=William|title=The stored program concept |doi=10.1109/6.58457|magazine=IEEE Spectrum|volume=27|issue=9|date=September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for example may be stored on [[punched card]]s, paper tape, or magnetic tape.}} As Moore's law no longer holds, concerns have arisen about the limits of integrated circuit transistor technology. Extreme miniaturization of [[logic gate|electronic gates]] is causing the effects of phenomena like [[electromigration]] and [[subthreshold leakage]] to become much more significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Saraswat |first1=Krishna |title=Trends in Integrated Circuits Technology |url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee311/NOTES/TrendsSlides.pdf|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electromigration |url= http://www.csl.mete.metu.edu.tr/Electromigration/emig.htm |publisher=Middle East Technical University |accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These newer concerns are among the many factors causing researchers to investigate new methods of computing such as the [[quantum computer]], as well as to expand the usage of [[Parallel computing|parallelism]] and other methods that extend the usefulness of the classical von Neumann model.

==Operation==
The fundamental operation of most CPUs, regardless of the physical form they take, is to execute a sequence of stored [[instruction (computing)|instructions]] that is called a program. The instructions to be executed are kept in some kind of [[Memory (computers)|computer memory]]. Nearly all CPUs follow the fetch, decode and execute steps in their operation, which are collectively known as the [[instruction cycle]].

After the execution of an instruction, the entire process repeats, with the next instruction cycle normally fetching the next-in-sequence instruction because of the incremented value in the [[program counter]]. If a jump instruction was executed, the program counter will be modified to contain the address of the instruction that was jumped to and program execution continues normally. In more complex CPUs, multiple instructions can be fetched, decoded and executed simultaneously. This section describes what is generally referred to as the &quot;[[classic RISC pipeline]]&quot;, which is quite common among the simple CPUs used in many electronic devices (often called microcontroller). It largely ignores the important role of CPU cache, and therefore the access stage of the pipeline.

Some instructions manipulate the program counter rather than producing result data directly; such instructions are generally called &quot;jumps&quot; and facilitate program behavior like [[Control flow#Loops|loops]], conditional program execution (through the use of a conditional jump), and existence of [[Subroutine|functions]].{{Efn|Some early computers, like the Harvard Mark I, did not support any kind of &quot;jump&quot; instruction, effectively limiting the complexity of the programs they could run. It is largely for this reason that these computers are often not considered to contain a proper CPU, despite their close similarity to stored-program computers.}} In some processors, some other instructions change the state of bits in a [[Status register|&quot;flags&quot; register]]. These flags can be used to influence how a program behaves, since they often indicate the outcome of various operations. For example, in such processors a &quot;compare&quot; instruction evaluates two values and sets or clears bits in the flags register to indicate which one is greater or whether they are equal; one of these flags could then be used by a later jump instruction to determine program flow.

===Fetch===
The first step, fetch, involves retrieving an [[instruction (computing)|instruction]] (which is represented by a number or sequence of numbers) from program memory. The instruction's location (address) in program memory is determined by a program counter (PC), which stores a number that identifies the address of the next instruction to be fetched. After an instruction is fetched, the PC is incremented by the length of the instruction so that it will contain the address of the next instruction in the sequence.{{Efn|Since the program counter counts ''memory addresses'' and not ''instructions'', it is incremented by the number of memory units that the instruction word contains. In the case of simple fixed-length instruction word ISAs, this is always the same number. For example, a fixed-length 32-bit instruction word ISA that uses 8-bit memory words would always increment the PC by four (except in the case of jumps). ISAs that use variable-length instruction words increment the PC by the number of memory words corresponding to the last instruction's length.}} Often, the instruction to be fetched must be retrieved from relatively slow memory, causing the CPU to stall while waiting for the instruction to be returned. This issue is largely addressed in modern processors by caches and pipeline architectures (see below).

===Decode===
The instruction that the CPU fetches from memory determines what the CPU will do. In the decode step, performed by the circuitry known as the ''instruction decoder'', the instruction is converted into signals that control other parts of the CPU.

The way in which the instruction is interpreted is defined by the CPU's instruction set architecture (ISA).{{Efn|Because the instruction set architecture of a CPU is fundamental to its interface and usage, it is often used as a classification of the &quot;type&quot; of CPU. For example, a &quot;PowerPC CPU&quot; uses some variant of the PowerPC ISA. A system can execute a different ISA by running an emulator.}} Often, one group of bits (that is, a &quot;field&quot;) within the instruction, called the opcode, indicates which operation is to be performed, while the remaining fields usually provide supplemental information required for the operation, such as the operands. Those operands may be specified as a constant value (called an immediate value), or as the location of a value that may be a [[processor register]] or a memory address, as determined by some [[addressing mode]].

In some CPU designs the instruction decoder is implemented as a hardwired, unchangeable circuit. In others, a [[microprogram]] is used to translate instructions into sets of CPU configuration signals that are applied sequentially over multiple clock pulses. In some cases the memory that stores the microprogram is rewritable, making it possible to change the way in which the CPU decodes instructions.

===Execute===
After the fetch and decode steps, the execute step is performed. Depending on the CPU architecture, this may consist of a single action or a sequence of actions. During each action, various parts of the CPU are electrically connected so they can perform all or part of the desired operation and then the action is completed, typically in response to a clock pulse. Very often the results are written to an internal CPU register for quick access by subsequent instructions. In other cases results may be written to slower, but less expensive and higher capacity [[Random access memory|main memory]].

For example, if an addition instruction is to be executed, the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) inputs are connected to a pair of operand sources (numbers to be summed), the ALU is configured to perform an addition operation so that the sum of its operand inputs will appear at its output, and the ALU output is connected to storage (e.g., a register or memory) that will receive the sum. When the clock pulse occurs, the sum will be transferred to storage and, if the resulting sum is too large (i.e., it is larger than the ALU's output word size), an arithmetic overflow flag will be set.

==Structure and implementation==
{{see also|Processor design}}
[[File:ABasicComputer.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|Block diagram of a basic uniprocessor-CPU computer. Black lines indicate data flow, whereas red lines indicate control flow; arrows indicate flow directions.]]

Hardwired into a CPU's circuitry is a set of basic operations it can perform, called an [[instruction set]]. Such operations may involve, for example, adding or subtracting two numbers, comparing two numbers, or jumping to a different part of a program. Each basic operation is represented by a particular combination of [[bit]]s, known as the machine language [[opcode]]; while executing instructions in a machine language program, the CPU decides which operation to perform by &quot;decoding&quot; the opcode. A complete machine language instruction consists of an opcode and, in many cases, additional bits that specify arguments for the operation (for example, the numbers to be summed in the case of an addition operation). Going up the complexity scale, a machine language program is a collection of machine language instructions that the CPU executes.

The actual mathematical operation for each instruction is performed by a [[combinational logic]] circuit within the CPU's processor known as the [[arithmetic logic unit]] or ALU. In general, a CPU executes an instruction by fetching it from memory, using its ALU to perform an operation, and then storing the result to memory. Beside the instructions for integer mathematics and logic operations, various other machine instructions exist, such as those for loading data from memory and storing it back, branching operations, and mathematical operations on floating-point numbers performed by the CPU's [[floating-point unit]] (FPU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Control unit===
{{main|Control unit}}
The '''control unit''' (CU) is a component of the CPU that directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic and logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.

It directs the operation of the other units by providing timing and control signals. Most computer resources are managed by the CU. It directs the flow of data between the CPU and the other devices. [[John von Neumann]] included the control unit as part of the [[von Neumann architecture]]. In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the CPU with its overall role and operation unchanged since its introduction.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Arithmetic logic unit===
{{main|Arithmetic logic unit}}
[[File:ALU block.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|Symbolic representation of an ALU and its input and output signals]]

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit within the processor that performs integer arithmetic and [[bitwise logic]] operations. The inputs to the ALU are the data words to be operated on (called [[operands]]), status information from previous operations, and a code from the control unit indicating which operation to perform. Depending on the instruction being executed, the operands may come from [[processor register|internal CPU registers]] or external memory, or they may be constants generated by the ALU itself.

When all input signals have settled and propagated through the ALU circuitry, the result of the performed operation appears at the ALU's outputs. The result consists of both a data word, which may be stored in a register or memory, and status information that is typically stored in a special, internal CPU register reserved for this purpose.

=== Address generation unit ===
{{main|Address generation unit}}
'''Address generation unit''' ('''AGU'''), sometimes also called '''address computation unit''' ('''ACU'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/patents/US20060010255 | title = Address generation unit for a processor (US 2006010255 A1 patent application) | date = {{date|2006-01-12|mdy}} | accessdate = {{date|2014-12-08|mdy}} | author1 = Cornelis Van Berkel | author2 = Patrick Meuwissen | website = google.com }} {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/897932214]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/897793086]] cite #1 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[execution unit]] inside the CPU that calculates [[Memory address|addresses]] used by the CPU to access [[main memory]]. By having address calculations handled by separate circuitry that operates in parallel with the rest of the CPU, the number of [[CPU cycle]]s required for executing various [[machine instruction]]s can be reduced, bringing performance improvements.

While performing various operations, CPUs need to calculate memory addresses required for fetching data from the memory; for example, in-memory positions of [[array element]]s must be calculated before the CPU can fetch the data from actual memory locations. Those address-generation calculations involve different [[integer arithmetic operation]]s, such as addition, subtraction, [[modulo operation]]s, or [[bit shift]]s. Often, calculating a memory address involves more than one general-purpose machine instruction, which do not necessarily [[Instruction cycle|decode and execute]] quickly. By incorporating an AGU into a CPU design, together with introducing specialized instructions that use the AGU, various address-generation calculations can be offloaded from the rest of the CPU, and can often be executed quickly in a single CPU cycle.

Capabilities of an AGU depend on a particular CPU and its [[Computer architecture|architecture]]. Thus, some AGUs implement and expose more address-calculation operations, while some also include more advanced specialized instructions that can operate on multiple [[operand]]s at a time. Furthermore, some CPU architectures include multiple AGUs so more than one address-calculation operation can be executed simultaneously, bringing further performance improvements by capitalizing on the [[superscalar]] nature of advanced CPU designs. For example, [[Intel]] incorporates multiple AGUs into its [[Sandy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Sandy Bridge]] and [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell]] [[microarchitecture]]s, which increase bandwidth of the CPU memory subsystem by allowing multiple memory-access instructions to be executed in parallel.

===Memory management unit (MMU)===
{{main|Memory management unit}}

Most high-end microprocessors (in desktop, laptop, server computers) have a memory management unit, translating logical addresses into physical RAM addresses, providing [[memory protection]] and [[paging]] abilities, useful for [[virtual memory]]. Simpler processors, especially [[microcontroller]]s, usually don't include an MMU.

=== Cache ===
A '''CPU cache'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/how-the-cache-memory-works/|title=How The Cache Memory Works|author=Gabriel Torres|date=September 12, 2007}} {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/897932874]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/895110016]] cite #1 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[hardware cache]] used by the central processing unit (CPU) of a [[computer]] to reduce the average cost (time or energy) to access [[Data (computing)|data]] from the [[main memory]]. A cache is a smaller, faster memory, closer to a [[processor core]], which stores copies of the data from frequently used main [[memory location]]s. Most CPUs have different independent caches, including [[Instruction cache|instruction]] and [[data cache]]s, where the data cache is usually organized as a hierarchy of more cache levels (L1, L2, L3, L4, etc.).

All modern (fast) CPUs (with few specialized exceptions&lt;ref&gt;A few specialized CPUs, accelerators or microcontrollers do not have a cache. To be fast, if needed/wanted, they still have an on-chip scratchpad memory that has a similar function, while software managed. In e.g. microcontrollers it can be better for hard real-time use, to have that or at least no cache, as with one level of memory latencies of loads are predictable. {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/897932874]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot in plain-text form.

[[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have multiple levels of CPU caches. The first CPUs that used a cache had only one level of cache; unlike later level 1 caches, it was not split into L1d (for data) and L1i (for instructions). Almost all current CPUs with caches have a split L1 cache. They also have L2 caches and, for larger processors, L3 caches as well. The L2 cache is usually not split and acts as a common repository for the already split L1 cache. Every core of a [[multi-core processor]] has a dedicated L2 cache and is usually not shared between the cores. The L3 cache, and higher-level caches, are shared between the cores and are not split. An L4 cache is currently uncommon, and is generally on [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM), rather than on [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM), on a separate die or chip. That was also the case historically with L1, while bigger chips have allowed integration of it and generally all cache levels, with the possible exception of the last level. Each extra level of cache tends to be bigger and be optimized differently.

Other types of caches exist (that are not counted towards the &quot;cache size&quot; of the most important caches mentioned above), such as the [[translation lookaside buffer]] (TLB) that is part of the [[memory management unit]] (MMU) that most CPUs have.

Caches are generally sized in powers of two: 4, 8, 16 etc. [[Kibibyte|KiB]] or [[Mebibyte|MiB]] (for larger non-L1) sizes, although the [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]] has a 96 KiB L1 instruction cache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg248250.pdf|title=IBM z13 and IBM z13s Technical Introduction|page=20|date=March 2016|publisher=[[IBM]]}} {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/897933560]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/895110016]] cite #3 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clock rate===
{{main|Clock rate}}
Most CPUs are [[synchronous circuit]]s, which means they employ a [[clock signal]] to pace their sequential operations. The clock signal is produced by an external [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]] that generates a consistent number of pulses each second in the form of a periodic [[square wave]]. The frequency of the clock pulses determines the rate at which a CPU executes instructions and, consequently, the faster the clock, the more instructions the CPU will execute each second.

To ensure proper operation of the CPU, the clock period is longer than the maximum time needed for all signals to propagate (move) through the CPU. In setting the clock period to a value well above the worst-case [[propagation delay]], it is possible to design the entire CPU and the way it moves data around the &quot;edges&quot; of the rising and falling clock signal. This has the advantage of simplifying the CPU significantly, both from a design perspective and a component-count perspective. However, it also carries the disadvantage that the entire CPU must wait on its slowest elements, even though some portions of it are much faster. This limitation has largely been compensated for by various methods of increasing CPU parallelism (see below).

However, architectural improvements alone do not solve all of the drawbacks of globally synchronous CPUs. For example, a clock signal is subject to the delays of any other electrical signal. Higher clock rates in increasingly complex CPUs make it more difficult to keep the clock signal in phase (synchronized) throughout the entire unit. This has led many modern CPUs to require multiple identical clock signals to be provided to avoid delaying a single signal significantly enough to cause the CPU to malfunction. Another major issue, as clock rates increase dramatically, is the amount of heat that is [[CPU power dissipation|dissipated by the CPU]]. The constantly changing clock causes many components to switch regardless of whether they are being used at that time. In general, a component that is switching uses more energy than an element in a static state. Therefore, as clock rate increases, so does energy consumption, causing the CPU to require more [[heat dissipation]] in the form of [[CPU cooling]] solutions.

One method of dealing with the switching of unneeded components is called [[clock gating]], which involves turning off the clock signal to unneeded components (effectively disabling them). However, this is often regarded as difficult to implement and therefore does not see common usage outside of very low-power designs. One notable recent CPU design that uses extensive clock gating is the IBM [[PowerPC]]-based [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]] used in the [[Xbox 360]]; that way, power requirements of the Xbox 360 are greatly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Jeffery | title = Application-customized CPU design | publisher = IBM developerWorks | url = http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2005-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of addressing some of the problems with a global clock signal is the removal of the clock signal altogether. While removing the global clock signal makes the design process considerably more complex in many ways, asynchronous (or clockless) designs carry marked advantages in power consumption and [[heat dissipation]] in comparison with similar synchronous designs. While somewhat uncommon, entire [[Asynchronous circuit#Asynchronous CPU|asynchronous CPUs]] have been built without using a global clock signal. Two notable examples of this are the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] compliant [[AMULET microprocessor|AMULET]] and the [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R3000 compatible MiniMIPS.

Rather than totally removing the clock signal, some CPU designs allow certain portions of the device to be asynchronous, such as using asynchronous [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]] in conjunction with superscalar pipelining to achieve some arithmetic performance gains. While it is not altogether clear whether totally asynchronous designs can perform at a comparable or better level than their synchronous counterparts, it is evident that they do at least excel in simpler math operations. This, combined with their excellent power consumption and heat dissipation properties, makes them very suitable for [[embedded computer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Garside, J.

===Integer range===
Every CPU represents numerical values in a specific way. For example, some early digital computers represented numbers as familiar [[decimal]] (base 10) [[numeral system]] values, and others have employed more unusual representations such as [[Balanced ternary|ternary]] (base three). Nearly all modern CPUs represent numbers in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form, with each digit being represented by some two-valued physical quantity such as a &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; [[volt]]age.{{Efn|The physical concept of [[voltage]] is an analog one by nature, practically having an infinite range of possible values. For the purpose of physical representation of binary numbers, two specific ranges of voltages are defined, one for logic '0' and another for logic '1'. These ranges are dictated by design considerations such as noise margins and characteristics of the devices used to create the CPU.}}

[[File:Binary Forty.PNG|thumb|left|A six-bit word containing the binary encoded representation of decimal value 40. Most modern CPUs employ word sizes that are a power of two, for example 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits.]]

Related to numeric representation is the size and precision of integer numbers that a CPU can represent. In the case of a binary CPU, this is measured by the number of bits (significant digits of a binary encoded integer) that the CPU can process in one operation, which is commonly called [[Word (data type)|''word size'']], ''bit width'', ''data path width'', ''integer precision'', or ''integer size''. A CPU's integer size determines the range of integer values it can directly operate on.{{Efn|While a CPU's integer size sets a limit on integer ranges, this can (and often is) overcome using a combination of software and hardware techniques. By using additional memory, software can represent integers many magnitudes larger than the CPU can. Sometimes the CPU's [[instruction set]] will even facilitate operations on integers larger than it can natively represent by providing instructions to make large integer arithmetic relatively quick. This method of dealing with large integers is slower than utilizing a CPU with higher integer size, but is a reasonable trade-off in cases where natively supporting the full integer range needed would be cost-prohibitive. See [[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] for more details on purely software-supported arbitrary-sized integers.}} For example, an [[8-bit]] CPU can directly manipulate integers represented by eight bits, which have a range of 256 (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) discrete integer values.

Integer range can also affect the number of memory locations the CPU can directly address (an address is an integer value representing a specific memory location). For example, if a binary CPU uses 32 bits to represent a memory address then it can directly address 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; memory locations. To circumvent this limitation and for various other reasons, some CPUs use mechanisms (such as [[bank switching]]) that allow additional memory to be addressed.

CPUs with larger word sizes require more circuitry and consequently are physically larger, cost more and consume more power (and therefore generate more heat). As a result, smaller 4- or 8-bit [[microcontroller]]s are commonly used in modern applications even though CPUs with much larger word sizes (such as 16, 32, 64, even 128-bit) are available. When higher performance is required, however, the benefits of a larger word size (larger data ranges and address spaces) may outweigh the disadvantages.  A CPU can have internal data paths shorter than the word size to reduce size and cost.  For example, even though the [[IBM System/360]] [[instruction set]] was a 32-bit instruction set, the System/360 [[IBM System/360 Model 30|Model 30]] and [[IBM System/360 Model 40|Model 40]] had 8-bit data paths in the arithmetic logical unit, so that a 32-bit add required four cycles, one for each 8 bits of the operands, and, even though the [[Motorola 68000 series]] instruction set was a 32-bit instruction set, the [[Motorola 68000]] and [[Motorola 68010]] had 16-bit data paths in the arithmetic logical unit, so that a 32-bit add required two cycles.

To gain some of the advantages afforded by both lower and higher bit lengths, many [[instruction set]]s have different bit widths for integer and floating-point data, allowing CPUs implementing that instruction set to have different bit widths for different portions of the device. For example, the IBM [[System/360]] instruction set was primarily 32 bit, but supported 64-bit [[floating point]] values to facilitate greater accuracy and range in floating point numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amdahl1964&quot; /&gt; The System/360 Model 65 had an 8-bit adder for decimal and fixed-point binary arithmetic and a 60-bit adder for floating-point arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/funcChar/A22-6884-3_360-65_funcChar.pdf|title=IBM System/360 Model 65 Functional Characteristics|date=September 1968|publisher=[[IBM]]|pages=8–9|id=A22-6884-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many later CPU designs use similar mixed bit width, especially when the processor is meant for general-purpose usage where a reasonable balance of integer and floating point capability is required.

===Parallelism===
{{main|Parallel computing}}
[[File:Nopipeline.png|thumb|upright=2|Model of a subscalar CPU, in which it takes fifteen clock cycles to complete three instructions]]

The description of the basic operation of a CPU offered in the previous section describes the simplest form that a CPU can take. This type of CPU, usually referred to as ''subscalar'', operates on and executes one instruction on one or two pieces of data at a time, that is less than one [[Instructions per cycle|instruction per clock cycle]] ({{nobreak|IPC &lt; 1}}).

This process gives rise to an inherent inefficiency in subscalar CPUs. Since only one instruction is executed at a time, the entire CPU must wait for that instruction to complete before proceeding to the next instruction. As a result, the subscalar CPU gets &quot;hung up&quot; on instructions which take more than one clock cycle to complete execution. Even adding a second [[execution unit]] (see below) does not improve performance much; rather than one pathway being hung up, now two pathways are hung up and the number of unused transistors is increased. This design, wherein the CPU's execution resources can operate on only one instruction at a time, can only possibly reach ''scalar'' performance (one instruction per clock cycle, {{nobreak|1=IPC = 1}}). However, the performance is nearly always subscalar (less than one instruction per clock cycle, {{nobreak|IPC &lt; 1}}).

Attempts to achieve scalar and better performance have resulted in a variety of design methodologies that cause the CPU to behave less linearly and more in parallel. When referring to parallelism in CPUs, two terms are generally used to classify these design techniques:
* ''[[instruction-level parallelism]]'' (ILP), which seeks to increase the rate at which instructions are executed within a CPU (that is, to increase the use of on-die execution resources);
* ''[[task-level parallelism]]'' (TLP), which purposes to increase the number of [[Thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] that a CPU can execute simultaneously.

Each methodology differs both in the ways in which they are implemented, as well as the relative effectiveness they afford in increasing the CPU's performance for an application.{{Efn|Neither [[Instruction-level parallelism|ILP]] nor [[Task-level parallelism|TLP]] is inherently superior over the other; they are simply different means by which to increase CPU parallelism. As such, they both have advantages and disadvantages, which are often determined by the type of software that the processor is intended to run. High-TLP CPUs are often used in applications that lend themselves well to being split up into numerous smaller applications, so-called &quot;[[embarrassingly parallel]] problems&quot;. Frequently, a computational problem that can be solved quickly with high TLP design strategies like [[symmetric multiprocessing]] takes significantly more time on high ILP devices like superscalar CPUs, and vice versa.}}

====Instruction-level parallelism====
{{main|Instruction pipelining|Superscalar processor}}
[[File:Fivestagespipeline.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Basic five-stage pipeline. In the best case scenario, this pipeline can sustain a completion rate of one instruction per clock cycle.]]

One of the simplest methods used to accomplish increased parallelism is to begin the first steps of instruction fetching and decoding before the prior instruction finishes executing. This is the simplest form of a technique known as [[instruction pipelining]], and is used in almost all modern general-purpose CPUs. Pipelining allows more than one instruction to be executed at any given time by breaking down the execution pathway into discrete stages. This separation can be compared to an assembly line, in which an instruction is made more complete at each stage until it exits the execution pipeline and is retired.

Pipelining does, however, introduce the possibility for a situation where the result of the previous operation is needed to complete the next operation; a condition often termed data dependency conflict. To cope with this, additional care must be taken to check for these sorts of conditions and delay a portion of the [[instruction pipeline]] if this occurs. Naturally, accomplishing this requires additional circuitry, so pipelined processors are more complex than subscalar ones (though not very significantly so). A pipelined processor can become very nearly scalar, inhibited only by pipeline stalls (an instruction spending more than one clock cycle in a stage).

[[File:Superscalarpipeline.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A simple superscalar pipeline. By fetching and dispatching two instructions at a time, a maximum of two instructions per clock cycle can be completed.]]

Further improvement upon the idea of instruction pipelining led to the development of a method that decreases the idle time of CPU components even further. Designs that are said to be ''superscalar'' include a long instruction pipeline and multiple identical [[execution unit]]s, such as [[load-store unit]]s, [[arithmetic-logic unit]]s, [[floating-point unit]]s and [[address generation unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huynh | first = Jack | title = The AMD Athlon XP Processor with 512KB L2 Cache | publisher = University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign | pages = 6–11 | url = http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-10-06 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061217/http://courses.ece.uiuc.edu/ece512/Papers/Athlon.pdf | archivedate = 2007-11-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a superscalar pipeline, multiple instructions are read and passed to a dispatcher, which decides whether or not the instructions can be executed in parallel (simultaneously). If so they are dispatched to available execution units, resulting in the ability for several instructions to be executed simultaneously. In general, the more instructions a superscalar CPU is able to dispatch simultaneously to waiting execution units, the more instructions will be completed in a given cycle.

Most of the difficulty in the design of a superscalar CPU architecture lies in creating an effective dispatcher. The dispatcher needs to be able to quickly and correctly determine whether instructions can be executed in parallel, as well as dispatch them in such a way as to keep as many execution units busy as possible. This requires that the instruction pipeline is filled as often as possible and gives rise to the need in superscalar architectures for significant amounts of [[CPU cache]]. It also makes [[Hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]-avoiding techniques like [[branch prediction]], [[speculative execution]], [[register renaming]], [[out-of-order execution]] and [[transactional memory]] crucial to maintaining high levels of performance. By attempting to predict which branch (or path) a conditional instruction will take, the CPU can minimize the number of times that the entire pipeline must wait until a conditional instruction is completed. Speculative execution often provides modest performance increases by executing portions of code that may not be needed after a conditional operation completes. Out-of-order execution somewhat rearranges the order in which instructions are executed to reduce delays due to data dependencies. Also in case of [[SIMD|single instruction stream, multiple data stream]]—a case when a lot of data from the same type has to be processed—, modern processors can disable parts of the pipeline so that when a single instruction is executed many times, the CPU skips the fetch and decode phases and thus greatly increases performance on certain occasions, especially in highly monotonous program engines such as video creation software and photo processing.

In the case where a portion of the CPU is superscalar and part is not, the part which is not suffers a performance penalty due to scheduling stalls. The Intel [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] had two superscalar ALUs which could accept one instruction per clock cycle each, but its FPU could not accept one instruction per clock cycle. Thus the P5 was integer superscalar but not floating point superscalar. Intel's successor to the P5 architecture, [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]], added superscalar capabilities to its floating point features, and therefore afforded a significant increase in floating point instruction performance.

Both simple pipelining and superscalar design increase a CPU's ILP by allowing a single processor to complete execution of instructions at rates surpassing one instruction per clock cycle.{{Efn|Best-case scenario (or peak) IPC rates in very superscalar architectures are difficult to maintain since it is impossible to keep the instruction pipeline filled all the time. Therefore, in highly superscalar CPUs, average sustained IPC is often discussed rather than peak IPC.}} Most modern CPU designs are at least somewhat superscalar, and nearly all general purpose CPUs designed in the last decade are superscalar. In later years some of the emphasis in designing high-ILP computers has been moved out of the CPU's hardware and into its software interface, or [[Instruction set|ISA]]. The strategy of the [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) causes some ILP to become implied directly by the software, reducing the amount of work the CPU must perform to boost ILP and thereby reducing the design's complexity.

====Task-level parallelism====
{{main|Multithreading (computer architecture)|l1=Multithreading|Multi-core processor}}
Another strategy of achieving performance is to execute multiple [[Thread (computing)|threads]] or [[Process (computing)|processes]] in parallel. This area of research is known as [[parallel computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb|first=Allan|title=Highly parallel computing|year=1989|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|location=Redwood City, Calif.|isbn=978-0-8053-0177-9|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=160438|author2=Almasi, George S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Flynn's taxonomy]], this strategy is known as [[MIMD|multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream]] (MIMD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=M. J. |authorlink1=Michael J. Flynn|doi=10.1109/TC.1972.5009071|title=Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Computers|IEEE Trans. Comput.]]|volume=C-21|issue=9|pages=948–960| date=September 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One technology used for this purpose was [[multiprocessing]] (MP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parallelism exploitation in superscalar multiprocessing|journal=IEE Proceedings - Computers and Digital Techniques|volume=145|issue=4|pages=255|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers|doi=10.1049/ip-cdt:19981955|year=1998|last1=Lu|first1=N.-P.|last2=Chung|first2=C.-P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial flavor of this technology is known as [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP), where a small number of CPUs share a coherent view of their memory system. In this scheme, each CPU has additional hardware to maintain a constantly up-to-date view of memory. By avoiding stale views of memory, the CPUs can cooperate on the same program and programs can migrate from one CPU to another. To increase the number of cooperating CPUs beyond a handful, schemes such as [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) and [[directory-based coherence protocols]] were introduced in the 1990s. SMP systems are limited to a small number of CPUs while NUMA systems have been built with thousands of processors. Initially, multiprocessing was built using multiple discrete CPUs and boards to implement the interconnect between the processors. When the processors and their interconnect are all implemented on a single chip, the technology is known as chip-level multiprocessing (CMP) and the single chip as a [[multi-core processor]].

It was later recognized that finer-grain parallelism existed with a single program. A single program might have several threads (or functions) that could be executed separately or in parallel. Some of the earliest examples of this technology implemented [[input/output]] processing such as [[direct memory access]] as a separate thread from the computation thread. A more general approach to this technology was introduced in the 1970s when systems were designed to run multiple computation threads in parallel. This technology is known as [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multi-threading]] (MT). This approach is considered more cost-effective than multiprocessing, as only a small number of components within a CPU is replicated to support MT as opposed to the entire CPU in the case of MP. In MT, the execution units and the memory system including the caches are shared among multiple threads. The downside of MT is that the hardware support for multithreading is more visible to software than that of MP and thus supervisor software like operating systems have to undergo larger changes to support MT. One type of MT that was implemented is known as [[temporal multithreading]], where one thread is executed until it is stalled waiting for data to return from external memory. In this scheme, the CPU would then quickly context switch to another thread which is ready to run, the switch often done in one CPU clock cycle, such as the [[UltraSPARC T1]]. Another type of MT is [[simultaneous multithreading]], where instructions from multiple threads are executed in parallel within one CPU clock cycle.

For several decades from the 1970s to early 2000s, the focus in designing high performance general purpose CPUs was largely on achieving high ILP through technologies such as pipelining, caches, superscalar execution, out-of-order execution, etc. This trend culminated in large, power-hungry CPUs such as the Intel [[Pentium 4]]. By the early 2000s, CPU designers were thwarted from achieving higher performance from ILP techniques due to the growing disparity between CPU operating frequencies and main memory operating frequencies as well as escalating CPU power dissipation owing to more esoteric ILP techniques.

CPU designers then borrowed ideas from commercial computing markets such as [[transaction processing]], where the aggregate performance of multiple programs, also known as [[throughput]] computing, was more important than the performance of a single thread or process.

This reversal of emphasis is evidenced by the proliferation of dual and more core processor designs and notably, Intel's newer designs resembling its less superscalar [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] architecture. Late designs in several processor families exhibit CMP, including the [[x86-64]] [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64 X2]], the [[SPARC]] [[UltraSPARC T1]], IBM [[POWER4]] and [[POWER5]], as well as several [[video game console]] CPUs like the [[Xbox 360]]'s triple-core PowerPC design, and the [[PlayStation 3]]'s 7-core [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microprocessor]].

====Data parallelism====
{{main|Vector processor|SIMD}}
A less common but increasingly important paradigm of processors (and indeed, computing in general) deals with data parallelism. The processors discussed earlier are all referred to as some type of scalar device.{{Efn|Earlier the term ''scalar'' was used to compare the IPC count afforded by various ILP methods. Here the term is used in the strictly mathematical sense to contrast with vectors. See [[scalar (mathematics)]] and [[Vector (geometric)]].}} As the name implies, vector processors deal with multiple pieces of data in the context of one instruction. This contrasts with scalar processors, which deal with one piece of data for every instruction. Using [[Flynn's taxonomy]], these two schemes of dealing with data are generally referred to as [[SIMD|single instruction stream, multiple data stream]] (SIMD) and [[SISD|single instruction stream, single data stream]] (SISD), respectively. The great utility in creating processors that deal with vectors of data lies in optimizing tasks that tend to require the same operation (for example, a sum or a [[dot product]]) to be performed on a large set of data. Some classic examples of these types of tasks include [[multimedia]] applications (images, video and sound), as well as many types of [[Scientific computing|scientific]] and engineering tasks. Whereas a scalar processor must complete the entire process of fetching, decoding and executing each instruction and value in a set of data, a vector processor can perform a single operation on a comparatively large set of data with one instruction. This is only possible when the application tends to require many steps which apply one operation to a large set of data.

Most early vector processors, such as the [[Cray-1]], were associated almost exclusively with scientific research and [[cryptography]] applications. However, as multimedia has largely shifted to digital media, the need for some form of SIMD in general-purpose processors has become significant. Shortly after inclusion of [[floating-point unit]]s started to become commonplace in general-purpose processors, specifications for and implementations of SIMD execution units also began to appear for general-purpose processors.{{when|date=September 2016}} Some of these early SIMD specifications - like HP's [[Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions]] (MAX) and Intel's [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]] - were integer-only. This proved to be a significant impediment for some software developers, since many of the applications that benefit from SIMD primarily deal with [[floating-point]] numbers. Progressively, developers refined and remade these early designs into some of the common modern SIMD specifications, which are usually associated with one ISA. Some notable modern examples include Intel's [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] and the PowerPC-related [[AltiVec]] (also known as VMX).{{Efn|Although SSE/SSE2/SSE3 have superseded MMX in Intel's general-purpose processors, later [[IA-32]] designs still support MMX. This is usually accomplished by providing most of the MMX functionality with the same hardware that supports the much more expansive SSE instruction sets.}}

The ''performance'' or ''speed'' of a processor depends on, among many other factors, the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]]) and the instructions per clock (IPC), which together are the factors for the [[instructions per second]] (IPS) that the CPU can perform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freq&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

Many reported IPS values have represented &quot;peak&quot; execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches, whereas realistic workloads consist of a mix of instructions and applications, some of which take longer to execute than others. The performance of the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in MIPS calculations. Because of these problems, various standardized tests, often called [[benchmark (computing)|&quot;benchmarks&quot;]] for this purpose{{mdashb}}such as [[SPECint]]{{mdashb}}have been developed to attempt to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

Processing performance of computers is increased by using [[multi-core processor]]s, which essentially is plugging two or more individual processors (called ''cores'' in this sense) into one integrated circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;tt&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

In practice, the performance gain is far smaller, only about 50%, due to imperfect software algorithms and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techspirited.com/quad-core-vs-dual-core|title=Quad Core Vs. Dual Core}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the number of cores in a processor (i.e. dual-core, quad-core, etc.) increases the workload that can be handled. This means that the processor can now handle numerous asynchronous events, interrupts, etc. which can take a toll on the CPU when overwhelmed. These cores can be thought of as different floors in a processing plant, with each floor handling a different task. Sometimes, these cores will handle the same tasks as cores adjacent to them if a single core is not enough to handle the information.

Due to specific capabilities of modern CPUs, such as [[simultaneous multithreading]] and [[uncore]], which involve sharing of actual CPU resources while aiming at increased utilization, monitoring performance levels and hardware use gradually became a more complex task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tegtmeier|first1=Martin|title=CPU utilization of multi-threaded architectures explained|url=https://blogs.oracle.com/partnertech/entry/cpu_utilization_of_multi_threaded|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response, some CPUs implement additional hardware logic that monitors actual use of various parts of a CPU and provides various counters accessible to software; an example is Intel's ''Performance Counter Monitor'' technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;intel-pcm&quot;&gt;{{cite web
