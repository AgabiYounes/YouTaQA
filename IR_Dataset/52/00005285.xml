'''STS-51-F''' (also known as '''Spacelab 2''') was the 19th flight of [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program]] and the eighth flight of [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']]. It launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], on July 29, 1985, and landed just under eight days later on August 6.

While STS-51-F's primary payload was the [[Spacelab]] 2 laboratory module, the payload that received the most publicity was the Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation, which was an experiment in which both [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/12128-9-weird-nasa-space-shuttle-cargo-mementos-countdown.html 9 Weird Things That Flew on NASA's Space Shuttles | Final Shuttle Missions &amp; NASA's Space Shuttle Souvenirs | NASA Shuttle Program | Space.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A helium-cooled '''Infrared telescope''' ('''IRT''') was also flown on this mission, and while it did have some problems, it observed 60% of the [[galactic plane]] in infrared light.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipac.caltech.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/orbit.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221020839/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/outreach/Edu/orbit.html |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kent/&gt;

During launch ''Challenger'' experienced multiple sensor failings in its [[RS-25]] engines and had to perform an &quot;[[Abort to Orbit]]&quot; (ATO) emergency procedure. It is the only Shuttle mission to have carried out an [[Space Shuttle abort modes|abort]] after launching. As a result of the ATO, the mission was carried out at a slightly lower orbital altitude.

===Crew notes===
As with previous Spacelab missions, the crew was divided between two 12-hour shifts. Acton, Bridges and Henize made up the &quot;Red Team&quot; while Bartoe, England and Musgrave comprised the &quot;Blue Team&quot;; commander Fullerton could take either shift when needed.&lt;ref name=presskit&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Shuttle Mission STS-51F Press Kit|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_019_STS-51F_Press_Kit.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=March 1, 2014|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Challenger'' carried two [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]]s in the event of an emergency spacewalk, which would have been performed by England and Musgrave.&lt;ref name=presskit /&gt;

==Launch==
[[File:STS-51-F shuttle.jpg|thumb|left|Aborted launch attempt at T-3 seconds on July 12, 1985]]
[[File:Space Shuttle abort panel.jpg|thumb|The control panel of the Shuttle on the STS-51-F mission, showing the selection of the Abort-to-Orbit (ATO) option]]
STS-51-F's first launch attempt on July 12, 1985 was halted with the countdown at T−3 seconds after main engine ignition, when a malfunction of the number two RS-25 coolant valve caused the shutdown of all three main engines. ''Challenger'' launched successfully on its second attempt on July 29, 1985, at 17:00 EDT, after a delay of 1 hour 37 minutes due to a problem with the table maintenance block update uplink.

At 3 minutes 31 seconds into the ascent, one of the central engine's two high-pressure fuel turbopump turbine discharge temperature sensors failed. 2 minutes and 12 seconds later, the second sensor failed, causing the shutdown of the central engine. This was the only in-flight [[SSME|main-engine]] failure of the [[Space Shuttle program]]. Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right-engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown. [[Booster Systems Engineer]] Jenny M. Howard acted quickly to command the crew to inhibit any further automatic RS-25 shutdowns based on readings from the remaining sensors, preventing the potential shutdown of a second engine and a possible abort mode that may have resulted in the loss of the vehicle and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The failed RS-25 resulted in an [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Abort to Orbit (ATO)|Abort to Orbit (ATO)]] trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieved a lower-than-planned orbital altitude.

STS-51-F's primary payload was the laboratory module Spacelab 2. A special part of the modular Spacelab system, the &quot;[[igloo]]&quot;, which was located at head of a three-pallet train, provided on-site support to instruments mounted on pallets. The main mission objective was to verify performance of Spacelab systems, determine the interface capability of the orbiter, and measure the environment created by the spacecraft. Experiments covered [[life science]]s, [[plasma physics]], [[astronomy]], high-energy [[astrophysics]], [[solar physics]], [[atmospheric physics]] and technology research. Despite mission replanning necessitated by ''Challenger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Intact abort modes|abort to orbit]] trajectory, the Spacelab mission was declared a success.

The flight marked the first time the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was tested in orbit. This unique pointing instrument was designed with an accuracy of one [[arcsecond]]. Initially, some problems were experienced when it was commanded to track the [[Sun]], but a series of software fixes were made and the problem was corrected. In addition, [[Anthony W. England|Tony England]] became the second [[amateur radio operator]] to [[Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment|transmit from space]] during the mission.

The Spacelab Infrared Telescope (IRT) was also flown on the mission.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; The IRT was a 15.2&amp;nbsp;cm aperture helium-cooled [[infrared]] telescope, observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992ApJS...78..403K Kent, et al. – '''Galactic structure from the Spacelab infrared telescope''' (1992)].&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment experienced some problems, it was thought heat emissions from the Shuttle corrupting long-wavelength data, but it still returned useful astronomical data.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; Another problem was that a piece of mylar insulation broke loose and floated in the line-of-sight of the telescope.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; IRT collected infrared data on 60% of the galactic plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipac.caltech.edu&quot;/&gt; (see also [[List of largest infrared telescopes]]) A later space mission that experienced a [[stray light]] problem from debris was [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] astrometry spacecraft launch in 2013 by the ESA{{mdash}}the source of the stray light was later identified as the fibers of the sunshield, protruding beyond the edges of the shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=STATUS OF THE GAIA STRAYLIGHT ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION ACTIONS| url=http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/news_20141217| accessdate=1 January 2015| date=2014-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Plasma Diagnostics Package (PDP), which had been previously flown on [[STS-3]], made its return on the mission, and was part of a set of plasma physics experiments designed to study the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. During the third day of the mission, it was grappled out of the payload bay by the [[Remote Manipulator System]] and released for six hours.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|title=STS-51F National Space Transportation System Mission Report|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/52621059/STS-51F-National-Space-Transportation-System-Mission-Report|publisher=NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|accessdate=March 1, 2014|page=2|date=September 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, ''Challenger'' maneuvered around the PDP as part of a targeted proximity operations exercise. The PDP was successfully grappled by the RMS and returned to the payload bay at the beginning of the fourth day of the mission.&lt;ref name=report /&gt;

In a heavily publicized marketing experiment, astronauts aboard STS-51-F drank [[soft drink|carbonated beverage]]s from specially-designed cans provided by [[Cola Wars|competitors]] [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearlman|first=Robert|title=A Brief History of Space Marketing|url=http://www.space.com/news/spaceagencies/space_market_010531-1.html|publisher=SPACE.com|accessdate=March 24, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214131154/http://space.com/news/spaceagencies/space_market_010531-1.html|archivedate=February 14, 2009|date=May 31, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Post-flight, the astronauts revealed that they preferred [[Tang (beverage)|Tang]], in part because it could be mixed on-orbit with existing chilled-water supplies, whereas there was no dedicated refrigeration equipment on board to chill the cans, which also [[fizz]]ed excessively in [[microgravity]].

In an experiment during the mission, thruster rockets were fired at a point over Tasmania and also above Boston to create two &quot;holes&quot; – plasma depletion regions – in the ionosphere. A worldwide group of geophysicists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://harveycohen.net/essex/index.htm |title=Elizabeth  A. Essex-Cohen Ionospheric Physics Papers| accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborated with the observations made from Spacelab 2.

==Landing==
''Challenger'' landed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]], on August 6, 1985, at 12:45:26&amp;nbsp;p.m. PDT. Its rollout distance was {{convert|8569|ft|m}}. The mission had been extended by 17 orbits for additional payload activities due to the Abort to Orbit. The orbiter arrived back at Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1985.

==Mission insignia==
The mission insignia was designed by [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] artist Skip Bradley. {{OV|99}} is depicted ascending toward the heavens in search of new knowledge in the field of solar and stellar astronomy, with its Spacelab 2 payload. The constellations [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] and [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] are shown in the positions they were in relative to the Sun during the flight. The nineteen stars indicate that the mission is the 19th shuttle flight.

==Crew bios==
[[C. Gordon Fullerton]] died on August 21, 2013, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-082113b.html |title=Gordon Fullerton, space shuttle test pilot, dies at 76 |accessdate=August 21, 2013 |publisher=collectSPACE |year=2013 |author=Robert Z. Pearlman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Gordon Henize]] died October 5, 1993 on an expedition to [[Mount Everest]] studying the effects of radiation from space.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Read, Freefall, Pages 224-235 (Little Brown, Edition 1, 1998). {{ISBN|0-316-64303-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-karl-henize-1512511.html - ''[[The Independent]] Newspaper reporting on the Death of Karl Heinze, 23 October 1993''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1993_1995/93-077.html - ''[[NASA]]: Press Release: Former Astronaut Karl Henize dies on Mt. Everest Expedition'', 8 October 1993''&lt;/ref&gt; (age 66)

==Legacy==
One of the purposes of the mission was to test how suitable the Shuttle was for conducting infrared observations, and the IRT was operated on this mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3349/1|title=The Space Review: From Skylab to Shuttle to the Smithsonian|website=www.thespacereview.com|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the orbiter was found to have some draw-backs for infrared astronomy, and this led to later infrared telescopes being free-flying from the Shuttle orbiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;
