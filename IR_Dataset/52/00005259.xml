'''Common descent''' is a concept in [[evolutionary biology]] applicable when one species is the ancestor of two or more species later in time. Its broadest application, the [[last universal common ancestor]] (UCA) of all [[life]] on [[Earth]], is a central assumption of modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=13 May 2010 |title=A formal test of the theory of universal common ancestry |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=219–222 |doi=10.1038/nature09014 |pmid=20463738|bibcode=2010Natur.465..219T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;steel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steel |first1=Mike |author1-link=Mike Steel (mathematician) |last2=Penny |first2=David |date=13 May 2010 |title=Origins of life: Common ancestry put to the test |journal=Nature |volume=465 |issue=7295 |pages=168–169 |doi=10.1038/465168a |pmid=20463725|bibcode=2010Natur.465..168S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common descent is an effect of [[speciation]], in which multiple species derive from a single ancestral population. The more recent the ancestral population two species have in common, the more closely are they related. The most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms is the last universal ancestor,&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot; /&gt; which lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.9 billion years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Doolittle |first=W.

Universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process was first proposed by the British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] in the concluding sentence of his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;origin_490&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

In the 1740s, the French [[mathematician]] [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] made the first known suggestion that all organisms had a common ancestor, and had diverged through random variation and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Crombie |Hoskin |1970 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OOgzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Maupertuis+%22for+the+first+time%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Maupertuis%20%22for%20the%20first%20time%22&amp;f=false 62–63]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Treasure |1985 |p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Essai de cosmologie'' (1750), Maupertuis noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May we not say that, in the fortuitous combination of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures ''could'' survive in whose organizations a certain degree of adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Harris |1981 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fkqg3TIkBJwC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Essai+de+Cosmologie+%22blind+destiny%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Essai%20de%20Cosmologie%20%22blind%20destiny%22&amp;f=false 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in ''Kritik der Urteilskraft'' (''[[Critique of Judgement]]'') that the similarity{{efn|Now called [[Homology (biology)|homology]].}} of animal forms implies a common original type, and thus a common parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kant |1987 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y5wQD-ioaUUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Critique+of+Judgment+%22original+mother%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 304]}}: &quot;Despite all the variety among these forms, they seem to have been produced according to a common archetype, and this analogy among them reinforces our suspicion that they are actually akin, produced by a common original mother.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]] asked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which {{Smallcaps |the great First Cause}} endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1818 |p=397 [§&amp;nbsp;39.4.8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]]'s views about common descent, as expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', were that it was probable that there was only one progenitor for all life forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1859 |p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But he precedes that remark by, &quot;Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. But analogy may be a deceitful guide.&quot; And in the subsequent edition,&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. 1860. On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. London: John Murray. 2nd edition, second issue, page 466&lt;/ref&gt; he asserts rather, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We do not know all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we know how imperfect the Geological Record is. Grave as these several difficulties are, in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent from a few created forms with subsequent modification&quot;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Common descent was widely accepted amongst the [[scientific community]] after Darwin's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Krogh, David. (2005). ''Biology: A Guide to the Natural World''. Pearson/Prentice Hall. p. 323. {{ISBN|978-0321946768}} &quot;Descent with modification was accepted by most scientists not long after publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'' in 1859. Scientists accepted it because it explained so many facets of the living world.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon Kellogg]] commented that &quot;practically no naturalists of position and recognized attainment doubt the theory of descent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Kellogg, Vernon L]]. (1907). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismtodaydi00kell#page/3/mode/2up ''Darwinism To-Day'']. Henry Holt and Company. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No reliable observation has ever been found to contradict the general notion of common descent. It should come as no surprise, then, that the scientific community at large has accepted evolutionary descent as a historical reality since Darwin’s time and considers it among the most reliably established and fundamentally important facts in all of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s12052-007-0001-z|title = Evolution as Fact, Theory, and Path| journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach| volume=1| pages=46–52|year = 2008|last1 = Gregory|first1 = T.

===Common biochemistry===

All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organization: genetic information encoded in [[DNA]], transcribed into [[RNA]], through the effect of [[protein]]- and RNA-[[enzyme]]s, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) [[ribosome]]s, with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] and others as energy sources. Analysis of small sequence differences in widely shared substances such as [[cytochrome c]] further supports universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knight |first1=Robin |last2=Freeland |first2=Stephen J. |last3=Landweber |first3=Laura F. |date=January 2001 |title=Rewiring the keyboard: evolvability of the genetic code |journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=49–58 |doi=10.1038/35047500 |pmid=11253070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 23 proteins are found in all organisms, serving as [[enzyme]]s carrying out core functions like DNA replication.

The [[genetic code]] (the &quot;translation table&quot; according to which DNA information is translated into [[amino acid]]s, and hence proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] to [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt;

The way that [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) are mapped to [[amino acid]]s seems to be strongly optimised. Richard Egel argues that in particular the [[hydrophobic]] (non-polar) side-chains are well organised, suggesting that these enabled the earliest organisms to create [[peptide]]s with water-repelling regions able to support the essential electron exchange ([[redox]]) reactions for energy transfer.&lt;ref name=Egel&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egel |first1=Richard |title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life |journal=Life |date=March 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=170–212 |doi=10.3390/life2010170 |pmc=4187143 |pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selectively neutral similarities===

Similarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by [[convergent evolution]], and therefore they provide compelling support for universal common descent. Such evidence has come from two areas: [[amino acid]] sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical amino acid sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) that code redundantly for the same amino acid. Since many species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for their sharing a recent common ancestor. Had the amino acid sequences come from different ancestors, they would have been coded for by any of the redundant codons, and since the correct amino acids would already have been in place, [[natural selection]] would not have driven any change in the codons, however much time was available. [[Genetic drift]] could change the codons, but it would be extremely unlikely to make all the redundant codons in a whole sequence match exactly across multiple lineages. Similarly, shared nucleotide sequences, especially where these are apparently neutral such as the positioning of [[intron]]s and [[pseudogene]]s, provide strong evidence of common ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=N. S. |title=Continuity And Evolution Of Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7Q47fvCfLIC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=2005 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-8293-018-6 |pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other similarities===

Biologists often{{quantify|date=March 2018}} point to the universality of many aspects of cellular life as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|left-handed]]. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the [[Laws of science|laws of physics and chemistry]] - rather than through universal common descent - and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of [[ATPase#Transmembrane ATP synthases|Transmembrane ATPases]] throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeable and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.&lt;ref&gt;

===Phylogenetic trees===
{{PhylomapB|size=300px|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on [[ribosomal RNA]] genes implies a single origin for all life.}}
{{Main |Phylogenetic tree}}
{{See also |Tree of life (biology)}}

Another important piece of evidence is from detailed phylogenetic trees (i.e., &quot;genealogic trees&quot; of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010, Douglas L. Theobald published a statistical analysis of available genetic data,&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot; /&gt; mapping them to phylogenetic trees, that gave &quot;strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steel&quot; /&gt;

Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, [[embryology]], etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most [[genetic variation]] has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#independent_convergence |title=Prediction 1.3: Consilience of independent phylogenies |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |version=Version 2.89 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive|The TalkOrigins Foundation]] |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential objections==

[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|2005 [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] shows many [[horizontal gene transfer]]s, implying multiple possible origins.]]

===Gene exchange clouds phylogenetic analysis===
{{further|Horizontal gene transfer}}

Theobald noted that substantial [[horizontal gene transfer]] could have occurred during early evolution. Bacteria today remain capable of gene exchange between distantly-related lineages. This weakens the basic assumption of phylogenetic analysis, that similarity of genomes implies common ancestry, because sufficient gene exchange would allow lineages to share much of their genome whether or not they [[monophyly|shared an ancestor (monophyly)]]. This has led to questions about the single ancestry of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot; /&gt; However, biologists consider it very unlikely that completely unrelated proto-organisms could have exchanged genes, as their different coding mechanisms would have resulted only in garble rather than functioning systems. Later, however, many organisms all derived from a single ancestor could readily have shared genes that all worked in the same way, and it appears that they have.&lt;ref name=&quot;theobald&quot; /&gt;

===Convergent evolution===
{{further|Convergent evolution}}

If early organisms had been driven by the same environmental conditions to [[Convergent evolution|evolve similar biochemistry convergently]], they might independently have acquired similar genetic sequences. Theobald's &quot;formal test&quot; was accordingly criticised by Takahiro Yonezawa and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yonezawa |first1=Takahiro |last2=Hasegawa |first2=Masami |title=Was the universal common ancestry proved? |date=16 December 2010 |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E9 |doi=10.1038/nature09482 |pmid=21164432|bibcode=2010Natur.468E...9Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; for not including consideration of convergence. They argued that Theobald's test was insufficient to distinguish between the competing hypotheses. Theobald has defended his method against this claim, arguing that his tests distinguish between phylogenetic structure and mere sequence similarity. Therefore, Theobald argued, his results show that &quot;real universally [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] proteins are [[sequence homology|homologous]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=16 December 2010 |title=Theobald reply |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E10 |doi=10.1038/nature09483|bibcode=2010Natur.468E..10T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=24 November 2011 |title=On universal common ancestry, sequence similarity, and phylogenetic structure: The sins of P-values and the virtues of Bayesian evidence |journal=Biology Direct |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=60 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-6-60 |pmc=3314578 |pmid=22114984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
