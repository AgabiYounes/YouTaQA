'''''Citizen Kane''''' is a 1941 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] by [[Orson Welles]], its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star. The picture was Welles's [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. Nominated for [[14th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] in nine categories, it won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film ever made]], ''Citizen Kane'' was voted as such in five consecutive [[British Film Institute]] ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls of critics, and it topped the [[American Film Institute]]'s  [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies]] list in 1998, as well as its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|2007 update]]. ''Citizen Kane'' is particularly praised for [[Gregg Toland]]'s cinematography, [[Robert Wise]]'s editing, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s music, and its narrative structure, all of which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.

The [[film à clef|quasi-biographical film]] examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnates [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]], Chicago tycoons [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]], and aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers.

After the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] successes of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]] and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast &quot;[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]&quot; on ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Although it was unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'']], collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.

While a critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as [[André Bazin]] and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th-anniversary edition. ''Citizen Kane'' was an inductee of the 1989 inaugural group of 25 films that established the [[National Film Registry]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031213743/https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing - National Film Preservation Board &amp;#124; Programs &amp;#124; Library of Congress|date=October 31, 2016|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php|title=National Film Registry|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419221742/http://www.loc.gov/film/registry_titles.php|archivedate=April 19, 2012|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a mansion called [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]], part of a vast palatial estate in [[Florida]], the elderly [[Charles Foster Kane]] is on his deathbed. Holding a [[snow globe]], he utters a word, &quot;Rosebud&quot;, and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A [[newsreel]] obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of &quot;Rosebud&quot;.

Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach his wife, Susan Alexander Kane, now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.

In 1871, after a gold mine is discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he would be properly educated. It is also implied that Kane's father could be violent towards his son and that is another reason she wants to send him away. While Thatcher and Charles' parents discuss arrangements inside, the young Kane plays happily with a [[sled]] in the snow outside his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. Furious at the prospect of exile from his own family to live with a man he does not know, the boy strikes Thatcher with his sled and attempts to run away.

Years later, after gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the ''New York Inquirer'' and starts publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.

Back in the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the ''Inquirer''{{'}}s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the [[Spanish–American War]] and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.

Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a [[retirement home]]. Leland recalls how Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates more and more over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for [[Governor of New York]]. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the [[Political scandal|public scandal]] ends his political career. Leland asks to be transferred to a newspaper in Chicago. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating [[opera]]tic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition, even building a large opera house for her. Leland begins to write a negative review of Susan's opera debut; Kane fires him, but finishes the negative review and prints it.
 
Back in the present, Susan now consents to an interview with Thompson and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan leaves him, Kane begins violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says &quot;Rosebud&quot;.

Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain an enigma.

Back at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded by the staff. They find the sled on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. Deeming it junk, they throw it into a furnace. As the sled burns, the camera reveals its trade name, ignored by the staff: &quot;Rosebud.&quot;

Following &quot;[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]&quot; broadcast of his CBS radio series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was lured to Hollywood with a remarkable contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Carringer |first=Robert L. |title=The Making of Citizen Kane |url=https://archive.org/details/makingofcitizenk00carr |url-access=registration |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1985 |isbn=978-0-520-20567-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} [[RKO Pictures]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J.

At first he simply wanted to spend three months in Hollywood and earn enough money to pay his debts and fund his next theatrical season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Welles first arrived on July 20, 1939&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|168|December 2014}} and on his first tour, he called the movie studio &quot;the greatest electric train set a boy ever had&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|174}}

Welles signed his contract with RKO on August 21, which stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both projects' stories&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|169|December 2014}} and so long as the budget did not exceed $500,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} RKO executives would not be allowed to see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|169|December 2014}} Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the [[final cut privilege|right of final cut]]. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: &quot;The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was going to pull off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}}

[[File:Orson-Home-1939.jpg|thumb|left|Orson Welles at his Hollywood home in 1939, during the long months it took to launch his first film project]]
Welles spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get his first project going, without success. &quot;They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there,&quot; wrote ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|15}} It was agreed that Welles would film ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', previously adapted for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', which would be presented entirely through a [[Point of view shot|first-person camera]]. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera—unheard of at the time—the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget.{{efn|&quot;I did a very elaborate production for [''Heart of Darkness''], such as I've never done again—never could,&quot; Welles said. &quot;I shot my bolt on preproduction on that picture. We designed every camera setup and everything else—did enormous research in aboriginal, Stone Age cultures in order to reproduce what the story called for. I'm sorry not to have got the chance to do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|31}}}}{{efn|Welles later used the subjective camera in ''The Magnificent Ambersons'', in a sequence that was later all but eliminated because it did not work in that picture. &quot;''Heart of Darkness'' is one of the few stories that it's very well adapted to, because it relies so heavily on narration,&quot; Welles said. &quot;The camera was going to be Marlow&amp;nbsp;... He's in the pilot house and he can see himself reflected in the glass through which you see the jungle. So it isn't that business of a hand-held camera mooching around pretending to walk like a man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|31}}}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|30–31}} Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; as war loomed, revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brady&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|215–216}}

He then started work on the idea that became ''Citizen Kane''. Knowing the script would take time to prepare, Welles suggested to RKO that while that was being done—&quot;so the year wouldn't be lost&quot;—he make a humorous political thriller.

One of the long-standing controversies about ''Citizen Kane'' has been the authorship of the screenplay.&lt;ref name=Meryman&gt;{{cite book |last=Meryman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Meryman |title=Mank: The Wit, World and Life of Herman Mankiewicz |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]], Inc. |location=New York |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-688-03356-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/mankwitworldlife00mery}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|237}} Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J.

In February 1940 Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of [[John Houseman]], Welles's former partner in the [[Mercury Theatre]]. Welles later explained, &quot;I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welles |first1=Orson |authorlink1=Orson Welles |last2=Bogdanovich |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Bogdanovich |last3=Rosenbaum |first3=Jonathan |authorlink3=Jonathan Rosenbaum |title=[[This is Orson Welles]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers |location=New York |date=1992 |isbn=0-06-016616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|54}} Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, &quot;At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|54}}

The terms of the contract stated that Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work, as he was hired as a [[script doctor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Callow |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Callow |title=Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu |publisher=[[Viking]] |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-670-86722-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/orsonwellesvolum00simo}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|487}} Before he signed the contract Mankiewicz was particularly advised by his agents that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the &quot;author and creator&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brady&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|236–237}} As the film neared release, however, Mankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film—including threats to place full-page ads in trade papers and to get his friend [[Ben Hecht]] to write an exposé for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|204}}

After lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when the studio, [[RKO Pictures]], awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant [[Richard Wilson (director)|Richard Wilson]] said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles.

Questions over the authorship of the ''Citizen Kane'' screenplay were revived in 1971 by influential film critic [[Pauline Kael]], whose controversial 50,000-word essay &quot;[[Raising Kane]]&quot; was commissioned as an introduction to the shooting script in ''The Citizen Kane Book'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|494}} published in October 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;CK Book Coming&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Citizen Kane Film Book Due in Fall |newspaper=[[The Bakersfield Californian]] |date=June 6, 1971 |quote=On Oct. 28, Atlantic–Little, Brown will publish ''The Citizen Kane Book'', an outsize volume that will include not only 'Raising Kane' but also, as Miss Kael had always intended, the complete, original text of the Mankiewicz–Welles shooting script, published here for the first time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book-length essay first appeared in February 1971, in two consecutive issues of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|494}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Raising Kane&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kael |first1=Pauline |author-link1=Pauline Kael |last2=Welles |first2=Orson  |author-link2=Orson Welles |last3=Mankiewicz |first3=Herman J. |author-link3=Herman J.

&quot;He trained us for films at the same time that he was training himself,&quot; recalled Agnes Moorehead. &quot;Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors.

In the end of July, RKO approved the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming &quot;tests&quot; for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had been so good that there was no need to re-shoot them. The first official scene to be shot was the breakfast montage sequence between Kane and his first wife Emily.

Welles usually worked 16 to 18 hours a day on the film. He often began work at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's shooting with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|194|December 2014}}

[[Principal photography|Principal shooting]] wrapped October 24.

Filming resumed November 15&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|87}} with some re-shoots. Toland had to leave due to a commitment to shoot Howard Hughes' ''[[The Outlaw]]'', but Toland's camera crew continued working on the film and Toland was replaced by RKO cinematographer [[Harry J.

The final day of shooting on November 30 was Kane's death scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles boasted that he only went 21 days over his official shooting schedule, without factoring in the month of &quot;camera tests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|195|December 2014}} According to RKO records, the film cost $839,727.

===Post-production===
''Citizen Kane'' was edited by [[Robert Wise]] and assistant editor [[Mark Robson (film director)|Mark Robson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the &quot;camera tests&quot; and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles &quot;had an older editor assigned to him for those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits.&quot; Wise and Robson began editing the film while it was still shooting and said that they &quot;could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1210}}

Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|109}} The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Complete&quot;/&gt; The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film &quot;in camera&quot; by leaving few options of how it could be put together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|110}} Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct &quot;timing&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; for the [[whip pan]]s and overlapping dialogue.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Complete&quot;/&gt; The ''News on the March'' sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|110}} They used [[stock footage]] from [[Pathé News]] and the General Film Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFIcat&quot;/&gt;

Stewart to re-do their work several times until he was satisfied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|109}}

Welles hired Bernard Herrmann to compose the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in as few as two or three weeks after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had sufficient time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Herrmann&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Herrmann |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Herrmann |title=Score for a Film |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trailer===
{{Main|Citizen Kane trailer}}

Written and directed by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the [[theatrical trailer]] for ''Citizen Kane'' differs from other trailers in that it did not feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, [[tongue-in-cheek]], [[mockumentary|pseudo-documentary]] piece on the film's production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunches&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|230}} Filmed at the same time as ''Citizen Kane'' itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|360}} The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of [[Everett Sloane]] appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus DVD trailer&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Citizen Kane (Theatrical Trailer) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]] |date=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was almost unprecedented for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while ''Citizen Kane'' is frequently cited as a groundbreaking, influential film, [[Simon Callow]] argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has &quot;great playful charm&amp;nbsp;... it is a miniature [[documentary]], almost an introduction to the cinema&amp;nbsp;... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: Without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [sic] minutes' duration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Callow&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|558–9}}

==Style==
Film scholars and historians view ''Citizen Kane'' as Welles's attempt to create a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of it and combining them into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started working on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, &quot;Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Estrin&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|80}}

[[David Bordwell]] wrote that &quot;The best way to understand ''Citizen Kane'' is to stop worshiping it as a triumph of technique.&quot; Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, and that many of these stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''. But Bordwell asserts that the film did put them all together for the first time and perfected the medium in one single film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1171}} In a 1948 interview, [[D. W. Griffith]] said, &quot;I loved ''Citizen Kane'' and particularly loved the ideas he took from me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=Ezra |title=Flash-Back to Griffith |publisher=PM |date=May 19, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against the film's cinematic innovations were made as early as 1946 when French historian [[Georges Sadoul]] wrote, &quot;The film is an encyclopedia of old techniques.&quot; He pointed out such examples as compositions that used both the foreground and the background in the films of [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], special effects used in the films of [[Georges Méliès]], shots of the ceiling in [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s ''[[Greed (1924 film)|Greed]]'' and newsreel montages in the films of [[Dziga Vertov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sadoul |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Sadoul |title=Le Cinéma: Hypertrophie ducerveau ̄ Review of ''Citizen Kane'' |publisher=[[Les Lettres Françaises]], number 115 |location=Paris, France |date=July 5, 1946 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French film critic André Bazin defended the film, writing: &quot;In this respect, the accusation of plagiarism could very well be extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide.&quot; Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since ''Citizen Kane'' used more sophisticated lenses,&lt;ref name=BazinatWork&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bazin |first1=André |editor-last=Cardullo |editor-first=Bert |authorlink1=André Bazin |title=Bazin at Work: Major Essays &amp; Reviews From the Forties &amp; Fifties |publisher=Rutledge |location=New York &amp; London |date=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-90018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|232}} but acknowledged that it had similarities to such previous works as ''[[49th Parallel (film)|The 49th Parallel]]'' and ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Bazin stated that &quot;even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in ''Citizen Kane'', one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their ''meaning''.&quot;&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|233}} Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believed that the film's use of special effects contradicted some of Bazin's theories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minding&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |last2=Thompson |first2=Kristin |title=Minding Movies.

===Storytelling techniques===
''Citizen Kane'' rejects the traditional linear, chronological narrative and tells Kane's story entirely in flashbacks using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the [[unreliable narrator]] in literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fabe |first=Marilyn |title=Closely Watched Films: an introduction to the art of narrative film technique |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-23891-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/closelywatchedfi00fabe_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|83}} Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life, a technique not used previously in Hollywood films.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|81}} Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story overlapping another.&lt;ref name=&quot;politics&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gianos |first=Phillip |title=Politics and politicians in American film |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-275-96766-6 |pages=170–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|82–84}}

The technique of flashbacks had been used in earlier films, notably ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933),&lt;ref name=&quot;Robbin Coons&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Coons |first=Robbin |date=May 1, 1941 |title=Hollywood Sights and Sounds |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19410501&amp;id=yOIcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3353,2902994 |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |location=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no film was as immersed in it as ''Citizen Kane''. Thompson the reporter acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;politics&quot;/&gt;

Films typically had an &quot;omniscient perspective&quot; at the time, which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the &quot;illusion that we are looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze&quot;. ''Citizen Kane'' also begins in that fashion until the ''News on the March'' sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|81}} The ''News on the March'' sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) at the beginning of the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead, the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what &quot;Rosebud&quot; means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what &quot;Rosebud&quot; is.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|82–83}}

===Cinematography===

The most innovative technical aspect of ''Citizen Kane'' is the extended use of [[deep focus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogle&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ogle |first1=Patrick L. |last2=Nichols |first2=Bill |authorlink2=Bill Nichols |title=Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States |publisher=University of California Press |date=1985 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the foreground, background, and everything in between are all in sharp focus. Cinematographer Toland did this through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Toland described the achievement in an article for ''Theatre Arts'' magazine, made possible by the sensitivity of modern speed film:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New developments in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced stage of the game but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed &quot;Pan-focus&quot;, as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in ''Citizen Kane''. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellesnet Toland&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 |last=Toland |first=Gregg |authorlink=Gregg Toland |title=The Motion Picture Cameraman |publisher=Theatre Arts, Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource |date=September 1941 |accessdate=September 21, 2013 |pages=646–654 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121044956/http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 |archive-date=January 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another unorthodox method used in the film was the low-angle shots facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Every set was built with a ceiling&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellesnet Toland&quot;/&gt; which broke with studio convention, and many were constructed of fabric that concealed microphones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert Viewer's Companion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/a-viewers-companion-to-citizen-kane |title=A Viewer's Companion to Citizen Kane |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=January 1, 2004 |website=Roger Ebert's Journal |accessdate=December 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216072938/http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/a-viewers-companion-to-citizen-kane |archive-date=December 16, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles felt that the camera should show what the eye sees, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend that there was no ceiling—&quot;a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there,&quot; he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}}

Welles credited Toland on the same title card as himself. &quot;It's impossible to say how much I owe to Gregg,&quot; he said. &quot;He was superb.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eyman |first1=Scott |last2=Duncan |first2=Paul |date=2004 |title=John Ford, The Complete Films |url= |location=					Köln; Los Angeles |publisher=Taschen |page=116 |isbn=978-3-8228-3093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called Toland &quot;the best director of photography that ever existed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cahiers 65&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rubio |first1=Juan Cobos Miguel |last2=Pruneda |first2=Jose Antonio |title=Interview with Orson Welles |publisher=Cahiers du Cinéma, number 165 |location=Paris, France |date=April 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s sound was recorded by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer [[James G. Stewart]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85}} both of whom had worked in radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|102}} Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles &quot;deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Complete&quot;/&gt; Although the film is known for its complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|102}}

Welles used techniques from radio like overlapping dialogue. The scene in which characters sing &quot;Oh, Mr. Kane&quot; was especially complicated and required mixing several soundtracks together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|104}} He also used different &quot;sound perspectives&quot; to create the illusion of distances,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|101}} such as in scenes at Xanadu where characters speak to each other at far distances.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Complete&quot;/&gt; Welles experimented with sound in post-production, creating audio montages,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schatz |first1=Thomas |title=History of the American Cinema, volume 6: Boom and bust, the American cinema in the 1940s |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London |date=1997 |isbn=0-520-22130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|94}} and chose to create all of the sound effects for the film instead of using RKO's library of sound effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|100}}

Welles used an aural technique from radio called the &quot;lightning-mix&quot;. Welles used this technique to link complex [[film editing|montage]] sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into a young man in just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |title=A History of Narrative Film |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofnarrati00cook |url-access=registration |publisher=[[W.

Film critic and director [[François Truffaut]] wrote that &quot;Before ''Kane'', nobody in Hollywood knew how to set music properly in movies. ''Kane'' was the first, in fact the only, great film that uses radio techniques.&amp;nbsp;... A lot of filmmakers know enough to follow [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Auguste Renoir]]'s advice to fill the eyes with images at all costs, but only Orson Welles understood that the sound track had to be filled in the same way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedancingimage.blogspot.com/2009/06/three-by-truffaut.html |last1=Truffaut |first1=François |authorlink1=François Truffaut |last2=Mayhew |first2=Leonard (translator) |title=The Films in My Life |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |date=1978 |isbn=0-306-80599-5 |page=282 |access-date=June 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323111502/http://thedancingimage.blogspot.com/2009/06/three-by-truffaut.html |archive-date=March 23, 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cedric Belfrage]] of ''The Clipper'' wrote &quot;of all of the delectable flavours that linger on the palate after seeing ''Kane'', the use of sound is the strongest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1171}}

===Make-up===
The make-up for ''Citizen Kane'' was created and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior member of the RKO make-up department.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Dick |authorlink=Dick Smith (make-up artist) |date=October–November 1999 |title=Citizen Seiderman |url=http://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=211197&amp;p=18# |journal=Make-Up Artist Magazine |issue=21 |pages=18–25 |accessdate=January 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207215356/http://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=211197&amp;p=18 |archive-date=February 7, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|19}} He had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|19}} &quot;Apprentices were not supposed to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present,&quot; wrote make-up artist [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]], who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. &quot;During his years at RKO I suspect these rules were probably overlooked often.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|19}} &quot;Seiderman had gained a reputation as one of the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood,&quot; wrote biographer Frank Brady.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brady&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|253}}

On an early tour of RKO, Welles met Seiderman in the small make-up lab that he created for himself in an unused dressing room.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|19}} &quot;Welles fastened on to him at once,&quot; wrote biographer Charles Higham, as Seiderman had developed his own makeup methods &quot;that ensured complete naturalness of expression—a naturalness unrivaled in Hollywood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Higham&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|157}} Seiderman developed a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster cast of the face of each of the actors who aged. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gambill |first=Norman |date=November–December 1978 |title=Making Up Kane |journal=[[Film Comment]] |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=42–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|46}}

&quot;My sculptural techniques for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, onto the surface of each bust,&quot; Seiderman told Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect, he cast the clay pieces in a soft plastic material&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|46}} that he formulated himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|20}} These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|46–47}}

Before the actors went before the cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied directly to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|43}} The red ground resulted in a warmth of tone that was picked up by the [[panchromatic film]]. Over that was applied liquid grease paint, and finally a colorless translucent talcum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|42–43}} Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast made from an orange peel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|42, 47}}

Welles often arrived on the set at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|69}} as application of the sculptural make-up took 3½ hours for the oldest incarnation of Kane. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast, and stomach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} &quot;In the film and production photographs, you can see that Kane had a belly that overhung,&quot; Seiderman said. &quot;That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman worked with Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a flexible skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When he found the wigs too full, he untied one hair at a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|43, 47}} He also made [[scleral lens]]es for Welles, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris, and Everett Sloane to dull the brightness of their young eyes. The lenses took a long time to fit properly, and Seiderman began work on them before devising any of the other makeup. &quot;I painted them to age in phases, ending with the blood vessels and the ''[[arcus senilis]]'' of old age.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|47}} Seiderman's tour de force was the breakfast montage, shot all in one day. &quot;Twelve years, two years shot at each scene,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|47}}

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|right|Kane ages convincingly in the breakfast montage, make-up artist Maurice Seiderman's tour de force]]

The major studios gave screen credit for make-up only to the department head. When RKO make-up department head [[Mel Berns]] refused to share credit with Seiderman, who was only an apprentice, Welles told Berns that there would be no make-up credit. Welles signed a large advertisement in the Los Angeles newspaper:&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|22}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambill&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|48}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO GETS SCREEN CREDIT FOR &quot;CITIZEN KANE&quot;&lt;br&gt;AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO DON'T&lt;br&gt;TO ALL THE ACTORS, THE CREW, THE OFFICE, THE MUSICIANS, EVERYBODY&lt;br&gt;AND PARTICULARLY TO MAURICE SEIDERMAN, THE BEST MAKE-UP MAN IN THE WORLD&lt;ref name=&quot;Citizen Seiderman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|20}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sets===
Although credited as an assistant, the film's art direction was done by [[Perry Ferguson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|37}} In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a [[periscope]] in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design was an integral part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|42}}

In the original script the Great Hall at Xanadu was modeled after the Great Hall in Hearst Castle and its design included a mixture of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|50–51}} &quot;The Hearstian element is brought out in the almost perverse juxtaposition of incongruous architectural styles and motifs,&quot; wrote Carringer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|54}} Before RKO cut the film's budget, Ferguson's designs were more elaborate and resembled the production designs of early [[Cecil B. DeMille]] films and ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|55}} The budget cuts reduced Ferguson's budget by 33 percent and his work cost $58,775 total,&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|65}} which was below average at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatz&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|93}}

To save costs Ferguson and Welles re-wrote scenes in Xanadu's living room and transported them to the Great Hall. A large staircase from another film was found and used at no additional cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|56–57}} When asked about the limited budget, Ferguson said &quot;Very often—as in that much-discussed 'Xanadu' set in ''Citizen Kane''—we can make a foreground piece, a background piece, and imaginative lighting suggests a great deal more on the screen than actually exists on the stage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|65–66}} According to the film's official budget there were 81 sets built, but Ferguson said there were between 106 and 116.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|64}}

Still photographs of [[Oheka Castle]] in [[Huntington, New York]], were used in the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oheka.com/film-photo-shoots.htm |title=Oheka Castle&amp;nbsp;– Film, Television and Photography Productions |publisher=Oheka.com |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403203423/http://www.oheka.com/film-photo-shoots.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/06/nyregion/c-corrections-910389.html |title=Corrections |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 6, 1989 |access-date=February 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219230154/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/06/nyregion/c-corrections-910389.html |archive-date=December 19, 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek]] to [[Gothic art|German Gothic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|61}} The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of [[muslin]] fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|64–65}} Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|65}}

===Special effects===
The film's special effects were supervised by RKO department head [[Vernon L. Walker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene in which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera [[Crane shot|craning]] upwards over the performance scene, then a [[wipe (transition)|curtain wipe]] to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=François |editor-last=Naremore |editor-first=James |chapter=''Citizen Kane'': The Sound Track |title=Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK and New York |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&amp;pg=PA173 |isbn=978-0-19-515891-5 |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |page=173 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226021819/http://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&amp;pg=PA173 |archive-date=December 26, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shots included [[Rear projection effect|rear screen projection]] in the background, such as Thompson's interview of Leland and some of the ocean backgrounds at Xanadu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|88}} Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used rear screen projection to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minding&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|74}} A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the [[Close-up#Types of close-up|extreme close-up]] shots such as Kane's lips when he says &quot;Rosebud&quot; and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|88}}

Optical effects artist Dunn claimed that &quot;up to 80 percent of some reels was optically printed.&quot; These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jewell |first=Richard B. |title=The Golden Age of Cinema.

Any time deep focus was impossible—as in the scene in which Kane finishes a negative review of Susan's opera while at the same time firing the person who began writing the review—an [[optical printer]] was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|92}} However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of [[in-camera effect]]s, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|82}}

===Music===
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Showgirls.jpg|thumb|right|Incidental music includes the publisher's theme, &quot;Oh, Mr. Kane&quot;, a tune by [[Pepe Guízar]] with special lyrics by Herman Ruby.]]
The [[Film score|film's music]] was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Steven C. |title=A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, California |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-520-22939-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|72}} Herrmann had composed for Welles for his Mercury Theatre radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|63}} Because it was Herrmann's first motion picture score, RKO wanted to pay him only a small fee, but Welles insisted he be paid at the same rate as [[Max Steiner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|72}}

Instead Herrmann used what he later described as &quot;radio scoring&quot;, musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|77–78}} The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/CitizenKanefilmscore.htm |title=70th anniversary of Citizen Kane and Bernard Herrmann's film score |accessdate=April 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718223803/http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/CitizenKanefilmscore.htm |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/citi4.html |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Citizen Kane, page 4 |publisher=filmsite.org |accessdate=November 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205054250/http://www.filmsite.org/citi4.html |archive-date=December 5, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring [[leitmotif]] played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of [[alto flute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmscorerundowns.net/herrmann/citizenkane.pdf |last=Wrobel |first=Bill |title=Herrmann's &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; |format=PDF |date=November 4, 2001 |accessdate=July 31, 2013 |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412125013/http://www.filmscorerundowns.net/herrmann/citizenkane.pdf |archive-date=April 12, 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a [[Mary Garden]] vehicle, an aria from ''[[Salammbô]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|57}} &quot;Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown,&quot; Herrmann said.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|79}} Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Herrmann&quot;/&gt; Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|79–80}} Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore.&lt;ref name=&quot;americancomposers&quot;/&gt; Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on [[Jean Racine]]'s ''[[Athalie]]'' and ''[[Phedre]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Houseman RT&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|460–461}} although some confusion remains since [[Lucille Fletcher]] remembered preparing the lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|80}} Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera ''[[Wuthering Heights (Herrmann)|Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|11}}

Music enthusiasts consider the scene in which Susan Alexander Kane attempts to sing the famous cavatina &quot;Una voce poco fa&quot; from ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]] with vocal coach Signor Matiste as especially memorable for depicting the horrors of learning music through mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concertonet.com/scripts/review.php?ID_review=2748 |last=Kirshnit |first=Frederick L. |title=Champagne and Pomade |publisher=ConcertoNet.com |location=Paris, France |date=December 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210138/http://www.concertonet.com/scripts/review.php?ID_review=2748 |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Herrmann said, &quot;I was fortunate to start my career with a film like ''Citizen Kane'', it's been a downhill run ever since!&quot; Welles loved Herrmann's score and told director [[Henry Jaglom]] that it was 50 percent responsible for the film's artistic success.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|84}}

Some incidental music came from other sources. Welles heard the tune used for the publisher's theme, &quot;Oh, Mr. Kane&quot;, in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|57}} Called &quot;A Poco No&quot;, the song was written by [[Pepe Guízar]] and special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrmann Cues&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folk.uib.no/smkgg/midi/soundtrackweb/herrmann/db/cuesheets/film_citizenkane.html |title=Cue Sheet: Citizen Kane |date=April 22, 1941 |publisher=The Bernard Herrmann Society |accessdate=December 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226211724/http://folk.uib.no/smkgg/midi/soundtrackweb/herrmann/db/cuesheets/film_citizenkane.html |archive-date=December 26, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the music used in the newsreel came from the RKO music library, edited at Welles's request by the newsreel department to achieve what Herrmann called &quot;their own crazy way of cutting&quot;. The ''News on the March'' theme that accompanies the newsreel titles is &quot;Belgian March&quot; by [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]], from the film ''[[Nurse Edith Cavell]]''. Other examples are an excerpt from [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s score for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (the exploration of Xanadu), [[Roy Webb]]'s theme for the film ''[[Reno (1939 film)|Reno]]'' (the growth of Kane's empire), and bits of Webb's score for ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (introducing Walter Parks Thatcher).&lt;ref name=&quot;stephensmith&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|79}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Herrmann Cues&quot;/&gt;

===Editing===
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Warrick-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|right|Orson Welles and Ruth Warrick in the breakfast montage]]
One of the editing techniques used in ''Citizen Kane'' was the use of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Costanzo Cahir |first=Linda |title=Literature into film: theory and practical approaches |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7864-2597-6 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene &quot;was stolen from ''[[The Long Christmas Dinner]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]]&amp;nbsp;... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|51|date=June 2012}} The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|90–91}}

Welles was influenced by the editing theories of [[Sergei Eisenstein]] by using jarring cuts that caused &quot;sudden graphic or associative contrasts&quot;, such as the cut from Kane's deathbed to the beginning of the ''News on the March'' sequence and a sudden shot of a shrieking bird at the beginning of Raymond's flashback.&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|88–89}} Although the film typically favors mise-en-scène over montage, the scene in which Kane goes to Susan Alexander's apartment after first meeting her is the only one that is primarily cut as close-ups with shots and counter shots between Kane and Susan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|68}} Fabe says that &quot;by using a standard Hollywood technique sparingly, [Welles] revitalizes its psychological expressiveness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;watched&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|88}}

==Political themes==
Laura Mulvey explored the anti-fascist themes of ''Citizen Kane'' in her 1992 monograph for the [[British Film Institute]]. The ''News on the March'' newsreel presents Kane keeping company with Hitler and other dictators while he smugly assures the public that there will be no war.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |date=2006 |title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?

Roosevelt]] was laboring to win public opinion for entering World War II. &quot;In the rhetoric of ''Citizen Kane'',&quot; Mulvey writes, &quot;the destiny of isolationism is realised in metaphor: in Kane's own fate, dying wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|15}}

Journalist [[Ignacio Ramonet]] has cited the film as an early example of mass media manipulation of public opinion and the power that media conglomerates have on influencing the democratic process.

==Reception==
===Pre-release controversy===
To ensure that Hearst's life's influence on ''Citizen Kane'' was a secret, Welles limited access to [[dailies]] and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in ''Stage'' magazine compared the film's narrative to ''[[Faust]]'' and made no mention of Hearst.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111}}

The film was scheduled to premiere at RKO's flagship theater [[Radio City Music Hall]] on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}} Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} for such magazines as ''Life'', ''Look'' and ''Redbook''. Gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] (an arch-rival of Louella Parsons, and Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a &quot;vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man&quot; and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}}

''Friday'' magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was so nice to him and that she should &quot;wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss.&quot; Welles immediately denied making the statement and the editor of ''Friday'' admitted that it might be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}}

[[File:Louella-Parsons-1937.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Film columnist and Hearst employee [[Louella Parsons]] was humiliated by ''Citizen Kane'' and made numerous threats to prevent the film's release.]]
Shortly after ''Friday''{{'}}s article, Hearst sent Parsons an angry letter complaining that he had learned about ''Citizen Kane'' from Hopper and not her. The incident made a fool of Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Directors in Action&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|11}}

Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released ''Kane''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they not screen it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} The next day, the front page headline in ''Daily Variety'' read, &quot;HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyvariety&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Hearst Bans RKO From Papers |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |date=January 10, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst began this ban by suppressing promotion of RKO's ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatz&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|94}} but in two weeks the ban was lifted for everything except ''Kane.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}}

When Schaefer did not submit to Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats on behalf of Hearst to expose the private lives of people throughout the entire film industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} Welles was threatened with an exposé about his romance with the married actress [[Dolores del Rio]], who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|207|December 2014}} In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve ''Kane''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the haven of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|209|December 2014}} Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by [[Nicholas Schenck]], head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s parent company, with an offer on the behalf of [[Louis B. Mayer]] and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|111–112|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson2001&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-greatest-story-ever-told-sixty-years-of-citizen-kane-682857.html |last=Thomson |first=David |title=The greatest story ever told: Sixty years of Citizen Kane |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=April 28, 2001 |accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that ''Kane'' would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|112|date=April 2012}} There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|112–113|date=April 2012}} Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|113|date=April 2012}}

===Hearst's response===
Hearing about ''Citizen Kane'' enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists [[libel]] Welles.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson2001&quot;/&gt; Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomson2001&quot;/&gt; A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1 million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A ''Hollywood Review'' headline read, &quot;Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture&quot;. The ''Motion Picture Herald'' reported about the screening and Hearst's intention to sue RKO. ''Time'' magazine wrote that &quot;The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people who have seen the film at private screenings, ''Citizen Kane'' is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry.&quot; A second press screening occurred in April.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatz&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|94}}

When Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film.

The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt; Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasaw |first=David |authorlink=David Nasaw |title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst |url=https://archive.org/details/chieflifeofwilli0000nasa |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston,MA |date=2000 |isbn=0-395-82759-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|572–573|date=April 2012}}

Hearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film. Welles said that while he was on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not to go back to his hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. &quot;But that wasn't Hearst,&quot; Welles said, &quot;that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85–86}}

In March 1941 Welles directed a Broadway version of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Native Son]]'' (and, for luck, used a &quot;Rosebud&quot; sled as a prop). ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' received positive reviews, but Hearst-owned papers used the opportunity to attack Welles as a communist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leaming OW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|213|December 2014}} The Hearst papers vociferously attacked Welles after his April 1941 radio play, &quot;His Honor, the Mayor&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/otr_freecompany |title=His Honor, the Mayor |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=February 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009225441/https://archive.org/details/otr_freecompany |archive-date=October 9, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced for The Free Company radio series on CBS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bret Wood&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Bret |authorlink=Bret Wood |title=Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |date=1990 |isbn=0-313-26538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellesnet His Honor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=186 |title=Orson Welles defends American civil liberties in His Honor the Mayor |publisher=Wellesnet.com |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224030954/http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=186 |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welles described his chance encounter with Hearst in an elevator at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] on the night ''Citizen Kane'' opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would like to come to the opening. Hearst did not respond. &quot;As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply&quot;, recalled Welles. &quot;And Kane would have you know. That was his style—just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles TIOW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|49–50}}

In 1945 Hearst journalist Robert Shaw wrote that the film got &quot;a full tide of insensate fury&quot; from Hearst papers, &quot;then it ebbed suddenly. With one brain cell working, the chief realized that such hysterical barking by the trained seals would attract too much attention to the picture.

It was widely believed the film would win most of its Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz.

[[André Bazin]], a little-known film critic working for Sartre's ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', was asked to give an [[Impromptu speaking|impromptu speech]] about the film after a screening at the Colisée Theatre in the autumn of 1946&lt;ref name=Truffaut/&gt;{{Rp|36}} and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article &quot;The Technique of Citizen Kane&quot;,&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|125}} which directly influenced public opinion about the film.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|124}} Carringer wrote that Bazin was &quot;the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|118}}{{efn|Bordwell has hypothesized that Bazin was influenced by publicity about the film's innovations that were published in France during its first release. These included interviews by Welles and the publication of Toland's article &quot;The Motion Picture Cameraman&quot; in the January 1947 issue of ''La Revue du Cinéma''. Bordwell believes that Bazin was aware of the legend of film's innovations before having seen it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minding&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|72–73}}}} Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in [[mise en scène]]. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular [[Soviet montage theory]]&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|xiii}} and the politically [[Marxist]] and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time.&lt;ref name=Truffaut/&gt;{{Rp|36}} Bazin believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their &quot;will&quot; on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported.&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|xiii}} Bazin wrote that ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s mise en scène created a &quot;new conception of filmmaking&quot;&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|233}} and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|128}} Bazin wrote extensively about the mise en scène in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene.&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|234}} Bazin wrote that the film's mise en scène &quot;forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film&quot;  and creates &quot;a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minding&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|72}}

In his 1950 essay &quot;The Evolution of the Language of Cinema&quot;, Bazin placed ''Citizen Kane'' center stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.&lt;ref name=WIC&gt;{{cite book |last=Bazin |first=André |author-link=André Bazin |translator-last=Gray |translator-first=Hugh |orig-year=1950 |chapter=The Evolution of the Language of Cinema |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1#page/n32/mode/1up |title=What is Cinema? |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |publication-date=1967 |pages=23–40 |isbn=978-0-520-24227-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|37}} One of the first critics to defend motion pictures as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film as an example of cinema as an art form&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|129}} and wrote that &quot;Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have.&quot;&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|236}} Bazin also compared the film to [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Paisà]]'' for having &quot;the same aesthetic concept of realism&quot;&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|117–118}} and to the films of [[William Wyler]] shot by Toland (such as ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' and ''The Best Years of Our Lives''), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called &quot;a dialectical step forward in film language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minding&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|71}}

Bazin's praise of the film went beyond film theory and reflected his own philosophy towards life itself.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|125}} His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|128}} Bazin believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning. It portrayed the world as ambiguous and full of contradictions, whereas films up until then simply portrayed people's actions and motivations.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|130}} Bazin's biographer [[Dudley Andrew]] wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world of ''Citizen Kane'', that mysterious, dark, and infinitely deep world of space and memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|129}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bazin went on to co-found ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', whose contributors (including future film directors François Truffaut and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]) also praised the film.&lt;ref name=WIC/&gt;{{Rp|37}} The popularity of Truffaut's [[auteur theory]] helped the film's and Welles's reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |authorlink1=David Bordwell |last2=Thompson |first2=Kristin |authorlink2=Kristin Thompson |title=Film History: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/filmhistoryintro00thom_0 |url-access=registration |publisher=McGraw-Hill inc. |location=New York |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|263}}

===Re-evaluation===
By 1942 ''Citizen Kane'' had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, ''The Film Till Now'', dismissed ''Citizen Kane'' as &quot;...&amp;nbsp;tinpot if not crackpot [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|117–118|date=April 2012}}

In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year ''Citizen Kane'' started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played ''[[King Lear]]''; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote &quot;Citizen Kane: The American Baroque&quot; for ''[[Film Culture]]'', and described it as &quot;the great American film&quot; and &quot;the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since ''[[Birth of a Nation]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sarris&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarris |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sarris |title=Citizen Kane: The American Baroque |publisher=[[Film Culture]], number 9 |year=1956 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|119}}

During [[Expo 58]], a poll of over 100 film historians named ''Kane'' one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Newman |first1=Kim |authorlink1=Kim Newman |last2=Freer |first2=Ian |authorlink2=Ian Freer |last3=Fraser |first3=Rob |title=Citizen Kane |magazine=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date=July 2003 |pages=146–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|152}}

In the decades since, its critical status as [[films that have been considered the greatest ever|the greatest film ever made]] has grown, with numerous essays and books on it including Peter Cowie's ''The Cinema of Orson Welles'', Ronald Gottesman's ''Focus on Citizen Kane'', a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, &quot;Raising Kane&quot;, which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|120|date=April 2012}} Despite its criticism of Welles, it further popularized the notion of ''Citizen Kane'' as the great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|119|date=April 2012}} David Thomson said that the film 'grows with every year as America comes to resemble it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|1172}}

The cinematography influenced [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Cinematographer [[Arthur Edeson]] used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that ''Citizen Kane'' did.

Its cinematography, lighting, and flashback structure influenced such [[film noir]]s of the 1940s and 1950s as ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', ''[[Keeper of the Flame (film)|Keeper of the Flame]]'', ''[[Caught (1949 film)|Caught]]'', ''[[The Great Man]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Cook&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|425}} and ''[[This Gun for Hire]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carringer TMOCK&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|85–86}} David Bordwell and [[Kristin Thompson]] have written that &quot;For over a decade thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements.&quot; However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and [[Cinéma vérité]] movements favored &quot;flatter, more shallow images with softer focus&quot; and ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell Thompson&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|798}} Its use of long takes influenced films such as ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'', and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced ''[[Gun Crazy]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell Thompson&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|389–390}} ''[[The Whip Hand]]'', ''[[The Devil's General]]'' and ''[[Justice Is Done]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell Thompson&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|414}} The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced ''[[La commare secca]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell Thompson&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|533}} and ''[[Man of Marble]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell Thompson&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|747}}

The film's structure influenced the biographical films ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]''—which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]''.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;{{Rp|154}} Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to ''Mr. Arkadin'', as well as the theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with ''Citizen Kane'' and including ''The Magnificent Ambersons'', ''Mr. Arkadin'' and ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |title=Movies as Politics |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1997 |isbn=978-0-520-20615-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/moviesaspolitics00rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113–116, 300–302}}

She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed to proceed with the lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/31/business/fi-kane31 |title=Welles' daughter could get profit from 'Kane' |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225143835/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/31/business/fi-kane31 |archive-date=December 25, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorization controversy===
In the 1980s, ''Citizen Kane'' became a catalyst in the controversy over the [[film colorization|colorization]] of [[black-and-white]] films. One proponent of film colorization was [[Ted Turner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/movies/council-opposes-coloring-old-films.html |last=Molotsky |first=Irwin |title=Council Opposes Coloring Old Films |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 4, 1986 |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121055017/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/movies/council-opposes-coloring-old-films.html |archive-date=January 21, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TBS acquires rights to RKO film and television library |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=December 9, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that ''Citizen Kane'' would not be colorized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Toole |first=Lawrence |title=No computer coloring for 'Kane' |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=December 18, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in July 1988 Turner said, &quot;''Citizen Kane?'' I'm thinking of colorizing it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bawden |first=James |title=Colorful Turner sees ''Citizen Kane'' in a different light |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |date=July 28, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him &quot;don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |title=Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize 'Citizen Kane' |publisher=Associated Press |date=January 30, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106042154/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |archive-date=January 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1989, Turner Entertainment President Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that &quot;could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |last=Antczyk |first=John |title=We'll Never Know If Rosebud Was Red |publisher=Associated Press |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106042152/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |archive-date=January 6, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer added that Welles's contract was &quot;quite unusual&quot; and &quot;other contracts we have checked out are not like this at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turner won't colorize 'Kane' |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had only colorized the final [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reel]] of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage was included in the BBC ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary ''The Complete Citizen Kane''.{{efn| The colorized ''Citizen Kane'' footage appears at approximately 1:17:00.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/the-complete-citizen-kane-is-now-online/ |title=The Complete Citizen Kane' documentary is now online |publisher=Wellesnet |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101213935/http://www.wellesnet.com/the-complete-citizen-kane-is-now-online/ |archive-date=January 1, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colorization controversy was a factor in the passage of the [[National Film Preservation Act]] in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year. [[ABC News]] anchor [[Peter Jennings]] reported that &quot;one major reason for doing this is to require people like the broadcaster Ted Turner, who's been adding color to some movies and re-editing others for television, to put notices on those versions saying that the movies have been altered&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jennings |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jennings |title=[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]] |publisher=[[ABC News]] Transcripts, [[American Broadcasting Company]] |date=September 19, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
