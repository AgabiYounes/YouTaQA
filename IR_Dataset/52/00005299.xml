'''Carbon''' (from {{lang-la|carbo}} &quot;coal&quot;) is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''C''' and [[atomic number]] 6. It is [[nonmetal]]lic and [[tetravalence|tetravalent]]—making four [[electron]]s available to form [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[chemical bond]]s. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=carbon {{!}} Facts, Uses, &amp; Properties|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-chemical-element|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024183827/https://www.britannica.com/science/carbon-chemical-element|archivedate=2017-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[Isotopes of carbon|isotopes]] occur naturally, [[Carbon-12|{{sup|12}}C]] and [[Carbon-13|{{sup|13}}C]] being stable, while [[Carbon-14|{{sup|14}}C]] is a [[radionuclide]], decaying with a [[half-life]] of about 5,730&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;isotopes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/isot.html|title=Carbon&amp;nbsp;– Naturally occurring isotopes|publisher=WebElements Periodic Table|accessdate=2008-10-09|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908030327/http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/isot.html|archivedate=2008-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is one of the [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|few elements known since antiquity]].&lt;ref name=D2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caer.uky.edu/carbon/history/carbonhistory.shtml|title=History of Carbon|accessdate=2013-01-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101085829/http://www.caer.uky.edu/carbon/history/carbonhistory.shtml#|archivedate=2012-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon is the 15th [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|most abundant element in the Earth's crust]], and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element in the universe by mass]] after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[oxygen]]. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of [[organic compound]]s, and its unusual ability to form [[polymer]]s at the temperatures commonly encountered on [[Earth]] enables this element to serve as a common element of [[Carbon-based life|all known life]]. It is the second most abundant element in the [[human body]] by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Campbell Biology|last=Reece|first=Jane B.|date=31 October 2013|publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]|isbn=9780321775658|edition=10|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atoms of carbon can bond together in diverse ways, resulting in various [[allotropes of carbon]]. The best known allotropes are [[graphite]], [[diamond]], and [[buckminsterfullerene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;therm prop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invsee.asu.edu/nmodules/Carbonmod/point.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010531203728/http://invsee.asu.edu/nmodules/Carbonmod/point.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-05-31|title=World of Carbon&amp;nbsp;– Interactive Nano-visulisation in Science &amp; Engineering Education (IN-VSEE)|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[physical property|physical properties]] of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and black while diamond is highly [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]]. Graphite is soft enough to form a streak on paper (hence its name, from the [[Greeks|Greek]] verb &quot;γράφειν&quot; which means &quot;to write&quot;), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good [[electrical conductor]] while diamond has a low [[electrical conductivity]]. Under normal conditions, diamond, [[carbon nanotube]]s, and [[graphene]] have the highest [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivities]] of [[List of thermal conductivities|all known materials]]. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermodynamically stable]] form at standard temperature and pressure. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.

The most common [[oxidation state]] of carbon in [[inorganic compound]]s is +4, while +2 is found in [[carbon monoxide]] and [[transition metal]] [[Metal carbonyl|carbonyl]] complexes. The largest sources of inorganic carbon are [[limestone]]s, [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]s and [[carbon dioxide]], but significant quantities occur in organic deposits of [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum|oil]], and [[methane clathrate]]s. Carbon forms a vast number of [[chemical compound|compounds]], more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date,&lt;ref name=lanl&gt;{{cite web|author=Chemistry Operations|date=December 15, 2003|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html|title=Carbon|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=2008-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913063402/http://periodic.lanl.gov/elements/6.html |archivedate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the &quot;king of the elements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deming |first=Anna |date=2010 |title=King of the elements? |journal=Nanotechnology |volume=21 |issue=30 |pages=300201 |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/21/30/300201 |pmid=20664156 |bibcode=2010Nanot..21D0201D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[graphite]], one of the softest known substances, and [[diamond]], the hardest naturally occurring substance. It [[Chemical bond|bonds]] readily with other small [[atom]]s, including other carbon atoms, and is capable of forming multiple stable [[covalent]] bonds with suitable multivalent atoms. Carbon is known to form almost ten million compounds, a large majority of all [[chemical compounds]].&lt;ref name=lanl/&gt; Carbon also has the highest [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] point of all elements. At [[atmospheric pressure]] it has no melting point, as its [[triple point]] is at {{val|10.8|0.2|u=MPa}} and {{convert|4600|±|300|K|C F|-1}},&lt;ref name=triple2/&gt;&lt;ref name=triple3/&gt; so it sublimes at about {{convert|3900|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;triple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=276 |pages=695–696 |date=1978 |doi=10.1038/276695a0 |title=The controversial carbon solid−liquid−vapour triple point |first=A. |last=Greenville Whittaker |issue=5689 |bibcode=1978Natur.276..695W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lbruno.home.cern.ch/lbruno/documents/Bibliography/LHC_Note_78.pdf |title=On Graphite Transformations at High Temperature and Pressure Induced by Absorption of the LHC Beam |first=J.

For example, graphite can be oxidised by hot concentrated [[nitric acid]] at standard conditions to [[mellitic acid]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which preserves the hexagonal units of graphite while breaking up the larger structure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood289&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 289–292.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon sublimes in a carbon arc, which has a temperature of about 5800 K (5,530&amp;nbsp;°C or 9,980&amp;nbsp;°F). Thus, irrespective of its allotropic form, carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than the highest-melting-point metals such as [[tungsten]] or [[rhenium]]. Although thermodynamically prone to [[Redox|oxidation]], carbon resists oxidation more effectively than elements such as [[iron]] and [[copper]], which are weaker reducing agents at room temperature.

Carbon is the sixth element, with a ground-state [[electron configuration]] of 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which the four outer electrons are [[valence electron]]s. Its first four ionisation energies, 1086.5, 2352.6, 4620.5 and 6222.7&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, are much higher than those of the heavier group-14 elements. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.5, significantly higher than the heavier group-14 elements (1.8–1.9), but close to most of the nearby nonmetals, as well as some of the second- and third-row [[transition metal]]s. Carbon's [[covalent radius|covalent radii]] are normally taken as 77.2&amp;nbsp;pm (C−C), 66.7&amp;nbsp;pm (C=C) and 60.3&amp;nbsp;pm (C≡C), although these may vary depending on coordination number and what the carbon is bonded to. In general, covalent radius decreases with lower coordination number and higher bond order.&lt;ref name=Greenwood276&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 276–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon compounds form the basis of all known life on [[Earth]], and the [[CNO cycle|carbon–nitrogen cycle]] provides some of the energy produced by the [[Sun]] and other [[star]]s. Although it forms an extraordinary variety of compounds, most forms of carbon are comparatively unreactive under normal conditions. At standard temperature and pressure, it resists all but the strongest oxidizers. It does not react with [[sulfuric acid]], [[hydrochloric acid]], [[chlorine]] or any [[Alkali metals|alkalis]]. At elevated temperatures, carbon reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[Oxocarbon|carbon oxides]] and will rob oxygen from metal oxides to leave the elemental metal. This [[exothermic reaction]] is used in the iron and steel industry to [[Smelting|smelt]] iron and to control the carbon content of [[steel]]:

:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 C{{sub|(s)}} → 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}}

Carbon monoxide can be recycled to smelt even more iron:

:{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}} + 4 CO{{sub|(g)}} → 3 Fe{{sub|(s)}} + 4 {{chem|C|O|2}}{{sub|(g)}}

with [[sulfur]] to form [[carbon disulfide]] and with steam in the coal-gas reaction:
:C{{sub|(s)}} + H{{sub|2}}O{{sub|(g)}} → CO{{sub|(g)}} + H{{sub|2(g)}}.
Carbon combines with some metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, such as the iron carbide [[cementite]] in steel and [[tungsten carbide]], widely used as an [[abrasive]] and for making hard tips for cutting tools.

The system of carbon allotropes spans a range of extremes:

The [[amorphous]] form is an assortment of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, glassy state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as [[charcoal]], [[lampblack]] ([[soot]]) and [[activated carbon]]. At normal pressures, carbon takes the form of graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused [[hexagon]]al rings, just like those in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The polymorphism of elements and compounds |last=Jenkins |first=Edgar |date=1973 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-423-87500-3 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |accessdate=2011-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123204229/http://books.google.com/books?id=XNYOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |archivedate=2012-11-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak [[van der Waals force]]s.&lt;!-- no evidence for upper case van der Waals; see [[Talk:Van der Waals#Van should be capitalized unless preceded by first name]] rebuttal --&gt; This gives graphite its softness and its [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleaving]] properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a [[Delocalized electron|π-cloud]], graphite conducts [[electricity]], but only in the plane of each [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] sheet. This results in a lower bulk [[electrical conductivity]] for carbon than for most [[metal]]s. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.

At very high pressures, carbon forms the more compact allotrope, [[diamond]], having nearly twice the density of graphite. Here, each atom is bonded [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally]] to four others, forming a 3-dimensional network of puckered six-membered rings of atoms. Diamond has the same [[cubic crystal system|cubic structure]] as [[silicon]] and [[germanium]], and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon [[chemical bond|bonds]], it is the hardest naturally occurring substance measured by [[Mohs scale|resistance to scratching]].

[[Fullerene]]s are a synthetic crystalline formation with a graphite-like structure, but in place of flat [[hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal cells]] only, some of the cells of which fullerenes are formed may be pentagons, nonplanar hexagons, or even heptagons of carbon atoms. The sheets are thus warped into spheres, ellipses, or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into buckyballs, buckytubes, and nanobuds) have not yet been fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in [[nanomaterials]]. The names ''fullerene'' and ''buckyball'' are given after [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]], popularizer of [[geodesic dome]]s, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming [[spheroid]]s (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped C{{sub|60}} [[buckminsterfullerene]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;buckyballs&quot;/&gt; Carbon nanotubes (buckytubes) are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nanotubes2&quot;/&gt; Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid buckytube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded to the outer wall of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;nanobuds&quot;/&gt;

Of the other discovered allotropes, [[carbon nanofoam]] is a [[ferromagnetic]] allotrope discovered in 1997. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings.

In 2015, a team at the [[North Carolina State University]] announced the development of another allotrope they have dubbed [[Q-carbon]], created by a high energy low duration laser pulse on amorphous carbon dust.

As for individual carbon allotropes, graphite is found in large quantities in the [[United States]] (mostly in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Texas]]), [[Russia]], [[Mexico]], [[Greenland]], and [[India]]. Natural diamonds occur in the rock [[kimberlite]], found in ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] &quot;necks&quot;, or &quot;pipes&quot;. Most diamond deposits are in [[Africa]], notably in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Diamond deposits have also been found in [[Arkansas]], [[Canada]], the Russian [[Arctic]], [[Brazil]], and in Northern and Western [[Australia]]. Diamonds are now also being recovered from the ocean floor off the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

The amount of {{sup|14}}C in the [[atmosphere]] and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in [[radiocarbon dating]], invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Libby|first=W.

===Formation in stars===
{{main|Triple-alpha process|CNO cycle}}
Formation of the carbon atomic nucleus occurs within a [[giant star|giant]] or [[supergiant]] star through the [[triple-alpha process]]. This requires a nearly simultaneous collision of three [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] nuclei), as the products of further [[nuclear fusion]] reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce [[isotopes of lithium|lithium-5]] and [[isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-8]] respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei.&lt;ref name=&quot;Audi&quot;&gt;{{NUBASE 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triple-alpha process happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvins and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the [[Big Bang]].

According to current physical cosmology theory, carbon is formed in the interiors of stars on the [[horizontal branch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostlie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostlie |first=Dale A. |last2=Carroll |first2=Bradley W. |last-author-amp=yes |title=An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics |publisher=Addison Wesley |location=San Francisco (CA) |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8053-0348-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When massive stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust.

The [[CNO cycle]] is an additional hydrogen fusion mechanism that powers stars, wherein carbon operates as a [[catalyst]].

Rotational transitions of various isotopic forms of carbon monoxide (for example, {{sup|12}}CO, {{sup|13}}CO, and {{sup|18}}CO) are detectable in the [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] wavelength range, and are used in the study of [[Star formation|newly forming stars]] in [[molecular clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pikelʹner |first=Solomon Borisovich |title=Star Formation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbGLgcxnfpIC&amp;pg=PA38 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |date=1977 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-277-0796-3 |pages=38 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123220424/http://books.google.com/books?id=qbGLgcxnfpIC&amp;pg=PA38 |archivedate=2012-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon cycle===
{{main|Carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Diagram of the carbon cycle. The black numbers indicate how much carbon is stored in various reservoirs, in billions tonnes (&quot;GtC&quot; stands for gigatonnes of carbon; figures are circa 2004). The purple numbers indicate how much carbon moves between reservoirs each year. The sediments, as defined in this diagram, do not include the ≈70&amp;nbsp;million GtC of carbonate rock and [[kerogen]].]]
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the [[carbon cycle]]. For example, [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] plants draw [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the [[Calvin cycle]], a process of [[carbon fixation]]. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become [[petroleum]] or [[coal]], which releases carbon when burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=290|issue=5490|pages=291–296|doi=10.1126/science.290.5490.291|title=The Global Carbon Cycle: A Test of Our Knowledge of Earth as a System|pmid=11030643|last1=Falkowski|first1=P.|last2=Scholes|first2=R.

===Organic compounds===
[[File:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Structural formula of [[methane]], the simplest possible organic compound.]]
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Correlation between the ''carbon cycle'' and formation of organic compounds. In plants, carbon dioxide formed by carbon fixation can join with water in [[photosynthesis]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;) to form organic compounds, which can be used and further converted by both plants and animals.]]
Carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting [[carbon–carbon bond]]s, a property that is called [[catenation]]. Carbon-carbon bonds are strong and stable. Through catenation, carbon forms a countless number of compounds. A tally of unique compounds shows that more contain carbon than do not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burrows Holman Parsons Pilling 2017 p. 70&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Burrows | first=A. | last2=Holman | first2=J. | last3=Parsons | first3=A. | last4=Pilling | first4=G. | last5=Price | first5=G. | title=Chemistry3: Introducing Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2017 | isbn=978-0-19-873380-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzbjDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 | accessdate=2017-05-07 | page=70 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122173131/https://books.google.com/books?id=YzbjDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70 | archivedate=2017-11-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar claim can be made for hydrogen because most organic compounds contain hydrogen chemically bonded to carbon or another common element like oxygen or nitrogen.

The simplest form of an organic molecule is the [[hydrocarbon]]—a large family of [[organic molecule]]s that are composed of [[hydrogen]] atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other atoms, known as [[heteroatom]]s. Common heteroatoms that appear in organic compounds include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and the nonradioactive halogens, as well as the metals lithium and magnesium. Organic compounds containing bonds to metal are known as organometallic compounds (''see below''). Certain groupings of atoms, often including heteroatoms, recur in large numbers of organic compounds. These collections, known as [[Functional group|''functional groups'']], confer common reactivity patterns and allow for the systematic study and categorization of organic compounds. Chain length, shape and functional groups all affect the properties of organic molecules.

In most stable compounds of carbon (and nearly all stable ''organic'' compounds), carbon obeys the [[octet rule]] and is ''tetravalent'', meaning that a carbon atom forms a total of four covalent bonds (which may include double and triple bonds). Exceptions include a small number of stabilized ''carbocations'' (three bonds, positive charge), ''radicals'' (three bonds, neutral), ''carbanions'' (three bonds, negative charge) and ''carbenes'' (two bonds, neutral), although these species are much more likely to be encountered as unstable, reactive intermediates.

Carbon occurs in all known [[organic material|organic]] life and is the basis of [[organic chemistry]]. When united with [[hydrogen]], it forms various hydrocarbons that are important to industry as [[refrigerant]]s, [[lubricant]]s, [[solvent]]s, as chemical feedstock for the manufacture of [[plastic]]s and [[petrochemical]]s, and as [[fossil fuel]]s.

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including [[sugar]]s, [[lignan]]s, [[chitin]]s, [[alcohol]]s, [[fat]]s, and aromatic [[ester]]s, [[carotenoid]]s and [[terpene]]s. With [[nitrogen]] it forms [[alkaloid]]s, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms [[antibiotic]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[rubber]] products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the chemical-code carriers of life, and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.

===Inorganic compounds===
Commonly carbon-containing compounds which are associated with minerals or which do not contain bonds to the other carbon atoms, halogens, or hydrogen, are treated separately from classical [[organic compounds]]; the definition is not rigid, and the classification of some compounds can vary from author to author (see reference articles above). Among these are the simple oxides of carbon. The most prominent oxide is [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). This was once the principal constituent of the [[paleoatmosphere]], but is a minor component of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1982|title=The prebiological paleoatmosphere: stability and composition|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|volume=12|pages=245–259|doi=10.1007/BF00926894|pmid=7162799|issue=3|bibcode=1982OrLi...12..245L|last1=Levine|first1=Joel S.|last2=Augustsson|first2=Tommy R.|last3=Natarajan|first3=Murali}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissolved in [[water (molecule)|water]], it forms [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|C|O|3}}), but as most compounds with multiple single-bonded oxygens on a single carbon it is unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Loerting, T.|date=2001|title=On the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Carbonic Acid|journal=Angew.

Some important minerals are carbonates, notably [[calcite]]. [[Carbon disulfide]] ({{chem|C|S|2}}) is similar.&lt;ref name=Greenwood289/&gt; Nevertheless, due to its physical properties and its association with organic synthesis, carbon disulfide is sometimes classified as an ''organic'' solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/carbon-disulfide|title=Carbon disulfide - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other common oxide is [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). It is formed by incomplete combustion, and is a colorless, odorless gas. The molecules each contain a triple bond and are fairly [[polar molecule|polar]], resulting in a tendency to bind permanently to hemoglobin molecules, displacing oxygen, which has a lower binding affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haldane J.|date=1895|title=The action of carbonic oxide on man|journal=Journal of Physiology|volume=18|pages=430–462|pmid=16992272|issue=5–6|pmc=1514663|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1895.sp000578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003|title=The clinical toxicology of carbon monoxide|journal=Toxicology|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00005-2|last1=Gorman|first1=D.|volume=187|pmid=12679050|last2=Drewry|first2=A.|last3=Huang|first3=Y.

A few carbides are covalent lattices, like [[Silicon carbide|carborundum]] (SiC), which resembles [[diamond]]. Nevertheless, even the most polar and salt-like of carbides are not completely ionic compounds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood297&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 297–301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organometallic compounds===
{{main|Organometallic chemistry}}
Organometallic compounds by definition contain at least one carbon-metal covalent bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, [[tetraethyllead]]), η{{sup|2}}-alkene compounds (for example, [[Zeise's salt]]), and η{{sup|3}}-allyl compounds (for example, [[allylpalladium chloride dimer]]); [[metallocene]]s containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, [[ferrocene]]); and [[transition metal carbene complex]]es. Many [[metal carbonyl]]s and [[Cyanometalate|metal cyanides]] exist (for example, [[tetracarbonylnickel]] and [[potassium ferricyanide]]); some workers consider metal carbonyl and cyanide complexes without other carbon ligands to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic. However, most organometallic chemists consider metal complexes with any carbon ligand, even 'inorganic carbon' (e.g., carbonyls, cyanides, and certain types of carbides and acetylides) to be organometallic in nature. Metal complexes containing organic ligands without a carbon-metal covalent bond (e.g., metal carboxylates) are termed ''metalorganic'' compounds.

While carbon is understood to strongly prefer formation of four covalent bonds, other exotic bonding schemes are also known. [[Carborane]]s are highly stable dodecahedral derivatives of the [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; unit, with one BH replaced with a CH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus, the carbon is bonded to five boron atoms and one hydrogen atom. The cation [(Ph{{sub|3}}PAu){{sub|6}}C]{{sup|2+}} contains an octahedral carbon bound to six phosphine-gold fragments. This phenomenon has been attributed to the [[aurophilicity]] of the gold ligands, which provide additional stabilization of an otherwise labile species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.198815441|author=Scherbaum, Franz|journal=[[Angew.

In 2016, it was confirmed that, in line with earlier theoretical predictions, the [[hexamethylbenzene|hexamethylbenzene dication]] contains a carbon atom with six bonds.  More specifically, the dication could be described structurally by the formulation [MeC(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, making it an &quot;organic [[metallocene]]&quot; in which a MeC&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; fragment is bonded to a η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; fragment through all five of the carbons of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i49/Six-bonds-carbon-Confirmed.html?type=paidArticleContent|title=Six bonds to carbon: Confirmed|first=Stephen K.|last=Ritter|magazine=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109183800/http://cen.acs.org/articles/94/i49/Six-bonds-carbon-Confirmed.html?type=paidArticleContent|archivedate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Akiba's &quot;hypervalent carbon&quot; compound.png|thumb|This anthracene derivative contains a carbon atom with 5 formal electron pairs around it.]]
It is important to note that in the cases above, each of the bonds to carbon contain less than two formal electron pairs.  Thus, the formal electron count of these species does not exceed an octet.  This makes them hypercoordinate but not hypervalent.

==History and etymology==
[[File:Antoine lavoisier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] in his youth]]
The [[English language|English]] name ''carbon'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''carbo'' for coal and charcoal,&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; whence also comes the [[French language|French]] ''charbon'', meaning charcoal. In [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], the names for carbon are ''Kohlenstoff'', ''koolstof'' and ''kulstof'' respectively, all literally meaning [[coal]]-substance.

Carbon was discovered in prehistory and was known in the forms of [[soot]] and [[charcoal]] to the earliest [[human]] [[civilization]]s. Diamonds were known probably as early as 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE in China, while carbon in the form of [[charcoal]] was made around Roman times by the same chemistry as it is today, by heating wood in a [[pyramid]] covered with [[clay]] to exclude air.&lt;ref name=ancient_China&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title=Chinese made first use of diamond|work=BBC News|date=17 May 2005|accessdate=2007-03-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320064349/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|archivedate=20 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=C|title=Carbonium/Carbon at Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict|author=van der Krogt, Peter|accessdate=2010-01-06|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123003310/http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=C|archivedate=2010-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphite===
{{main|Graphite}}
Commercially viable natural deposits of graphite occur in many parts of the world, but the most important sources economically are in [[China]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[North Korea]]. Graphite deposits are of [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] origin, found in association with [[quartz]], [[mica]] and [[feldspar]]s in schists, [[gneiss]]es and metamorphosed [[sandstone]]s and [[limestone]] as [[lens (geology)|lenses]] or [[vein (geology)|veins]], sometimes of a metre or more in thickness. Deposits of graphite in [[Borrowdale]], [[Cumberland]], [[England]] were at first of sufficient size and purity that, until the 19th century, [[pencil]]s were made simply by sawing blocks of natural graphite into strips before encasing the strips in wood. Today, smaller deposits of graphite are obtained by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite out on water.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite USGS Minerals Yearbook: Graphite, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916114706/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/graphite/ |date=2008-09-16 }} and Graphite: Mineral Commodity Summaries 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of natural graphite—amorphous, flake or crystalline flake, and vein or lump. Amorphous graphite is the lowest quality and most abundant. Contrary to science, in industry &quot;amorphous&quot; refers to very small crystal size rather than complete lack of crystal structure. Amorphous is used for lower value graphite products and is the lowest priced graphite. Large amorphous graphite deposits are found in China, Europe, Mexico and the United States. Flake graphite is less common and of higher quality than amorphous; it occurs as separate plates that crystallized in metamorphic rock. Flake graphite can be four times the price of amorphous. Good quality flakes can be processed into expandable graphite for many uses, such as [[flame retardant]]s. The foremost deposits are found in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and Madagascar. Vein or lump graphite is the rarest, most valuable, and highest quality type of natural graphite. It occurs in veins along intrusive contacts in solid lumps, and it is only commercially mined in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

According to the [[USGS]], world production of natural graphite was 1.1&amp;nbsp;million tonnes in 2010, to which China contributed 800,000&amp;nbsp;t, India 130,000 t, Brazil 76,000&amp;nbsp;t, North Korea 30,000&amp;nbsp;t and Canada 25,000 t. No natural graphite was reported mined in the United States, but 118,000 t of synthetic graphite with an estimated value of $998&amp;nbsp;million was produced in 2009.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

=== Diamond ===

{{main|Diamond}}
[[File:Global Diamond Output in 2005.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Diamond output in 2005]]

The diamond supply chain is controlled by a limited number of powerful businesses, and is also highly concentrated in a small number of locations around the world (see figure).

Only a very small fraction of the diamond ore consists of actual diamonds. The ore is crushed, during which care has to be taken in order to prevent larger diamonds from being destroyed in this process and subsequently the particles are sorted by density. Today, diamonds are located in the diamond-rich density fraction with the help of [[X-ray fluorescence]], after which the final sorting steps are done by hand. Before the use of [[X-ray]]s became commonplace, the separation was done with grease belts; diamonds have a stronger tendency to stick to grease than the other minerals in the ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=223|title=The nature of diamonds|author=Harlow, G. E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1998|isbn=978-0-521-62935-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically diamonds were known to be found only in alluvial deposits in [[southern India]].&lt;ref name=Catelle1&gt;{{cite book|last=Catelle|first=W. R.|title=The Diamond|publisher=John Lane Company|date=1911|page=159}} discussion on alluvial diamonds in India and elsewhere as well as earliest finds&lt;/ref&gt; India led the world in diamond production from the time of their discovery in approximately the 9th century BC&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=V.|title=Diamonds, Gold and Coal of India|url=https://archive.org/details/diamondscoalgold00ballrich|publisher=London, Truebner &amp; Co.|date=1881}} Ball was a Geologist in British service. Chapter I, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; to the mid-18th century AD, but the commercial potential of these sources had been exhausted by the late 18th century and at that time India was eclipsed by Brazil where the first non-Indian diamonds were found in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=28|title=The Book Of Diamonds: Their Curious Lore, Properties, Tests And Synthetic Manufacture|first=J. W.|last=Hershey|publisher=Kessinger Pub Co.|isbn=978-1-4179-7715-4|date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond production of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only started in the 1870s after the discovery of the diamond fields in South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5&amp;nbsp;billion carats have been mined since that date.&lt;ref name=giasummer2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Janse|first=A. J.

Most of these mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.&lt;ref name=giasummer2007/&gt;

In the United States, diamonds have been found in [[Arkansas]], [[Colorado]] and [[Montana]].&lt;ref name=DGemGLorenz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=V.|title=Argyle in Western Australia: The world's richest diamantiferous pipe; its past and future|journal=Gemmologie, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft|volume=56|issue=1/2|pages=35–40|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montanastandard.com/articles/2004/10/18/featuresbusiness/hjjfijicjbhdjc.txt |title=Microscopic diamond found in Montana |newspaper=The Montana Standard |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121085707/http://www.montanastandard.com/articles/2004/10/18/featuresbusiness/hjjfijicjbhdjc.txt |archivedate=2005-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a startling discovery of a microscopic diamond in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/wyoming_diamond_041019.html |publisher=Livescience.com|accessdate=2008-09-12|title=Microscopic Diamond Found in Montana|first=Sarah|last=Cooke|date=2004-10-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705160039/http://www.livescience.com/environment/wyoming_diamond_041019.html |archivedate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the January 2008 bulk-sampling of [[kimberlite pipes]] in a remote part of [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deltamine.com/release2008-01-08.htm|title=Delta News / Press Releases / Publications|publisher=Deltamine.com|accessdate=2008-09-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526154238/http://www.deltamine.com/release2008-01-08.htm|archivedate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most commercially viable diamond deposits are in [[Russia]], [[Botswana]], [[Australia]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnn.tv/videos/2/The_Diamond_Life|title=The Diamond Life|publisher=Guerrilla News Network|first=Stephen|last=Marshall|last2=Shore|first2=Josh|accessdate=2008-10-10|date=2004-10-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609101643/http://gnn.tv/videos/2/The_Diamond_Life|archivedate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Russia produced almost one-fifth of the global diamond output, reports the [[British Geological Survey]]. Australia has the richest diamantiferous pipe with production reaching peak levels of {{convert|42|MT}} per year in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=DGemGLorenz/&gt; There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the [[Northwest Territories]] of [[Canada]], [[Siberia]] (mostly in [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia territory]]; for example, [[Mir Mine|Mir pipe]] and [[Udachnaya pipe]]), Brazil, and in Northern and Western [[Australia]].

Carbon is essential to all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist (see [[alternative biochemistry]]). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the [[fossil fuel]] [[methane]] gas and [[crude oil]] (petroleum). [[Petroleum|Crude oil]] is [[distillation|distilled]] in [[Oil refinery|refineries]] by the [[petrochemical industry]] to produce [[gasoline]], [[kerosene]], and other products. [[Cellulose]] is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[hemp]]. [[Cellulose]] is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include [[wool]], [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[silk]]. [[Plastics]] are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.

The uses of carbon and its compounds are extremely varied. It can form [[alloys]] with [[iron]], of which the most common is [[carbon steel]]. [[Graphite]] is combined with [[clay]]s to form the 'lead' used in [[pencil]]s used for [[writing]] and [[drawing]]. It is also used as a [[lubricant]] and a [[pigment]], as a molding material in [[glass]] manufacture, in [[electrodes]] for dry [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] and in [[electroplating]] and [[electroforming]], in [[brush (electric)|brushes]] for [[electric motors]] and as a [[neutron moderator]] in [[nuclear reactors]].

[[Charcoal]] is used as a drawing material in [[art]]work, barbecue [[grilling]], [[iron smelting]], and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as [[fuel]] for production of energy and [[heating]]. Gem quality [[diamond]] is used in jewelry, and [[industrial diamond]]s are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and [[carbon fiber]], made by [[pyrolysis]] of synthetic [[polyester]] [[fiber]]s is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight [[composite materials]].

[[Carbon fiber]] is made by pyrolysis of extruded and stretched filaments of [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend on the type of starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher [[specific strength|specific tensile strength]] than steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;cantwell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first1=W. J.|last1=Cantwell|first2=J.|last2=Morton|title=The impact resistance of composite materials&amp;nbsp;– a review|journal=Composites|date=1991|volume=22|issue=5|pages=347–62|doi=10.1016/0010-4361(91)90549-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon black]] is used as the black [[pigment]] in [[printing]] [[ink]], artist's oil paint and water colours, [[carbon paper]], automotive finishes, [[India ink]] and [[laser printer]] [[toner]]. [[Carbon black]] is also used as a [[Filler (materials)|filler]] in [[rubber]] products such as tyres and in [[plastic]] compounds. [[Activated charcoal]] is used as an [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] and [[adsorbent]] in [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]] material in applications as diverse as [[gas masks]], [[water purification]], and [[kitchen]] [[extractor hood]]s, and in medicine to [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] toxins, poisons, or gases from the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]]. Carbon is used in [[Redox|chemical reduction]] at high temperatures. [[Coke (fuel)|Coke]] is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). [[Case hardening]] of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. [[Carbide]]s of [[silicon carbide|silicon]], [[tungsten carbide|tungsten]], [[boron carbide|boron]] and [[titanium carbide|titanium]], are among the hardest known materials, and are used as [[abrasives]] in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make up most of the materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic [[textiles]] and [[leather]], and almost all of the interior surfaces in the [[built environment]] other than glass, stone and metal.

===Diamonds===
The [[diamond]] industry falls into two categories: one dealing with gem-grade diamonds and the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in both types of diamonds exists, the two markets function dramatically differently.

Unlike [[precious metal]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]], gem diamonds do not trade as a [[commodity]]: there is a substantial mark-up in the sale of diamonds, and there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.

Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20&amp;nbsp;tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as ''[[bort]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turning And Mechanical Manipulation|first=Ch.|last=Holtzapffel|publisher=Charles Holtzapffel|date=1856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428063201/https://books.google.com/books?id=omwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|archivedate=2016-04-28|df=}} [https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft Internet Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326085110/https://archive.org/details/turningmechanica02holtuoft |date=2016-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[synthetic diamond]]s, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3&amp;nbsp;billion carats (600&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s) of synthetic diamond is produced annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|accessdate=2009-05-05|title=Industrial Diamonds Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506221551/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/diamond/|archivedate=2009-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant industrial use of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=R.

==Precautions==
[[File:Worker at carbon black plant2.jpg|thumb|upright|Worker at [[carbon black]] plant in [[Sunray, Texas]] (photo by [[John Vachon]], 1942)]]Pure carbon has extremely low [[toxicity]] to humans and can be handled safely in the form of graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. [[Carbon black]] was probably one of the first pigments to be used for [[tattoo]]ing, and [[Ötzi the Iceman]] was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200&amp;nbsp;years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leopold|last=Dorfer|date=1998|title=5200-year old acupuncture in Central Europe?|journal=Science|volume=282|pages=242–243|doi=10.1126/science.282.5387.239f|pmid=9841386|last2=Moser|first2=M.|last3=Spindler|first3=K.|last4=Bahr|first4=F.|last5=Egarter-Vigl|first5=E.|last6=Dohr|first6=G.|issue=5387|bibcode=1998Sci...282..239D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive [[human lung|lung]] disease, [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis]].

Carbon generally has low toxicity to [[life|life on Earth]]; but carbon nanoparticles are deadly to ''[[Drosophila]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090807103921.htm Carbon Nanoparticles Toxic To Adult Fruit Flies But Benign To Young] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102130334/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090807103921.htm |date=2011-11-02 }} ScienceDaily (Aug. 17, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon may burn vigorously and brightly in the presence of air at high temperatures.

In [[nuclear reactor|nuclear applications]] where graphite is used as a [[neutron moderator]], accumulation of [[Wigner energy]] followed by a sudden, spontaneous release may occur. [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] to at least 250&amp;nbsp;°C can release the energy safely, although in the [[Windscale fire]] the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to combust.

The great variety of carbon compounds include such lethal poisons as [[tetrodotoxin]], the [[lectin]] [[ricin]] from seeds of the [[castor oil plant]] ''[[Ricinus communis]]'', [[cyanide]] (CN{{sup|−}}), and [[Carbon monoxide poisoning|carbon monoxide]]; and such essentials to life as [[glucose]] and [[protein]].
