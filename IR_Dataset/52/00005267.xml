A '''constellation''' is an area on the [[celestial sphere]] in which a group of [[star]]s forms an imaginary outline or pattern, typically representing an animal, mythological person or creature, or an inanimate object.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/constellation |title=Definition of constellation |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the earliest constellations likely go back to [[prehistory]]. People used them to relate stories of their beliefs, experiences, [[creation myth|creation]], or [[mythology]]. Different cultures and countries adopted their own constellations, some of which lasted into the early [[20th century]] before today's constellations were internationally recognized. The recognition of constellations has changed significantly over time. Many have changed in size or shape. Some became popular, only to drop into obscurity. Others were limited to a single culture or nation.

The 48 traditional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'' and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', though their origin probably predates these works by several centuries. Constellations in the far [[southern celestial hemisphere|southern sky]] were added from the [[15th century]] until the mid-[[18th century]] when European explorers began traveling to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Twelve ancient constellations belong to the [[zodiac]] (straddling the [[ecliptic]], which the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s all traverse). The origins of the zodiac remain historically uncertain; its [[astrology|astrological]] divisions became prominent [[circa|c.]] 400 BC in [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]] or [[Chaldea]]n astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=John P. |date=2010 |title=Studies in Babylonian lunar theory: part III. The introduction of the uniform zodiac |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=617–663 |jstor=41134332 |doi=10.1007/S00407-010-0064-Z |access-date= |quote=[T]he zodiac was introduced between −408 and −397 and probably within a very few years of −400.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally accepted the modern list of [[IAU designated constellations|88 constellations]], and in 1928 adopted official constellation boundaries that together cover the entire celestial sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU1928&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Eugène |last=Delporte |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |title=Délimitation scientifique des constellations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3XvAAAAMAAJ |year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Star Tales: The final 88 |first=Ian |last=Ridpath |year=2018|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1d.htm#delporte}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any given point in a [[celestial coordinate system]] lies in one of the modern constellations. Some [[stellar designation|astronomical naming systems]] include the constellation where a given celestial object is found to convey its approximate location in the sky. The [[Flamsteed designation]] of a star, for example, consists of a number and the genitive form of the constellation name.

Other star patterns or groups called [[asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] are not constellations per se, but are used by observers to navigate the night sky. Asterisms may be several stars within a constellation, or they may share stars with more than one constellation. Examples of asterisms include the [[Pleiades]] and [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] within the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and the [[False Cross]] split between the southern constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], or Venus' Mirror in the constellation of [[Orion_(constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DOCdb2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Terminology==

The word &quot;constellation&quot; comes from the [[Late Latin]] term {{lang|la|cōnstellātiō}}, which can be translated as &quot;set of stars&quot;; it came into use in [[Middle English|English]] during the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/constellation#etymonline_v_18252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek]] word for constellation is [[wikt:ἄστρον|ἄστρον.]] These terms generally referred to a recognisable pattern of stars whose appearance is associated with mythological characters or creatures, earthbound animals, or objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddic&quot; /&gt; A more modern astronomical sense of the term &quot;constellation&quot; denotes one of the 88 [[IAU designated constellations]] recognized today.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxforddicastro&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095633860 |title=constellation |work=Oxford Dictionary of Astronomy |access-date=26 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Colloquial usage does not draw a sharp distinction between &quot;constellations&quot; and smaller &quot;asterisms&quot; (pattern of stars), yet the modern accepted astronomical constellations employ such a distinction. E.g., the [[Pleiades]] and the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] are both asterisms, and each lies within the boundaries of the constellation of Taurus. Another example is the northern asterism popularly known as the [[Big Dipper]] (US) or the Plough (UK), composed of the seven brightest stars within the area of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-defined constellation of [[Ursa Major]]. The southern [[False Cross]] asterism includes portions of the constellations [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] and the [[Summer Triangle]] is composed of the brightest stars in the constellations [[Lyra (constellation)|Lyra]], [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] and [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].

A constellation (or star), viewed from a particular latitude on [[Earth]], that never sets below the [[horizon]] is termed [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]]. From the [[North Pole]] or [[South Pole]], all constellations south or north of the [[celestial equator]] are [[circumpolar constellation|circumpolar]]. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie between declinations 45° north and 45° south,&lt;ref name=harbord_goodwin1897/&gt; or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or [[zodiac]] ranging between 23½° north, the celestial equator, and 23½° south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton14th&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=steele1884 /&gt;

Although stars in constellations appear near each other in the sky, they usually lie at a variety of distances away from the Earth. Since stars have their own independent motions, all constellations will change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, familiar outlines will generally become unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=&quot;marc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Identification == 

Both the 88 [[International Astronomical Union | IAU]] recognized constellations and those which have been culturally recognized throughout history are essentially imagined figures and shapes which have only a certain basis in the actually observable sky.&lt;ref&gt;''What Are the Constellations?'', University of Wisconsin, http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/constellations.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the officially recognized constellations are based in the imaginations of ancient, Near Eastern and Mediterranean mythologies, but the physical reality of the Earth's position in the Milky Way still produces shapes which are connected by the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautil.us/blog/forest-for-the-treeswhy-we-recognize-faces--constellations |title=Forest for the Trees - Why We Recognize Faces &amp; Constellations|publisher=Nautilus Magazine |access-date=3 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Orion's Belt]] forms a more or less visually perfect line. [[H.A. Rey]], who wrote popular books on astronomy, pointed out the imaginative nature of the constellations and their mythological, artistic basis, and the practical use of identifying them through definite images, according to the classical names they were given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rey |first=H.A. |date=1954 |title=The Stars: A New Way to See Them |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing |isbn=9780547132808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the early constellations ==

=== Lascaux Caves Southern France ===
It has been suggested that the 17,000 year old [[cave painting]]s in [[Lascaux]] Southern France depict star constellations such as Taurus, Orion's Belt and the Pleiades.  However this view is not yet generally accepted among scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1997ascu.conf..217R |title=The Pleiades in the &quot;Salle des Taureaux&quot;, grotte de Lascaux.

=== Mesopotamia ===
Inscribed stones and clay writing tablets from [[Mesopotamia]] (in modern Iraq) dating to 3000 BC provide the earliest generally accepted evidence for humankind's identification of constellations.&lt;ref name= Rogers&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1998JBAA..108....9R|title=Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions|journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association|volume=108|pages=9|last1=Rogers|first1=J. H|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the bulk of the Mesopotamian constellations were created within a relatively short interval from around 1300 to 1000 BC. Mesopotamian constellations appeared later in many of the classical Greek constellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek Constellations 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaefer|first1=Bradley E.|authorlink=Bradley E.

The oldest [[Babylonian star catalogues|Babylonian catalogues]] of stars and constellations date back to the beginning of the [[Middle Bronze Age]], most notably the ''Three Stars Each'' texts and the ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', an expanded and revised version based on more accurate observation from around 1000 BC. However, the numerous [[Sumerian language|Sumerian names]] in these catalogues suggest that they built on older, but otherwise unattested, [[Sumer]]ian traditions of the [[Early Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.westnet.com.au/Gary-David-Thompson/page11-4.html |title=History of the Constellations and Star Names — D.4: Sumerian constellations and star names? |work=Gary D.

The classical Zodiac is a revision of [[Neo-Babylonian]] constellations from the 6th century BC. The Greeks adopted the Babylonian constellations in the 4th century BC. Twenty Ptolemaic constellations are from the Ancient Near East. Another ten have the same stars but different names.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek Constellations 2006&quot;/&gt;

Biblical scholar [[E. W.

[[File:Senenmut.jpg|upright|thumb|Ancient Egyptian star chart and decanal clock on the ceiling from the tomb of Senenmut]]
There is only limited information on ancient Greek constellations, with some fragmentary evidence being found in the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of the Greek poet [[Hesiod]], who mentioned the &quot;heavenly bodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Stars and Constellations in Homer and Hesiod |journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens |volume=46 |pages=86–101 |date=1951|doi=10.1017/S0068245400018359 |last1=Lorimer |first1=H. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek astronomy essentially adopted the older Babylonian system in the [[Hellenistic era]], first introduced to Greece by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] in the 4th century BC. The original work of Eudoxus is lost, but it survives as a versification by [[Aratus]], dating to the 3rd century BC. The most complete existing works dealing with the mythical origins of the constellations are by the Hellenistic writer termed [[pseudo-Eratosthenes]] and an early Roman writer styled pseudo-[[Hyginus]]. The basis of Western astronomy as taught during [[Late Antiquity]] and until the [[Early Modern period]] is the ''[[Almagest]]'' by [[Ptolemy]], written in the 2nd century.

In the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], [[Egyptian astronomy|native Egyptian]] tradition of anthropomorphic figures represented the planets, stars, and various constellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Clagett 1995, p. 111&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Clagett|title=Ancient Egyptian Science: Calendars, clocks, and astronomy|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8c10QYoGa4UC|year=1989|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-214-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were combined with Greek and Babylonian astronomical systems culminating in the [[Dendera zodiac|Zodiac of Dendera]]; it remains unclear when this occurred, but most were placed during the Roman period between 2nd to 4th centuries AD.

These [[Chinese constellations|constellations]] are some of the most important observations of Chinese sky, attested from the 5th century BC. Parallels to the earliest Babylonian (Sumerian) star catalogues suggest that the ancient Chinese system did not arise independently.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite book|author1=Xiaochun Sun|author2=Jacob Kistemaker|title=The Chinese Sky During the Han: Constellating Stars and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87lvBoFi8A0C |year=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three schools of classical [[Chinese astronomy]] in the [[Han period]] are attributed to astronomers of the earlier [[Warring States period]]. The constellations of the three schools were conflated into a single system by [[Chen Zhuo]], an astronomer of the 3rd century ([[Three Kingdoms period]]). Chen Zhuo's work has been lost, but information on his system of constellations survives in [[Tang period]] records, notably by [[Qutan Xida]]. The oldest extant Chinese star chart dates to that period and was preserved as part of the [[Dunhuang Manuscripts]]. Native Chinese astronomy flourished during the [[Song dynasty]], and during the [[Yuan dynasty]] became increasingly influenced by [[medieval Islamic astronomy]] (see [[Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era]]).&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; As maps were prepared during this period on more scientific lines, they were considered as more reliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Selin2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Selin|first=Helaine Elise|title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&amp;pg=PA2022|date=12 March 2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-4559-2|page=2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A well known map from the Song period is the [[Chinese star maps|Suzhou Astronomical Chart]], which was prepared with carvings of stars on the [[planisphere]] of the Chinese sky on a stone plate; it is done accurately based on observations, and it shows the supernova of the year of 1054 in Taurus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Selin2008&quot;/&gt;

Influenced by European astronomy during the late [[Ming dynasty]], more stars were depicted on the charts but retaining the traditional constellations; new stars observed were incorporated as supplementary stars in old constellations in the southern sky which did not depict any of the traditional stars recorded by ancient Chinese astronomers. Further improvements were made during the later part of the Ming dynasty by [[Xu Guangqi]] and [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]], the German Jesuit and was recorded in [[Chongzhen calendar|Chongzhen Lishu]] (Calendrical Treatise of [[Chongzhen Emperor|Chongzhen period]], 1628).{{clarify|date=September 2018}} Traditional Chinese star maps incorporated 23 new constellations with 125 stars of the southern hemisphere of the sky based on the knowledge of Western star charts; with this improvement, the Chinese Sky was integrated with the World astronomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Selin2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sun | first =Xiaochun | editor=Helaine Selin | editor-link=Helaine Selin | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | date=1997 | pages=910 | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern astronomy==

Historically, the origins of the constellations of the northern and southern skies are distinctly different. Most northern constellations date to antiquity, with names based mostly on Classical Greek legends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton14th&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of these constellations has survived in the form of [[star charts]], whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the [[Farnese Atlas]], based perhaps on the star catalogue of the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradley2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Some southern constellations had long names that were shortened to more usable forms; e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton14th&quot; /&gt;

Some of the early constellations were never universally adopted. Stars were often grouped into constellations differently by different observers, and the arbitrary constellation boundaries often led to confusion as to which constellation a celestial object belonged. Before astronomers delineated precise boundaries (starting in the 19th century), constellations generally appeared as ill-defined regions of the sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norton2nd&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The 1603 star atlas &quot;[[Uranometria]]&quot; of [[Johann Bayer]] assigned stars to individual constellations and formalized the division by assigning a series of Greek and Latin letters to the stars within each constellation.  These are known today as [[Bayer designation]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swerdlow1986&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

===Origin of the southern constellations===

The southern sky, below about −65° [[declination]], was only partially catalogued by ancient Babylonians, Egyptian, Greeks, Chinese, and Persian astronomers of the north. Knowledge that northern and southern star patterns differed goes back to Classical writers, who describe, for example, the [[Exploration of Africa|African circumnavigation]] expedition commissioned by Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II in c. 600 BC and those of [[Hanno the Navigator]] in c. 500 BC. However, much of this history was lost with the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The history of southern constellations is not straightforward.  Different groupings and different names were proposed by various observers, some reflecting national traditions or designed to promote various sponsors. Southern constellations were important from the 14th to 16th centuries, when sailors used the stars for [[celestial navigation]]. Italian explorers who recorded new southern constellations include [[Andrea Corsali]], [[Antonio Pigafetta]], and [[Amerigo Vespucci]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen1899&quot; /&gt;

Many of the [[88 modern constellations|88 IAU-recognized constellations]] in this region first appeared on celestial globes developed in the late 16th century by [[Petrus Plancius]], based mainly on observations of the Dutch navigators [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several modern proposals have not survived. The French astronomers [[Pierre Lemonnier]] and [[Joseph Lalande]], for example, proposed constellations that were once popular but have since been dropped. The northern constellation [[Quadrans Muralis]] survived into the 19th century (when its name was attached to the [[Quadrantid]] meteor shower), but is now divided between [[Boötes]] and [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].

===88 modern constellations===
{{Main|IAU designated constellations}}
A general list of 88 constellations was produced for the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt; It is roughly based on the traditional Greek constellations listed by Ptolemy in his ''Almagest'' in the 2nd century and [[Aratus]]' work ''Phenomena'', with early modern modifications and additions (most importantly introducing constellations covering the parts of the southern sky unknown to Ptolemy) by Petrus Plancius (1592, 1597/98 and 1613), [[Johannes Hevelius]] (1690) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1763),&lt;ref name=&quot;iau-const&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Constellations |url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/ |publisher=IAU—[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm |title=Constellation names, abbreviations and sizes |author=Ian Ridpath |access-date= 30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/almagest.htm |title=Star Tales – The Almagest |author=Ian Ridpath |accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who named fourteen constellations and renamed a fifteenth one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisconsin-Madison&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/extra/Lacaille.html|title=Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713-1762)|website=Department of Astronomy. University of Wisconsin-Madison|access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Lacaille studied the stars of the southern hemisphere from 1750 until 1754 from [[Cape of Good Hope]], when he was said to have observed more than 10,000 stars using a {{convert |0.5|in|mm}} [[refracting telescope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisconsin-Madison&quot; /&gt;

In 1922, [[Henry Norris Russell]] produced a general list of 88 constellations and some useful abbreviations for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/iaulist1.htm| title = The original names and abbreviations for constellations from 1922| accessdate = 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these constellations did not have clear borders between them. In 1928, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally accepted [[88 modern constellations]], with contiguous boundaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ianridpath.com/boundaries.htm| title = Constellation boundaries. | accessdate = 24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; along vertical and horizontal lines of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] developed by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugene Delporte]] that, together, cover the entire celestial sphere;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachièze-ReyLuminet2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Lachièze-Rey|author2=Jean-Pierre Luminet|author3=Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Paris|title=Celestial Treasury: From the Music of the Spheres to the Conquest of Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZFXiNn62ZEC&amp;pg=PA80|date=16 July 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80040-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; this list was finally published in 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU1928&quot;/&gt; Where possible, these modern constellations usually share the names of their Graeco-Roman predecessors, such as [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] or [[Scorpius]]. The aim of this system is area-mapping, i.e. the division of the celestial sphere into contiguous fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;iau-const&quot; /&gt; Out of the 88 modern constellations, 36 lie predominantly in the northern sky, and the other 52 predominantly in the southern.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The boundaries developed by Delporte used data that originated back to [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] [[B1875.0]], which was when [[Benjamin A. Gould]] first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date is that because of the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the [[equinox]]es, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch [[J2000]], are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;A.C.

Leggett, [http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/VI/49/constell.pdf &quot;A Catalogue of Constellation Boundary Data&quot;], (Centre de Donneés astronomiques de Strasbourg, February 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.

== Dark cloud constellations ==
{{further|Great Rift (astronomy)}}
The Great Rift, a series of dark patches in the [[Milky Way]], is more visible and striking in the [[southern hemisphere]] than in the northern. It vividly stands out when conditions are otherwise so dark that the Milky Way's central region casts shadows on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Joe|title=A Great Week to See the Milky Way|url=http://www.space.com/7270-great-week-milky.html|publisher=Space|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures have discerned shapes in these patches and have given names to these &quot;dark cloud constellations&quot;.
