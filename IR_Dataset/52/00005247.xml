'''Country music''', also known as  '''country and western''' (or simply '''country'''), and '''[[hillbilly music]]''', is a genre of popular music that takes its roots from genres such as [[American folk music]] (especially [[Appalachian music|Appalachian]] and [[Western music (North America)|Western music]]) and [[blues]]. Its popularized roots originate in the [[Southern United States]] of the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard A. Peterson| title = Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity| date = 1999-12-15| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-66285-5| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies mostly accompanied by string instruments such as [[banjo]]s, electric and [[acoustic guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]s (such as [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steels]] and [[dobro]]s), and [[fiddle]]s as well as [[harmonica]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/country+music |title=Country music – Definition |accessdate=2011-10-30 |dictionary=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionaryoxford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/country+music |title=Country music – Definition |accessdate=2011-10-30 |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909171326/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/country%2Bmusic |archivedate=9 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Country music – Definition from WordWeb http://wordweb.info/free/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jazz scale#Blues scale|Blues modes]] have been used extensively throughout its [[recorded history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard J.

According to Lindsey Starnes, the term ''country music'' gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term ''[[hillbilly]] music''; it came to encompass [[Western music (North America)|Western music]], which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. In 2009 in the United States, country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute.&lt;ref&gt;ARRP Bulletin. Vol. 53 No 1. &quot;50&amp;nbsp;Minutes on the Road. Betsy Tower. page 50. citing Commuting in America III and Arbitron.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''country music'' is used today to describe many [[List of country genres|styles]] and subgenres. The origins of country music are found in the [[folk music]] of [[working class Americans]] and/or [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] [[United States|American]] life, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, cowboy songs, and the musical traditions of various groups of European immigrants.

==Origins==
{{Main|Appalachian music|Blues|Celtic folk|Old-time music|Western music (North America)}}

The main components of the modern Country music style dates back to music traditions throughout the [[Southern United States]] and [[Southwestern United States]]. Country music was &quot;introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Bill. ''Country Music U.S.A.'' Austin: University of Texas Press, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrants to the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], of the [[Southeastern United States]], brought the [[folk music]] and instruments of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and [[Africa]], along with them for nearly 300 years. Which developed into [[Appalachian music]] and eventual [[blues]] and [[bluegrass music]]. As the country expanded westward, the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Louisiana]] became a crossroads for Country music, giving rise to [[Cajun music]]. In the [[Southwestern United States]], it was the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[American frontier]], and [[Rio Grande]] that acted as a similar backdrop for [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]], and [[cowboy]] ballads, which resulted in [[New Mexico music]] and the development of [[Western music (North America)|Western music]], and its directly related [[Red dirt (music)|Red Dirt]], [[Texas country music|Texas country]], and [[Tejano music]] styles.

Before these, pioneer settlers, in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] region, had developed a rich musical heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/news/grammy-nomination.htm|title=CD of Old-Time Smokies Music Nominated for Grammy – Great Smoky Mountains National Park (U.S. National Park Service)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generations==
The first generation emerged in the early 1920s, with [[Country music in Atlanta|Atlanta's music scene]] playing a major role in launching country's earliest recording artists. [[Gid Tanner|James Gideon &quot;Gid&quot; Tanner]] (1885–1960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the [[Skillet Lickers]], was one of the most innovative and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were Clayton McMichen (fiddle and vocal), Dan Hornsby (vocals), Riley Puckett (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label [[Okeh Records]] began issuing hillbilly music records by [[Fiddlin' John Carson]] as early as 1923, followed by [[Columbia Records]] (series 15000D &quot;Old Familiar Tunes&quot;) ([[Samantha Bumgarner]]) in 1924, and [[RCA Victor Records]] in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the first family of country music [[Carter Family|The Carter Family]].&lt;ref name=&quot;78discography.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.78discography.com/COL15000D.htm 78discography.com] ''The Online Discography Project''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many &quot;hillbilly&quot; musicians, such as [[Cliff Carlisle]], recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Russell| first = Tony| title = Country Music Originals: The Legends and the Lost| date = 2007-11-15| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-532509-6| pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225]| url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second generation (1930s–1940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and &quot;barn dance&quot; shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring the king of the &quot;singing cowboys&quot;, [[Gene Autry]]. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a &quot;[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],&quot; and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takecountryback.com&quot;&gt;[http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm Takecountryback.com], Merle Haggard – Bob Wills {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085028/http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Country musicians began recording [[boogie-woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at [[Carnegie Hall]], when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;.

The third generation (1950s–1960s) started at the end of [[World War II]] with &quot;mountaineer&quot; string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], which emerged when [[Bill Monroe]], along with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] were introduced by [[Roy Acuff]] at the Grand Ole Opry. [[Gospel music]] remained a popular component of country music. Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods, became popular among poor communities in [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]; the basic ensemble consisted of [[classical guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[dobro]] or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured [[electric guitar]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of [[tack piano]]), [[banjo]]s, and [[drum]]s. This sound had its roots in the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[Hispanos|Hispano]], and [[American frontier]] music of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], including [[Western music (North America)|Western]], [[Honky tonk music|honky tonk]], [[ranchera]], and [[corrido]]. By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of [[rockabilly]] in country music, with [[Johnny Cash]] emerging as one of the most popular and enduring representatives of the rockabilly genre; rockabilly was also a starting point for eventual rock-and-roll superstar [[Elvis Presley]], who would return to his country roots near the end of his life. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the [[Nashville sound]] turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]] were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the early 1950s, and during the mid-1960s, Western singer-songwriters such as [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and [[Marty Robbins]] rose in prominence as did others, throughout Western music traditions, like [[New Mexico music]]'s [[Al Hurricane]]. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the &quot;old values&quot; of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]].

Fourth generation (1970s–1980s) music included [[outlaw country]] with roots in the [[Bakersfield sound]], and [[country pop]] with roots in the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]], folk music and [[soft rock]]. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist [[John Denver]] released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] gained popularity with performers like [[Freddie Fender]]. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of &quot;neocountry disco music&quot; was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional &quot;back-to-basics&quot; production; this [[neotraditional country|neotraditional movement]] would dominate country music through the late 1980s and was typified by the likes of [[George Strait]]. Attempts to combine [[Punk rock|punk]] and country were pioneered by [[Jason and the Scorchers]], and in the 1980s Southern Californian [[cowpunk]] scene with bands like [[the Long Ryders]] and [[Mojo Nixon]].

During the fifth generation (1990s), country music became a worldwide phenomenon. Two types of artists enjoyed mainstream popularity: neotraditionalists such as [[Alan Jackson]], and the more broadly popular [[stadium rock|stadium country]] acts, in particular [[Garth Brooks]]. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s.

The sixth generation (2000s–present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. The influence of [[rock music]] in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s. Most of the best-selling country songs of this era were in the country pop genre, such as those by [[Lady Antebellum]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Taylor Swift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;best-selling&quot; /&gt; [[Hip-hop]] also made its mark on country music with the emergence of [[country rap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/6150280/despite-hits-no-radio-love-yet-for-country-rap |title=Despite Hits, No Radio Love Yet For Country Rap |agency= Associated Press |magazine=Billboard |date= July 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record sales declined during the [[Great Depression]], but radio became a popular source of entertainment, and &quot;barn dance&quot; shows featuring country music were started by radio stations all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California.

The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and continuing to the present day. Some of the early stars on the ''Opry'' were [[Uncle Dave Macon]], [[Roy Acuff]] and African American harmonica player [[DeFord Bailey]]. WSM's 50,000-watt signal (in 1934) could often be heard across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=code:v_farquharson@kshira_interactive and j_nowicki@kshira_interactive design:k_wilson@framewerk |url=https://www.pbs.org/americanrootsmusic/pbs_arm_episode_summaries.html |title=American Roots Music: Episode Summaries |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many musicians performed and recorded songs in any number of styles. [[Moon Mullican]], for example, played [[Western swing]] but also recorded songs that can be called [[rockabilly]]. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner [[Eddy Arnold]] placed eight songs in the top 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp Billboard.com] ''Billboard.com'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803173648/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp |date=August 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1945 to 1955 [[Jenny Lou Carson]] was one of the most prolific songwriters in country music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Langley |first1=Jerry|last2=Rogers |first2=Arnold |title=Many Tears Ago The Life and Times of Jenny Lou Carson |url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/library/books/index.php?id=3964 |location= |publisher=Nova Books |page= |isbn=0-9628452-4-8 |access-date=July 10, 2015|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Singing cowboys and Western swing====
[[File:Roy Rogers and Gail Davis 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|Publicity photo of [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Gail Davis]], 1948]]

In the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or Western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood. Some of the popular [[singing cowboy]]s from the era were [[Gene Autry]], the [[Sons of the Pioneers]], and [[Roy Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040216083920/http://www.roughstock.com/history/cowboy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2004 |url=http://www.roughstock.com/history/cowboy.html |title=Roughstock's History of Country Music – Cowboy Music |publisher=Roughstock.com |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country music and western music were frequently played together on the same radio stations, hence the term ''country and western'' music. Cowgirls contributed to the sound in various family groups. [[Patsy Montana]] opened the door for female artists with her history-making song &quot;I Want To Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart&quot;. This would begin a movement toward opportunities for women to have successful solo careers. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a &quot;[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],&quot; and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[Western swing]]. [[Cliff Bruner]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Milton Brown]] and [[Adolph Hofner]] were other early Western swing pioneers. [[Spade Cooley]] and [[Tex Williams]] also had very popular bands and appeared in films. At its height, Western swing rivaled the popularity of [[big band]] swing music.

====Changing instrumentation====
Drums were scorned by early country musicians as being &quot;too loud&quot; and &quot;not pure&quot;, but by 1935 Western swing big band leader Bob Wills had added drums to the [[Texas Playboys]]. In the mid-1940s, the Grand Ole Opry did not want the Playboys' drummer to appear on stage. Although drums were commonly used by rockabilly groups by 1955, the less-conservative-than-the-Grand-Ole-Opry ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' kept its infrequently used drummer back stage as late as 1956. By the early 1960s, however, it was rare for a country band not to have a drummer.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/experience-museum-programs-school-instruments.aspx Instruments | Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Nashville, Tennessee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723204246/http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/experience-museum-programs-school-instruments.aspx |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an [[electric guitar]] to his band, in 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Takecountryback.com&quot;/&gt; A decade later (1948) [[Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith|Arthur Smith]] achieved top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recording of &quot;[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie]]&quot;, which crossed over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar. For several decades Nashville session players preferred the warm tones of the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] and [[Gretsch]] archtop electrics, but a &quot;hot&quot; [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] style, using guitars which became available beginning in the early 1950s, eventually prevailed as the signature guitar sound of country.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empsfm.org/exhibitions/index.asp?categoryID=129&amp;ccID=132 Empsfm.org ], exhibitions – online features {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203052822/http://www.empsfm.org/exhibitions/index.asp?categoryID=129&amp;ccID=132 |date=December 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hillbilly boogie====
Country musicians began recording [[boogie-woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at [[Carnegie Hall]], when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;. The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning in late 1945. One notable release from this period was [[The Delmore Brothers]]' &quot;Freight Train Boogie&quot;, considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards [[rockabilly]]. In 1948, [[Arthur &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; Smith]] achieved top ten US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of &quot;[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie]]&quot; and &quot;Banjo Boogie&quot;, with the former crossing over to the US pop charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Arthur-Smith.html Oldies.com], Arthur Smith Biography.&lt;/ref&gt; Other country boogie artists included [[Moon Mullican]], [[Merrill Moore (musician)|Merrill Moore]] and [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s and remains one of many subgenres of country into the 21st century.

====Bluegrass, folk and gospel====
{{Main|Bluegrass music}}
[[File:MonroeBrothers.jpg|thumb|right|Bill and Charlie Monroe (1936). Bill Monroe (1911–1996) and The Blue Grass Boys created the bluegrass by the end of World War II.]]
By the end of [[World War II]], &quot;mountaineer&quot; string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] had emerged when [[Bill Monroe]] joined with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]], introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry. That was the ordination of bluegrass music and how Bill Monroe became to be known as the &quot;Father of Bluegrass.&quot; [[Gospel music]], too, remained a popular component of bluegrass and other sorts of country music. [[Red Foley]], the biggest country star following World War II, had one of the first million-selling gospel hits (&quot;[[Peace in the Valley]]&quot;) and also sang boogie, blues and rockabilly. In the post-war period, country music was called &quot;folk&quot; in the trades, and &quot;hillbilly&quot; within the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Charles K.

====Honky tonk====
[[File:Hank Williams MGM Records - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hank Williams]]]]
Another type of stripped down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, [[dobro]] or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. It became known as [[Honky tonk music|honky tonk]] and had its roots in Western swing and the [[ranchera]] music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. [[Bob Wills]] and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as &quot;a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white&amp;nbsp;... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 135&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Gerald W.

Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll,{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 9}} such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], as well as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Ike Turner]], while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like [[George Jones]]. [[Webb Pierce]] was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.

===Third generation (1950s–1960s)===
{{See also|1950s in music|1960s in music}}
By the early 1950s, a blend of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk was played by most country bands. Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads and [[Tejano music]] rhythms of the [[southwestern U.S.]] and northern Mexico, reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song &quot;[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]&quot;, first recorded by [[Marty Robbins]] in September 1959. In 1953, the first all-country radio station was established in [[Lubbock, Texas]].&lt;ref name=hamilton&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| last = Hamilton| first=Shane |title = Trucking Country: The Road to America's Wal-Mart Economy| journal = Trucking Country| pages = 187–232| chapter = Agrarian Trucking Culture and Deregulatory Capitalism, 1960–80| date = 2008| jstor = j.ctt7t2vg.12| isbn = 9780691135823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country music scene largely kept the music of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] and [[folk rock]] at a distance, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, [[The Byrds]]' negative reception during their appearance on the ''Grand Ole Opry''). The main concern was politics: the folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. Only a handful of folk artists, such as [[Burl Ives]], [[John Denver]] and Canadian musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]], would cross over into country music after the folk revival died out. During the mid-1950s a new style of country music became popular, eventually to be referred to as rockabilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Morrison| first = Craig| title = Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly Music and Its Makers| date = 1996-09-01| publisher = University of Illinois Press| isbn = 978-0-252-02207-4| page = 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the 1960s and 1970s targeted the American working class, and [[History of the trucking industry in the United States|truckers]] in particular. As country radio became more popular, trucking songs like the 1963 hit song ''Six Days on the Road'' by [[Dave Dudley]] began to make up their own subgenre of country. These revamped songs sought to portray American truckers as a &quot;new folk hero&quot;, marking a significant shift in sound from earlier country music. The song was written by actual truckers and contained numerous references to the trucker culture of the time like &quot;ICC&quot; for [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and &quot;little white pills&quot; as a reference to [[amphetamines]]. [[Starday Records]] in Nashville followed up on Dudley's initial success with the release of ''Give me 40 Acres'' by the [[Willis Brothers]].&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;

====Rockabilly====
{{Main|Rockabilly}}
[[File:Johnny Cash Promotional Photo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Johnny Cash]]]]
Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s, and 1956 could be called the year of [[rockabilly]] in country music. Rockabilly was an early form of [[rock and roll]], an upbeat combination of [[blues]] and country music.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 7–8}} The number two, three and four songs on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' charts for that year were [[Elvis Presley]], &quot;[[Heartbreak Hotel]]&quot;; [[Johnny Cash]], &quot;[[I Walk the Line]]&quot;; and [[Carl Perkins]], &quot;[[Blue Suede Shoes]]&quot; Thumper Jones (George Jones)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1956 |title=Billboard.com |magazine=Billboard.com |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017032334/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot%2BCountry%2BSongs&amp;g=Year-end%2BSingles&amp;year=1956 |archivedate=17 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cash and Presley placed songs in the top 5 in 1958 with No. 3 &quot;Guess Things Happen That Way/Come In, Stranger&quot; by Cash, and No. 5 by Presley &quot;Don't/I Beg of You.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1958 Billboard.com] ''Billboard.com''  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105115329/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot%20Country%20Songs&amp;g=Year-end%20Singles&amp;year=1958 |date=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presley acknowledged the influence of [[rhythm and blues]] artists and his style, saying &quot;The colored folk been singin' and playin' it just the way I'm doin' it now, man for more years than I know.&quot; Within a few years, many rockabilly musicians returned to a more mainstream style or had defined their own unique style.

Country music gained national television exposure through ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' on ABC-TV and radio from 1955 to 1960 from [[Springfield, Missouri]]. The program showcased top stars including several rockabilly artists, some from the [[Ozarks]]. As Webb Pierce put it in 1956, &quot;Once upon a time, it was almost impossible to sell country music in a place like New York City. Nowadays, television takes us everywhere, and country music records and sheet music sell as well in large cities as anywhere else.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Art &quot;Dynamo – Country Style&quot; (1956), ''TV Guide'', p, 28&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1950s saw the emergence of [[Buddy Holly]], but by the end of the decade, backlash as well as traditional artists such as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Marty Robbins]], and [[Johnny Horton]] began to shift the industry away from the rock n' roll influences of the mid-1950s.
 
The [[Country Music Association]] was founded in 1958, in part because numerous country musicians were appalled by the increased influence of rock and roll on country music.&lt;ref name=&quot;RollingstoneDeath&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Bobby |title=Mac Wiseman, Bluegrass Icon, Dead at 93 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/mac-wiseman-bluegrass-country-music-dead-obituary-799481/ |accessdate=February 25, 2019 |work=Rolling Stone |date=February 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Nashville and countrypolitan sounds====
{{Main|Nashville sound}}

Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the Nashville sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Under the direction of producers such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], [[Owen Bradley]], [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]], and later [[Billy Sherrill]], the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a [[string section]] (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark &quot;licks&quot;. Leading artists in this genre included [[Jim Reeves]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Connie Smith]], [[The Browns]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 10–11}} [[Patsy Cline]], and [[Eddy Arnold]]. The &quot;slip note&quot; piano style of session musician [[Floyd Cramer]] was an important component of this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/floyd-cramer |title=Rockhall.com |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the [[British Invasion]] and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into [[countrypolitan]]. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Lynn Anderson]] and [[Charlie Rich]], as well as such former &quot;hard country&quot; artists as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] and [[Marty Robbins]]. Despite the appeal of the Nashville sound, many traditional country artists emerged during this period and dominated the genre: [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Buck Owens]], [[Porter Wagoner]], George Jones, and [[Sonny James]] among them.

====Country-soul crossover====
{{Main|Country soul}}
In 1962, [[Ray Charles]] surprised the pop world by turning his attention to country and western music, topping the charts and rating number three for the year on ''Billboard's'' pop chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1962 |title=Billboard.com |magazine=Billboard.com |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109172855/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The%2BBillboard%2BHot%2B100&amp;g=Year-end%2BSingles&amp;year=1962 |archivedate=9 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the &quot;[[I Can't Stop Loving You]]&quot; single, and recording the landmark album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]''.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 16}}

====Bakersfield sound====
Another subgenre of country music grew out of hardcore honky tonk with elements of [[Western swing]] and originated {{convert|112|mi|km|0}} north-northwest of Los Angeles in [[Bakersfield, California]], where many &quot;[[Okie]]s&quot; and other [[Dust Bowl]] migrants had settled. Influenced by one-time West Coast residents [[Bob Wills]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]], by 1966 it was known as the [[Bakersfield sound]]. It relied on electric instruments and amplification, in particular the [[Telecaster]] electric guitar, more than other subgenres of the country music of the era, and it can be described as having a sharp, hard, driving, no-frills, edgy flavor—hard guitars and honky-tonk harmonies.&lt;ref name = hamilton /&gt; Leading practitioners of this style were [[Buck Owens]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[Tommy Collins (country music)|Tommy Collins]], [[Gary Allan]], and [[Wynn Stewart]], each of whom had his own style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/haggard_merle/bio.jhtml |title=Merle Haggard: Biography |publisher=CMT.com |date=1937-04-06 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck18.html Buckowens.com], Buck Owen's Crystal Palace: About Buck {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213024906/http://www.buckowens.com/aboutbuck18.html |date=December 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Nelson (United States record producer)|Ken Nelson]], who had produced Owens and Haggard and [[Rose Maddox]] became interested in the trucking song subgenre following the success of ''Six Days on the Road'' and asked [[Red Simpson]] to record an album of trucking songs.

The Country music scene of the 1940s until the 1970s was largely dominated by Western music influences, so much so that the genre began to be called “Country and Western”. &lt;ref name=&quot;June-Friesen 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=June-Friesen | first=Katy | title=The Cowboy in Country Music | website=Smithsonian Magazine | date=September 7, 2011 | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-cowboy-in-country-music-71339427/ | access-date=February 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, cowboy and frontier values continue to play a role in the larger Country music, with [[Western wear]], [[cowboy boot]]s, and [[cowboy hat]]s continues to be in fashion for country artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wide Open Country 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Best and Worst Country Fashion Trends in History | website=Wide Open Country | date=August 9, 2018 | url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/country-fashion-trends/ | access-date=February 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West of the [[Mississippi river]], many of these Western genres continue to flourish, including the [[Red dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] of [[Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio Texas, LIVE! 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=What is Red Dirt? | website=Radio Texas, LIVE! | date=April 11, 2018 | url=https://radiotexaslive.com/what-is-red-dirt-music/ | access-date=February 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Mexico music]] of [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Latino USA 2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The 10 Best Songs of New Mexico Music, America’s Forgotten Folk Genre | website=Latino USA | date=November 8, 2017 | url=https://www.latinousa.org/2017/11/08/10-best-songs-new-mexico-music-americas-forgotten-folk-genre/ | access-date=February 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both [[Texas country music]] and [[Tejano music]] of [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dansby 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Dansby | first=Andrew | title=Freddy Fender, 'giant of Texas music,' dies at 69 | website=Houston Chronicle | date=October 15, 2006 | url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Freddy-Fender-giant-of-Texas-music-dies-at-69-1492844.php | access-date=February 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Highways 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Little Joe’s Big Life | website=Texas Highways | date=December 16, 2016 | url=https://texashighways.com/culture/people/little-joe-hernandez-big-life/ | access-date=February 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s until the early 1970s, the latter part of the Western heyday in Country music, many of these genres featured popular artist that continue to influence both their distinctive  genres and larger Country music. Red Dirt featured [[Bob Childers]] and [[Steve Ripley]]; for New Mexico music [[Al Hurricane]], [[Al Hurricane Jr.]], and [[Antonia Apodaca]]; and within the Texas scenes [[Willie Nelson]], [[Freddie Fender]], and [[Little Joe (singer)|Little Joe]].

As Outlaw country music emerged as subgenre in its own right, Red Dirt, New Mexico, Texas country, and Tejano grew in popularity as a part of the Outlaw country movement. Originating in the bars, fiestas, and honky-tonks of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas, their music supplemented outlaw country's singer-songwriter tradition as well as future [[rock music|rock]]-inspired [[alternative country]] and [[hip-hop music|hip hop]]-inspired [[country rap]] artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beaujohn |first1=Andrew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/arts/music/18beau.html |title=Alt-Country Finds Red Dirt Under Its Nails |accessdate=5 September 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=18 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucero&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Lucero | first=Mario J. | title=The problem with how the music streaming industry handles data | website=Quartz | url=https://qz.com/1773480/the-problem-with-how-the-music-streaming-industry-handles-data/ | access-date=February 7, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western music artists such as [[Michael Martin Murphey]], and artists within the aforementioned styles and genres, have seen continued success throughout their respective fields, including the likes of [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]], [[Lorenzo Antonio]], [[Sparx (US band)|Sparx]], [[Pat Green]], and [[Jack Ingram]].

====Outlaw country====
[[File:Willie Nelson at Farm Aid 2009 - Cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willie Nelson]] (2009)]]
{{Main|Outlaw country}}
Derived from the traditional Western, including [[Red dirt (music)|Red Dirt]], [[New Mexico music|New Mexico]], [[Texas country music|Texas country]], [[Tejano music|Tejano]], and [[honky-tonk]] musical styles of the late 1950s and 1960s. Songs such as the 1963 [[Johnny Cash]] popularized &quot;[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]&quot; show clear influences from the likes of [[Al Hurricane]] and [[Little Joe (singer)|Little Joe]], this influence just happened to culminate with artists such as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] (whose band, the &quot;Cherokee Cowboys&quot;, included [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Roger Miller]]) and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period, outlaw country revolutionized the genre of country music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 1974 TX&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine=Billboard | date= Sep 7, 1974 | title= Giley, Rodriguez, Spread Fame Of Texas Country Music Heritage | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard 1974 NM&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | magazine=Billboard | date= Sep 7, 1974 | title= Hurricane Enterprises in New Mexico | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;After I left Nashville (the early 70s), I wanted to relax and play the music that I wanted to play, and just stay around Texas, maybe Oklahoma.

The whole outlaw thing, it had nothing to do with the music, it was something that got written in an article, and the young people said, 'Well, that's pretty cool.' And started listening.&quot; (Willie Nelson)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Roots of Country Music&quot; Collectors Edition by ''Life'', September 1, 1994 page 72&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''outlaw country'' is traditionally associated with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axs.com/jerry-jeff-walker-bringing-outlaw-country-to-bi ]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], Merle Haggard, [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Joe Ely]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlawcountrycruise.com/lineup/view/76/|title=Joe Ely Band|last=Sixthman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Young, [[David Allan Coe]], [[John Prine]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Michael Martin Murphey]], [[Tompall Glaser]], [[Steve Earle]], and the later career renaissance of Johnny Cash, along with a few female vocalists such as [[Jessi Colter]], [[Sammi Smith]], [[Tanya Tucker]], and [[Rosanne Cash]]. It was encapsulated in the 1976 album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''.

====Country pop====
{{Main|Country pop}}
[[File:John Denver 1975.JPG|thumb|upright|[[John Denver]] (1975)]]
Country pop or soft pop, with roots in the [[countrypolitan]] sound, folk music, and [[soft rock]], is a subgenre that first emerged in the 1970s. Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to [[adult contemporary music]]. It started with pop music singers like [[Glen Campbell]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Anne Murray]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[The Bellamy Brothers]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (&quot;[[Rocky Mountain High]]&quot;, &quot;[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]&quot;, &quot;[[Annie's Song]]&quot;, &quot;[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]&quot;, and &quot;[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]&quot;), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the &quot;Best Female Country Vocal Performance&quot; as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year&quot;. In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, [[Jean Shepard]] and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived &quot;Association of Country Entertainers&quot; in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.
[[File:Dolly Parton, 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dolly Parton]]]]

During the mid-1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit &quot;[[Here You Come Again]]&quot;, which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, [[Kenny Rogers]], came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition|The First Edition]], achieving success the same year with &quot;[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]&quot;, which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart. Parton and Rogers would both continue to have success on both country and pop charts simultaneously, well into the 1980s. Artists like [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[Barbara Mandrell]] would also find success on the pop charts with their records. In 1975, author Paul Hemphill stated in the ''Saturday Evening Post'', &quot;Country music isn't really country anymore; it is a hybrid of nearly every form of popular music in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hemphill | first1 = Paul | year = 1975 | title = Nashville—Where It All Started | url = | journal = Saturday Evening Post | volume = 247 | issue = 3| pages = 44–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1980s, country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Juice Newton]] each had two songs in the top 5 of the Billboard Hot 100 in the early eighties: Nelson charted &quot;[[Always on My Mind]]&quot; (No. 5, 1982) and &quot;[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]&quot; (No. 5, 1984, a duet with [[Julio Iglesias]]), and Newton achieved success with &quot;[[Queen of Hearts (Hank DeVito song)|Queen of Hearts]]&quot; (No. 2, 1981) and &quot;[[Angel of the Morning]]&quot; (No. 4, 1981). Four country songs topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in the 1980s: &quot;[[Lady (Kenny Rogers song)|Lady]]&quot; by [[Kenny Rogers]], from the late fall of 1980; &quot;[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]&quot; by [[Dolly Parton]], &quot;[[I Love a Rainy Night]]&quot; by [[Eddie Rabbitt]] (these two back-to-back at the top in early 1981); and &quot;[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]&quot;, a duet by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers in 1983, a pop-country crossover hit written by Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb of the [[Bee Gees]]. Newton's &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot; almost reached No. 1, but was kept out of the spot by the pop ballad juggernaut &quot;[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]&quot; by [[Diana Ross]] and [[Lionel Richie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp Billboard.com], Historical Music Charts Archive. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803173648/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_index.jsp |date=August 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move of country music toward neotraditional styles led to a marked decline in country/pop crossovers in the late 1980s, and only one song in that period—[[Roy Orbison]]'s &quot;[[You Got It]]&quot;, from 1989—made the top 10 of both the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]]&quot; and Hot 100 charts, due largely to a revival of interest in Orbison after his sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, Joel, &quot;Top Country Songs: 1944–2008,&quot; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, Joel, &quot;Top Pop Singles: 1955–2006,&quot; 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The only song with substantial country airplay to reach number one on the pop charts in the late 1980s was &quot;[[At This Moment]]&quot; by [[Billy Vera]] and the Beaters, an R&amp;B song with slide guitar embellishment that appeared at number 42 on the country charts from minor crossover airplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/quartzy/1592928/old-town-road-is-only-the-third-country-song-in-30-years-to-make-it-to-make-it-to-no-1/|title=&quot;Old Town Road&quot; is only the third country song in 30 years to make it to make it to number one|first1=Dan|last1=Kopf|first2=Dan|last2=Kopf|website=Quartzy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record-setting, multi-platinum group [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] was named Artist of the Decade for the 1980s by the Academy of Country Music.

====Country rock====

[[File:Eagles cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|A reunited [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] in 2008]]

Country rock is a genre that started in the 1960s but became prominent in the 1970s. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the &quot;old values&quot; of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]]. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included [[Bob Dylan]], who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 54}} (and even more so with that album's follow-up, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''), followed by [[Gene Clark]], Clark's former band [[The Byrds]] (with [[Gram Parsons]] on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'') and its spin-off [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist [[Clarence White]], [[Michael Nesmith]] ([[The Monkees]] and the [[First National Band]]), the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Poco]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], among many, even the former folk music duo [[Ian &amp; Sylvia]], who formed [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]] in 1969. The Eagles would become the most successful of these country rock acts, and their compilation album ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' remains the second best-selling album of all time in the US with 29 million copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6844102/glenn-frey-eagles-biggest-billboard-hits|title= Glenn Frey &amp; Eagles' Biggest Billboard Hits |date=January 18, 2016|author= Gary Trust |work=Billboard }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rolling Stones]] also got into the act with songs like &quot;[[Dead Flowers (The Rolling Stones song)|Dead Flowers]]&quot; and a country version of &quot;[[Honky Tonk Women]]&quot;.

Described by [[AllMusic]] as the &quot;father of country-rock&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5109|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com], Gram Parsons: Overview&lt;/ref&gt; Gram Parsons' work in the early 1970s was acclaimed for its purity and for his appreciation for aspects of traditional country music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/gramparsons Rollingstone.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429081141/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/gramparsons |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his career was cut tragically short by his 1973 death, his legacy was carried on by his protégé and duet partner [[Emmylou Harris]]; Harris would release her debut solo in 1975, an amalgamation of country, rock and roll, folk, blues and pop. Subsequent to the initial blending of the two polar opposite genres, other offspring soon resulted, including [[Southern rock]], [[heartland rock]] and in more recent years, [[alternative country]]. In the decades that followed, artists such as [[Juice Newton]], [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] (and, to an even greater extent, [[Hank Williams III]]), [[Gary Allan]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Brooks &amp; Dunn]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] moved country further towards rock influence.

====Neocountry====
In 1980, a style of &quot;neocountry disco music&quot; was popularized by the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 259&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Gerald W.

Sales in record stores rocketed to $250 million in 1981; by 1984, 900 radio stations began programming country or neocountry pop full-time. As with most sudden trends, however, by 1984 sales had dropped below 1979 figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Workin 1999. page 259&quot;/&gt;

====Neotraditionalist movement====
{{Main|Neotraditionalist country}}
[[File:George Strait 2014 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Strait]], one of the best selling musicians of all-time (2014)]]
During the mid-1980s, a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts, in favor of more, traditional, &quot;back-to-basics&quot; production. Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included [[Travis Tritt]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], and [[The Judds]].

Beginning in 1989, a confluence of events brought an unprecedented commercial boom to country music. The arrival of exceptionally talented artists coincided with new marketing strategies to engage fans, technology that more accurately tracked the popularity of country music, and a political and economic climate that focused attention on the genre. [[Garth Brooks]] (&quot;Friends in Low Places&quot;) in particular attracted fans with his fusion of neotraditionalist country and [[arena rock|stadium rock]]. Other artists such as [[Brooks and Dunn]] (&quot;Boot Scootin' Boogie&quot;) also combined conventional country with slick, rock elements, while [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] updated neotraditionalist styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Jocelyn R.|title=Country Music|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2224075|website=Oxford music online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Country music was aided by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) Docket 80–90, which led to a significant expansion of [[FM radio]] in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural [[AM radio]] stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by [[talk radio]] (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the [[classic country]] format for the AM audience). At the same time, [[beautiful music]] stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which had published a [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on [[country radio]] determined a song's place on the chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=R&amp;B Enjoying Rare Dominance Over Rap|journal=Billboard|date=24 April 2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mxAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Nielsen+Broadcast+Data+Systems+january+20+1990#v=onepage&amp;q=Nielsen%20Broadcast%20Data%20Systems%20january%2020%201990&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Garth Brooks]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Worldwide&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1510,3298161&amp;dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&amp;hl=en |title=Country is No. 1 musical style |date=1992-08-19 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Worldwide2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4760,3698051&amp;dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&amp;hl=en |title=Country music reflects the time |date=1992-09-27 |publisher=Herald-Journal |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Country Worldwide3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+25%2C+1993&amp;author=Jack+Hurst&amp;pub=The+Record&amp;desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&amp;pqatl=google |title=Country music is making waves across the seas |date=1993-11-25 |publisher=thestar.com |accessdate=2010-07-26 | first=Jack | last=Hurst}}&lt;/ref&gt; who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade. The [[RIAA]] has certified his recordings at a combined (128× [[RIAA certification|platinum]]), denoting roughly 113 million U.S. shipments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=RIAA.com |publisher=RIAA.com |accessdate=2011-02-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archivedate=2007-06-26 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists that experienced success during this time included [[Clint Black]], [[Sammy Kershaw]], [[Aaron Tippin]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Alan Jackson]] and the newly formed duo of [[Brooks &amp; Dunn]]; [[George Strait]], whose career began in the 1980s, also continued to have widespread success in this decade and beyond. [[Toby Keith]] began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the late 1990s with ''[[Pull My Chain]]'' and its follow-up, ''[[Unleashed (Toby Keith album)|Unleashed]]''.

====Success of female artists====
Female artists such as [[Reba McEntire]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Deana Carter]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Mindy McCready]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album ''[[Wide Open Spaces]]'' went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer [[Natalie Maines]]'s comments disparaging then-President [[George W. Bush]] while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the [[Iraq War]] a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall but largely ignored among country audiences{{Citation needed|reason=Who else would have bought it except the country audience?|date=December 2016}}. After ''Taking the Long Way'', the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the [[Court Yard Hounds]]) before embarking on a reunion tour in 2016.

[[File:ShaniaTwain3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shania Twain]] performing during her [[Up! Tour]] in 2004]]

[[Shania Twain]] became the best selling female country artist of the decade. This was primarily due to the success of her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, ''[[The Woman in Me (Shania Twain album)|The Woman in Me]]'', which was certified 12x platinum sold over 20 million copies worldwide and its follow up, 1997's ''[[Come On Over]]'', which was certified 20x platinum and sold over 40 million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums of 1998, 1999 and 2000; it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time.

Unlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', which was certified 11x platinum and sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Twain has been credited with breaking international boundaries for country music, as well as inspiring many country artists to incorporate different genres into their music in order to attract a wider audience. She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical '[[honky-tonk]]' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.

====Line dancing revival====
In the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of [[line dancing]]. This influence was so great that [[Chet Atkins]] was quoted as saying, &quot;The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Roots of Country Music&quot; Collectors Edition by ''Life'', September 1, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as [[Don Williams]] and [[George Jones]] who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.

====Alt-country/Americana====
{{Main|Alt country|cowpunk}}

[[File:WilcoFIB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Wilco]] performing in Spain in 2007]]

Country influences combined with [[Punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]] to forge the &quot;[[cowpunk]]&quot; scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as [[The Long Ryders]], [[Lone Justice]] and [[The Beat Farmers]], as well as the established punk group [[X (American band)|X]], whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malone2002&quot;&gt;W. C. Malone, ''Country Music, U.S.A.'' (Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 2nd edn., 2002), {{ISBN|0-292-75262-8}}, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, a generation of diverse country artists outside of California emerged that rejected the perceived cultural and musical conservatism associated with Nashville's mainstream country musicians in favor of more countercultural outlaw country and the folk singer-songwriter traditions of artists such as [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

Artists from outside California who were associated with early alternative country included singer-songwriters such as [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Lyle Lovett]] and [[Steve Earle]], the Nashville country rock band [[Jason and the Scorchers]] and the British post-punk band [[The Mekons]]. Earle, in particular, was noted for his popularity with both country and [[college rock]] audiences: He promoted his 1986 debut album ''[[Guitar Town]]'' with a tour that saw him open for both country singer [[Dwight Yoakam]] and alternative rock band [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Deming|first1=Mark|title=Guitar Town – Steve Earle {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/guitar-town-mw0000189768|website=AllMusic|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoakam also cultivated a fanbase spanning multiple genres through his stripped-down [[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk]] influenced sound, association with the cowpunk scene, and performances at Los Angeles punk rock clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Dwight Yoakam {{!}} Biography &amp; History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=7 August 2019 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early styles had coalesced into a genre by the time the Illinois group [[Uncle Tupelo]] released their influential debut album ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=smith2009&gt;C. Smith, ''101 Albums That Changed Popular Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-537371-5}}, pp. 204–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicNoDepression&quot;&gt;M. Deming, [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r626894|pure_url=yes}} &quot;No Depression Bonus Tracks&quot;], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 26 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The album is widely credited as being the first &quot;alternative country&quot; album, and inspired the name of ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' magazine, which exclusively covered the new genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicNoDepression&quot;/&gt; Following Uncle Tupelo's disbanding in 1994, its members formed two significant bands in genre: [[Wilco]] and [[Son Volt]]. Although Wilco's sound had moved away from country and towards [[indie rock]] by the time they released their critically acclaimed album ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' in 2002, they have continued to be an influence on later alt-country artists.

Other acts who became prominent in the alt-country genre during the 1990s and 2000s included [[The Bottle Rockets]], [[The Handsome Family]], [[Blue Mountain (band)|Blue Mountain]], [[Robbie Fulks]], [[Blood Oranges]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Drive-By Truckers]], [[Old 97's]], [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[Nickel Creek]], [[Neko Case]], and [[Whiskeytown]], whose lead singer [[Ryan Adams]] later had a successful solo-career.&lt;ref name=WolfandDuanep549-92&gt;K. Wolff and O. Duane, eds, ''Country Music: the Rough Guide'' (London: Rough Guides, 2000), {{ISBN|1-85828-534-8}}, pp. 549–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Alt-country, in various iterations overlapped with other genres, including [[Red dirt (music)|Red Dirt country music]] ([[Cross Canadian Ragweed]]), [[jam band]]s ([[My Morning Jacket]] and [[The String Cheese Incident]]), and [[indie folk]] ([[The Avett Brothers]]).

Despite the genre's growing popularity in the 1980s, '90s and 2000s, alternative country and neo-traditionalist artists saw minimal support from country radio in those decades, despite strong sales and critical acclaim for albums such as the soundtrack to the 2000 film ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Strauss |first1=Neil |title=MUSIC; The Country Music Country Radio Ignores |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/24/movies/music-the-country-music-country-radio-ignores.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=13 April 2019 |date=24 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, The Beat Farmers gained airplay on country music stations with their song &quot;Make It Last&quot;, but the single was pulled from the format when station programmers decreed the band's music was too rock-oriented for their audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beat Farmers {{!}} Biography &amp; History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/beat-farmers-mn0000038661/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=13 April 2019 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some alt-country songs have been [[Crossover music|crossover hits]] to mainstream country radio in cover versions by established artists on the format; Lucinda Williams' &quot;[[Passionate Kisses]]&quot; was a hit for [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] in 1993, Ryan Adams's &quot;[[When The Stars Go Blue]]&quot; was a hit for [[Tim McGraw]] in 2007, and Old Crow Medicine Show's &quot;[[Wagon Wheel (song)|Wagon Wheel]]&quot; was a hit for [[Darius Rucker]] in 2013.

In the 2010s, the alt-country genre saw an increase in its critical and commercial popularity, owing to the success of artists such as [[The Civil Wars]], [[Chris Stapleton]], [[Sturgill Simpson]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Lydia Loveless]] and [[Margo Price]]. In 2019, [[Kacey Musgraves]] – a country artist who had gained a following with [[indie rock]] fans and music critics despite minimal airplay on country radio – won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for her album ''[[Golden Hour (album)|Golden Hour]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moss |first1=Marissa R. |title=How Kacey Musgraves' Grammy Wins Give Country Radio a Choice to Make |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/kacey-musgraves-grammy-golden-hour-country-radio-793796/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=22 April 2019 |date=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth generation of country music continued to be influenced by other genres such as pop, rock, and R&amp;B. [[Richard Marx]] crossed over with his ''[[Days in Avalon]]'' album, which features five country songs and several singers and musicians. [[Alison Krauss]] sang background vocals to Marx's single &quot;Straight from My Heart.&quot; Also, [[Bon Jovi]] had a hit single, &quot;[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]&quot;, with [[Jennifer Nettles]] of [[Sugarland]]. [[Kid Rock]]'s collaboration with [[Sheryl Crow]], &quot;[[Picture (song)|Picture]],&quot; was a major crossover hit in 2001 and began Kid Rock's transition from hard rock to a country-rock hybrid that would later produce another major crossover hit, 2008's &quot;[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]].&quot; (Crow would also cross over into country with her hit &quot;[[Easy (Sheryl Crow song)|Easy]].&quot;) [[Darius Rucker]], frontman for the 1990s pop-rock band [[Hootie &amp; the Blowfish]], began a country solo career in the late 2000s, one that to date has produced three albums and several hits on both the country charts and the Billboard Hot 100. Singer-songwriter [[Unknown Hinson]] became famous for his appearance in the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] television show ''Wild, Wild, South'', after which Hinson started his own band and toured in southern states. Other rock stars who featured a country song on their albums were [[Don Henley]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]].

In 2005, country singer [[Carrie Underwood]] rose to fame as the winner of the fourth season of ''[[American Idol]]'' and has since become one of the most prominent recording artists of 2006 through 2016, with worldwide sales of more than 65 million records and seven [[Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/readers-poll-10-best-carrie-underwood-songs-20150310 |title=Readers' Poll: 10 Best Carrie Underwood Songs |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=March 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With her first single, &quot;[[Inside Your Heaven]]&quot;, Underwood became the only solo country artist to have a #1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in the 2000–2009 decade and also broke ''Billboard'' chart history as the first country music artist ever to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Underwood's debut album, ''[[Some Hearts (Carrie Underwood album)|Some Hearts]]'', became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the #1 Country Album of the 2000–2009 decade. She has also become the female country artist with the most number one hits on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991–present), having 14 No. 1s and breaking her own ''[[Guinness Book]]'' record of ten. In 2007, Underwood won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]], becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has listed Underwood as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]].
In 2016, Underwood topped the [[Country Airplay]] chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with most number ones on that chart.

[[Carrie Underwood]] was one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s. In addition to Underwood, ''American Idol'' launched the careers of [[Kellie Pickler]], [[Josh Gracin]], [[Bucky Covington]], [[Kristy Lee Cook]], [[Danny Gokey]], [[Lauren Alaina]] and [[Scotty McCreery]] (as well as that of occasional country singer [[Kelly Clarkson]]) in the decade, and would continue to launch country careers in the 2010s. The series ''[[Nashville Star]]'', while not nearly as successful as ''Idol'', did manage to bring [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Chris Young (musician)|Chris Young]] to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as [[Buddy Jewell]], [[Sean Patrick McGraw]], and Canadian musician [[George Canyon]]. ''[[Can You Duet]]?'' produced the duos [[Steel Magnolia]] and [[Joey + Rory]]. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress [[Jennette McCurdy]] (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom ''[[iCarly]]'') released her first single, &quot;So Close&quot;, following that with the single &quot;[[Generation Love]]&quot; in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, [[Miley Cyrus]] (of ''[[Hannah Montana]]''), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with &quot;[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]&quot; and another with a duet with her father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], with &quot;[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]].&quot; [[Jana Kramer]], an actress in the teen drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013. Actresses [[Hayden Panettiere]] and [[Connie Britton]] began recording country songs as part of their roles in the TV series ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.

One of the most commercially successful country artists of the late 2000s and early 2010s has been singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, &quot;[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]],&quot; was released when Swift was only 16. In 2006, Swift released her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]], which spent 275 weeks on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', which made her the second longest number-one charted on ''Billboard'' 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'') within the past 5 years. At the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010 Grammys]], Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for ''Fearless'', which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received ten [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] already. Buoyed by her [[teen idol]] status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single &quot;[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]&quot; spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and [[Hot Country Songs]] chart of any song in nearly five decades.  The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), and ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) were released solely to [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/6228999/taylor-swift-country-music-split |title=Are Taylor Swift and Country Splitting Up for Good? |author= Jem Aswad |date= August 22, 2014 |work=Billboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/taylor-swift-country-pop-transformation-20140909 |title=Trace Taylor Swift's Country-to-Pop Transformation in 5 Song |author= Keith Harris |date=September 9, 2014 |work=Rolling Stone }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/08/18/taylor-swift-shakes-off-country-with-first-pop-album-1989/14256849/ |title=Taylor Swift shakes off country with first pop album |author=Patrick Ryan and Brian Mansfield |work= USA TODAY |date= August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 and the economic recession helped move country music back into the spotlight. Many country artists, such as Alan Jackson with his ballad on terrorist attacks, &quot;[[Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)]]&quot;, wrote songs that celebrated the military, highlighted the gospel, and emphasized home and family values over wealth. Alt-Country singer Ryan Adams song &quot;[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]&quot; pays tribute to New York City, and its popular music video (which was shot 4 days before the attacks) shows Adams playing in front of the Manhattan skyline, Along with several shots of the city. In contrast, more rock-oriented country singers took more direct aim at the attacks' perpetrators; Toby Keith's &quot;[[Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)|The Angry American (Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue)]]&quot; threatened to &quot;a boot in&quot; the posterior of the enemy, while Charlie Daniels's &quot;[[This Ain't No Rag, It's a Flag]]&quot; promised to &quot;hunt&quot; the perpetrators &quot;down like a mad dog hound.&quot; These songs gained such recognition that it put country music back into popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Jocelyn|title=Country Music|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2224075|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[rock music]] in country has become more overt during the late 2000s and early 2010s as artists like [[Eric Church]], [[Jason Aldean]], and [[Brantley Gilbert]] have had success; [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]], former frontman for the rock group [[Staind]], had a moderately successful entry into country music in 2011 and 2012. {{Main|Bro-country}}

==== Bluegrass Country ====
[[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass Country]] is a genre that contain songs about going through hard times, country loving, and telling stories. Artists like [[Tyler Childers]] have been increasing the popularity of this genre. Some may claim that his music is from the heart and you can feel what he is singing. The genre has developed in the [[Northern Kentucky]] and [[Cincinnati]] area. It is called bluegrass because of the type of grass that is in this area. Other artists include [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Osborne Brothers]], and many others.

==== Pop-Country ====
{{Main|Country pop}}
In the mid to late 2010s, country music began to increasingly sound more like the [[Pop music|Pop]] style of music. Some modern artists that primarily or entirely produce [[country pop]] music include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Sam Hunt]], [[Maren Morris]], [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[Kane Brown]], [[Chris Lane]], and [[Dan + Shay]]. With more simple and repetitive lyrics, more electronic-based instrumentation and experimentation with “talk-singing” and rap, Pop-Country pulled farther away from the traditional sounds of country music. However, some newer artists have thrived despite using a more traditional country sound, such as [[Jon Pardi]] and [[Riley Green (singer)|Riley Green]].

Outside of the United States, Canada has the largest country music fan and artist base, something that is to be expected given the two countries' proximity and cultural parallels. Mainstream country music is culturally ingrained in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]], the [[British Columbia Interior]], Ontario, and in [[Atlantic Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfe |first=Charles K. |author2=James Edward Akenson |title=The Women of Country Music |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=162=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] developed in Atlantic Canada in the form of Scottish, Acadian and Irish folk music popular amongst Irish, French and Scottish immigrants to Canada's Atlantic Provinces ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Nova Scotia, [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; Like the southern United States and [[Appalachia]], all four regions are of heavy [[British Isles]] stock and rural; as such, the development of traditional music in the Maritimes somewhat mirrored the development of country music in the US South and Appalachia. Country and Western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or &quot;[[sea shanty]]&quot; in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred. Certain areas often are viewed as embracing one strain or the other more openly. For example, in Newfoundland the traditional music remains unique and [[Music of Ireland|Irish]] in nature, whereas traditional musicians in other parts of the region may play both genres interchangeably.

''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' was a [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]-based country/folk variety television show that was broadcast nationally from 1957 to 1969. In Canada it out-performed ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' broadcast from the United States and became the top-rated television show throughout much of the 1960s. ''Don Messer's Jubilee'' followed a consistent format throughout its years, beginning with a tune named &quot;Goin' to the Barndance Tonight&quot;, followed by fiddle tunes by Messer, songs from some of his &quot;Islanders&quot; including singers [[Marg Osburne]] and [[Charlie Chamberlain]], the featured guest performance, and a closing hymn. It ended with &quot;[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]&quot;.

The guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] and [[Catherine McKinnon]]. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. [[Hank Snow]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]] (also known as Montana Slim), and [[Anne Murray]] are the three most notable.

The cancellation of the show by the public broadcaster in 1969 caused a nationwide protest, including the raising of questions in the Parliament of Canada.

The Prairie provinces, due to their western cowboy and agrarian nature, are the true heartland of Canadian country music.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; While the Prairies never developed a traditional music culture anything like the Maritimes, the folk music of the Prairies often reflected the cultural origins of the settlers, who were a mix of [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]], [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukrainian]], [[Canadians of German ethnicity|German]] and others. For these reasons [[polka]]s and Western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do. The Atlantic Provinces, on the other hand, produce far more traditional musicians, but they are not usually specifically country in nature, usually bordering more on the [[Folk music|folk]] or [[Celtic music|Celtic]] genres.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

Many traditional country artists are present in eastern and western Canada. They make common use of fiddle and pedal steel guitar styles. Some notable Canadian country artists include [[Shania Twain]], [[Anne Murray]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[George Canyon]], [[Blue Rodeo]], [[Tommy Hunter]], [[Rita MacNeil]], [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Stan Rogers]], [[Ronnie Prophet]], [[Carroll Baker (singer)|Carroll Baker]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Ian Tyson]], [[Johnny Reid]], [[Paul Brandt]], [[Jason McCoy]], [[George Fox (singer)|George Fox]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Don Messer]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]], [[Michelle Wright]], [[Terri Clark]], [[Prairie Oyster]], [[Family Brown]], [[Johnny Mooring]], [[Marg Osburne]], [[Lindsay Ell]], [[Doc Walker]], [[Emerson Drive]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Corb Lund and the Hurtin' Albertans]], [[Crystal Shawanda]], [[Dean Brody]], [[Shane Yellowbird]], [[Gord Bamford]], [[Chad Brownlee]], [[The Road Hammers]], [[Brett Kissel]], [[Colter Wall]] and [[The Higgins]].

[[Australian country music]] has a long tradition. Influenced by American country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Country instruments, including the guitar, [[banjo]], [[fiddle]] and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.

Folk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government [[tyranny]], or the lives of [[bushranger]]s, [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[sheep shearer|shearers]], continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as &quot;bush music&quot; or &quot;[[bush band]] music&quot;. &quot;[[Waltzing Matilda]]&quot;, often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by American country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include &quot;[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]&quot;, &quot;[[Click Go the Shears]]&quot;, &quot;The Queensland Drover&quot; and &quot;The Dying Stockman&quot;. Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginality]] and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |title=Bush songs and music – Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406104520/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |archivedate=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |title=Australian country music – Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217020802/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |archivedate=2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] (known as &quot;The Father of Australian Country Music&quot;) in the 1930s. Author Andrew Smith delivers a through research and engaged view of Tex Morton's life and his impact on the country music scene in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Other early stars included [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]], [[Shirley Thoms]] and [[Smoky Dawson]]. Buddy Williams (1918–1986) was the first Australian-born to record country music in Australia in the late 1930s and was the pioneer of a distinctly Australian style of country music called the bush ballad that others such as Slim Dusty would make popular in later years. During the Second World War, many of Buddy Williams recording sessions were done whilst on leave from the Army. At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.

In 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. [[Slim Dusty]] (1927–2003) was known as the &quot;King of Australian Country Music&quot; and helped to popularise the Australian [[bush ballad]]. His successful career spanned almost six decades, and his 1957 hit &quot;[[A Pub with No Beer]]&quot; was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, and with over seven million record sales in Australia he is the most successful artist in Australian musical history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-obit&quot;&gt;Dave&quot; Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries &quot;Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer&quot;], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing &quot;[[Waltzing Matilda]]&quot; in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Dusty's wife [[Joy McKean]] penned several of his most popular songs.

[[Chad Morgan]], who began recording in the 1950s, has represented a [[vaudeville]] style of comic Australian country; [[Frank Ifield]] achieved considerable success in the early 1960s, especially in the UK Singles Charts and [[Reg Lindsay]] was one of the first Australians to perform at Nashville's [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duncan |first=Jamie |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/reg-lindsay-country-great-takes-final-bow/1236107.aspx |title=Reg Lindsay, country great, takes final bow – Local News – News – General |newspaper=The Canberra Times |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807072605/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/reg-lindsay-country-great-takes-final-bow/1236107.aspx |archivedate=7 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Bogle]]'s 1972 folk lament to the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] &quot;[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]&quot; recalled the British and Irish origins of Australian folk-country.

By the 1990s, country music had attained crossover success in the pop charts, with artists like [[James Blundell (singer)|James Blundell]] and [[James Reyne]] singing &quot;[[The Dingoes|Way Out West]]&quot;, and country star [[Kasey Chambers]] winning the [[ARIA Award for Best Female Artist]] in 2000, 2002 and 2004, tying with pop stars [[Wendy Matthews]] and [[Sia (musician)|Sia]] for the most wins in that category. Furthermore, Chambers has gone on to win nine [[ARIA Award for Best Country Album|ARIA Awards for Best Country Album]] and, in 2018, became the youngest artist to ever be inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]]. The crossover influence of Australian country is also evident in the music of successful contemporary bands [[the Waifs]] and the [[John Butler Trio]]. [[Nick Cave]] has been heavily influenced by the country artist [[Johnny Cash]]. In 2000, Cash, covered Cave's &quot;[[The Mercy Seat (song)|The Mercy Seat]]&quot; on the album ''[[American III: Solitary Man]]'', seemingly repaying Cave for the compliment he paid by covering Cash's &quot;The Singer&quot; (originally &quot;[[The Folk Singer]]&quot;) on his ''[[Kicking Against the Pricks]]'' album. Subsequently, Cave cut a duet with Cash on a version of [[Hank Williams]]' &quot;[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]&quot; for Cash's ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'' album (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Nick Cave |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/13/arts.artsnews1 |title=Nick Cave on Johnny Cash &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 2003-09-13|accessdate=2011-02-01 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular contemporary performers of Australian country music include [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] (who wrote the iconic &quot;[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]&quot;), [[Lee Kernaghan]] (whose hits include &quot;Boys from the Bush&quot; and &quot;[[The Outback Club]]&quot;), [[Gina Jeffreys]], [[Forever Road]] and [[Sara Storer]]. In the United States, [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Sherrié Austin]] and [[Keith Urban]] have attained great success. During her time as a country singer in the 1970s, Newton-John became the first (and to date only) non-American winner of the [[Country Music Association Award for Female Vocalist of the Year]] which many considered a controversial decision by the CMA; after starring in the rock-and-roll musical film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1978, Newton-John (mirroring the character she played in the film) shifted to pop music in the 1980s. Urban is arguably considered the most successful international Australian country star, winning nine CMA Awards, including three [[Country Music Association Award for Male Vocalist of the Year|Male Vocalist of the Year]] wins and two wins of the CMA's top honour [[Country Music Association Award for Entertainer of the Year|Entertainer of the Year]].

Country music has been a particularly popular form of musical expression among [[Indigenous Australians]]. [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] is among Australia's successful contemporary indigenous performers, and [[Kev Carmody]] and [[Archie Roach]] employ a combination of folk-rock and country music to sing about Aboriginal rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/folk/ |title=Australian folk music – Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |accessdate=2011-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217015929/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/folk/ |archivedate=2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] began in 1973 and now attracts up to 100,000 visitors annually. Held in [[Tamworth, New South Wales]] (country music capital of Australia), it celebrates the culture and heritage of Australian country music. During the festival the [[Country Music Association of Australia|CMAA]] holds the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] ceremony awarding the [[Golden Guitar]] trophies.  Other significant country music festivals include the Whittlesea Country Music Festival (near [[Melbourne]]) and the [[Mildura Country Music Festival]] for &quot;independent&quot; performers during October, and the [[Canberra Country Music Festival]] held in the national capital during November.

''Country HQ'' showcases new talent on the rise in the country music scene [[down under]].

Country music has enjoyed mainstream exposure and success throughout the '60s and '70s in the United Kingdom. However, this somewhat diminished in the '90s and 2000s. Though, there have been exceptions such as [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Shania Twain]] in the '90s (particularly the latter) and Taylor Swift, [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Lady Antebellum]] and the Dixie Chicks in the 2000s. Crossover hits (in terms of singles and albums) within the country genre are few and far between and have been since the '80s. There are some [[British country music]] acts and publications. Although radio stations devoted to country are among the most popular in other Anglophone nations, none of the top 10 [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|most-listened-to stations in the UK]] are country stations, and national broadcaster [[BBC Radio]] does not offer a full-time country station ([[BBC Radio 2 Country]], a &quot;pop-up&quot; station, operated four days each year between 2015 and 2017). The BBC does offer a country show on [[BBC Radio 2]] each week hosted by [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php |publisher=Rajar |title=Quarterly Listening }}&lt;/ref&gt;  UK Country music is overseen by the [[British Country Music Association]].

The most successful British country music act of the 21st century are [[Ward Thomas (band)|Ward Thomas]] and [[The Shires (duo)|the Shires]]. In 2015, the Shires' album ''[[Brave (The Shires album)|Brave]]'', became the first UK country act ever to chart in the Top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart]] and they became the first UK country act to receive an award from the American [[Country Music Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/the-shires-become-first-uk-country-act-to-reach-albums-chart-top-10/061094|title=The Shires become first UK country act to reach Albums Chart Top 10|last=Stassen|first=Murray|date=9 March 2015|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Ward Thomas (band)|Ward Thomas]] then became the first UK country act to hit number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] with their album [[Cartwheels (Ward Thomas album)|''Cartwheels'']].

There is the [[C2C: Country to Country]] festival held every year, and for many years there was a festival at [[Wembley Arena]], which was broadcast on the [[BBC]], the International Festivals of Country Music, promoted by [[Mervyn Conn]], held at the venue between 1969 and 1991. The shows were later taken into Europe, and featured such stars as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Tammy Wynette]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Boxcar Willie]], [[Johnny Russell (singer)|Johnny Russell]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. A handful of country musicians had even greater success in mainstream UK music than they did in the US, despite a certain amount of disdain from the music press. The UK's largest music festival [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] has featured major US country acts in recent years, such as [[Kenny Rogers]] in 2013 and Dolly Parton in 2014.

From within the UK, few country musicians achieved widespread mainstream success. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The [[Bee Gees]] had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists (&quot;[[Rest Your Love on Me]]&quot;) and a major hit as songwriters (&quot;[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]&quot;); [[Barry Gibb]], the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/news/bee-gees-barry-gibb-country-music-always-inspired-us |title=The Bee Gees' Barry Gibb: &quot;Country Music Always Inspired Us&quot; |date=November 4, 2013 |publisher=Country Weekly |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085038/http://www.countryweekly.com/news/bee-gees-barry-gibb-country-music-always-inspired-us |archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with &quot;[[After the Lovin']],&quot; achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his faithful covers of Nashville country ballads such as &quot;[[Release Me (1949 song)|Release Me]],&quot; &quot;[[Am I That Easy to Forget]]&quot; and &quot;[[There Goes My Everything (song)|There Goes My Everything]].&quot; The songwriting tandem of [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]] and [[Roger Greenaway]] wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. Welsh singer [[Bonnie Tyler]] initially started her career making country albums and was even nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] before her huge crossover hit &quot;[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]&quot; lead her towards more commercial pop and rock. In 2013, Tyler returned to her roots, blending the country elements of her early work with the rock of her successful material on her album ''[[Rocks and Honey]]'' which featured a duet with American country icon [[Vince Gill]]. Tyler subsequently announced that she was making a new country rock album in Nashville with [[John Carter Cash]], son of country music legends [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter Cash]], slated for release in 2018.

===Other international country music===
Tom Roland, from the [[Country Music Association]] International, explains country music's global popularity: &quot;In this respect, at least, Country Music listeners around the globe have something in common with those in the United States. In Germany, for instance, Rohrbach identifies three general groups that gravitate to the genre: people intrigued with the American cowboy icon, middle-aged fans who seek an alternative to harder rock music and younger listeners drawn to the pop-influenced sound that underscores many current Country hits.&quot;&lt;ref name=int/&gt; One of the first Americans to perform country music abroad was [[George Hamilton IV]]. He was the first country musician to perform in the [[Soviet Union]]; he also toured in Australia and the Middle East. He was deemed the &quot;International Ambassador of Country Music&quot; for his contributions to the [[globalization]] of country music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/spotlight/hamilton_loudermilk.html Lib.unc.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111222/http://www.lib.unc.edu/spotlight/hamilton_loudermilk.html |date=July 29, 2013 }} &quot;Country Music Figures Donate Papers, Give Concert&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, Keith Urban, and Dwight Yoakam have also made numerous international tours.&lt;ref name=&quot;int&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmaworld.com/international/default.asp CMAworld.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923182808/http://www.cmaworld.com/international/default.asp |date=September 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Country Music Association]] undertakes various initiatives to promote country music internationally.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

====Latin America====
[[Regional Mexican]] is [[Mexico|Mexico's]] version of country music. It includes a number of different subgenres, depending on where they originated, and in what regions they are popular. One specific song style, the [[Ranchera]], found its origins in the Mexican countryside and was first popularized with [[Mariachi]]. It has since also become popular with [[Banda music|Banda]], [[Norteño (music)|Norteño]], [[Duranguense]] and other regional Mexican styles. The [[Corrido]], a different song style with a similar history, is also performed in many different regional styles. Other song styles performed in regional Mexican music include [[Sentimental ballad|Ballad]]s, [[Cumbia]]s, [[Boleros]], among others. American-style country music is also popular in Mexico, but most prominently in the northern regions of the country, where a number of bands and solo artists perform the genre while singing in Spanish. It is known as Country en Español (Country in Spanish), and originated in the 1980s. It most resembles [[Neotraditional country]]. Famous bands include the likes of Wild West, Caballo Dorado (Golden Horse), and 8 Segundos (8 Seconds). [[Tejano music|Tejano]] (also known as &quot;Tex-Mex&quot; in English) is popular in Spanish-speaking areas of the United States, particularly in and near [[Texas]] (especially [[South Texas]]), and in northeastern areas of Mexico.
 
In [[Brazil]], there is [[Música sertaneja|Música Sertaneja]], a popular genre very similar to American country music, sharing its rich history of development in the countryside.

====Europe====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}
In [[Ireland]], [[TG4]] began a quest for Ireland's next country star called ''[[Glór Tíre]]'', translated as &quot;Country Voice&quot;. It is now in its sixth season and is one of TG4's most watched TV shows. Over the past ten years country and gospel recording artist [[James Kilbane]] has reached multi-platinum success with his mix of [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] and traditional country influenced albums. James Kilbane like many other Irish artists are today working closer with Nashville. A recent success in the Irish arena has been [[Crystal Swing]]. In [[Sweden]], [[Rednex]] rose to stardom combining country music with [[synthpop|electro-pop]] in the 1990s. In 1994, the group had a worldwide hit with their version of the traditional Southern tune &quot;[[Cotton-Eyed Joe]]&quot;. Artists popularizing more traditional country music in Sweden have been [[Ann-Louise Hanson]], [[Hasse Andersson]], [[Kikki Danielsson]], [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] and [[Jill Johnson]]. In [[Poland]] an international country music festival, known as [[Piknik Country]], has been organized in [[Mrągowo]] in [[Masuria]] since 1983. There are more and more country music artists in France. Some of the most important are [[Liane Edwards]], {{ill|Annabel (singer)|lt=Annabel|fr|Annabel|vertical-align=sup}}, Rockie Mountains, Tahiana, and Lili West. French [[rock and roll]] superstar [[Eddy Mitchell]] is also very inspired by [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and country music. In the [[Netherlands]] there are many artists producing popular country and Americana music, which is mostly in the English language, as well as Dutch country and country-like music in Dutch language. The latter is mainly popular on the countrysides in the northern and eastern parts of the Netherlands and is less associated with his American brother, although it sounds sometimes very similar. Well known popular artists mainly performing in English are [[Waylon (singer)|Waylon]], [[Danny Vera]], [[Ilse DeLange]], [[Douwe Bob]] and the band [[Savannah (band)|Savannah]]. The most popular artist in Dutch is [[Henk Wijngaard]].

==Performers and shows==
{{Main|List of country music performers|List of country performers by era|List of country television and radio shows}}

===US cable television===
Several U.S. TV networks are at least partly devoted to the genre: [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|Country Music Television]] and [[CMT Music]] (both owned by [[ViacomCBS]]), [[RFD-TV]] and [[The Cowboy Channel]] (owned by Patrick Gottsch), [[Great American Country]] (owned by [[Discovery, Inc.]]), [[Heartland (TV network)|Heartland]] (owned by [[Reach High Media Group]]), and [[The Country Network]] (owned by TCN Country, LLC). An upcoming channel named Circle, a joint venture between [[Gray Television]] and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', will launch in 2020.

The first American country music video cable channel was [[The Nashville Network]], launched in the early 1980s as a channel devoted to southern culture. In 2000, after it and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, the channel was stripped of its country format and rebranded as ''The National Network'', then ''Spike'', and finally [[Paramount Network]]. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after Jim Owens Entertainment (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts [[Crook &amp; Chase]]) acquired the trademark and licensed it to Luken Communications; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.

===Canadian television===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}
Only one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: [[CMT (Canada)|CMT]] owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, [[Canadian content|Cancom]]-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day [[Cottage Life (TV channel)|Cottage Life]] network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold. [[Stingray Music]] continues to maintain several country music audio-only channels on [[cable radio]].

In the past, country music had an extensive presence, especially on the Canadian national broadcaster, [[CBC Television]]. The show ''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' significantly affected country music in Canada; for instance, it was the program that launched [[Anne Murray]]'s career. [[Gordie Tapp]]'s ''[[Country Hoedown]]'' and its successor, ''[[The Tommy Hunter Show]]'', ran for a combined 36 years on the CBC, from 1956 to 1992; in its last nine years on air, the U.S. cable network TNN carried Hunter's show.

===Australian cable television===
The only network dedicated to country music in Australia is the [[Country Music Channel]] owned by [[Foxtel]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===UK digital television===
One music channel is currently dedicated to country music in the United Kingdom: [[Spotlight TV]], owned by Canis Media.
