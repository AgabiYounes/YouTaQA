{{Short description|Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth}}
{{Christianity|expanded=all}}
'''Christianity''' is an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]] based on the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life]] and teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. Its adherents, known as [[Christians]], believe that Jesus is the [[Christ (title)|Christ]], whose coming as the [[Messiah#Christianity|messiah]] was [[Old Testament messianic prophecies quoted in the New Testament|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], called the [[Old Testament]] in Christianity, and chronicled in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Christianity: A Very Short Introduction|last= Woodhead|first= Linda |year= 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |location= Oxford|pages= n.p}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[Major religious groups|world's largest religion]] with about 2.4 billion followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/05/christians-remain-worlds-largest-religious-group-but-they-are-declining-in-europe/|title=World's largest religion by population is still Christianity|website=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of Christianity|Christianity began]] as a [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple Judaic]] sect [[Christianity in the 1st century|in the 1st century]] in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. Jesus' [[apostles]] and their followers [[Early centers of Christianity|spread]] around [[Syria (region)|Syria]], the [[Levant]], [[Europe]], [[Anatolia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Transcaucasia]], [[Egypt]], and [[Ethiopia]], despite [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|initial persecution]]. It soon attracted [[gentile]] [[God-fearer]]s, which led to a departure from [[Judaism|Jewish customs]], and, after the [[Fall of Jerusalem, AD 70]] which ended the [[Second Temple|Temple]]-based Judaism, Christianity slowly [[Jewish Christian#Split of early Christianity and Judaism|separated from Judaism]]. Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), later convening the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the [[State church of the Roman Empire]] (380). Constantine converted to Christianity before his death (337). The early history of Christianity's united church before major [[List of schisms in Christianity|schisms]] is sometimes referred to as the &quot;[[Great Church]]&quot;. The [[Church of the East]] split after the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] split after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) over differences in [[Christology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-vhwjamOioC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=anagignoskomena#v=onepage&amp;q=anagignoskomena |title=Orthodox and Wesleyan Scriptural understanding and practice | editor=S.

Similarly, [[Protestantism]] split in numerous denominations from the [[Latin Catholic]] Church in the [[Reformation]] era (16th century) over [[Christian theology|theological]] and [[ecclesiological]] disputes, most predominantly [[Sola fide|on the issue of justification]] and the [[papal primacy|primacy of the bishop of Rome]]. Following the [[Age of Discovery]] (15th–17th century), Christianity was spread into the [[Americas]], [[Oceania]], [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and the rest of the world via [[Christian mission|missionary work]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Spread&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=g2AtOlJMPTUC&amp;pg=PA52|title =Muslim-Christian Relations|publisher = Amsterdam University Press|quote=The enthusiasm for evangelization among the Christians was also accompanied by the awareness that the most immediate problem to solve was how to serve the huge number of new [[Conversion to Christianity|converts]].

Christianity remains culturally diverse in its [[Western Christianity|Western]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern branches]], as well as in its doctrines concerning [[Justification (theology)|justification and the nature of salvation]], ecclesiology, [[ordination]], and [[Christology]]. The four largest [[Christian denomination|branches of Christianity]] are the Catholic Church (1.3 billion/50.1%), Protestantism (920 million/36.7%), the Eastern Orthodox Church (260 million) and Oriental Orthodoxy (86 million/both together 11.9%), amid various efforts toward unity ([[ecumenism]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45877584|title=Orthodox Church split: Five reasons why it matters|last=Peter|first=Laurence|date=17 October 2018|accessdate=17 October 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[creed]]s generally hold in common Jesus as the [[Son of God]]—the [[logos (Christianity)|logos]] [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnated]]—who [[Ministry of Jesus|ministered]], [[passion of Jesus|suffered]], and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|died on a cross]], but [[Resurrection of Jesus|rose from the dead]] for the [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] of mankind; as referred to as [[the gospel]], meaning the &quot;good news&quot;, in the [[Bible]] ([[scripture]]).

==Etymology==
Early Jewish Christians referred to themselves as 'The Way' ({{lang|grc|της οδου}}), probably coming from [[Isaiah 40:3]], &quot;prepare the way of the Lord.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurtado.the_way&quot;&gt;Larry Hurtado (17 August 2017 ), [https://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/paul-the-pagans-apostle/ ''&quot;Paul, the Pagans’ Apostle&quot;'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|It appears in the Acts of the Apostles, {{bibleverse|Acts|9:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|Acts|19:9|KJV}} and {{bibleverse|Acts|19:23|KJV}}). Some [[English translations of the bible|English translations of the New Testament]] capitalize 'the Way' (e.g. the [[New King James Version]] and the [[English Standard Version]]), indicating that this was how 'the new religion seemed then to be designated'&lt;ref&gt;[[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary]] on Acts 19, http://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb//acts/19.htm accessed 8 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others treat the phrase as indicative—'the way',&lt;ref&gt;Jubilee Bible 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 'that way'&lt;ref&gt;[[American King James Version]]&lt;/ref&gt; or 'the way of the Lord'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douai-Rheims Bible]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version reads, &quot;the way of God&quot; and the [[Vulgate|Vulgate Latin]] version, &quot;the way of the Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, J., ''Gill's Exposition of the Bible'', commentary on Acts 19:23 http://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/19.htm accessed 8 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;}} According to [[Acts 11:26]], the term &quot;Christian&quot; ({{Lang-el|Χριστιανός}}) was first used in reference to Jesus's [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in the city of [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], meaning &quot;followers of Christ,&quot; by the non-Jewish inhabitants of Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;E. Peterson (1959), &quot;Christianus.&quot; In: ''Frühkirche, Judentum und Gnosis'', publisher: Herder, Freiburg, pp. 353–72&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term &quot;Christianity&quot; ({{Lang-el|Χριστιανισμός|links=no}}) was by [[Ignatius of Antioch]], in around 100&amp;nbsp;AD.{{Sfn|Elwell|Comfort|2001|pp=266, 828}}

==Beliefs==
While Christians worldwide share basic convictions, there are also differences of interpretations and opinions of the [[Bible]] and [[sacred tradition]]s on which Christianity is based.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olsen&quot;&gt;Olson, ''The Mosaic of Christian Belief''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creeds===

{{Main|Creed#Christian creeds|List of Christian creeds}}
{{Wikisource|Apostles' Creed}}
{{Wikisource|Nicene Creed}}

Concise doctrinal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as [[creeds]]. They began as baptismal formulae and were later expanded during the [[Christology|Christological]] controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith.

The [[Apostles' Creed]] is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of Christian faith. It is used by a number of [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechesis|catechetical]] purposes, most visibly by liturgical churches of [[Western Christian]] tradition, including the [[Latin Church]] of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Western Rite Orthodoxy]]. It is also used by [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. This particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries. Its central doctrines are those of the Trinity and God the Creator. Each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic period]]. The creed was apparently used as a summary of Christian doctrine for baptismal candidates in the churches of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Pelikan/Hotchkiss, ''Creeds and Confessions of Faith in the Christian Tradition''.&lt;/ref&gt; Its points include:
* Belief in [[God the Father]], [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[Son of God]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]
* The [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]], [[Harrowing of Hell|descent into hell]], [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus|ascension]] of Christ
* The holiness of the [[Ecclesia (church)|Church]] and the [[communion of saints]]
* Christ's [[second coming]], the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] of the faithful

The Nicene Creed was formulated, largely in response to [[Arianism]], at the Councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 325 and 381 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cuf.org/2005/02/we-believe-in-one-god-the-nicene-creed-at-mass/ |title=&quot;We Believe in One God....&quot;: The Nicene Creed and Mass |date=February 2005 |website= |publisher=Catholics United for the Fath |url-access=registration  |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Religion'', &quot;Arianism&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and ratified as the universal creed of [[Christendom]] by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.&lt;ref name=&quot;ephesus&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05491a.htm &quot;Council of Ephesus&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Athanasian Creed]], received in the Western Church as having the same status as the Nicene and Chalcedonian, says: &quot;We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons nor dividing the [[Consubstantiality|Substance]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02033b.htm Athanasian Creed]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Protestant]] alike) accept the use of creeds, and subscribe to at least one of the creeds mentioned above.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1806 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114032325/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1806 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 January 2006 |title=Our Common Heritage as Christians |publisher=The United Methodist Church |accessdate=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Evangelical Protestants]] reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creeds. Most [[Baptists]] do not use creeds &quot;in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another.&quot;&lt;ref name=Avis&gt;Avis, Paul (2002) ''The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions'', SPCK, London, {{ISBN|0-281-05246-8}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Also rejecting creeds are groups with roots in the [[Restoration Movement]], such as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]], and the [[Churches of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Howard A.

{{Main|Jesus|Jesus in Christianity|Christ (title)}}
{{See also|Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus in comparative mythology}}
The central tenet of Christianity is the belief in [[Jesus]] as the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]] and the [[Messiah]] ([[Christ]]). Christians believe that Jesus, as the Messiah, was [[anointing|anointed]] by God as savior of humanity and hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfillment of [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecies]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Christian concept of messiah differs significantly from [[Messiah in Judaism|the contemporary Jewish concept]]. The core Christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|the death and resurrection of Jesus]], [[original sin|sinful]] humans can be reconciled to God, and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of [[Immortality|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'', pp. 513, 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been many [[Christian theology|theological]] disputes over the [[Christology|nature of Jesus]] over the earliest centuries of Christian history, generally, Christians believe that Jesus is [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God incarnate]] and &quot;[[Hypostatic union|true God and true man]]&quot; (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become [[Incarnation (Christianity)|fully human]], suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, but did not [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. As fully God, he rose to life again. According to the [[New Testament]], he [[Resurrection of Jesus|rose]] from the dead,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|2:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|2:31–32}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:15}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|3:26}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|4:10}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|5:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|10:40–41}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:34}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|13:37}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|17:30–31}}, {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:9}}, {{bibleref2|1Cor|15:15 || 1 Cor. 15:15}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Cor|6:14}}, {{bibleref2|2Cor|4:14 || 2 Cor. 4:14}}, {{Bibleref2|Gal|1:1}}, {{Bibleref2|Eph|1:20}}, {{Bibleref2|Col|2:12}}, {{bibleref2|1Thess|1:10 || 1 Thess. 11:10}}, {{Bibleref2|Heb.|13:20}}, {{bibleref2|1Pet|1:3 || 1 Pet. 1:3}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Pet|1:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended]] to heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father,&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Nicene Creed]]&lt;/ref&gt; and will ultimately [[Second Coming|return]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|1:9–11}} to fulfill the rest of the [[Messianic prophecy]], including the [[resurrection of the dead]], the [[Last Judgment]], and the final establishment of the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]].

According to the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Jesus was [[Incarnation (Christianity)|conceived]] by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] and [[Nativity of Jesus|born]] from [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]. Little of Jesus' childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels, although [[New Testament apocrypha|infancy gospels]] were popular in antiquity. In comparison, his adulthood, especially the week before his death, is well documented in the gospels contained within the [[New Testament]], because that part of his life is believed to be most important. The biblical accounts of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]] include: [[Baptism of Jesus|his baptism]], [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]], preaching, teaching, and deeds.

Christians consider the resurrection of Jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith (see [[1 Corinthians 15]]) and the most important event in history.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff. ''Resurrection: The Capstone in the Arch of Christianity''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Christian beliefs, the death and resurrection of Jesus are two core events on which much of Christian doctrine and theology is based.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACU-Death &amp; Resurrection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm |title=The Significance of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus for the Christian |publisher=Australian Catholic University National |accessdate=16 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901153606/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/research/theology/Walsh.htm |archivedate=1 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Testament, Jesus was [[Crucifixion|crucified]], died a physical death, was buried within a tomb, and rose from the dead three days later.{{bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30–31}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|16:1}} {{bibleref2c-nb|Mark|16:6}}

The New Testament mentions several [[resurrection appearances of Jesus]] on different occasions to his [[twelve apostles]] and [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]], including &quot;more than five hundred brethren at once&quot;,{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:6}} before Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]] to heaven. Jesus' death and resurrection are commemorated by Christians in all worship services, with special emphasis during [[Holy Week]], which includes [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter|Easter Sunday]].

The death and resurrection of Jesus are usually considered the most important events in [[Christian theology]], partly because they demonstrate that Jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2 || John|3:16}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|5:24}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:39–40}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:47}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|10:10}}, {{bibleref2-nb|John|11:25–26}}, and {{bibleref2-nb|John|17:3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian churches accept and teach the [[New Testament]] account of the resurrection of Jesus with very few exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;This is drawn from a number of sources, especially the early Creeds, the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', certain theological works, and various Confessions drafted during the Reformation including the ''Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England'', works contained in the ''Book of Concord''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern scholars use the belief of Jesus' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the [[historical Jesus]] and the proclamation of the [[early church]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, ''The Foundations of New Testament Christology'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]] do not accept a literal bodily resurrection,&lt;ref&gt;A [[Jesus Seminar]] conclusion held that &quot;in the view of the Seminar, he did not rise bodily from the dead; the resurrection is based instead on [[vision hypothesis|visionary experiences]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and [[Mary Magdalene|Mary]].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Funk. ''The Acts of Jesus: What Did Jesus Really Do?''.&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritually nourishing [[mythology|myth]]. Arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious [[debate]]s and [[interfaith|interfaith dialogues]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzen. ''Resurrection, Discipleship, Justice: Affirming the Resurrection Jesus Christ Today'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], an early Christian convert and missionary, wrote, &quot;If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your trust in God is useless.&quot;{{bibleref2c|1Cor|15:14}}&lt;ref&gt;Ball/Johnsson (ed.).

===Salvation===

Modern Christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be [[eternal salvation|saved]] from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both Jews and Gentiles can be in God's family. According to [[Eastern Orthodox]] theology, based upon their understanding of the atonement as put forward by Irenaeus' [[Recapitulation (Irenaeus)|recapitulation theory]], Jesus' death is a [[Ransom theory of atonement|ransom]]. This restores the relation with God, who is loving and reaches out to humanity, and offers the possibility of ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' c.q. [[Divinization (Christian)|divinization]], becoming the kind of humans God wants humanity to be. According to Catholic doctrine, Jesus' death [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfies]] the wrath of God, aroused by the offense to God's honor caused by human's sinfulness. The Catholic Church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithfulness on the part of Christians; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and ordinarily must be baptized.&lt;ref&gt;CCC 846; Vatican II, Lumen Gentium 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See quotations from Council of Trent on Justification at [http://www.justforcatholics.org/a14.htm Justforcatholics.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In Protestant theology, Jesus' death is regarded as a [[Penal substitution|substitionary penalty]] carried by Jesus, for the debt that has to be paid by humankind when it broke God's moral law. [[Martin Luther]] taught that baptism was necessary for salvation, but modern Lutherans and other Protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by [[Divine grace|God's grace]], sometimes defined as &quot;unmerited favor&quot;, even apart from baptism.

Christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals' salvation is pre-ordained by God. Reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are [[total depravity|completely incapable of self-redemption]], but that [[irresistible grace|sanctifying grace is irresistible]].&lt;ref&gt;Westminster Confession, [http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 Chapter X] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528062341/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/wcf.htm#chap10 |date=28 May 2014 }};&lt;br /&gt;Spurgeon, ''[http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm A Defense of Calvinism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410133140/http://www.spurgeon.org/calvinis.htm |date=10 April 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestants believe that the exercise of [[free will]] is necessary to have faith in Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Grace and Justification|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815001751/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm|archivedate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinity===
{{Main|Trinity}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Trinity]] is the belief that [[God in Christianity|God]] is one God in three persons: the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]] ([[Jesus]]), and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]&lt;ref name=&quot;def-lateran&quot;&gt;Definition of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT §253].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Trinity'' refers to the teaching that the one God&lt;ref name=&quot;Monotheism&quot;&gt;Christianity's status as monotheistic is affirmed in, among other sources, the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (article &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Monotheism]&quot;); [[William F.

Together, these three persons are sometimes called the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander. ''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology''. pp. 514ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGrath.

''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 782.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the [[Athanasian Creed]], an early statement of Christian belief, &quot;the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and yet there are not three Gods but one God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''The Athanasian Creed''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinct from another: the Father has no source, the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father. Though distinct, the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation. While some Christians also believe that God appeared as the Father in the [[Old Testament]], it is agreed that he appeared as the Son in the [[New Testament]], and will still continue to manifest as the Holy Spirit in the present. But still, God still existed as three persons in each of these times.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, &quot;Encyclopedia of Christianity, pg1207&lt;/ref&gt; However, traditionally there is a belief that it was the Son who appeared in the Old Testament because, for example, when the [[Trinity#Art|Trinity is depicted in art]], the Son typically has the distinctive appearance, a [[cruciform halo]] identifying Christ, and in depictions of the [[Garden of Eden]], this looks forward to an Incarnation yet to occur. In some [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] [[sarcophagi]] the Logos is distinguished with a beard, &quot;which allows him to appear ancient, even pre-existent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heidi J. Hornik and Mikeal Carl Parsons, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BmWpMKaDBVUC&amp;pg=PA34 Interpreting Christian Art: Reflections on Christian art]'', Mercer University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-86554-850-1}}, pp. 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trinity]] is an essential doctrine of mainstream Christianity. From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed (325) Christianity advocated&lt;ref&gt;''Examples of ante-Nicene statements'':{{quote|Hence all the power of magic became dissolved; and every bond of wickedness was destroyed, men's ignorance was taken away, and the old kingdom abolished God Himself appearing in the form of a man, for the renewal of eternal life.|St. Ignatius of Antioch in ''Letter to the Ephesians'', ch.4, shorter version, Roberts-Donaldson translation}}{{quote|We have also as a Physician the Lord our God Jesus the Christ the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began, but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin.

&lt;/ref&gt; the triune [[Holy Mystery|mystery]]-nature of [[God in Christianity|God]] as a normative profession of faith. According to [[Roger E.

According to this doctrine, God is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole; rather, each person is considered to be fully God (see [[Perichoresis]]). The distinction lies in their relations, the Father being unbegotten; the Son being begotten of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and (in [[Western Christian]] theology) [[Filioque|from the Son]]. Regardless of this apparent difference, the three &quot;persons&quot; are each [[eternity|eternal]] and [[omnipotent]]. Other Christian religions including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[Mormonism]], do not share those views on the Trinity.

====Trinitarians====
{{Main|Trinitarianism}}
''Trinitarianism'' denotes Christians who believe in the concept of the [[Trinity]]. Almost all Christian denominations and churches hold Trinitarian beliefs. Although the words &quot;Trinity&quot; and &quot;Triune&quot; do not appear in the Bible, theologians, beginning in the 3rd century, developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the New Testament teachings of God as being Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Since that time, Christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that Trinity does not imply that there are three gods (the antitrinitarian heresy of [[Tritheism]]), nor that each hypostasis of the Trinity is one-third of an infinite God (partialism), nor that the Son and the Holy Spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the Father ([[Arianism]]). Rather, the Trinity is defined as one God in three persons.&lt;ref&gt;Moltman, Jurgen. ''The Trinity and the Kingdom: The Doctrine of God.'' Tr. from German. Fortress Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8006-2825-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nontrinitarianism====
{{Main|Nontrinitarianism}}
''Nontrinitarianism'' (or ''antitrinitarianism'') refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the Trinity. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[adoptionism]] or [[modalism]], existed in early Christianity, leading to the disputes about [[Christology]].&lt;ref&gt;Harnack, ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/dogma1.ii.iii.iii.html History of Dogma]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Nontrinitarianism later appeared again in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] between the 11th and 13th centuries, among groups with [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theology in the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;''Pocket Dictionary of Church History'' Nathan P. Feldmeth p. 135 &quot;Unitarianism. Unitarians emerged from Protestant Christian beginnings in the sixteenth century with a central focus on the unity of God and subsequent denial of the doctrine of the Trinity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century.

===Eschatology===
{{Main|Christian eschatology}}
[[File:Kohrvirab.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The 7th-century [[Khor Virap]] monastery in the shadow of [[Mount Ararat]]; [[Armenia]] was the first state to adopt Christianity as the state religion, in AD 301&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia&quot;/&gt;]]
The end of things, whether the end of an individual life, the end of the age, or the end of the world, broadly speaking, is Christian eschatology; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the Bible. The major issues in Christian eschatology are the [[Great Tribulation|Tribulation]], death and the afterlife, (mainly for [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelical]] groups) [[Millennialism|the Millennium]] and the following [[Rapture]], the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, [[Resurrection of the Dead]], Heaven, (for [[Christian liturgy|liturgical]] branches) [[Purgatory]], and Hell, the [[Last Judgment]], the end of the world, and the [[New Heavens and New Earth]].

Christians believe that the second coming of Christ will occur at the [[eschatology|end of time]], after a period of severe persecution (the Great Tribulation). All who have died will be [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrected bodily from the dead]] for the Last Judgment. Jesus will fully establish the [[Kingdom of God]] in fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|scriptural prophecies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;res&quot;&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm ''Summa Theologicum, Supplementum Tertiae Partis''] questions 69 through 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Calvin | first =John | title =Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Three, Ch. 25 | website = | publisher =reformed.org | url =http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book3/bk3ch25.html | accessdate =1 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death and afterlife====
Most Christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or [[hell|eternal damnation]]. This includes the [[Last Judgment|general judgement]] at the [[resurrection of the dead]] as well as the belief (held by Catholics,&lt;ref name=&quot;CEParticularJudgement&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08550a.htm Particular Judgment]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ott&quot;&gt;Ott, ''Grundriß der Dogmatik'', p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox&lt;ref&gt;David Moser, ''[http://www.orthodox.net/articles/about-prayer-for-the-dead.html What the Orthodox believe concerning prayer for the dead]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Collins, ''[http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm What Happens to Me When I Die?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928055816/http://www.kencollins.com/question-45.htm |date=28 September 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; and most Protestants) in a [[particular judgment|judgment particular to the individual soul]] upon physical death.

In the liturgical branches (e.g. Catholicism or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] or [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodoxy]]), those who die in a state of grace, i.e., without any mortal sin separating them from God, but are still imperfectly purified from the effects of sin, undergo purification through the intermediate state of [[purgatory]] to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into God's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_04081999_en.html |title=Audience of 4 August 1999 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=4 August 1999 |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have attained this goal are called ''saints'' (Latin ''sanctus'', &quot;holy&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04171a.htm The Communion of Saints]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, hold to [[Christian mortalism|mortalism]], the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal, and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection. These Christians also hold to [[Annihilationism]], the belief that subsequent to the final judgement, the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer everlasting torment. Jehovah's Witnesses hold to a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The death that Adam brought into the world is spiritual as well as physical, and only those who gain entrance into the Kingdom of God will exist eternally. However, this division will not occur until Armageddon, when all people will be resurrected and given a chance to gain eternal life. In the meantime, &quot;the dead are conscious of nothing.&quot; What is God's Purpose for the Earth?&quot; Official Site of Jehovah's Witnesses. ''Watchtower'', 15 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
{{Main|Christian worship|Church service}}
{{See also|Mass (liturgy)|Reformed worship|Contemporary worship}}
[[File:Thebible33.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Samples of [[Catholic]] religious objects – the [[Bible]], a [[crucifix]] and a [[rosary]]]]

Depending on the specific [[Christian denomination|denomination of Christianity]], practices may include [[baptism]], [[Eucharist]] (Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper), prayer (including the [[Lord's Prayer]]), [[Confession (religion)|confession]], [[confirmation]], burial rites, marriage rites and the religious education of children. Most denominations have ordained clergy and hold regular group worship services.

===Communal worship===
[[Justin Martyr]] described 2nd-century Christian [[liturgy]] in his ''[[First Apology]]'' (c. 150) to Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], and his description remains relevant to the basic structure of Christian liturgical worship:
{{quote|And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the [[Presbyter|president]] verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying [[Amen]]; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need.&lt;ref name=&quot;justin&quot;&gt;Justin Martyr, [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/justinmartyr-firstapology.html ''First Apology''] §LXVII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, as Justin described, Christians assemble for communal worship on Sunday, the day of the resurrection, though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting. Scripture readings are drawn from the Old and New Testaments, but especially the gospel accounts. Often these are arranged on an [[annual cycle]], using a book called a [[lectionary]]. Instruction is given based on these readings, called a [[sermon]], or homily. There are a variety of congregational [[prayer]]s, including thanksgiving, confession, and intercession, which occur throughout the [[Church service|service]] and take a variety of forms including recited, responsive, silent, or sung. The [[Lord's Prayer]], or Our Father, is regularly prayed.

[[File:Worship-team.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A modern Protestant worship band leading a contemporary worship session]]
Some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure. A division is often made between &quot;[[High church|High]]&quot; church services, characterized by greater solemnity and ritual, and &quot;[[Low church|Low]]&quot; services, but even within these two categories, there is great diversity in forms of [[Christian worship|worship]]. [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] meet on Saturday, while others do not meet on a weekly basis. [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] or [[Pentecostal]] congregations may spontaneously feel led by the Holy Spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service, including spontaneous prayer. [[Society of Friends|Quakers]] sit quietly until moved by the Holy Spirit to speak.

Some [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] services resemble concerts with [[Christian rock|rock and pop music]], dancing and use of multimedia. For groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers, the services are generally led by a [[minister of religion|minister]], [[preacher]], or [[pastor]]. Still others may lack any formal leaders, either in principle or by local necessity. Some churches use only [[a cappella]] music, either on principle (for example, many [[Churches of Christ]] object to the use of instruments in worship) or by tradition (as in Orthodoxy).

Nearly all forms of [[churchmanship]] celebrate the [[Eucharist]] (Holy Communion), which consists of a consecrated meal. It is reenacted in accordance with Jesus' instruction at the Last Supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples [[Sacramental bread|bread]], saying, &quot;This is my body&quot;, and gave them [[sacramental wine|wine]] saying, &quot;This is my blood&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ignazio Silone, ''Bread and Wine'' (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Christian denominations]] practice [[closed communion]]. They offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church. Catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of [[mortal sin]]. Most other churches practice [[open communion]] since they view communion as a means to unity, rather than an end, and invite all believing Christians to participate.

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

{{quote box|title=2nd-century description of the [[Eucharist]]
|quote=And this food is called among us ''Eukharistia'' [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Savior, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that confers [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both which rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament, vary among Christian denominations and traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot;&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. pp. 1435ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot; /&gt;

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1435&quot; /&gt; [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

In addition to this, the [[Church of the East]] has two additional sacraments in place of the traditional sacraments of Matrimony and the Anointing of the Sick. These include [[Holy Leaven]] (Melka) and the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon&quot;&gt;''Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East, Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical calendar===
{{Main|Liturgical year}}
{{See also|Calendar of saints}}
Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Christians, and traditional Protestant communities frame worship around the [[liturgical year]]. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of [[season]]s, each with their theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colors of [[parament]]s and [[vestment]]s for clergy,&lt;ref name=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fortescue|first1=Adrian|title=Christian Calendar|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03158a.htm|website=The Catholic Encyclopedia.|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=18 July 2014|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home.

Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,&lt;ref name=&quot;calendar&quot; /&gt; and Eastern Christians use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]]. Calendars set aside holy days, such as [[Solemnity|solemnities]] which commemorate an event in the life of Jesus, Mary, or the [[saint]]s, and periods of [[fasting]], such as [[Lent]] and other pious events such as [[memoria]], or lesser festivals commemorating saints. Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of Christ's birth, resurrection, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively. A few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman. ''Handbook of the Christian Year''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
{{Main|Christian symbolism}}
[[File:Nideggen-St.Johannes Baptist249.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The [[Christian cross|cross]] and the fish are two common symbols of [[Jesus Christ]]; letters of the Greek word ΙΧΘΥΣ [[Ichthys]] (fish) form an acronym for &quot;Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior&quot;]]
Christianity has not generally practiced [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconism]], the avoidance or prohibition of devotional images, even if early [[Jewish Christian]]s and some modern [[Christian denomination|denominations]], invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of [[idolatry]], avoided figures in their symbols.

The [[Christian cross|cross]], today one of the most widely recognized symbols, was used by Christians from the earliest times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm |title=ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth; Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second &amp;#124; Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minucius Felix speaks of the cross of Jesus in its familiar form, likening it to objects with a crossbeam or to a man with arms outstretched in prayer ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter XXIX).&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian, in his book ''De Corona'', tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace the sign of the cross on their foreheads.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign.&quot; (Tertullian, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cross was known to the early Christians, the [[crucifix]] did not appear in use until the 5th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;&gt;Dilasser. ''The Symbols of the Church''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest Christian symbols, that of the fish or [[Ichthys]] seems to have ranked first in importance, as seen on monumental sources such as tombs from the first decades of the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=&quot;cefish&quot;&gt;''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083a.htm Symbolism of the Fish]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity seemingly arose from the Greek word ''ichthys'' (fish) forming an [[acronym]] for the Greek phrase ''Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter'' (Ἰησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ),{{refn|group=note|''Iesous Christos Theou '''H'''yios Soter'' would be a more complete transliteration; in Greek though, the daseia or [[spiritus asper]] was not—commonly—marked in the [[majuscule]] script of the time.}} (Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior), a concise summary of Christian faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;cefish&quot; /&gt;

Other major Christian symbols include the [[Chi-Rho|chi-rho monogram]], the [[dove]] (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (representing Christ's sacrifice), the [[vine]] (symbolizing the connection of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from passages of the New Testament.&lt;ref name=&quot;soc&quot;/&gt;

===Baptism===
{{Main|Baptism}}
[[File:El bautismo de Jesús, por José Ferraz de Almeida Júnior.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The baptism of Jesus depicted by [[José Ferraz de Almeida Júnior|Almeida Júnior]] (1895)]]
Baptism is the ritual act, with the use of water, by which a person is admitted to membership of the [[Christian Church|Church]]. Beliefs on baptism vary among denominations. Differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance. Some, such as the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, as well as Lutherans and Anglicans, hold to the doctrine of [[baptismal regeneration]], which affirms that baptism creates or strengthens a person's faith, and is intimately linked to salvation. Others view baptism as a purely symbolic act, an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person, but not as spiritually efficacious. Secondly, there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act. These methods are: by [[Immersion baptism|''immersion'']]; if immersion is total, by ''submersion''; by [[affusion]] (pouring); and by [[aspersion]] (sprinkling). Those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of [[infant baptism]];&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission&quot; ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1213] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722003736/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3G.HTM |date=22 July 2016 }}); &quot;Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ's Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God&quot; ([http://anglicansonline.org/basics/catechism.html#Holy Book of Common Prayer, 1979, Episcopal );] &quot;Baptism is the sacrament of initiation and incorporation into the body of Christ&quot; ([http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf By Water and The Spirit – The Official United Methodist Understanding of Baptism (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313053601/http://www.backriverumc.com/userFiles/1257/by_water_and_the_spirit.pdf |date=13 March 2016 }};&lt;br /&gt;&quot;As an initiatory rite into membership of the Family of God, baptismal candidates are symbolically purified or washed as their sins have been forgiven and washed away&quot; ([[William H. Brackney]], [http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm Doing Baptism Baptist Style{{snd}} Believer's Baptism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107183031/http://www.baptisthistory.org/pamphlets/baptism.htm |date=7 January 2010 }})&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Orthodox Church]]es all practice infant baptism and always baptize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;After the proclamation of faith, the baptismal water is prayed over and blessed as the sign of the goodness of God's creation. The person to be baptized is also prayed over and blessed with sanctified oil as the sign that his creation by God is holy and good. And then, after the solemn proclamation of &quot;Alleluia&quot; (God be praised), the person is immersed three times in the water in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit&quot; ([http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&amp;ID=51 Orthodox Church in America: Baptism).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the Orthodox Church we totally immerse, because such total immersion symbolizes death. What death? The death of the &quot;old, sinful man&quot;. After Baptism we are freed from the dominion of sin, even though after Baptism we retain an inclination and tendency toward evil.&quot;, Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, article &quot;[http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/faq/faqbaptism Baptism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930002357/http://www.greekorthodox.org.au/general/faq/faqbaptism |date=30 September 2014 }}&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church also practices infant baptism,&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm#403 403], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm 1231, 1233, 1250, 1252].&lt;/ref&gt; usually by affusion, and utilizing the [[Trinitarian formula]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a1.htm#1240 1240].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prayer===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity}}
Jesus' teaching on prayer in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer. A concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as &quot;pagan&quot;, and instead a simple trust in God's fatherly goodness is encouraged.{{bibleref2c|Mat.|6:5–15}} Elsewhere in the New Testament, this same freedom of access to God is also emphasized.{{bibleref2c|Phil.|4:6}}{{bibleref2c|Jam.|5:13–19}} This confident position should be understood in light of Christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and Christ through the indweling of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBDprayer&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Alexander, T.D. |editor2=Rosner, B.S |year=2001 |title =Prayer |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Biblical Theology|publisher=Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent Christian traditions, certain physical gestures are emphasized, including medieval gestures such as [[genuflection]] or making the [[sign of the cross]]. [[Kneeling]], bowing, and [[prostration]]s (see also [[poklon]]) are often practiced in more traditional branches of Christianity. Frequently in Western Christianity, the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal [[commendation ceremony]]. At other times the older [[orans]] posture may be used, with palms up and elbows in.

''Intercessory prayer'' is prayer offered for the benefit of other people. There are many intercessory prayers recorded in the Bible, including prayers of the [[Apostle Peter]] on behalf of sick persons{{bibleref2c|Acts|9:40}} and by [[prophet]]s of the Old Testament in favor of other people.{{bibleref2c|1Ki|17:19–22}} In the [[Epistle of James]], no distinction is made between the intercessory prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent Old Testament prophet [[Elijah]].{{bibleref2c|Jam|5:16–18}} The effectiveness of prayer in Christianity derives from the power of God rather than the status of the one praying.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBDprayer&quot;/&gt;

The ancient church, in both [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]], developed a tradition of asking for the [[intercession of saints|intercession of (deceased) saints]], and this remains the practice of most [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and some [[Anglican]] churches. Churches of the Protestant Reformation, however, rejected prayer to the saints, largely on the basis of the sole mediatorship of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1=Ferguson, S.B. |author2=Packer, J.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1988 |title =Saints |encyclopedia= New Dictionary of Theology|publisher=Intervarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, IL }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reformer [[Huldrych Zwingli]] admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the Bible convinced him that this was [[idolatry in Christianity|idolatrous]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Gray, ''The Protestant Reformation'', (Sussex Academic Press, 2003), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]: &quot;Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God or the requesting of good things from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/Catechism/Catechism_013.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church: Part Four – Christian Prayer |publisher=Va |accessdate=19 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Common Prayer]] in the Anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services, containing set prayers, scripture readings, and hymns or sung Psalms.

==Scriptures==
{{Main|Bible|Biblical canon|Development of the Christian biblical canon}}
[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Bible]] is the sacred book in Christianity.]]
Christianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the [[biblical canon]], the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]], as the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in {{bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16||2 Timothy 3:16}} is ''theopneustos'', which literally means &quot;God-breathed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation |edition=2nd |last=Virkler |first=Henry A. |editor-last=Ayayo |editor-first=Karelynne Gerber |year=2007 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=978-0-8010-3138-0 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]]. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the [[King James Version]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]|title=Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909213651/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm|archivedate=9 September 2010}}(§105–108)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Second Helvetic Confession, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120450/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/helvetic/c01.htm ''Of the Holy Scripture Being the True Word of God'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html ''online text'']&lt;/ref&gt; Another closely related view is [[biblical infallibility]] or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography, or science.

The [[books of the Bible]] accepted by the Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant churches vary somewhat, with Jews accepting only the Hebrew Bible as canonical; however, there is substantial overlap. These variations are a reflection of the range of [[tradition]]s, and of the [[Ecumenical council|councils]] that have convened on the subject. Every version of the Old Testament always includes the books of the [[Tanakh]], the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Catholic and Orthodox canons, in addition to the Tanakh, also include the [[deuterocanonical books]] as part of the Old Testament. These books appear in the [[Septuagint]], but are regarded by Protestants to be [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]]. However, they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words, grammar, and syntax used in the historical period of their conception. Some versions of the Bible include a separate Apocrypha section between the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger/Coogan, ''Oxford Companion to the Bible''. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament, originally written in [[Koine Greek]], contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches.

Modern scholarship has raised many issues with the Bible. While the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] is held to by many because of its striking English prose, in fact it was translated from the Erasmus Greek Bible, which in turn &quot;was based on a single 12th Century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrman209-183&quot;&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). ''Misquoting Jesus: the story behind who changed the Bible and why''. San Francisco: Harper {{ISBN|978-0060738174}} pp. 183, 209&lt;/ref&gt; Much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to reconstruct the original text. Another issue is that several books are considered to be forgeries. The injunction that women &quot;be silent and submissive&quot; in 1 Timothy 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:11-12&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Timothy 2:11–12 NIV – A woman should learn in quietness and |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is thought by many to be a forgery by a follower of Paul, a similar phrase in 1 Corinthians 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2014:34-35&amp;version=NIV |title=1 Corinthians 14:34–35 NIV – Women should remain silent in the |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is thought to be by Paul, appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a copyist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrman209-183&quot; /&gt; Other verses in 1 Corinthians, such as 1 Corinthians 11:2–16 where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair &quot;when they pray or prophesies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20corinthians%2011:2-16&amp;version=NIV |title=1 corinthians 11:2–16 NIV – On Covering the Head in Worship – I |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contradict this verse.

A final issue with the Bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the New Testament. [[Gnostic Gospels|Other gospels]] have now been recovered, such as those found near [[Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, and while some of these texts are quite different from what Christians have been used to, it should be understood that some of this newly recovered Gospel material is quite possibly contemporaneous with, or even earlier than, the New Testament Gospels. The core of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], in particular, may date from as early as AD 50 (although some major scholars contest this early dating),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=N.T.|title=The New Testament and the People of God|date=1992|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8006-2681-5|pages=435–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that underlie the canonical Gospels, texts that are mentioned in Luke 1:1–2. The Gospel of Thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical Gospels—verse 113, for example (&quot;The Father's Kingdom is spread out upon the earth, but people do not see it&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html |title=The Gospel of Thomas Collection – Translations and Resources |publisher=Gnosis.org |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is reminiscent of Luke 17:20–21&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV |title=Luke 17:20–21 NIV – The Coming of the Kingdom of God |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmnet.com.au/australian_landscape_photos/writer/Reflections.html |title=Reflections on religions |publisher=Mmnet.com.au |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and the [[Gospel of John]], with a terminology and approach that is suggestive of what was later termed ''Gnosticism'', has recently been seen as a possible response to the Gospel of Thomas, a text that is commonly labeled ''proto-Gnostic''. Scholarship, then, is currently exploring the relationship in the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other, by analyzing new-found texts, by subjecting canonical texts to further scrutiny, and by an examination of the passage of New Testament texts to canonical status.

===Catholic interpretation===
[[File:View of saint Peter basilica from a roof.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]], the largest church in the world and a symbol of the [[Catholic Church]]]]{{Main|Catholic theology of Scripture}}
In antiquity, two schools of exegesis developed in [[Alexandria]] and [[School of Antioch|Antioch]]. The Alexandrian interpretation, exemplified by [[Origen]], tended to read Scripture [[allegory|allegorically]], while the Antiochene interpretation adhered to the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called ''[[theoria]]'') could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly. ''Early Christian Doctrines''. pp. 69–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] theology distinguishes two senses of scripture: the literal and the spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III, ''The Holy Spirit, Interpreter of Scripture'' § 115–118]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325191945/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=25 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''literal'' sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture. The ''spiritual'' sense is further subdivided into:
* The ''allegorical'' sense, which includes [[Typology (theology)|typology]]. An example would be the [[Passage of the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] being understood as a &quot;type&quot; (sign) of baptism.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|10:2}}
* The ''[[moral]]'' sense, which understands the scripture to contain some ethical teaching.
* The ''[[anagoge|anagogical]]'' sense, which applies to [[eschatology]], eternity and the [[Apocalypse|consummation of the world]]

Regarding [[exegesis]], following the rules of sound interpretation, Catholic theology holds:
* The injunction that all other senses of sacred scripture are based on the ''literal''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm &quot;Whether in Holy Scripture a word may have several senses&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906114843/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/100110.htm |date=6 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', [http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III §116] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325191945/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a3.htm#III |date=25 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the historicity of the Gospels must be absolutely and constantly held&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Council]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html ''Dei Verbum'' (V.19)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531175312/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html |date=31 May 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant interpretation===
[[File:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|The [[Luther Bible]] (shown above) was an early translation of the Bible by a Protestant. Another early unauthorized translation was [[Wycliffe's Bible]].]]

====Qualities of Scripture====
Protestant Christians believe that the Bible is a self-sufficient revelation, the final authority on all Christian doctrine, and [[Revelation|revealed all truth]] necessary for salvation. This concept is known as ''[[sola scriptura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC&amp;pg=PA15|title=The Shape of Sola Scriptura |author=Keith A.

Mathison }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants characteristically believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of Scripture because Scripture itself is clear in its meaning (or &quot;perspicuous&quot;). Martin Luther believed that without God's help, Scripture would be &quot;enveloped in darkness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foutz&quot; /&gt; He advocated for &quot;one definite and simple understanding of Scripture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foutz&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Foutz |first=Scott David |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000414063800/http://www.quodlibet.net/luther.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 April 2000 |title=Martin Luther and Scripture |publisher=Quodlibet Journal |accessdate=16 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] wrote, &quot;all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their guide, find in the Scripture a clear light&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom45.vii.iv.iv.html '' Commentaries on the Catholic Epistles'' 2 Peter 3:14–18]&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this is &quot;efficacy&quot;, that Scripture is able to lead people to faith; and &quot;sufficiency&quot;, that the Scriptures contain everything that one needs to know in order to obtain salvation and to live a Christian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Engelder |first=Theodore E.W. |url=https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1 |title=Popular Symbolics: The Doctrines of the Churches of Christendom and of Other Religious Bodies Examined in the Light of Scripture |page=[https://archive.org/details/MN41551ucmf_1/page/n57 28] |location=Saint Louis, MO |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Original intended meaning of Scripture====
Protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture, the [[historical-grammatical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Sproul. ''Knowing Scripture'', pp. 45–61; Bahnsen, ''[http://www.cmfnow.com/articles/pt173.htm A Reformed Confession Regarding Hermeneutics'' (article 6)''].''&lt;/ref&gt; The historical-grammatical method or grammatico-historical method is an effort in [[Biblical hermeneutics]] to find the intended original meaning in the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elwell565&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Baker Book House |isbn=978-0-8010-3413-8 |last=Elwell |first=Walter A. |title=Evangelical Dictionary of Theology |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/evangelicaldicti00elwe/page/565 565] |title-link=Evangelical Dictionary of Theology }}&lt;/ref&gt; This original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre, as well as theological (canonical) considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Academie Books |isbn=978-0-310-34160-4 |last=Johnson |first=Elliott |title=Expository hermeneutics : an introduction |location=Grand Rapids Mich. |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text. The significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said: &quot;A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Zondervan Pub. House |last=Terry |first=Milton |title=Biblical hermeneutics : a treatise on the interpretation of the Old and New Testaments |location=Grand Rapids Mich. |year=1974 |page=205}} (1890 edition page 103, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fy9VAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22fundamental+principle%22 view1], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fy9VAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22neglect+this+principle%22 view2])&lt;/ref&gt; Technically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Taken together, both define the term (Biblical) hermeneutics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elwell565&quot; /&gt;

Some Protestant interpreters make use of [[Typology (theology)|typology]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g., in his [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhcw/matthew/1.htm commentary on Matthew 1] (§III.1). [[Matthew Henry]] interprets the twin sons of Judah, Phares and Zara, as an allegory of the Gentile and [[Jewish Christians]]. For a contemporary treatment, see Glenny, ''[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_typology_glenny.html Typology: A Summary Of The Present Evangelical Discussion]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity developed during the 1st century CE as a [[Jewish Christian]] sect of [[Second Temple Judaism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cory2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Cory|title=Christian Theological Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsZcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|date=13 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34958-7|nopp=y|at=p. 20 and forwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benko1984&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Benko|title=Pagan Rome and the Early Christians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHHxkapsiEgC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34286-7|nopp=y|at=p. 22 and forwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early Jewish Christian community was founded in Jerusalem under the leadership of the [[Pillars of the Church]], namely [[James the Just]], the brother of the Lord, [[Saint Peter]], and John. They had known Jesus, and, according to Paul, the arisen Christ had first appeared to James and Peter.

Jewish Christianity soon attracted Gentile [[God-fearers]], posing a problem for its Jewish religious outlook, which insisted on close observance of the Jewish commands. [[Paul the Apostle]] solved this by insisting that salvation by [[Pistis Christou|faith in Christ]], and [[Participation in Christ|participation]] in His death and resurrection, sufficed. At first he persecuted the early Christians, but after a conversion experience he preached to the [[gentiles]], and is regarded as having had a formative effect on the emerging Christian identity as separate from Judaism. Eventually, his departure from Jewish customs would result in the establishment of Christianity as an independent religion.

====Ante-Nicene period====
{{Main|Ante-Nicene period}}

This formative period was followed by the early [[bishop]]s, whom Christians consider the [[apostolic succession|successors of Christ's apostles]]. From the year 150, Christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and the study of them is called [[patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]].

According to the [[New Testament]], Christians were from the beginning, subject to [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] by some Jewish and Roman religious authorities. This involved punishments, including death, for Christians such as [[Stephen]]{{bibleref2c|Acts|7:59}} and [[James, son of Zebedee]].{{bibleref2c|Acts|12:2}} Further widespread [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|persecution]] of the Church occurred under nine subsequent Roman emperors, most intensely under [[Decius]] and [[Diocletian]].

====Spread and acceptance in Roman Empire ====

{{See also|Edict of Thessalonica}}

Christianity spread to [[Aramaic]]-speaking peoples along the [[Mediterranean coast]] and also to the inland parts of the [[Roman Empire]] and beyond that into the [[Parthian Empire]] and the later [[Sasanian Empire]], including [[Mesopotamia]], which was dominated at different times and to varying extents by these empires.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Whitby, et al. eds.

[[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] was exposed to Christianity in his youth, and throughout his life his support for the religion grew, culminating in baptism on his deathbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Constantinople: Capital of Byzantium |author= Harris, Jonathan |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |edition=  2nd |year=2017 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b-ECDgAAQBAJ |page= 38|isbn= 9781474254670 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his reign, state-sanctioned persecution of Christians was ended with the [[Edict of Serdica|Edict of Toleration]] in 311 and the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313.

Constantine was also instrumental in the convocation of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, which sought to address [[Arianism]] and formulated the [[Nicene Creed]], which is still used by the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Anglican Communion]], and many [[Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC—Our Common Heritage as Christians&quot;/&gt; Nicaea was the first of a series of [[ecumenical council]]s, which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the Church, notably concerning [[Christology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners37&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 37ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of the East]] did not accept the third and following ecumenical councils and is still separate today by its successors ([[Assyrian Church of the East]]).

In terms of prosperity and cultural life, the [[Byzantine Empire]] was one of the peaks in [[Christian history]] and [[Christian civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2006|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Constantinople]] remained the leading city of the [[Christian world]] in size, wealth, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2006|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy]], as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning-1992-190-218&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1992|pp=198–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine art and literature held a preeminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of [[Byzantine art]] on the West during this period was enormous and of long-lasting significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning-1992-218&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Browning|1992|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The later rise of [[Islam]] in North Africa reduced the size and numbers of Christian congregations, leaving in large numbers only the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] in Egypt, the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] in the Horn of Africa and the [[Christianity in Sudan|Nubian Church]] in the Sudan (Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia).

===Early Middle Ages===
With the decline and [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire in the West]], the [[papacy]] became a political player, first visible in [[Pope Leo I|Pope Leo]]'s diplomatic dealings with [[Attila the Hun|Huns]] and [[Vandals]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; The church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes. While [[Arianism|Arianists]] instituted the death penalty for practicing pagans (see the [[Massacre of Verden]], for example), what would later become [[Catholicism]] also spread among the [[Hungarians]], the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 238–242.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Celts|Celtic]], the [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] and some [[Slavic peoples]].

Around 500, [[St. Benedict]] set out his [[Monastic Rule]], establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; [[Monasticism]] became a powerful force throughout Europe,&lt;ref name = &quot;Gonzalez-p238&quot;/&gt; and gave rise to many early centers of learning, most famously in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and [[Gaul]], contributing to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century.

In the 7th century, [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Muslims conquered Syria]] (including [[Jerusalem]]), North Africa, and Spain, converting some of the Christian population to [[Islam]], and placing the rest under a separate [[Dhimmi|legal status]]. Part of the Muslims' success was due to the exhaustion of the Byzantine Empire in its decades long conflict with [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, 2008, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 8th century, with the rise of [[Carolingian]] leaders, the Papacy sought greater political support in the [[Frankish Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, 2008, pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Middle Ages brought about major changes within the church. [[Pope Gregory the Great]] dramatically reformed the [[Ecclesiastical polity|ecclesiastical structure]] and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 244–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 8th century, [[iconoclasm]] became a divisive issue, when it was sponsored by the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] emperors. The [[Second Council of Nicaea|Second Ecumenical Council of Nicaea]] (787) finally pronounced in favor of icons.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 10th century, Western Christian monasticism was further rejuvenated through the leadership of the great Benedictine monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 278–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
[[File:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]], where he preached the [[First Crusade]]]]
In the West, from the 11th century onward, some older cathedral schools became universities (see, for example, [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Paris]] and [[University of Bologna]]). Previously, higher education had been the domain of Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), led by [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s. Evidence of such schools dates back to the 6th century&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Riché, Pierre (1978): &quot;Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century&quot;, Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;126–127, 282–298&lt;/ref&gt; These new universities expanded the curriculum to include academic programs for clerics, lawyers, civil servants, and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Rudy, ''The Universities of Europe, 1100–1914'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.&lt;ref name=verger1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Verger |first=Jacques |date=1999 |authorlink=:fr:Jacques Verger|title=Culture, enseignement et société en Occident aux XIIe et XIIIe siècles |edition=1st |trans-title=|language=French |publisher=Presses universitaires de Rennes in Rennes |isbn=978-2868473448 |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL822497W |accessdate=17 June 2014 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accompanying the rise of the &quot;new towns&quot; throughout Europe, [[mendicant order]]s were founded, bringing the [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|consecrated religious life]] out of the monastery and into the new urban setting. The two principal mendicant movements were the [[Franciscans]]&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 303–307, 310ff., 384–386.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]],&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 305, 310ff., 316ff.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and [[St. Dominic]], respectively. Both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of Europe. Another new order was the [[Cistercians]], whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas. In this period, church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights, culminating in the orders of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] and the building of the great European cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 321–323, 365ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1095 under the pontificate of [[Urban II]], the [[Crusades]] were launched.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 292–300.&lt;/ref&gt; These were a series of military campaigns in the [[Holy Land]] and elsewhere, initiated in response to pleas from the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I]] for aid against [[Turkish people|Turkish]] expansion. The Crusades ultimately failed to stifle Islamic aggression and even contributed to Christian enmity with the sacking of [[Constantinople]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;Riley-Smith. ''The Oxford History of the Crusades''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Church experienced internal conflict between the 7th and 13th centuries that resulted in a [[East-West Schism|schism]] between the so-called Latin or [[Western Christian]] branch (the Catholic Church),&lt;ref&gt;The Western Church was called Latin at the time by the Eastern Christians and non-Christians due to its conducting of its rituals and affairs in the Latin language&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], largely Greek, branch (the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]). The two sides disagreed on a number of administrative, liturgical and doctrinal issues, most notably [[papal primacy|papal primacy of jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orthodox Information Centre-Great Schism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx| title = The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom|publisher = Orthodox Information Centre|accessdate = 26 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SandSp91&quot;&gt;Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274) and the [[Council of Florence]] (1439) attempted to reunite the churches, but in both cases, the Eastern Orthodox refused to implement the decisions, and the two principal churches remain in schism to the present day. However, the Catholic Church has achieved union with various [[Eastern Catholic Churches|smaller eastern churches]].

In the thirteenth century, a new emphasis on Jesus' suffering, exemplified by the Franciscans' preaching, had the consequence of turning worshippers' attention towards Jews, on whom [[Jewish deicide|Christians had placed the blame for Jesus' death]]. Christianity's limited tolerance of Jews was not new—Augustine of Hippo said that Jews should not be allowed to enjoy the citizenship that Christians took for granted—but the growing antipathy towards Jews was a factor that led to [[Edict of Expulsion|the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290]], the first of many such expulsions in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;diarmaid&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=MacCulloch |first=Diarmaid |title=Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years |publisher=Penguin |date=2011 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7x4m20TRYzQC|isbn=9781101189993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telushkin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Telushkin |first=Joseph |title=Jewish Literacy |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewishliteracy00telu/page/192 192–193] |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-688-08506-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/jewishliteracy00telu/page/192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 1184, following the crusade against [[Cathars|Cathar]] heresy,&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 300, 304–305.&lt;/ref&gt; various institutions, broadly referred to as the [[Inquisition]], were established with the aim of suppressing [[heresy]] and securing religious and doctrinal unity within Christianity through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', pp. 310, 383, 385, 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation===

The 15th-century [[Renaissance]] brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning. During the [[Reformation]], [[Martin Luther]] posted the ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' 1517 against the sale of [[indulgences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 39, 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Printed copies soon spread throughout Europe. In 1521 the [[Edict of Worms]] condemned and excommunicated Luther and his followers, resulting in the schism of the [[Western Christianity|Western Christendom]] into several branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon-120-121&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reformers like [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Oecolampadius]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], [[John Knox|Knox]], and [[Jacobus Arminius|Arminius]] further criticized Catholic teaching and worship. These challenges developed into the movement called [[Protestantism]], which repudiated the [[papal primacy|primacy of the pope]], the role of tradition, the [[Catholic sacraments|seven sacraments]], and other doctrines and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon&quot; /&gt; The [[English Reformation|Reformation in England]] began in 1534, when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] had himself [[Act of Supremacy|declared head]] of the [[Church of England]]. Beginning in 1536, the monasteries throughout England, Wales and Ireland were [[Dissolution of the monasteries|dissolved]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schama&quot;&gt;Schama. ''A History of Britain''. pp. 306–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Müntzer]], [[Andreas Karlstadt]] and other theologians perceived both the Catholic Church and the confessions of the [[Magisterial Reformation]] as corrupted. Their activity brought about the [[Radical Reformation]], which gave birth to various [[Anabaptist]] denominations.

Partly in response to the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the [[Counter-Reformation]] or Catholic Reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bokenkotter242&quot;&gt;Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'', pp. 242–244.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Trent]] clarified and reasserted Catholic doctrine. During the following centuries, competition between Catholicism and Protestantism became deeply entangled with political struggles among European states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simon3&quot;&gt;Simon. ''Great Ages of Man: The Reformation''. pp. 109–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 brought about a new wave of missionary activity. Partly from missionary zeal, but under the impetus of [[Colonialism|colonial expansion]] by the European powers, Christianity spread to the Americas, Oceania, East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Throughout Europe, the division caused by the Reformation led to outbreaks of [[religious violence]] and the establishment of separate state churches in Europe. [[Lutheranism]] spread into the northern, central, and eastern parts of present-day Germany, [[Livonia]], and Scandinavia. [[Anglicanism]] was established in England in 1534. [[Calvinism]] and its varieties, such as [[Presbyterianism]], were introduced in Scotland, the Netherlands, Hungary, Switzerland, and France. [[Arminianism]] gained followers in the Netherlands and [[Frisia]]. Ultimately, these differences led to the outbreak of [[religious war|conflicts]] in which religion played a key factor. The [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[English Civil War]], and the [[French Wars of Religion]] are prominent examples. These events intensified the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]].&lt;ref&gt;A general overview about the English discussion is given in Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England 1558–1689''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Enlightenment===

In the era known as the [[Great Divergence]], when in the West, the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[scientific revolution]] brought about great societal changes, Christianity was confronted with various forms of [[skepticism]] and with certain modern [[Ideology|political ideologies]], such as versions of [[socialism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Michael|title=Catholic social thought and liberal institutions: Freedom with justice|year=1988|publisher=Transaction|isbn=978-0-88738-763-0|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pb1GDmxA1UC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events ranged from mere [[anti-clericalism]] to violent outbursts against Christianity, such as the [[dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|dechristianization of France during the French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Chambers, ''The Western Experience'' (vol. 2) chapter 21.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Spanish Civil War]], and certain [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements, especially [[Russian Revolution (1917)|the Russian Revolution]] and the [[persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union]] under [[state atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and the State in Russia and China: Suppression, Survival, and Revival'', by Christopher Marsh, p. 47.

''A Short History of Christianity''; Viking; p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially pressing in Europe was the formation of [[nation states]] after the [[Napoleonic era]]. In all European countries, different Christian denominations found themselves in competition to greater or lesser extents with each other and with the state. Variables were the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious, political, and ideological orientation of the states. Urs Altermatt of the [[University of Fribourg]], looking specifically at Catholicism in Europe, identifies four models for the European nations. In traditionally Catholic-majority countries such as Belgium, Spain, and Austria, to some extent, religious and national communities are more or less identical. Cultural symbiosis and separation are found in Poland, the Republic of Ireland, and Switzerland, all countries with competing denominations. Competition is found in Germany, the Netherlands, and again Switzerland, all countries with minority Catholic populations, which to a greater or lesser extent identified with the nation. Finally, separation between religion (again, specifically Catholicism) and the state is found to a great degree in France and Italy, countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altermatt|first=Urs|title=Religion und Nation: Katholizismen im Europa des 19. und 20. Jahrhundert|year=2007|publisher=[[Kohlhammer Verlag]]|isbn=978-3-17-019977-4|pages=15–34|editor=Urs Altermatt, Franziska Metzger|language=German|chapter=Katholizismus und Nation: Vier Modelle in europäisch-vergleichender Perspektive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined factors of the formation of nation states and [[ultramontanism]], especially in Germany and the Netherlands, but also in England to a much lesser extent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heimann|first=Mary|title=Catholic Devotion in Victorian England|year=1995|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-820597-5|pages=165–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; often forced Catholic churches, organizations, and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the Church, specifically the papacy. This conflict came to a head in the [[First Vatican Council]], and in Germany would lead directly to the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', where liberals and Protestants under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] managed to severely restrict Catholic expression and organization.

Christian commitment in Europe dropped as modernity and secularism came into their own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197 | work=BBC News | title=Religion may become extinct in nine nations, study says | date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Estonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html |title=図録▽世界各国の宗教 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while religious commitments in America have been generally high in comparison to Europe. The late 20th century has shown the shift of Christian adherence to the [[Third World]] and the Southern Hemisphere in general, with the West no longer the chief standard bearer of Christianity. Approximately 7 to 10% of [[Arabs]] are [[Arab Christians and Arabic-speaking Christians|Christians]],&lt;ref name=Pacini&gt;{{cite book |last=Fargues|first=Philippe  |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-19-829388-0 |chapter=A Demographic Perspective |editor1-last=Pacini|editor1-first=Andrea}}&lt;/ref&gt; most prevalent in Egypt, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].

By reason of [[Protestant ecclesiology]], ever since its emergence in the 16th century, Protestantism comprises the widest diversity of groupings and practices. In addition to the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] (or Calvinist) branches of the Reformation, [[Anglicanism]] appeared after the [[English Reformation]]. The [[Anabaptist]] tradition was largely ostracized by the other Protestant parties at the time, but has achieved a measure of affirmation in contemporary history.

The Eastern Orthodox Church consists of those churches in communion with the [[patriarch]]al sees of the East, such as the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC1199&quot;&gt;Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'', p. 1199.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church also traces its heritage to the foundation of Christianity through [[apostolic succession]] and has an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] structure, though the [[autocephaly|autonomy]] of its component parts is emphasized, and most of them are national churches.

A number of conflicts with Western Christianity over questions of doctrine and authority culminated in the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]].

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
{{Main|Oriental Orthodoxy}}
The [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]] (also called &quot;Old Oriental&quot; churches) are those eastern churches that recognize the first three ecumenical councils—[[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]], and [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]]—but reject the dogmatic definitions of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] and instead espouse a [[Miaphysite]] [[christology]].

{{Main|Assyrian Church of the East}}
The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], with an unbroken patriarchate established in the 17th century, is an independent [[Eastern Christian]] denomination which claims continuity from the [[Church of the East]]—in parallel to the Catholic patriarchate established in the 16th century that evolved into the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], an [[Eastern Catholic]] church in [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]]. It is an Eastern Christian [[Christian denomination|church]] that follows the traditional [[christology]] and [[ecclesiology]] of the historical Church of the East. Largely [[Aniconism in Christianity|aniconic]] and not in [[communion (Christianity)|communion]] with any other church, it belongs to the eastern branch of [[Syriac Christianity]], and uses the [[East Syriac Rite]] in its [[liturgy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Baumer|first=Christoph|title=The Church of the East: An Illustrated History of Assyrian Christianity|year=2006|location=London-New York|publisher=Tauris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ7ZAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main spoken language is [[Syriac language|Syriac]], a dialect of [[Eastern Aramaic]], and the majority of its adherents are ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. It is officially headquartered in the city of [[Erbil]] in northern [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], and its original area also spreads into south-eastern Turkey and north-western Iran, corresponding to ancient [[Assyria]]. Its hierarchy is composed of [[metropolitan bishop]]s and [[diocesan bishop]]s, while lower clergy consists of [[priest]]s and [[deacon]]s, who serve in dioceses (eparchies) and parishes throughout the Middle East, India, North America, Oceania, and Europe (including the [[Caucasus]] and Russia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Hunter|first=Erica C.D.|chapter=The Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East|editor-last=Leustean|editor-first=Lucian N.|title=Eastern Christianity and Politics in the Twenty-First Century|date=2014|location=London &amp; New York|publisher=Routledge|pages=601–620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zt2vAwAAQBAJ|isbn=9781317818663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Church of the East]] distinguished itself from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] in 1964. It is one of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] churches that claim continuity with the historical [[Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]]—the Church of the East, one of the oldest Christian churches in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.us/default.aspx?ID=1&amp;pagetypeID=9&amp;sitecode=HQ&amp;pageno=1 |title=CNEWA: Ronald G.

===Protestantism===
{{Main|Protestantism}}
{{Protestantism}}
In 1521, the [[Edict of Worms]] condemned [[Martin Luther]] and officially banned citizens of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from defending or propagating his ideas.&lt;ref name=ENC3&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin, and Bromiley, Geoffrey William, ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 2003. p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; This split within the Roman Catholic church is now called the [[Reformation]]. Prominent Reformers included Martin Luther, [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and [[John Calvin]]. The 1529 [[Protestation at Speyer]] against being excommunicated gave this party the name [[Protestantism]]. Luther's primary theological heirs are known as [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. Zwingli and Calvin's heirs are far broader denominationally, and are referred to as the [[Reformed|Reformed tradition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners251&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. pp. 251–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglican churches descended from the [[Church of England]] and organized in the [[Anglican Communion]]. Some, but not all Anglicans consider themselves both Protestant and Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes/Booty/Knight. ''The Study of Anglicanism'', p. 219. Some Anglicans consider their church a [[Branch theory|branch of the &quot;One Holy Catholic Church&quot;]] alongside of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, a concept rejected by the Catholic Church, some Eastern Orthodox, and many [[evangelical Anglican]]s themselves, for more on this, see Gregory Hallam, ''[http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/ecumenical/hallam_orthodoxy_ecumenism.htm Orthodoxy and Ecumenism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Mathewes-Green, &quot;[http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html Whither the Branch Theory?]&quot;, ''Anglican Orthodox Pilgrim'' Vol. 2, No. 4. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519104645/http://www.westernorthodox.com/branch.html |date=19 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Anglican, Lutheran, and the Reformed branches of Protestantism originated for the most part in cooperation with the government, these movements are termed the  &quot;[[Magisterial Reformation]]&quot;. On the other hand, groups such as the [[Anabaptists]], who often do not consider themselves to be Protestant, originated in the [[Radical Reformation]], which though sometimes protected under ''Acts of Toleration'', do not trace their history back to any state church. They are further distinguished by their rejection of infant baptism; they believe in baptism only of adult believers—[[credobaptism]] (Anabaptists include the [[Amish]], [[Apostolic Christian Church|Apostolic]], [[Mennonites]], [[Hutterites]] and [[Schwarzenau Brethren]]/[[German Baptist]] groups.)&lt;ref name=&quot;BenedettoDuke2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benedetto|first1=Robert|last2=Duke|first2=James O.|title=The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History|year=2008|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=9780664224165|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Littell2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Littell|first=Franklin H.|title=The Anabaptist View of the Church|year=2000|publisher=The Baptist Standard Bearer, Inc.|language=English|isbn=978-1579788360|page=79|quote=In reviewing the records, the reader is struck with the Anabaptists' acute consciousness of separation from the &quot;fallen&quot; church—in which they included the Reformers as well as the Roman institution. Some writers have therefore concluded that Anabaptism is not merely a variant form of Protestantism, but rather an ideology and practice quite different in kind from those of both Rome and the Reformers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mennoniteusa.org/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are: A Quick Visual Guide|year=2018|publisher=Mennonite Church US|language=English|accessdate=26 April 2018|quote=Anabaptists: We are neither Catholic nor Protestant, but we share ties to those streams of Christianity. We cooperate as a sign of our unity in Christ and in ways that extend the reign of God's Kingdom on earth.

The term ''Protestant'' also refers to any churches which formed later, with either the Magisterial or Radical traditions.

Estimates of the total number of Protestants are very uncertain, but it seems clear that Protestantism is the second largest major group of Christians after Catholicism in number of followers, although the Eastern Orthodox Church is larger than any single Protestant denomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adherents&quot; /&gt; Often that number is put at more than 800 million, corresponding to nearly 40% of world's Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewforum1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |title=Pewforum: Christianity (2010)  |accessdate=14 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805020311/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2011/12/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |archive-date=5 August 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Protestants are members of just a handful of denominational families, i.e. [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism|Reformed (Calvinists)]],&lt;ref&gt;This branch was first called Calvinism by Lutherans who opposed it, and many within the tradition would prefer to use the word ''Reformed''.

This resurgence may in part be explained by the phenomenal growth of Pentecostalism and the emergence of the charismatic movement, which are closely associated with evangelicalism. However, there can be no doubt that the evangelical tradition &quot;per se&quot; has become one of the major components of world Christianity. Evangelicals also constitute sizable minorities in the traditional Protestant and Anglican churches. In regions like Africa and Latin America, the boundaries between &quot;evangelical&quot; and &quot;mainline&quot; are rapidly changing and giving way to new ecclesial realities.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups of individuals who hold basic Protestant tenets identify themselves simply as &quot;Christians&quot; or &quot;[[born-again]] Christians&quot;. They typically distance themselves from the [[confessionalism (religion)|confessionalism]] and [[creed]]alism of other Christian communities&lt;ref&gt;Confessionalism is a term employed by historians to refer to &quot;the creation of fixed identities and systems of beliefs for separate churches which had previously been more fluid in their self-understanding, and which had not begun by seeking separate identities for themselves—they had wanted to be truly Catholic and reformed.&quot; (MacCulloch, ''The Reformation: A History'', p. xxiv.)&lt;/ref&gt; by calling themselves &quot;[[Non-denominational Christianity|non-denominational]]&quot; or &quot;[[evangelical]]&quot;.

The [[Second Great Awakening]], a period of religious revival that occurred in the United States during the early 1800s, saw the development of a number of unrelated churches. They generally saw themselves as [[Restorationism|restoring]] the original church of Jesus Christ rather than reforming one of the existing churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 91ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A common belief held by Restorationists was that the other divisions of Christianity had introduced doctrinal defects into Christianity, which was known as the [[Great Apostasy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Religious Tolerance—Restorationism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.religioustolerance.org/chrrest.htm| title = The Restorationist Movements|publisher = Religious Tolerance|accessdate = 31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] is a known restorationist religion that was established during the early 1900s.

Some of the churches originating during this period are historically connected to early 19th-century camp meetings in the Midwest and upstate New York. One of the largest churches produced from the movement is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|work=mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Millennialism]] and [[Adventism]], which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, influenced the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] movement and, as a reaction specifically to [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].

Other groups originating in this time period include the [[Christadelphians]] and the previously mentioned [[Latter Day Saints movement]]. While the churches originating in the Second Great Awakening have some superficial similarities, their doctrine and practices vary significantly.

Various smaller [[Independent Catholic]] communities, such as the [[Old Catholic Church]], include the word ''[[Catholic (term)|Catholic]]'' in their title, and arguably have more or less liturgical practices in common with the [[Catholic Church]], but are no longer in [[full communion]] with the [[Holy See]].

[[Spiritual Christians]], such as the [[Doukhobor]] and [[Molokan]], broke from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and maintain close association with Mennonites and [[Quakers]] due to similar religious practices; all of these groups are furthermore collectively considered to be [[peace churches]] due to their belief in [[Christian pacifism|pacifism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fahlbusch2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin|title=The Encyclodedia of Christianity|date=2008|publisher=Wm.

[[Messianic Judaism]] (or the Messianic Movement) is the name of a Christian movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. The movement originated in the 1960s and 1970s, and it blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Christianity. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of &quot;Yeshua&quot; (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs.&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p208&gt;{{Cite book

C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd (1968). {{ISBN|0-903983-05-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term for the decline of Christianity, particularly in [[Christianity in Europe|Europe]], [[Religion in Canada|Canada]], [[Christianity in Australia|Australia]], and to a minor degree the [[Southern Cone]], in the 20th and 21st centuries, considered in terms of [[postmodernism]]. It refers to the loss of Christianity's monopoly on [[values]] and [[world view]] in historically Christian societies.

[[Cultural Christian]]s are secular people with a Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the [[Christian pop culture|popular culture]], art, [[Christian music|music]], and so on related to it. Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds.

==Ecumenism==
{{Main|Ecumenism}}
[[File:Taizé prayer.JPG|thumb|left|Ecumenical worship service at the [[monastery]] of [[Taizé]] in France]]
Christian groups and denominations have long expressed ideals of being reconciled, and in the 20th century, Christian [[ecumenism]] advanced in two ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners581&quot;&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', pp. 581–584.&lt;/ref&gt; One way was greater cooperation between groups, such as the [[World Evangelical Alliance]] founded in 1846 in London or the [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]] of Protestants in 1910, the Justice, Peace and Creation Commission of the [[World Council of Churches]] founded in 1948 by Protestant and Orthodox churches, and similar national councils like the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]], which includes Catholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;McManners581&quot;/&gt;

The other way was an institutional union with [[United and uniting churches|united churches]], a practice that can be traced back to unions between Lutherans and Calvinists in early 19th-century Germany. Congregationalist, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches united in 1925 to form the [[United Church of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. pp. 413ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977 to form the [[Uniting Church in Australia]]. The [[Church of South India]] was formed in 1947 by the union of Anglican, Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, and Presbyterian churches.&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecumenical, [[monasticism|monastic]] [[Taizé Community]] is notable for being composed of more than one hundred [[monk|brothers]] from Protestant and Catholic traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;taize&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to Christian thought|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-860024-4|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hast|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hast/page/694 694]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community emphasizes the reconciliation of all denominations and its main church, located in [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire]], France, is named the &quot;Church of Reconciliation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;taize&quot; /&gt; The community is internationally known, attracting over 100,000 young [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, &quot;Encyclopedia of Christianity, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steps towards reconciliation on a global level were taken in 1965 by the Catholic and Orthodox churches, mutually revoking the excommunications that marked their [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; the Anglican Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) working towards full communion between those churches since 1970;&lt;ref&gt;McManners, ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity'', p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran]] and Catholic churches signing the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] in 1999 to address conflicts at the root of the Protestant Reformation.

===Criticism===
Criticism of Christianity and Christians goes back to the [[Apostolic Age]], with the New Testament recording friction between the followers of Jesus and the [[Pharisees]] and [[scribes]] (e.g. {{Bibleref||Matthew|15:1–20|NIV}} and {{Bibleref||Mark|7:1–23|NIV}}).&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 {{ISBN|0-8028-3782-4}} p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2nd century, Christianity was criticized by the Jews on various grounds, e.g. that the prophecies of the Hebrew Bible could not have been fulfilled by Jesus, given that he did not have a successful life.&lt;ref&gt;''Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135'' by James D.G. Dunn 1999 {{ISBN|0-8028-4498-7}} pp.&amp;nbsp;112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a sacrifice to remove sins in advance, for everyone or as a human being, did not fit to the Jewish sacrifice ritual; furthermore, [[God in Judaism|God]] is said to judge people on their deeds instead of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Asher Norman ''Twenty-six Reasons why Jews Don't Believe in Jesus'' Feldheim Publishers 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-977-19370-7}} p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith Akers ''The Lost Religion of Jesus: Simple Living and Nonviolence in Early Christianity''. Lantern Books 2000 {{ISBN|978-1-930-05126-3}} p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]], who wrote ''[[The True Word]]'', a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Everett|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|date=1993|publisher=William B.

By the 3rd century, criticism of Christianity had mounted, partly as a defense against it. Wild rumors about Christians were widely circulated, claiming that they were [[atheism|atheists]] and that, as part of their rituals, they devoured human infants and engaged in incestuous orgies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Everett|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|date=1993|publisher=William B.

By the 12th century, the [[Mishneh Torah]] (i.e., [[Rabbi]] [[Moses Maimonides]]) was criticizing Christianity on the grounds of idol worship, in that Christians attributed divinity to Jesus, who had a physical body.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' by Edward Kessler, Neil Wenborn 2005 {{ISBN|0-521-82692-6}} p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[Nietzsche]] began to write a series of polemics on the &quot;unnatural&quot; teachings of Christianity (e.g. sexual abstinence), and continued his criticism of Christianity to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche'' by Bernd Magnus, Kathleen Marie Higgins 1996 {{ISBN|0-521-36767-0}} pp.&amp;nbsp;90–93&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] expressed his criticism of Christianity in ''[[Why I Am Not a Christian]]'', formulating his rejection of Christianity in the setting of logical arguments.&lt;ref&gt;''Russell on Religion: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'' by Bertrand Russell, Stefan Andersson and Louis Greenspan 1999 {{ISBN|0-415-18091-0}} pp.&amp;nbsp;77–87&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of Christianity continues to date, e.g. [[Jewish]] and [[Muslim]] theologians criticize the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] held by most Christians, stating that this doctrine in effect assumes that there are three gods, running against the basic tenet of [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity: An Introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 {{ISBN|1-4051-0899-1}} pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar [[Robert M. Price]] has outlined the possibility that some Bible stories are based partly on myth in ''The Christ Myth Theory and its problems''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot; The Christ Myth Theory and its Problems &quot;, published 2011 by American Atheist press, Cranford, NJ, {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologetics===
Christian apologetics aims to present a [[reason|rational]] basis for Christianity. The word &quot;apologetic&quot; (Greek: ἀπολογητικός ''apologētikos'') comes from the Greek verb ἀπολογέομαι ''apologeomai'', meaning &quot;(I) speak in defense of&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)pologhtiko/s|ἀπολογητικός}}, {{LSJ|a)pologe/omai|ἀπολογέομαι|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with Paul the Apostle. The philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] presented five arguments for God's existence in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', while his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' was a major apologetic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-89870-933-9|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Readings in Christian Apologetics|year=1983|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-0-310-45641-4|editor=L Russ Bush|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous apologist, [[G. K. Chesterton]], wrote in the early twentieth century about the benefits of religion and, specifically, Christianity. Famous for his use of paradox, Chesterton explained that while Christianity had the most mysteries, it was the most practical religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chesterton.org/why-i-believe-in-christianity/|title=Why I Believe in Christianity – Society of Gilbert Keith Chesterton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hauser, Chris (History major, Dartmouth College class of 2014)|date=Fall 2011|title=Faith and Paradox: G.K.

John Lennox, a mathematician at the University of Oxford, tells us that 'even if the non-believers don't like it, the Big Bang fits in exactly with the Christian narrative of creation'. ... William Lane Craig is another who claims that the Biblical account is corroborated by Big Bang cosmology. Lane Craig also claims that there is a prior ''proof'' that there is a God who created this universe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
