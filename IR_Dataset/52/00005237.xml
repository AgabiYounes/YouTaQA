'''Catatonia''' is a state of psycho-motor immobility and behavioral abnormality manifested by [[stupor]]. It was first described in 1874 by [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum]] as {{lang-de|Die Katatonie oder das Spannungsirresein|label=none}} (Catatonia or Tension Insanity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entwicklung-der-psychiatrie.de/seiten/24.1_kahlbaum_die_katatonie.htm|title=Zur Entwicklung der Psychiatrie - ein Internet-Atlas von Dr. Hans-Peter Haack|language=de|access-date=2017-06-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209213229/http://www.entwicklung-der-psychiatrie.de/seiten/24.1_kahlbaum_die_katatonie.htm|archive-date=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though catatonia has historically been related to schizophrenia (catatonic schizophrenia), it is now known that catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may be observed in other mental disorders and neurological conditions. In the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), catatonia is not recognized as a separate disorder, but is associated with psychiatric conditions such as [[schizophrenia]] (catatonic type), [[bipolar disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[narcolepsy]], [[drug abuse]] or [[overdose]] (or both). It may also be seen in many medical disorders including infections (such as [[encephalitis]]), [[autoimmune disorder]]s, focal neurological lesions (including [[stroke]]s), alcohol withdrawal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Geoffroy-2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Geoffroy PA, Rolland B, Cottencin O | title = Catatonia and alcohol withdrawal: a complex and underestimated syndrome. | journal = Alcohol Alcohol. | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 288–90 |date=May–June 2012 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agr170 | pmid = 22278315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; abrupt or overly rapid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|benzodiazepine withdrawal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosebush PI |author2=Mazurek MF. |date=August 1996 | title = Catatonia after benzodiazepine withdrawal | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 315–9 | pmid = 8835707 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199608000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deuschle M, Lederbogen F |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal-induced catatonia |journal=Pharmacopsychiatry |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11229621 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15188|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanemoto K, Miyamoto T, Abe R |title=Ictal catatonia as a manifestation of de novo absence status epilepticus following benzodiazepine withdrawal |journal=Seizure |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=364–6 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10512781 |doi=10.1053/seiz.1999.0309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cerebrovascular disease]], [[neoplasm]]s, [[head injury]],&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-5-introduction&quot; /&gt; and some metabolic conditions: [[homocystinuria]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and [[hypercalcaemia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-5-introduction&quot;/&gt;

It can be an adverse reaction to prescribed medication. It bears similarity to conditions such as [[encephalitis lethargica]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. There are a variety of treatments available; [[benzodiazepine]]s are a first-line treatment strategy. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] is also sometimes used. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of [[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s for benzodiazepine-resistant catatonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniels-2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniels | first1 = J. | title = Catatonia: clinical aspects and neurobiological correlates. | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 371–80 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.4.371 | pmid = 19996245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antipsychotics are sometimes employed but require caution as they can worsen symptoms and have serious adverse effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Catatonia can be stuporous or excited. Stuporous catatonia is characterised by immobility during which people may hold rigid poses ([[stupor]]), an inability to speak ([[mutism]]), or [[waxy flexibility]], in which they maintain positions after being placed in them by someone else. [[Mutism]] may be partial and they may repeat meaningless phrases or speak only to repeat what someone else says. People with stuporous catatonia may also show stereotyped, repetitive movements ([[stereotypy]]). Excited catatonia is characterised by bizarre, non-goal directed hyperactivity and impulsiveness.

Catatonia is a syndrome that can occur in various psychiatric disorders, including [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[brief psychotic disorder]], and substance-induced psychotic disorder. It appears as the Kahlbaum syndrome (motionless catatonia), malignant catatonia (neuroleptic malignant syndrome, [[Serotonin syndrome|toxic serotonin syndrome]]), and excited forms (delirious mania, catatonic excitement, [[oneirophrenia]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot;&gt;Fink M, Taylor MA: CATATONIA: A Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment, Cambridge U Press, 2003&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been recognized as grafted on to [[autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Dhossche D et al.: Catatonia in Autism Spectrum Disorders, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
According to the [[DSM-5]], &quot;Catatonia Associated with Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)&quot; (code 293.89 [F06.1]) is diagnosed if the clinical picture is dominated by at least three of the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-5-introduction&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last= American Psychiatric Association| year= 2013| title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth| publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing| location=Arlington, VA| pages=119–121| isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[stupor]] (i.e., no psycho-motor activity; not actively relating to environment)
* [[catalepsy]] (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against gravity)
* [[waxy flexibility]] (i.e., allow positioning by examiner and maintain position)
* [[mutism]] (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response [exclude if known [[aphasia]]])
* [[Catatonic stupor|negativism]] (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or external stimuli)
* [[Abnormal posturing|posturing]] (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity)
* mannerisms (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions)
* [[stereotypy]] (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements)
* agitation, not influenced by external stimuli
* grimacing (i.e., making a [[Facial expression|grimace]] like children)
* [[echolalia]] (i.e., mimicking another's speech)
* [[echopraxia]] (i.e., mimicking another's movements)

Other disorders (additional code 293.89 [F06.1] to indicate the presence of the [[Comorbidity|co-morbid]] catatonia):
* Catatonia associated with [[autism spectrum disorder]]
* Catatonia associated with [[schizophrenia]] spectrum and other psychotic disorders
** Catatonia associated with [[brief psychotic disorder]]
** Catatonia associated with [[schizophreniform disorder]]
** Catatonia associated with [[schizoaffective disorder]]
** Catatonia associated with substance-induced psychotic disorder
* Catatonia associated with [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and related disorders
* Catatonia associated with [[major depressive disorder]]
* Catatonic disorder due to another medical condition

If catatonic [[symptom]]s are present but they do not form the catatonic [[syndrome]], a medication- or substance-induced aetiology should first be considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-5Differential&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael B. First |title=DSM-5® Handbook of Differential Diagnosis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haOvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 |date=2013 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |isbn=978-1-58562-998-5 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtypes===
* '''[[Stupor]]''' is a motionless, [[apathy|apathetic]] state in which one is oblivious or does not react to external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. [[motor skill|Motor activity]] is nearly non-existent. Individuals in this state make little or no eye contact with others and may be mute and rigid. One might remain in one position for a long period of time, and then go directly to another position immediately after the first position.
* '''Catatonic excitement''' is a state of constant purposeless [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] and excitation. Individuals in this state are extremely hyperactive, although, as aforementioned, the activity seems to lack purpose. The individual may also experience delusions or hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema. Abnormal psychology. (6th ed., p. 224)&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly cited as one of the most dangerous mental states in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maric |first=J.|title=Clinical Psychiatry |publisher=Nolit, Belgrade|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Malignant catatonia''' is an acute onset of excitement, fever, autonomic instability, delirium and may be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, David. &quot;Oxford hand book of psychiatry&quot; Oxford press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rating scale===
Fink and Taylor developed a catatonia rating scale to identify the syndrome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt; A diagnosis is verified by a [[benzodiazepine]] or [[barbiturate]] test. The diagnosis is validated by the quick response to either benzodiazepines or [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). While proven useful in the past, barbiturates are no longer commonly used in [[psychiatry]]; thus the option of either benzodiazepines or ECT.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment is aimed at providing symptomatic relief. [[Benzodiazepine]]s are the first line of treatment, and high doses are often required. A test dose of intramuscular [[lorazepam]] will often result in marked improvement within half an hour. In France, [[zolpidem]] has also been used in diagnosis, and response may occur within the same time period. Ultimately the underlying cause needs to be treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt;

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is an effective treatment for catatonia, however, it has been pointed out that further high quality [[randomized controlled trial]]s are needed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance, and protocols of ECT in catatonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leroy|first=Arnaud|last2=Naudet|first2=Florian|last3=Vaiva|first3=Guillaume|last4=Francis|first4=Andrew|last5=Thomas|first5=Pierre|last6=Amad|first6=Ali|date=2017-06-21|title=Is electroconvulsive therapy an evidence-based treatment for catatonia? A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|language=en|volume=268|issue=7|pages=675–687|doi=10.1007/s00406-017-0819-5|pmid=28639007|issn=0940-1334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antipsychotic]]s should be used with care as they can worsen catatonia and are the cause of [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], a dangerous condition that can mimic catatonia and requires immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink &amp; Taylor&quot; /&gt;

Excessive [[glutamate]] activity is believed to be involved in catatonia; when first-line treatment options fail, [[NMDA antagonists]] such as [[amantadine]] or [[memantine]] are used. Amantadine may have an increased incidence of tolerance with prolonged use and can cause psychosis, due to its additional effects on the dopamine system. Memantine has a more targeted pharmacological profile for the glutamate system, reduced incidence of psychosis and may therefore be preferred for individuals who cannot tolerate amantadine. [[Topiramate]] is another treatment option for resistant catatonia; it produces its therapeutic effects by producing glutamate antagonism via modulation of AMPA receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carroll-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = BT. | last2 = Goforth | first2 = HW. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = C. | last4 = Ahuja | first4 = N. | last5 = McDaniel | first5 = WW. | last6 = Kraus | first6 = MF. | last7 = Spiegel | first7 = DR. | last8 = Franco | first8 = KN. | last9 = Pozuelo | first9 = L. | last10 = Munoz | first10 = C. | title = Review of adjunctive glutamate antagonist therapy in the treatment of catatonic syndromes | url = http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/406 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213183638/http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/19/4/406 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2007-12-13 | journal = J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.19.4.406 | pmid = 18070843 | display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
