[[File:Las Vegas Strip at sunset.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The [[Las Vegas Strip]] is renowned for its high concentration of casino resort hotels]]
A '''casino''' is a facility for certain types of [[gambling]]. Casinos are often built near or combined with hotels, resorts, restaurants, retail shopping, cruise ships, and other tourist attractions. Some casinos are also known for hosting live entertainment, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sports.

==Etymology and usage==
''Casino'' is of [[Italian language|Italian origin]]; the root ''casa'' means a house. The term casino may mean a small country [[villa]], [[Summerhouse (building)|summerhouse]], or [[social club]].&lt;ref name=casitalian&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=William N.|title=Gambling in America: An Encyclopedia of History, Issues, and Society|date=2015|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QAI9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=casino+word+italian+casa+villa#v=onepage&amp;q=casino%20word%20italian%20casa%20villa&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781610699808}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the term ''casino'' came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities took place; such edifices were usually built on the grounds of a larger Italian villa or [[palazzo]], and were used to host civic town functions, including dancing, gambling, music listening, and sports. Examples in Italy include [[Villa Farnese]] and [[Villa Giulia]], and in the US the [[Newport Casino]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. In modern-day Italian a ''casino'' is a brothel (also called ''casa chiusa'', literally &quot;closed house&quot;), a [[mess]], or a noisy environment; a gaming house is spelt ''casinò'', with an accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|Casino }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=casitalian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preble, Rossi|first1=Keith, Francesco|title=Il vero italiano: Your Guide To Speaking &quot;Real&quot; Italian|date=2014|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IDU3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=casino+word+italian+noisy#v=onepage&amp;q=casino%20word%20italian%20noisy&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all casinos are used for gaming. The [[Catalina Casino]], overlooking Avalon Harbor on [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], has never been used for traditional games of chance, which were already outlawed in California by the time it was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalonball.com/casino.asp |title=Avalon Casino Ballroom |publisher=Avalonball.com |accessdate=2009-06-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701101606/http://avalonball.com/casino.asp |archivedate=2009-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Copenhagen Casino was a theatre, known for the mass public meetings often held in its hall during the [[1848 Revolution]], which made Denmark a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Until 1937, it was a well-known Danish theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/samling/dra/dra-specialkataloger.html|title=Special catalogues in the Drama Collection |accessdate=2007-07-09 |work=The Royal Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hanko Casino in [[Hanko, Finland]]—one of that town's most conspicuous landmarks—was never used for gambling. Rather, it was a banquet hall for the [[Russian nobility]] which frequented this spa resort in the late 19th century and is now used as a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingshipadventures.com/DisplayPages/ItineraryPopUp.cfm?ItineraryID=2135 |title=Itinerary Details |website=sailingshipadventures.com |accessdate=August 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123080936/http://www.sailingshipadventures.com/DisplayPages/ItineraryPopUp.cfm?ItineraryID=2135 |archivedate=November 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In military and non-military usage in German and Spanish, a ''casino'' or ''kasino'' is an officers' [[mess]].

==History of gambling houses==
[[File:&quot;Orient Saloon at Bisbee, Arizona... Faro game in full blast. Recognized, Left to right-Tony Downs (standing with derby) - NARA - 530986.tif|200px|thumb|Gambling at the Orient Saloon in [[Bisbee, Arizona]], {{circa}}1900. Photograph by [[C.S. Fly]].]]
The precise origin of gambling is unknown. It is generally believed that gambling in some form or another has been seen in almost every society in history. From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.

The first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bjørn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=ridotto+1638+casino#v=onepage&amp;q=ridotto%201638%20casino&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781409460800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.

Most jurisdictions worldwide have a minimum [[gambling age]] of 18 to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Futures at Stake: Youth, Gambling, and Society|editor1=Howard J. Shaffer|display-editors=etal|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=2003|pages=147-151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fk0DGWFiW6QC&amp;pg=PA147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Customers gamble by playing [[casino game|games of chance]], in some cases with an element of skill, such as [[craps]], [[roulette]], [[baccarat (card game)|baccarat]], [[blackjack]], and [[video poker]]. Most games have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.

''Payout'' is the percentage of funds (&quot;winnings&quot;) returned to players.

Casinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.

Video Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.&lt;ref&gt;

Casino design—regarded as a psychological exercise—is an intricate process that involves optimising floor plan, décor and atmospherics to encourage gambling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livecasino.co.uk/resource/casino-design/ Creating Compulsion: An Investigation Into Casino Design, Architecture and Ambience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104222350/http://www.livecasino.co.uk/resource/casino-design/ |date=November 4, 2013 }}, LiveCasino.co.uk, Retrieved 2/9/2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors influencing gambling tendencies include sound, odour and lighting. Natasha Dow Schüll, an anthropologist at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], highlights the decision of the audio directors at Silicon Gaming to make its slot machines resonate in &quot;the universally pleasant tone of C, sampling existing casino soundscapes to create a sound that would please but not clash&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/08/slot-machine-lose-lose-situation S] l [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/08/slot-machine-lose-lose-situation ot machines: a lose-lose situation] (June 8, 2013).

Dr Alan Hirsch, founder of the Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in [[Chicago]], studied the impact of certain scents on gamblers, discerning that a pleasant albeit unidentifiable odor released by [[Las Vegas]] slot machines generated about 50% more in daily revenue. He suggested that the scent acted as an aphrodisiac, causing a more aggressive form of gambling.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.timeoutchicago.com/things-to-do/casinos-gambling/14902383/the-psychology-behind-casino-design The psychology behind casino design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801080041/http://www.timeoutchicago.com/things-to-do/casinos-gambling/14902383/the-psychology-behind-casino-design |date=2013-08-01 }}&quot;, (August 24, 2011).

===Significant sites===
While there are casinos in many places, a few places have become well known specifically for gambling. Perhaps the place almost defined by its casino is Monte Carlo, but other places are known as gambling centers.

====Monte Carlo, Monaco====
{{Main|Monte Carlo Casino}}
[[Monte Carlo Casino]], located in [[Monte Carlo]] city, in [[Monaco]], is a famous casino and a tourist attraction popular with well-off visitors. 

Monte Carlo Casino has been depicted in many books, including [[Ben Mezrich]]'s ''[[Busting Vegas]]'', where a group of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] students beat the casino out of nearly $1 million. This book is based on real people and events; however, many of those events are contested by main character [[Semyon Dukach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thepogg.com/thepogg-interviews-semyon-dukach-mit-card-counting-team-captain/| title=ThePOGG Interviews - Semyon Dukach - MIT Card Counting Team Captain | accessdate=2012-10-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monte Carlo Casino has also been featured in multiple [[James Bond]] novels and films.

The casino is mentioned in the song &quot;[[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (song)|The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo]]&quot; as well as [[The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo (film)|the film of the same name]].

====Campione d'Italia====
{{Main|Casinò di Campione}}
Casinò di Campione is located in the tiny [[Itay|Italian]] enclave of [[Campione d'Italia]], within [[Canton of Ticino|Ticino]], [[Switzerland]]. The casino was founded in 1917 as a site to gather information from foreign diplomats during the First World War. Today it is owned by the Italian government, and operated by the municipality. With gambling laws being less strict than in Italy and Switzerland, it is among most popular gambling destination besides Monte Carlo. The income from the casino is sufficient for the operation of Campione without the imposition of taxes, or obtaining of other revenue.&lt;ref name=nytehs&gt;{{cite news |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/enclave-hunting-in-switzerland/ |title=Enclave-Hunting in Switzerland |date=May 15, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |author=Frank Jacobs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the casino moved into new premises of more than {{convert |55000|m2}}, making it the largest casino in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/business/21586616-casinos-are-licence-print-money-right-not-one-losing-streak |title = Gambling: Losing streak|work = The Economist|date = 21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new casino was built alongside the old one, which dated from 1933 and has since been demolished.&lt;ref name= nytehs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://como-lake.arounder.com/en/casinos/casino-campione-d-italia | title = Casinó Campione d'Italia | work = Arounder | publisher = VRWAY Communication | accessdate = 2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macau====
{{Main|Gambling in Macau}}
[[File:Venetian Macau.jpg|thumb|[[The Venetian Macao]]]]
The former [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colony]] of [[Macau]], a [[Special administrative region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] of [[China]] since 1999, is a popular destination for visitors who wish to gamble. This started in Portuguese times, when Macau was popular with visitors from nearby [[British Empire|British]] [[Hong Kong]], where gambling was more closely regulated. [[The Venetian Macao]] is currently the largest casino in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casino.org/blog/the-worlds-largest-casino/|title=10 Of The World's Largest Casinos: The Biggest Casinos Ever!|date=25 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macau also surpassed Las Vegas as the largest gambling market in the world.

====Germany====
Machine-based gaming is only permitted in land-based casinos, restaurants, bars and gaming halls, and only subject to a licence. Online slots are, at the moment, only permitted if they are operated under a Schleswig-Holstein licence. AWPs are governed by federal law – the Trade Regulation Act and the Gaming Ordinance.

====Estoril, Cascais, Portugal====
{{Main|Casino Estoril}}
[[File:Casino Estoril - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Casino Estoril]], in [[Portuguese Riviera]], is Europe's largest casino by capacity.]]
The [[Casino Estoril]], located in the municipality of [[Cascais]], on the [[Portuguese Riviera]], near [[Lisbon]], is the largest casino in Europe by capacity.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it was reputed to be a gathering point for [[spy|spies]], dispossessed [[royal family|royals]], and wartime adventurers; it became an inspiration for [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond|James Bond 007]] novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.

====Singapore====

[[Singapore]] is an up-and-coming destination for visitors wanting to gamble, although there are currently only two casinos (both foreign owned), in Singapore. The [[Marina Bay Sands]] is the most expensive standalone casino in the world, at a price of US$8 billion, and is among the [[List of most expensive buildings in the world|world's ten most expensive buildings]]. The [[Resorts World Sentosa]] has the world's largest [[oceanarium]].

====United States====
{{main|Gambling in the United States}}
With currently over 1,000 casinos, the United States has the largest number of casinos in the world. The number continues to grow steadily as more states seek to legalize casinos. 40 states now{{when|date=December 2017}} have some form of casino gambling. Relatively small places such as [[Las Vegas]] are best known for gambling; larger cities such as [[Chicago]] are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.

The [[Las Vegas Valley]] has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States. Based on revenue, [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] ranks second, and the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago region]] third.

==Security==
{{main|Casino security}}
[[File:noidnoentry.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.75|A sign at the [[OLG Casino Thousand Islands|Thousand Islands Casino]]]]
Given the large amounts of currency handled within a casino, both patrons and staff may be tempted to cheat and steal, in collusion or independently; most casinos have security measures to prevent this. [[Security camera]]s located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.

Modern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system, known in the industry as the [[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/6_Casino_Management.htm|title=Casino Management and Operations|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.

When it opened in 1989, [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |date=February 2007 |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.

==Business practices==
Over the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes &quot;Tribes to pay Conn. $25m in slot accord&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043241/http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes |date=2012-05-12 }}, (August 27, 2009).

Casinos have been linked to [[organised crime]], with early casinos in Las Vegas originally dominated by the [[American Mafia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2442c84a-f8e3-11df-99ed-00144feab49a|title=When the mob ruled Vegas|author=Doug McKinlay|date=2010-12-07|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/from-siegel-to-spilotro-mafia-influenced-gambling-regulation-in-las-vegas/|title=From Siegel to Spilotro, Mafia influenced gambling, regulation in Las Vegas|author=Jeff German|date=2014-03-09|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Macau by [[Triad syndicate|Triad syndicates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/17/world/asia/macau-dark-side/index.html|title=The dark side of Asia's gambling Mecca|author=Katie Hunt|date=2013-06-18|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11731468|title=Murky world of Chinese high-rollers and organised crime|author=Emma Reynolds|date=2016-10-19|newspaper=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some police reports, local incidence of reported crime often doubles or triples within three years of a casino's opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_742867.html#ixzz1Qbh6hiXF &quot;Gambling addiction leads many down criminal road&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625025307/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_742867.html |date=2011-06-25 }}, [[Jeremy Boren]], (June 19, 2011). ''[[The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', Retrieved 7/20/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2004 report by the US Department of Justice, researchers interviewed people who had been arrested in Las Vegas and Des Moines and found that the percentage of problem or pathological gamblers among the arrestees was three to five times higher than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;McCorkle, Richard C., &quot;Gambling and Crime Among Arrestees: Exploring the Link&quot; (July 2004).

It has been said that economic studies showing a positive relationship between casinos and crime usually fail to consider the visiting population: they count crimes committed by visitors but do not count visitors in the population measure, which overstates the crime rate. Part of the reason this methodology is used, despite the overstatement, is that reliable data on tourist count are often not available.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Douglas M. &quot;Do Casinos Really Cause Crime?&quot; (Jan 2008).
