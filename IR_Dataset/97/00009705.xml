Most [[language]]s of [[Europe]] belong to the '''[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]]. 
Out of a [[demographics of Europe|total population]] of 744 million (as of 2018), some 94% are native speakers of an Indo-European language;
within Indo-European, the three largest phyla are '''[[Romance languages|Romance]]''', '''[[Germanic languages|Germanic]]''' and '''[[Slavic languages|Slavic]]''' with more than 200 million speakers each, between them accounting for close to 90% of Europeans. Smaller phyla of Indo-European found in Europe include [[Hellenic languages|Hellenic]] ([[Greek language|Greek]], c. 10 million), [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] (c. 7 million), [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (c. 5 million), [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Romani language|Romani]], c. 1.5 million) and [[Celtic language|Celtic]] (including Welsh, c. 1 million).

Of the approximately 45 million Europeans speaking non-Indo-European languages, most speak languages within either the '''[[Uralic languages|Uralic]]''' and '''[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]''' families. Still smaller groups (such as [[Basque language|Basque]] and various [[languages of the Caucasus]]) account for less than 1% of the European population between them. Immigration has added sizeable communities of speakers of African and Asian languages, amounting to about 4% of the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International migrant stock: By destination and origin|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimatesorigin.shtml|publisher=United Nations}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Arabic]] being the most widely spoken of them.

Five languages have more than 50 million native speakers in Europe: [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. While Russian has the largest number of native speakers (more than 100 million in Europe), English has the largest number of speakers in total, including some 200 million speakers of [[English as a second language]]. (''See [[English language in Europe]]''.)

== Indo-European languages ==
{{See also|List of Indo-European languages}}

The [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]] is descended from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], which is believed to have been spoken thousands of years ago. Early speakers of Indo-European daughter languages most likely expanded into Europe with the incipient [[European Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], around 4,000 years ago ([[Bell-Beaker culture]]).

=== Romance ===
{{see|Romance languages|Italic languages}}
[[File:Romance 20c en.png|thumb|300px|Romance languages, 14th century.]]
Roughly 215 million Europeans (primarily in Southern and Western Europe) are native speakers of [[Romance languages]], the largest groups including
[[French language|French]] (c. 72 million),
[[Italian language|Italian]] (c. 65 million),
[[Spanish language|Spanish (Castilian)]] (c. 40 million), 
[[Romanian language|Romanian]] (c. 23 million),
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (c. 10 million),
[[Catalan language|Catalan]] (c. 9 million),
[[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] (c. 5 million, also subsumed under Italian), 
[[Venetian language]] (c. 4 million),
[[Galician language|Galician]] (c. 2 million),
[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]] (c. 1 million),
[[Occitan language|Occitan]] (c. 500,000),
besides numerous smaller communities.

The Romance languages are descended from varieties of [[Vulgar Latin]] spoken in the various parts of the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]]. [[Latin]] was itself part of the (otherwise extinct) [[Italic languages|Italic]] branch of Indo-European.
Romance is divided phylogenetically into '''[[Italo-Western languages|Italo-Western]]''', '''[[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]]''' (including [[Romanian language|Romanian]]) and '''[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]'''. The Romance-speaking area in Europe is often referred to as [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friedman |first1=Lawrence |last2=Perez-Perdomo |first2=Rogelio |date=2003 |title=Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEMUKyPTE9AC |location= |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page= |isbn=0804766959 |author-link1=Lawrence M. Friedman |author-link2= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

We can further break down Italo-Western into the ''[[Italo-Dalmatian languages]]'' (sometimes grouped with Eastern Romance), including the Tuscan-derived [[Italian language|Italian]] and numerous [[Languages of Italy|local Romance lects in Italy]] as well as [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], and the ''[[Western Romance languages]]''. The Western Romance languages in turn separate into the [[Gallo-Romance languages]], including [[French language|French]] and its varieties ([[Langues d'oïl]]), the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]] and the [[Gallo-Italic languages]]; the [[Occitano-Romance languages]], grouped with either Gallo-Romance or East Iberian, including [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]; and finally the [[West Iberian languages]] (Spanish-Portuguese), including the [[Astur-Leonese languages]], [[Galician-Portuguese]] and [[Castilian languages|Castilian]].

The [[Germanic languages]] make up the predominant language family in [[northwestern Europe]].
An estimated 210 million Europeans are native speakers of Germanic languages, the largest groups being [[German-speaking Europe|German]] (c. 95 million), [[English language in Europe|English]] (c. 70 million), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (c. 24 million), [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (c. 10 million), [[Danish language|Danish]] (c. 6 million) and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (c. 5 million).

There are two extant major sub-divisions: [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] and [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]. A third group, [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]], is now extinct; the only known surviving East Germanic texts are written in the [[Gothic language]]. West Germanic is divided into [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] (including [[English language|English]]), [[Low German]] and [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] (including [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[High German]] (including [[Standard German]]).

====German and Low Franconian====
{{Main|German language|German-speaking Europe|Low Franconian|Dutch-speaking Europe}}
[[German language|German]] is spoken throughout [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Liechtenstein]], much of [[Switzerland]] (including the northeast areas bordering on Germany and Austria), northern [[Italy]] ([[South Tyrol]]), [[Luxembourg]], and the [[East Cantons of Belgium]].

There are several groups of German dialects:
* [[High German]] includes several dialect families:
** [[German language|Standard German]]
** [[Central German]] dialects, spoken in central Germany and including [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]]
** [[High Franconian]], a family of transitional dialects between Central and Upper High German
** [[Upper German]], including [[Austro-Bavarian]] and [[Swiss German]]
** [[Yiddish]] is a [[Jewish languages|Jewish language]] developed in Germany and shares many features of High German dialects and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

[[Low German]] (including Low Saxon) is spoken in various regions throughout Northern Germany and the northern and eastern parts of the Netherlands. It is an official language in Germany. 
It may be separated into [[West Low German|Low Saxon (West Low German)]] and [[East Low German]].

[[Dutch language|Dutch]] is spoken throughout the [[Netherlands]], the northern half of [[Belgium]], as well as the [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] region of [[France]], and around [[Düsseldorf]] in Germany. In Belgian and French contexts, Dutch is sometimes referred to as [[Flemish]]. [[Dutch dialects]] are varied and cut across national borders.

====Anglo-Frisian====
{{Main|Anglo-Frisian languages|English-speaking Europe}}
The [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian language family]] is now mostly represented by [[Anglic languages|English (Anglic)]], descended from the [[Old English language]] spoken by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]:
* [[English language|English]], the main language of the [[United Kingdom]], also used in [[English-speaking Europe]]
* [[Scots language|Scots]], spoken in [[Scotland]] and [[Ulster]].
The [[Frisian languages]] are spoken by about 500,000 [[Frisians]], who live on the southern coast of the [[North Sea]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]. These languages include [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], [[Saterlandic]], and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]].

====North Germanic (Scandinavian)====
The '''[[North Germanic languages]]''' are spoken in [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] and include [[Danish language|Danish]] ([[Denmark]]), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ([[Norway]]), [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ([[Sweden]] and parts of [[Finland]]), or [[Elfdalian]] (in a small part of central Sweden), [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ([[Faroe Islands]]), and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ([[Iceland]]).

English has a long history of contact with Scandinavian languages, given the immigration of Scandinavians early in the history of Britain, and shares various features with the Scandinavian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121127094111.htm|title=Linguist makes sensational claim: English is a Scandinavian language|website=ScienceDaily|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slavic ===
{{See also|Slavic languages|Slavs}}
[[File:Slavic europe.svg|thumb|300px|Political map of Europe with countries where the national language is Slavic. Pale green represents West Slavic languages, wood green represents East Slavic languages, and dark green represents South Slavic languages.]]
[[Slavic languages]] are spoken in large areas of [[Central Europe]], [[Southern Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. An estimated 250 million Europeans are native speakers of Slavic languages, the largest groups being 
[[Russian language|Russian]] (c. 110 million in [[European Russia]] and adjacent parts of Eastern Europe, Russian forming the largest linguistic community in Europe), 
[[Polish language|Polish]] (c. 55 million),
[[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] (c. 40 million), 
[[Serbo-Croatian]] (c. 21 million),&lt;!--includes Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin--&gt;
[[Czech language|Czech]] (c. 11 million),
[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (c. 9 million), 
[[Slovak language|Slovak]] (c. 5 million)
[[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (c. 3 million each)
and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (c. 2 million).

Phylogenetically, Slavic is divided into three subgroups:
* '''[[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]]''' includes [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]], [[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]] and [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]].
* '''[[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]]''' includes [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], and [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]].
* '''[[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]]''' is divided into Southeast Slavic and Southwest Slavic groups: ''Southwest Slavic languages'' include [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], each with numerous distinctive dialects. Serbo-Croatian boasts four distinct national standards, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], all based on the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]]; ''Southeast Slavic languages'' include [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]] (a [[liturgical language]]).

=== Other ===

* [[Greek language|Greek]] (ca. 13 million){{Fix|text=cf 10 million at start of this article}} is the official language of [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]], and there are Greek-speaking enclaves in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]] and [[Turkey]], and in [[Greek diaspora|Greek communities]] around the world. Dialects of modern Greek that originate from [[Attic Greek]] (through [[Koine Greek|Koine]] and then [[Medieval Greek]]) are [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]], [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]], [[Cretan Greek|Cretan]], [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot]], [[Katharevousa]], and [[Yevanic]].
** [[Greek-Bovesian|Italiot Greek]] is, debatably, a [[Doric Greek|Doric]] dialect of Greek.

It is spoken in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], neighboring [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and [[Montenegro]]. It is also widely spoken in the [[Albanian diaspora]].
* There are six living [[Celtic languages]], spoken in areas of northwestern Europe dubbed the &quot;[[Celtic nations]]&quot;. All six are members of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] family, which in turn is divided into:
** [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic family]]: [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ([[Wales]], ca. 700 000), [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ([[Cornwall]], ca. 500) and [[Breton language|Breton]] ([[Brittany]], ca. 200 000)
** [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic family]]: [[Irish language|Irish]] ([[Ireland]], ca. 140 000), [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ([[Scotland]], ca. 50 000), and [[Manx language|Manx]] ([[Isle of Man]], ca. 1 800)
: [[Continental Celtic languages]] had previously been spoken across Europe from Iberia and Gaul to Asia Minor, but became extinct in the first millennium AD.
* The [[Indo-Aryan languages]] have one major representation: [[Romani language|Romani]] (c. 1.5 million speakers), introduced to Europe in the late medieval period.
* The [[Iranian languages]] in Europe are natively represented in the North Caucasus, notably with [[Ossetic language|Ossetian]] (ca. 600 000).

=== Uralic ===
{{Main|Uralic languages}}
[[File:Oeraals verspreiding-af.svg|bélyegkép|thumb|right|350px|Distribution of Uralic languages in Eurasia]]

Uralic is native to northern Eurasia. [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] groups the Uralic languages other than [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]. 
[[Finnic languages]] include [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (ca. 5 million) and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (ca. 1 million). The [[Sami languages]] (ca. 30 000) are closely related to Finnic.

The [[Ugric languages]] are represented in Europe with the [[Hungarian language]] (ca. 13 million), historically introduced with the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] of the 9th century.

The Samoyedic [[Nenets language]] is spoken in [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] of Russia, located in the far northeastern corner of Europe (as [[Extreme points of Europe#Mainland Europe|delimited]] by the [[Ural Mountains]]).

=== Turkic ===

=== Other ===
* The [[Basque language]] (or ''Euskara'', ca. 750 000) is a [[language isolate]] and the ancestral language of the [[Basque people]] who inhabit the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], a region in the western [[Pyrenees]] mountains mostly in northeastern [[Spain]] and partly in southwestern [[France]] of about 3&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, where it is spoken fluently by about 750,000 and understood by more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people. Basque is directly related to [[Aquitanian language|ancient Aquitanian]], and it is likely that an early form of the Basque language was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages in the area in the [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]].
* [[North Caucasian languages]] is a geographical blanket term for two unrelated [[Language family|language families]] spoken chiefly in the north [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]]—the [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]] family (including [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and [[Adyghe language|Circassian]]) and the [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]] family, spoken mainly in the border area of the southern [[Russian Federation]] (including [[Dagestan]], [[Chechnya]], and [[Ingushetia]]).

Most speakers live in [[Nicosia]], but others are in the communities of [[Kormakiti]] and [[Limassol|Lemesos]]. Brought to the island by Maronites fleeing [[Lebanon]] over 700 years ago, this variety of Arabic has been influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]] in both [[phonology]] and [[vocabulary]], while retaining certain unusually archaic features in other respects.

== History of standardization ==
{{see|Ethnic groups in Europe#History|Vernacular|De vulgari eloquentia}}

=== Language and identity, standardization processes ===
In the Middle Ages the two most important defining elements of Europe were ''Christianitas'' and ''Latinitas''.

The earliest dictionaries were glossaries: more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) ''[[Abrogans]]'' was among the first. A new wave of [[lexicography]] can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the printing press, with the growing interest in standardisation of languages).

The concept of the [[nation state]] began to emerge in the [[early modern period]]. Nations adopted particular dialects as their national language. This, together with improved communications, led to official efforts to standardise the [[national language]], and a number of language academies were established: 1582 ''[[Accademia della Crusca]]'' in Florence, 1617 ''[[Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft]]'' in Weimar, 1635 ''[[Académie française]]'' in Paris, 1713 ''[[Real Academia Española]]'' in Madrid. Language became increasingly linked to nation as opposed to culture, and was also used to promote religious and ethnic identity: e.g. different [[Bible translations]] in the same language for Catholics and Protestants.

The first languages whose standardisation was promoted included Italian (''questione della lingua'': Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian → Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (the standard is based on Parisian), English (the standard is based on the London dialect) and (High) German (based on the dialects of the chancellery of Meissen in Saxony, Middle German, and the chancellery of Prague in Bohemia (&quot;Common German&quot;)). But several other nations also began to develop a standard variety in the 16th century.

=== Lingua franca ===
Europe has had a number of languages that were considered [[linguae francae]] over some ranges for some periods according to some historians. Typically in the rise of a national language the new language becomes a lingua franca to peoples in the range of the future nation until the consolidation and unification phases. If the nation becomes internationally influential, its language may become a lingua franca among nations that speak their own national languages. Europe has had no lingua franca ranging over its entire territory spoken by all or most of its populations during any historical period. Some linguae francae of past and present over some of its regions for some of its populations are:
&lt;!-- in national and chronological order --&gt;
* [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] and then [[Koine Greek]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean Basin]] from the [[Athenian Empire]] to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], being replaced by [[Modern Greek]].

=== Linguistic minorities ===
Historical attitudes towards linguistic diversity are illustrated by two French laws: the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts|Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] (1539), which said that every document in France should be written in French (neither in Latin nor in Occitan) and the [[Toubon Law|Loi Toubon]] (1994), which aimed to eliminate anglicisms from official documents. States and populations within a state have often resorted to war to settle their differences. There have been attempts to prevent such hostilities: two such initiatives were promoted by the [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, which affirms the right of minority language speakers to use their language fully and freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Strasbourg, 5.XI.1992|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|publisher=Council of Europe|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe is committed to protecting linguistic diversity. Currently all European countries except [[France]], [[Andorra]] and [[Turkey]] have signed the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], while [[Greece]], [[Iceland]] and [[Luxembourg]] have signed it, but have not ratified it; this framework entered into force in 1998. Another European treaty, the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], was adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]]: it entered into force in 1998, and while it is legally binding for 24 countries, [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Moldova]] and [[Russia]] have chosen to sign without ratifying the convention.

]]--&gt;
 
The main scripts used in Europe today are the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

The [[Greek alphabet]] was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and Latin was derived from the Greek via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]. In the Early Middle Ages, [[Ogham]] was used in Ireland and [[runes]] (derived the Old Italic script) in Scandinavia. Both were replaced in general use by the Latin alphabet by the Late Middle Ages. The Cyrillic script was derived from the Greek with the first texts appearing around 940&amp;nbsp;AD.

{{See also|Antiqua–Fraktur dispute}}
Around 1900 there were mainly two typeface variants of the [[Latin alphabet]] used in Europe: [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] and [[Fraktur]]. Fraktur was used most for German, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Danish whereas Antiqua was used for Italian, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, English, Romanian, Swedish and Finnish. The Fraktur variant was banned by [[Hitler]] in 1941, having been described as &quot;[[Schwabacher]] Jewish letters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]&lt;br /&gt;
The memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;For general attention, on behalf of the Führer, I make the following announcement:&lt;br /&gt;It is wrong to regard or to describe the so‑called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so‑called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.&lt;br /&gt;Today the Führer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf Müller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script. As soon as is feasible in terms of textbooks, only the normal script will be taught in village and state schools.&lt;br /&gt;The use of the Schwabach Jew letters by officials will in future cease; appointment certifications for functionaries, street signs, and so forth will in future be produced only in normal script.&lt;br /&gt;On behalf of the Führer, Herr Reichsleiter Amann will in future convert those newspapers and periodicals that already have foreign distribution, or whose foreign distribution is desired, to normal script&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scripts have historically been in use in Europe, including Phoenician, from which modern Latin letters descend, Ancient [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] on Egyptian artefacts traded during Antiquity various runic systems used in Northern Europe preceding Christianisation, and Arabic during the era of the Ottoman Empire.

[[Old Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian rovás]] was used by the Hungarian people in the early Middle Ages, but it was gradually replaced with the Latin-based Hungarian alphabet when Hungary became a kingdom, though it was revived in the 20th century and has certain marginal, but growing area of usage since then.

=== European Union ===
{{main|Languages of the European Union}}
The [[European Union]] (as of 2016) had 28 member states accounting for a population of 510 million, or about 69% of the population of Europe.

The European Union has designated by agreement with the member states 24 languages as &quot;official and working&quot;: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages Policy: Linguistic diversity: Official languages of the EU|url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm|publisher=European Commission, European Union|date=4 June 2009|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This designation provides member states with two &quot;entitlements&quot;: the member state may communicate with the EU in any of the designated languages, and view &quot;EU regulations and other legislative documents&quot; in that language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Languages of Europe: Official EU languages |url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc135_en.htm |publisher=European Commission, European Union |year=2009 |accessdate=5 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202112407/http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc135_en.htm |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union and the [[Council of Europe]] have been collaborating in education of member populations in languages for &quot;the promotion of plurilingualism&quot; among EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR) |url=http://www.coe.int/T/DG4/Linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=5 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=30 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint document, &quot;[[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]]: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR)&quot;, is an educational standard defining &quot;the competencies necessary for communication&quot; and related knowledge for the benefit of educators in setting up educational programs. 
In a 2005 independent survey requested by the EU's [[Directorate-General for Education and Culture (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Education and Culture]] regarding the extent to which major European languages were spoken in member states. The results were published in a 2006 document, &quot;Europeans and Their Languages&quot;, or &quot;Eurobarometer&amp;nbsp;243&quot;. In this study, statistically relevant{{clarify|date=December 2019}}{{Fix|text=Do you mean &quot;significant&quot;?}} samples of the population in each country were asked to fill out a survey form concerning the languages that they spoke with sufficient competency &quot;to be able to have a conversation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europeans and Their Languages|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=European Commission|year=2006|accessdate=November 5, 2009|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a table of European languages. The number of speakers as a first or second language (L1 and L2 speakers) listed are speakers in Europe only;{{refn|&quot;Europe&quot; is taken as a geographical term, [[Europe#Definition|defined]] by the conventional [[Europe-Asia boundary]] along the Caucasus and the Urals. Estimates for populations geographically in Europe are given for [[transcontinental countries]].|group=nb}} see [[list of languages by number of native speakers]] and [[list of languages by total number of speakers]] for global estimates on numbers of speakers.

The list includes any language variety with an [[ISO 639]] code. Because the ISO-639-2 and ISO-639-3 codes have different definitions, this means that some communities of speakers may be listed more than once. For instance, speakers of [[Austro-Bavarian]] are listed both under &quot;Bavarian&quot; (ISO-639-3 code ''bar'') as well as under &quot;German&quot; (ISO-639-2 code ''de'').

==Immigrant communities==
Recent (post-1945) [[immigration to Europe]] introduced substantial communities of speakers of non-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International migrant stock: By destination and origin|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimatesorigin.shtml|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest such communities include [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers  (see [[Arabs in Europe]])
and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] speakers (beyond [[European Turkey]] and the historical sphere of influence of the [[Ottoman Empire]], see [[Turks in Europe]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole 2011 loc=367&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Cole|first=Jeffrey|author-link=Jeffrey Cole|year=2011|title=Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia|place=|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-302-8|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Armenian diaspora|Armenians]], [[Berbers]] and [[Kurds]] have diaspora communities of c. 1&amp;ndash;2 million each. The various [[languages of Africa]] and [[languages of India]] form numerous smaller diaspora communities.
