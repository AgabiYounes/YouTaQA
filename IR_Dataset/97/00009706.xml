The '''Eindhoven University of Technology''' ({{lang-nl|Technische Universiteit Eindhoven}}), [[Abbreviation|abbr.]] '''{{lang|nl|TU/e}}''', is a [[technical university]] in the Netherlands, operating in English. 

The University has been placed in the top 400 universities in the world by five major ranking tables. The 2019 [[QS World University Rankings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/eindhoven-university-technology|title=QS World University Ranking - TU Eindhoven|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Top Universities|accessdate=2018-11-25|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; place Eindhoven 99th in the world, 34th in Europe, and 3rd in the Netherlands - TU/e has moved up 59 places in this world ranking since 2012 (in two [https://web.archive.org/web/20181126005538/https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/about-the-university/rankings-and-publications/rankings/ other main world rankings] it is 167th and 51-75th).

TU/e is the Dutch member of the [http://eurotech-universities.eu EuroTech Universities Alliance], a strategic partnership of universities of science &amp; technology in Europe: [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU), [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (EPFL), [[École Polytechnique]] (L’X), [[The Technion]], Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), and [[Technical University of Munich]] (TUM).

==History==
{{See also|List of rectores magnifici of the Eindhoven University of Technology}}
[[File:TUe by night.png|thumb|300px|left|TU by night]]
The Eindhoven University of Technology was founded as the ''Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven'' (THE) on 23 June 1956 by the Dutch government. It was the second institute of its kind in the [[Netherlands]], preceded only by the [[Delft University of Technology]]. 

Undergraduate education was given in four- or five-year programs until 2002, styled along the lines of the German system of education; graduates of these programs were granted an engineering title and allowed to prefix their name with the title ''ir.'' (an abbreviation of ingenieur; not to be confused with graduates of technical ''hogescholen'', who were engineers abbreviated ''ing.''). Starting in 2002, following the entry into force of the [[Bologna Process|Bologna Accords]], the university switched to the bachelor/master structure (students graduating in 2002 were given both an old-style engineering title and a new master's title). The undergraduate programs are now split into two parts, a three-year bachelor program and a two-year master program. 

===Strategic Vision 2020===
[[Image:URE05e.jpg|thumb|right|The fully electric [[Formula Student]] car developed and built by 60 students of the Eindhoven University of Technology]]
On 3 January 2011, the university's strategic vision document for the period up to 2020, the &quot;Strategic Plan 2020&quot;, was presented.&lt;ref name=&quot;StratPlanAnnouncement&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/nieuws/artikel/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=10377&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=361&amp;cHash=7cfc26c00c |title=Strategisch Plan 2020 vergt 700 miljoen euro |trans-title=Strategic Plan 2020 will take 700 million euro |date=3 January 2011 |publisher=Eindhoven University of Technology |language=Dutch |accessdate=17 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119033145/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/nieuws/artikel/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=10377&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=361&amp;cHash=7cfc26c00c |archive-date=19 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the economic crisis and the budget cutbacks announced by the Dutch government for the period up to 2014, the university set itself an ambitious strategic vision for the period up to 2020. This vision included establishing a University College to foster both depth, breadth, and societal relevance in engineering education; establishing a combined Graduate School to manage the graduate programs; an increase of the student body by 50 percent; a 50 percent increase in the number of annual PhDs awarded; an increase of knowledge &quot;valorisation&quot; (exploitation by industry and society) to a campus-wide score of 4.2; increasing the international position of the university to within the top-100 universities; and increasing the embedding of the university within the city and the Brainport region by transforming the campus into a high-grade science park with laboratories, housing facilities for 700 students and researchers and supporting facilities. The science park was one of the more costly elements of the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;StratPlan2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/de_universiteit/Strategie_TUe2020/TUE_2020_Strategisch_Plan_NL.pdf |title= Strategisch Plan 2020 |access-date= 17 January 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110627012601/http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/de_universiteit/Strategie_TUe2020/TUE_2020_Strategisch_Plan_NL.pdf |archive-date= 27 June 2011 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all |language=nl}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(3.0Mb)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Eindhoven University of Technology is a public university of the Netherlands. As such its general structure and management is determined by the ''Wet op het Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek'' (English: ''Law on Higher Education and Scientific Research''). Between that law and the statutes of the university itself, the management of the university is organized according to the following chart:&lt;ref name=&quot;Organogram&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/organogram/ |title=Organogram |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831160432/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/organogram/ |archive-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Organogram of the management of the Eindhoven University of Technology.png|thumb|600px|Organization chart of the TU/e management]]

===Executive college===
The day-to-day running of the university is in the hands of the Executive College (Dutch: ''College van Bestuur''). The College provides oversight for the departments, the service organizations and the Innovation Lab, plus the local activities of the [[Stan Ackermans Institute]]. The College consists of three people, plus a secretary:

;The president: The president is the chair of the College and the main face of the university to the outside world. Over the last few years the post has been held by people from outside the university, chosen from high levels of industry, in order to strengthen the ties between the university and industrial partners. The current president is [[Robert-Jan Smits]], the former Director-General of Research and Innovation at the European Commission.
;The rector magnificus: The [[rector magnificus]] is the one member of the College whose membership is mandated by law. The law allows the university to appoint a rector in any way, but the university statutes determine that the rector magnificus must be an active professor at the university (and must have been that before being appointed rector); in practice the rector is always a former department dean. The rector is the voice of the academic staff in the College and guards the academic interests of the university in the College. The current rector magnificus is [[Frank Baaijens]].
;The vice president: The third member is a &quot;tie-breaker&quot; member of the College. The post is open to anybody (but generally not filled by an academic staff member). The current vice president is Nicole Ummelen.
;The secretary: The secretary is not a member of the College but a university functionary who does secretarial work for the College, keeping the minutes and the records and taking care of communication between the College and the university. The College secretary is usually the secretary for the entire university. The current secretary is Susanne van Weelden.

===Oversight of the executive college===
There are two bodies that provide oversight over the Executive College:

* The Oversight Board is an external board of five people appointed by the Minister of Education (one member is appointed at the suggestion of the University Council). The Board provides external oversight of the running of the university, including changing of the statutes, the budget and other management decisions.
* The University Council is a council of 18 people, half of whom are elected from the university staff (academic and otherwise) and half from the student body. The University Council is informed of the running of the university by the College at least twice a year and may advise the College as it sees fit. It guards against discrimination within the university. And the council must agree to changes in the management structure. The Council membership is open to all students and personnel, except those persons who are in the Oversight Board, the Executive College or who are the University Secretary.

===Departments and service organizations===
Most of the work at the university is done in the departments and the service organizations.

* The [[#Departments|departments]] take care of most of the research and education at the university; each one is run by its professors, headed by the [[dean (education)|dean]]. The deans are all members of the executive deliberation meeting, which is a regular meeting of the deans and the rector.
* The [[#Service organizations|service organizations]] provide services to the inhabitants of the university campus. Examples of these organizations include the housing organization, the ICT organization and the Communication Expertise Center (which does external communications, including to the press). Each service organization is headed by an organization head.

Both for the departments and the service organizations, the staff (and students) are involved with the running of the body. For that reason both types of bodies have advisory councils which have advisory and co-decision authorities.

===TU/e Holding B.V.===
Over the past two decades, the TU/e has increasingly developed commercial interests and off-campus ties. These include commercial agreements and contracts directly between the university and external companies, but also interests in [[#Spinoffs|spinoff companies]]. In order to manage these kinds of contractual obligations the university started the TU/e Holding B.V. in 1997. The Holding is a [[limited company]], dedicated to the commercial exploitation of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;TUEHolding&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/tue_holding_bv/ |title=TU/e Holding B.V. |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814152457/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/tue_holding_bv |archive-date=14 August 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Departments===
The scientific departments (or [[faculty (division)|faculties]]; Dutch: ''faculteiten'') are the primary vehicles for teaching and research in the university. They employ the majority of the academic staff, are responsible for teaching and sponsor the research schools and institutions.

The departments also offer Ph.D programs (Dutch: ''promotiefase'') whereby a qualified master may earn a Ph.D. Unlike in [[anglo-saxon]] countries these are not educational programs, however; rather, a person working towards obtaining the Ph.D is a research employee of the university.

The TU/e has nine departments:
* [[Biomedical Engineering]]
* [[Architectural engineering|Built Environment]]
* [[Electrical Engineering]]
* [[Industrial Design]]
* [[Chemical Engineering]] and [[Chemistry]]
* [[Industrial Engineering]] &amp; Innovation Sciences (formerly [[Technology Management]])
* [[Applied Physics]]
* [[Mechanical Engineering]]
* [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]]

====Honors programs====
The university offers honors programs aimed at both bachelor and master students. At the bachelor level it consists of intensive study within eight possible areas or tracks. At the master level it consists of personal leadership and professional development components, over and above the normal masters study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://studiegids.tue.nl/opleidingen/tue-honors-academy/ |title=TU/e Honors Academy|accessdate=2019-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate doctorate of engineering (PDEng) ===
In 1986, the university started a number of programs for a postgraduate doctorate of engineering (PDEng) together with two other Dutch technological universities (TU Delft and University of Twente). These programs are managed by the [[Stan Ackermans Institute]] on behalf of the [[4TU|4TU Federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SAI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3tu.nl/en/education/sai/ |title=Stan Ackermans Institute |publisher=3tu.nl |date=2008-12-07 |accessdate=2013-06-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929231208/http://www.3tu.nl/en/education/sai/ |archivedate=29 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each program is two years in length. Ten programs are available at the TU/e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tue.nl/en/education/degree-programs/pdeng-programs/ |title=PDEng Programs |accessdate=2019-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*TU/e PDEng programs:
**Automotive Systems Design
**Clinical Informatics
**Data Science
**Healthcare Systems Design
**Information and Communication Technology
**Process and Product Design
**Qualified Medical Engineer
**Smart Buildings and Cities
**[[Software engineering|Software Technology]]
**[[User System Interaction (USI)|User-System Interaction]]

Nationally, more than 3,500 students have earned the postgraduate PDEng degree through this program.

===Other educational programs===
The university hosts a number of other educational programs that are in some way related to the main educational programs. These include the teacher's program and an MBA program.

*[[Eindhoven School of Education]]: Teacher's education for masters, to get their higher education teaching certificate. Also does research into educational sciences and innovation in education.
*[[TIAS School for Business and Society]]: A shared [[MBA]] program with the [[University of Tilburg]], for university graduates.
*HBO minor program: Bachelor programs for students of HBO universities (four-year bachelor programs), to allow them access to university master programs.

==Research==
The TU/e participates in a large number of research institutes which balance in different ways between pure science and applied science research. Some of these institutes are bound strictly to the university, others combine research across different universities. 

===Top in research partnerships with industry===
The TU/e is among the world’s ten best-performing research universities in terms of research cooperation with industry in 2011 (Number 1 in 2009). Ten to 20 percent of the scientific publications of these ten universities in the period 2006–2008 were the result of partnerships with researchers in industry. As well as TU/e and Delft University of Technology, the top 10 also includes two universities in Japan (Tokyo Institute of Technology and Keio University in Tokyo), two in Sweden (CTH Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm), and one each in Denmark (DTU Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby), Finland (University of Helsinki), Norway (Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim) and the USA (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/tue-among-world-top-in-research-partnerships-with-industry/ |title=TU/e among world top in research partnerships with industry |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Off-campus activities==
The TU/e plays a central role in the academic, [[economy|economic]] and [[society|social]] life of [[Eindhoven]] and the surrounding region. In addition the university maintains relations with institutions far beyond that region as well and participates in national and international events (sometimes through the student body).

===Economic and research motor===
The TU/e is enormously important to the economy of the [[Eindhoven]] region, as well as the wider areas of [[BrabantStad]] and the [[Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven]]. It provides highly skilled labor for the local [[knowledge economy]] and is a knowledge and research partner for technology companies in the area.

The historic basis for the university's role as an economy and research motor was the interaction with [[Philips]]. The university was founded primarily to address the need of Philips for local personnel with academic levels of education in [[electronics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and later [[computer science]]. Later that interest spread to [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (which became the primary employer for graduates of the chemistry department). There was also a synergy with these companies in that senior personnel were hired from them to form the academic staff of the university (which led to the Eindhoven joke that the university trains the engineers and Philips trains the professors).

Changing economic times and business strategies changed the relationship during the 1980s and 1990s. As Philips started moving away from the region, its importance to the region and the university decreased. A struggle for economic survival forced the university to seek closer ties with the city and region of Eindhoven in the 1989–1995 period, resulting in the creation of the [[Brainport (Eindhoven)|Brainport]] initiative to draw high tech business and industry to the region. The university started expending more effort in knowledge [[valorisation]], in incubating technology startups, in providing direct knowledge support for local technology companies. Also the academic interests of the research shifted with the times, with more effort going into energy efficiency research, green technologies, and other areas of interest driven by social relevance (the call for better technology in the medical field, for example, led to cooperation with the [[Catharina Hospital (Eindhoven)|Catharina Hospital]] and the [[University of Maastricht]] medical department and finally the creation of the Biomedical Technology department).

The TU/e is host (and in some cases also commissioner) of a number of highly successful research schools, including the [[Eindhoven Embedded Systems Institute|ESI]] and the [[Dutch Polymer Institute|DPI]]. These research institutes are a source of high-tech knowledge for high-tech companies in the area, such as [[ASML Holding|ASML]], [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] and [[FEI Company|FEI]]. The university also plays a large role as knowledge and personnel supplier to other companies in the [[High Tech Campus Eindhoven]] and helps incubate startups through the Eindhoven [[Twinning Center]]. It is also a knowledge supporter of the [[automotive]] industry in the [[Helmond]] region.

In the extended region, the TU/e is part of the backbone of the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ELAt&quot;&gt;[http://www.elat.org ELAt.org] The ELAt website&lt;/ref&gt; This economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the [[European Union]] (measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy); the agreement is based on the cooperative triangle that connects the three technical universities in those cities.

====Eindhoven Energy Institute====
As of the summer of 2010, the TU/e is host to the Eindhoven Energy Institute (EEI). The EEI is a virtual research institute (meaning that it doesn't have any actual offices or facilities), which manages and coordinates the activities of a large number of groups and subinstitutes in the general area of sustainable and alternative energy technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;EEIOverview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/en/the_university/research/research_schools_and_institutes/eindhoven_energy_institute/this_is_eei/ |title=This is EEI |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514120650/http://w3.tue.nl/en/the_university/research/research_schools_and_institutes/eindhoven_energy_institute/this_is_eei |archive-date=14 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific director of the institute is prof.dr.ir. David Smeulders. He is pro forma head of the research department, which is split into four key areas: ''Built Environment'' (energy usage and patterns in building, headed by prof.dr.ir. Jan Hensen from the Department of the Built Environment), ''Future Fuels'' (headed by prof.dr. Philip de Goey of Mechanical Engineering), ''Energy Conversion'' (headed by prof.dr.ir. [[René Janssen]] from Chemical Engineering) and ''Fusion and Plasma'' (headed by prof.dr. Niek Lopes Cardozo from Physics). The EEI also incorporates the Graduate School on Sustainable Energy, which the TU/e had already established together with the [[Technical University Munich|TU Munich]] and [[Technical University of Denmark|DTU Lyngby]]. Secretarial services will be provided by the Center Technology for Sustainable Development (TDO) which also already existed at the TU/e (since 1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;MatrixEEI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/csc/matrix/matrix2010_2.pdf |title= Matrix, the TU/e quarterly publication, summer edition 2010 |access-date= 21 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201212/http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/csc/matrix/matrix2010_2.pdf |archive-date= 17 July 2011 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.3Mb; p.4-7)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy research at the TU/e is among the best in academic Europe (a February 2010 study by Reed Elsevier puts it second only to [[Imperial College London]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReedElsevierResearch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/nieuws_tue/2010/03/Q2226.SciVal.Spt.Alternative_Energy_ReportV3.pdf |title= Alternative Energy Leadership Study |access-date= 21 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201257/http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/nieuws_tue/2010/03/Q2226.SciVal.Spt.Alternative_Energy_ReportV3.pdf |archive-date= 17 July 2011 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.6Mb)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact, as well as the unique attention to energy in the built-up environment, drew the attention of the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]]. The EEI is now a full co-location of EIT's KIC on Sustainable Energy (InnoEnergy).&lt;ref name=&quot;EEIOverview&quot;/&gt;

===International cooperation and appeal===
The TU/e maintains active academic cooperation with sister institutions in many different countries, for example:&lt;ref name=&quot;TUESamenWerking&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stuvo.tue.nl/scholieren/studeren-aan-de-tue/where-innovation-starts/samenwerking.html |title=Samenwerking |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=18 September 2010 |language=nl }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/education/studying-at-tue/why-study-at-tue/inter-national-partnerships/ |title=(Inter-)national partnerships |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2010-07-22 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
