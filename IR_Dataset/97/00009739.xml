In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text. Users from [[Japan]] popularized a kind of emoticon called '''kaomoji''' ([[:ja:顔文字|顔文字]]; lit. 顔(kao)=face, 文字(moji)=character(s)), utilizing the [[Katakana]] character set, that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;aist&quot;&gt;{{cite web

As [[SMS]] and the [[internet]] became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used on text messages, [[internet forum]]s and [[email|e-mails]]. Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of &quot;tone&quot; and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Origin of the term ==
The word is a [[portmanteau]] word of the [[English language|English]] words &quot;emotion&quot; and &quot;icon&quot;. In [[web forum]]s, [[instant messaging|instant messengers]] and [[online game]]s, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called &quot;emoticons&quot; as well. Emoticons for a [[smiley]] face &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; and sad face &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt; appear in the first documented use in digital form. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in non-Latin scripts, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of [[kaomoji]].

The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 17th century, drawn by a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing. Digital forms of emoticons on the [[Internet]] were included in a proposal by [[Scott Fahlman]] of [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], in a message on September 19, 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;smiley&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

=== Pre-emoticon ===
Emoticons began with the suggestion that combinations of punctuation could be used in typography to replace [[language]]. While [[Scott Fahlman]]'s suggestion in the 1980s was the birth of the emoticon, it wasn't the first occasion that :) or :-) was used in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stamp |first1=Jimmy |title=Who Really Invented the Smiley Face? |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/who-really-invented-the-smiley-face-2058483/ |publisher=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alleged use of emoticon, 1862-08-07.jpg|thumb|Alleged use of emoticon by ''[[The New York Times]]'', in 1862]]

Many different forms of communication are now seen as precursors to emoticons and more recently [[emoji]]s. The ''National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide'' in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in [[Morse code]] to express &quot;love and kisses&quot; (later reduced to the more formal &quot;best regards&quot;). ''Dodge's Manual'' in 1908 documented the reintroduction of &quot;love and kisses&quot; as the number 88. Gajadhar and Green comment that both [[Morse code abbreviations]] are more succinct than modern abbreviations such as [[LOL (Internet slang)|LOL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Joan Gajadhar| author2 = John Green| title   = The Importance of Nonverbal Elements in Online Chat| year    = 2005| journal = EDUCAUSE Quarterly| volume  = 28| issue   = 4| url     = https://er.educause.edu/~/media/files/articles/2005/10/eqm05411.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[morse code]], other communication tools such as generic [[prosign]]s were seen by some as an evolution of language. The first time an emoticon appeared in text was in the transcript of one of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s speeches written in 1862. It contained the following:

&lt;code&gt;(applause and laughter ;)&lt;/code&gt;

According to the [[New York Times]], there has been some debate whether the emoticon in Abraham Lincoln's speech was a [[typo]], a legitimate punctuation construct, or the first emoticon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url   = http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/hfo-emoticon/| work  = The New York Times| title = Is That an Emoticon in 1862?| date  = January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1800s, the first emoticons were created as an art form in the U.S. satirical magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]].'' In total, four different emoticon designs were displayed, all using punctuation to create different typographical emoticon faces. The emoticon designs were similar to that which formed many years later in [[Japan]], often referred to as ''&quot;Kaomoji&quot;'', due to their complicated design.&lt;ref name=&quot;emoticonPuck&quot; /&gt; Despite the innovation, complex emoticons didn't develop in [[Japan]] until nearly a century later. In 1912, American author [[Ambrose Bierce]] was the first to suggest that a [[bracket]] could be used to represent a smiling face. He stated, &quot;an improvement in punctuation&amp;nbsp;– the snigger point, or note of [[wikt:cachinnation|cachinnation]]: it is written thus&amp;nbsp;‿ and presents a smiling mouth. It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author    = Ambrose Bierce| chapter   = For Brevity and Clarity| title     = The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce, XI: Antepenultimata| year      = 1912| publisher = The Neale Publishing Company| pages     = 386–7| chapter-url       = https://books.google.com/books?id=3nEcAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emoticons Puck 1881.png|thumb|And Like RuneSlash.Tk|Emoticons published in the March 30, 1881 issue of ''Puck''.&lt;ref name=&quot;emoticonPuck&quot;&gt;[http://explore.noodle.org/post/38732179273/the-birth-of-emoticons-one-of-100-diagrams-that See original the page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718025547/http://explore.noodle.org/post/38732179273/the-birth-of-emoticons-one-of-100-diagrams-that |date=July 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following this breakthrough statement, other writers and linguistic experts began to put out theories as to how punctuations could be used in collections to represent a face. Moving on from Bierce's theory that a horizontal [[bracket]]s could be used for a smiling face, Alan Gregg was the first recorded person to suggest that by combining [[punctuation mark]]s, more elaborate emotions could be demonstrated. There is an argument that this was the first real set of emoticons, despite later designs becoming the standard for emoticons. Gregg published his theory in 1936, in an ''[[The Harvard Lampoon|Harvard Lampoon]]'' article. He suggested that by turning the bracket sideways, it could be used for the sides of the mouth or cheeks, with other punctuation used between the brackets to display various emotions. Gregg's theory took the step of creating more than one smiling face, with (-) for a normal smile and (--) for a laughing smile. The logic behind the design was that more teeth were showing on the wider design. Two other emoticons were proposed in the article, with (#) for a frown and (*) for a wink.&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Lampoon, Vol. 112 No. 1, September 16, 1936, pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emoticon adoption===
Emoticons had already come into use in sci-fi [[fandom]] in the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Benford, &quot;A Scientist's Notebook: net@fandom.com&quot;, ''The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction'', Vol. 90, No. 6 (June 1996), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.

The September 1962 issue of [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]] included an article titled &quot;Typewri-toons&quot;. The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to &quot;Royal Portable&quot;, was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h &quot;raising its hand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MAD Magazine No. 73, Sept. 1962, EC Publications, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Two additional &quot;Typewri-toons&quot; articles subsequently appeared in ''Mad'', in 1965 and 1987.

In 1963, the &quot;[[smiley]] face&quot;, a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist [[Harvey Ball]]. It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit. This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is, in fact, a small yellow smiley face.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview in April 1969, [[Alden Whitman]] asked writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]]: &quot;How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?&quot; Nabokov answered: &quot;I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile&amp;nbsp;– some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author     = Nabokov

In 1971, a French journalist, [[Franklin Loufrani]], created a smiley logo to mark good news in the French newspaper ''France Soir''. Loufrani was the first person to trademark the symbol, in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2001, [[Walmart]] opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990. The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to the widespread use of smiley face designs. Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was &quot;readily distinguishable&quot; from Walmart's. The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court. The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Walmart continued to use its smiley design intermittently and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016.&lt;ref name=serious /&gt;&lt;ref name=back&gt;{{cite web

Starting circa 1972, on the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system, emoticons and other decorative graphics were produced as [[ASCII art]], particularly with [[ASCII art#Overprinting (surprint)|overprinting]]: typing a character, backing up, then typing another character. For example, WOBTAX and VICTORY both produced convincing smiley faces (where the overprinted characters produced the solid background, and pixels untouched by any of the characters produced the actual design). This developed into a sophisticated set, particularly in combination with superscript and subscript.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLATO&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.

== Western-style ==
Usually, emoticons in Western style have the eyes on the left, followed by the nose and the mouth. The two-character version &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; which omits the nose is also very popular.

=== Common Western examples ===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Less than three]] --&gt;
{{Main|List of emoticons}}The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny [[ambigrams]]), with or without a hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, &lt;code&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt; equals sad and &lt;code&gt;:((&lt;/code&gt; equals very sad. Weeping can be written as &lt;code&gt;:'(&lt;/code&gt;. A blush can be expressed as &lt;code&gt;:&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Others include wink &lt;code&gt;;)&lt;/code&gt;, a grin &lt;code&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt;, smug &lt;code&gt;:-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and tongue out &lt;code&gt;:P&lt;/code&gt;, such as when [[blowing a raspberry]]. An often used combination is also &lt;code&gt;&lt;3&lt;/code&gt; for a heart, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;/3&lt;/code&gt; for a broken heart. &lt;code&gt;:O&lt;/code&gt; is also sometimes used to depict shock.

A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; &lt;code&gt;XD&lt;/code&gt; and the addition of further &quot;D&quot; letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g. &lt;code&gt;XDDDD&lt;/code&gt;. There are hundreds of other variations including &lt;code&gt;&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt; for anger, or &lt;code&gt;&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt; for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of &lt;code&gt;D:&lt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;=K&lt;/code&gt; for vampire teeth, &lt;code&gt;:s&lt;/code&gt; for grimace, and &lt;code&gt;;P&lt;/code&gt; can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a [[double entendre|second meaning]] in the sentence preceding it.&lt;ref&gt;Dresner &amp; Herring (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

As computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons. The '[[shrug]]' emoticon, &lt;code&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;, uses the glyph [[ツ]] from the Japanese [[katakana]] writing system.

=== Variation ===
{{Main|ASCII art}}

An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an &quot;o&quot; as in &lt;code&gt;=O)&lt;/code&gt;. In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;:^)&lt;/code&gt;. One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age, with younger people less likely to use a nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another. It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;.

Some variants are also more common in certain countries due to [[keyboard layout]]s. For example, the smiley &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; may occur in [[Scandinavia]], where the keys for &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; are placed right beside each other. However, the &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; variant is without a doubt the dominant one in Scandinavia, making the &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; version a rarity. [[Diacritic]]al marks are sometimes used. The letters &lt;code&gt;Ö&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Ü&lt;/code&gt; can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of &lt;code&gt;:O&lt;/code&gt; (meaning that one is surprised) and &lt;code&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt; (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.

Some emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact, can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example &lt;code&gt;D:&lt;/code&gt; which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of &lt;code&gt;:D&lt;/code&gt;.

== &lt;span &quot;id=East Asian style&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Asian style&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Japanese style&quot;&gt;Japanese style (''kaomoji'')&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ==

[[File:Kaomoji! (2334722446).jpg|thumb|200px|A Kaomoji painting in Japan]]
Users from [[Japan]] popularized a style of emoticons ([[:ja:顔文字|顔文字]], ''kaomoji, lit.'' &quot;face characters&quot;) that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on [[ASCII Corporation#History|ASCII NET]], an early Japanese online service, in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;aist&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whatjapanthinks2007&quot; /&gt; Similar-looking emoticons were used on the [[Byte Information Exchange]] (BIX) around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg261.txt

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to &lt;code&gt;(*_*)&lt;/code&gt;. The [[asterisk]]s indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an [[underscore]], the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.

Different emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, &quot;T&quot; can be used to express crying or sadness: &lt;code&gt;(T_T)&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;T_T&lt;/code&gt; may also be used to mean &quot;unimpressed&quot;.  The emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;.  Looks of stress are represented by the likes of &lt;code&gt;(x_x)&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;(-_-;)&lt;/code&gt; is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced [[sweat drop]] (discussed further below).  &lt;code&gt;///&lt;/code&gt; can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title      = KawaiiFace.net

| year       = 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, &quot;cuter&quot; mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g. &lt;code&gt;(^.^)&lt;/code&gt;. Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. &lt;code&gt;(^^)&lt;/code&gt;. 

Parentheses are sometimes replaced with [[Bracket#Curly brackets|braces]] or [[Bracket#Square brackets|square brackets]], e.g. &lt;code&gt;{^_^}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[o_0]&lt;/code&gt;. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^^&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt; &gt;.&lt; &lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;o_O&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;O.O&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;e_e&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;e.e&lt;/code&gt;. A quotation mark &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, apostrophe &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;, or semicolon &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in [[manga]] and [[anime]].

Microsoft [[Input method editor|IME]] 2000 ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.  In IME 2007, this support was moved to the Emoticons dictionary.  Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.

Communication software allowing the use of [[Shift JIS]] encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as &lt;code&gt;(^ム^)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(益)&lt;/code&gt;.

Modern communication software generally utilizes [[Unicode]], which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages (e.g. from the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]), and a variety of symbols into the kaomoji, as in &lt;code&gt;(`Д´)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(◕‿◕✿)&lt;/code&gt;.

Further variations can be produced using Unicode [[combining character]]s, as in &lt;code&gt;٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ᶘᵒᴥᵒᶅ&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Western use of Japanese style ===
English-language [[anime]] forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.  Because of this, they are often called &quot;anime style&quot; emoticons in English{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}.  They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and non-anime-related discussion forums.  Emoticons such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;(&amp;nbsp;^.^&amp;nbsp;)&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;(^_^&lt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;(o_o&lt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;(&amp;nbsp;-'.'-&amp;nbsp;)&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;('.'-^)&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;(&gt;';..;')&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs &lt; or &gt;) also are often referred to as &quot;{{not a typo|Kirbys}}&quot; in reference to their likeness to [[Nintendo]]'s [[video game]] character [[Kirby (Nintendo)|Kirby]]. The parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an [[intensifier]] for the emoticon in question, e.g. &lt;code&gt;^_________^&lt;/code&gt; for very happy. The emoticon {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;t(-_-t)&lt;/code&gt;}} uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western [[The finger|&quot;middle-finger flick-off&quot;]] using a &quot;t&quot; as the arm, hand, and finger. Using a [[lateral click]] for the nose such as in &lt;!-- Had to do the following since code tags prevent combining characters from combining.  If there's a less manual way to do it with a template, I couldn't find it. --&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #eaecf0; padding: 1px; text-align: center; vertical-align: bottom&quot;&gt;{{nowrap |( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)}}&lt;/span&gt; is believed to originate from the Finnish image-based message board Ylilauta, and is called a &quot;Lenny face&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/memes/lenny-face/|title=Where does Lenny Face come from?|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=2019-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like &lt;code&gt;*,..,*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;`;..;´&lt;/code&gt; to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.

=== Mixture of Western and Japanese style ===
Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture has given rise to many emoticons that have an upright viewing format.  The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as &lt;code&gt;-O-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-3-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-w-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'_'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;;_;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;T_T&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;.V.&lt;/code&gt; are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime- or manga-styled sweat drop, for example &lt;code&gt;^_^'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;!&gt;_&lt;!&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;@&gt;_____&lt;@&gt;;;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;;O;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;*u*&lt;/code&gt;.  The equals sign can also be used for closed, anime-looking eyes, for example &lt;code&gt;=0=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=3=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=w=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=A=&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;=7=&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;uwu&lt;/code&gt; face (and its variations &lt;code&gt;UwU&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OwO&lt;/code&gt;),  is an emoticon of Japanese origin which denotes a cute expression or emotion felt by the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2018/10/22/why-did-the-official-twitter-account-tweet-uwu|title=Why Did the Official Twitter Account Tweet &quot;uwu&quot;???|last=Thomas|first=Miles|website=Crunchyroll|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inches|first=Giacomo|last2=Carman|first2=Mark James|last3=Crestani|first3=Fabio|date=2011|editor-last=Christiansen|editor-first=Henning|editor2-last=De Tré|editor2-first=Guy|editor3-last=Yazici|editor3-first=Adnan|editor4-last=Zadrozny|editor4-first=Slawomir|editor5-last=Andreasen|editor5-first=Troels|editor6-last=Larsen|editor6-first=Henrik Legind|title=Investigating the Statistical Properties of User-Generated Documents|journal=Flexible Query Answering Systems|volume=7022|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|pages=198–209|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24764-4_18|isbn=9783642247644|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/27362/files/crestani_LNCS_2011_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, sometimes combining characters (accents) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, as in &lt;code&gt;ò_ó&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ó_ò&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;õ_o&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ù_u&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;o_Ô&lt;/code&gt;.

=== 2channel style ===
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[ಠ ಠ]] --&gt;
Users of the Japanese discussion board [[2channel]], in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], as in  &lt;code&gt;ಠ_ಠ&lt;/code&gt; (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).  These were quickly picked up by [[4chan]] and spread to other Western sites soon after.  Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like [[Mona (ASCII art)|Monā]].

== Korean style ==
In [[South Korea]], emoticons use Korean [[Hangul]] letters, and the Western style is rarely used. The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences. Korean style contains Korean [[jamo]] (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters. Consonant jamos &lt;code&gt;ㅅ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅁ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ㅂ&lt;/code&gt; as the mouth/nose component and &lt;code&gt;ㅇ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅎ&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ㅍ&lt;/code&gt; for the eyes. For example: &lt;code&gt;ㅇㅅㅇ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅇㅂㅇ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅇㅁㅇ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-ㅅ-&lt;/code&gt;. Faces such as &lt;code&gt;'ㅅ'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&quot;ㅅ&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;'ㅂ'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'ㅇ'&lt;/code&gt;, using quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and apostrophes &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as ㅜ,ㅠ depict a crying face. Example: &lt;code&gt;ㅜㅜ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅠㅠ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;뉴뉴&lt;/code&gt; (same function as T in western style). Sometimes ㅡ (not an em-dash &quot;—&quot; but a vowel jamo), a comma or an underscore is added, and the two character sets can be mixed together, as in &lt;code&gt;ㅜ.ㅜ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅠ.ㅜ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅠ.ㅡ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅜ_ㅠ&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅡ^ㅜ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ㅜㅇㅡ&lt;/code&gt;. Also, semicolons and carets are commonly used in Korean emoticons; semicolons mean sweating (embarrassed). If they are used with ㅡ or – they depict a bad feeling. Examples: &lt;code&gt;-;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--^&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ㅡㅡ;;;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-_-;;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-_^&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code&gt;^^, ^오^&lt;/code&gt; means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age). Others include: &lt;code&gt;~_~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-6-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+0+&lt;/code&gt;.

== Chinese ideographic style ==
{{See also|Jiong}}

The character 囧 (U+56E7), which means &quot;bright&quot;, It is also combined with posture emoticon Orz, such as 囧rz. The character existed in [[Oracle bone script]], but its use as emoticon was documented as early as January 20, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;nownews-56E7&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ideographic variants for 囧 include 崮 (king 囧), 莔 (queen 囧), 商 (囧 with hat), 囧興 (turtle), 卣 ([[Bomberman]]).

The character 槑 (U+69D1), which sounds like the word for &quot;plum&quot; (梅 (U+FA44)), is used to represent double of 呆 (dull), or further magnitude of dullness. In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) might be [[Reduplication#Chinese|duplicated]] to express emphasis.

== Russian smiley ==
On the Russian speaking internet, the right parenthesis  &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;  is used as a smiley. Multiple parentheses  &lt;code&gt;))))&lt;/code&gt;  are used to express greater happiness, amusement or laughter. It is commonly placed at the end of a sentence. The colon is omitted due to being in a lesser-known and difficult to type position on the [[JCUKEN|ЙЦУКЕН keyboard layout]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 2004, the [[Trillian (software)|Trillian]] chat application introduced a feature called &quot;emotiblips&quot;, which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients &quot;as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2007, [[MTV]] and [[Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] promoted the &quot;emoticlip&quot; as a form of [[viral marketing]] for the second season of the show ''The Hills''. The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley &amp; Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as &quot;greeting cards that just happen to be selling something&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623867 AdWeek Article about Emoticlip] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225011527/http://www.adweek.com/aw/national/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623867 |date=December 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based application allows users to create a short animation. Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the first half of the 2010s, there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one's emotion. These videos lack an established name, and there are several ways to designate them: &quot;emoticlips&quot; (named above), &quot;emotivideos&quot; or more recently &quot;emoticon videos&quot;. These are tiny videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone to another. Current video compression codecs such as [[H.264]] allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable. The popular computer and mobile app [[Skype]] use these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the &quot;emoticon videos&quot; between parentheses.

In 2000, [[Despair, Inc.]] obtained a U.S. [[trademark]] registration for the &quot;frowny&quot; emoticon &lt;code&gt;:-(&lt;/code&gt; when used on &quot;greeting cards, posters and art prints&quot;. In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website [[Slashdot]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, John. &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/technology/29LOGO.html Compressed Data; Don't Mind That Lawsuit, It's Just a Joke] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817050840/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/29/technology/29LOGO.html |date=2016-08-17 }}&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[patent application]]s have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have been issued as US [[patent]]s. {{cite patent|US|6987991}}, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop-down menu. The stated advantage over the [[prior art]] was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.

The emoticon &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt; was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European [[Community Trademark]] (CTM). In [[Finland]], the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=STT |url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2012081315947358_uu.shtml |title=Hymiölle ei saa tavaramerkkiä &amp;#124; Kotimaan uutiset |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=August 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons &lt;code&gt;:-)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;=(&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:(&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tavaramerkkilehti | journal = Tavaramerkkilehti | issue = 10 | pages = 27–28 | date = May 31, 2006 | url = http://tavaramerkki.prh.fi/lehti/tm/Tavaramerkkilehti10S_2006.pdf | accessdate = June 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a Russian court rejected a legal claim against [[Siemens]] by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt; emoticon.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcwink&quot; /&gt;

In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt; emoticon. A license would not &quot;cost that much{{spaced ndash}}tens of thousands of dollars&quot; for companies, but would be free of charge for individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcwink&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7778767.stm |title=Russian hopes to cash in on ;-) |work=BBC News|date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Emoticons (Unicode block)}}

Some smiley faces were present in Unicode since [[Unicode 1.1|1.1]], including a white [[frowning]] face, a white [[smiling]] face, and a black smiling face. (&quot;Black&quot; refers to a glyph which is filled, &quot;white&quot; refers to a glyph which is unfilled).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://emojipedia.org/glossary/#white|title=📖 Emoji Glossary |publisher=emojipedia.org |access-date=November 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unicode chart Miscellaneous Symbols|emoticons}}

The [[Emoticons (Unicode block)|Emoticons]] block was introduced in [[Unicode]] Standard [[Unicode 6.0|version 6.0]] (published in October 2010) and extended by [[Unicode 7.0|7.0]]. It covers Unicode range from U+1F600 to U+1F64F fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-6.0/U60-1F600.pdf |title=Emoticons |website=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Unicode chart Emoticons}}

After that block had been filled, [[Unicode 8.0]] (2015), [[Unicode 9.0|9.0]] (2016) and [[Unicode 10.0|10.0]] (2017) added additional emoticons in the range from U+1F910 to U+1F9FF. Currently, U+1F90C{{snd}}U+1F90F, U+1F93F, U+1F94D{{snd}}U+1F94F, U+1F96C{{snd}}U+1F97F, U+1F998{{snd}}U+1F9CF (excluding U+1F9C0 which contains the [[cheese|🧀]] emoji) and 1F9E7{{snd}}1F9FF do not contain any emoticons since Unicode 10.0.

{{Unicode chart Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs}}

For historic and compatibility reasons, some other heads and figures, which mostly represent different aspects like genders, activities,g and professions instead of emotions, are also found in [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs#Table of emojis with modifiers|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] (especially U+1F466{{snd}}U+1F487) and [[Transport and Map Symbols#Diversity|Transport and Map Symbols]]. Body parts, mostly hands, are also encoded in the [[Dingbat#Diversity|Dingbat]] and [[Miscellaneous Symbols#Diversity|Miscellaneous Symbols]] blocks.
