It was designed by [[Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon]] and completed in 1931. The building has a roof height of {{convert|1250|ft|m}} and stands a total of {{convert|1454|ft|m|1}} tall, including its [[antenna tower|antenna]]. Its name is derived from &quot;[[Empire State]]&quot;, the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years until the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] in late 1970. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, it was again the tallest building in New York City until it was surpassed by the new [[One World Trade Center]] in 2012. {{As of|2019}}, the building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|seventh-tallest building in New York City]], the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|sixth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States]], and the [[List of tallest buildings|45th-tallest in the world]]. It is also the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas]].

The site of the Empire State Building, located in [[Midtown South]] on the west side of [[Fifth Avenue]] between West [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd]] and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Streets]], was originally part of an early 18th-century farm, then became the site of the [[Waldorf–Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf–Astoria Hotel]] in 1893. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite the publicity surrounding the building's construction, its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s.

Since its opening, the building's Art Deco architecture and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around 4 million tourists from around the world visit the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories every year, and an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The building stands near other major Midtown tourist attractions including [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]], [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Koreatown, Manhattan|Koreatown]], and [[Macy's Herald Square]].

The Empire State Building is an [[United States|American]] [[cultural icon]] and has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. The Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior have been designated as a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and were confirmed as such by the [[New York City Board of Estimate]]. It was also designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986, and was ranked number one on the [[American Institute of Architects]]' List of [[America's Favorite Architecture]] in 2007.

==== Early plans ====
Bethlehem Engineering Corporation originally intended to build a 25-story office building on the Waldorf–Astoria site. The company's president, Floyd De L. Brown, paid $100,000 of the $1&amp;nbsp;million [[down payment]] required to start construction on the tower, with the promise that the difference would be paid later.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=108}} Brown borrowed $900,000 from a bank, but then [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] on the loan.{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=109}}{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|pp=85–87}}

Empire State Inc. contracted [[William F.

While plans for the Empire State Building were being finalized, an intense competition in New York for the title of &quot;[[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]]&quot; was underway. [[40 Wall Street]] (then the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the Empire State Building.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}} The &quot;Race into the Sky&quot;, as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, fueled by the building boom in major cities.{{sfn|Rasenberger|2009|pp=388–389}} The 40 Wall Street tower was revised, in April 1929, from {{convert|840|ft|m}} to {{convert|925|ft|m}} making it the world's tallest.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} The Chrysler Building added its {{convert|185|ft|m|adj=on}} steel tip to its roof in October 1929, thus bringing it to a height of {{convert|1046|ft|m}} and greatly exceeding the height of 40 Wall Street.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=14}} The Chrysler Building's developer, [[Walter Chrysler]], realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having instructed his architect, [[William Van Alen]], to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] dome to a narrow steel spire.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=130}} Raskob, wishing to have the Empire State Building be the world's tallest, reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire; however, the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=131}} On November 18, 1929, Smith acquired a lot at 27–31 West 33rd Street, adding {{convert|75|ft|m}} to the width of the proposed office building's site.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=230}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Enlarges Site For 1,000-foot Building; Empire State Adds 75 Feet in 33d Street to the Waldorf Hotel Plot. | work=The New York Times | date=November 19, 1929 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/11/19/107107719.pdf | access-date=October 24, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper.

===Construction===

==== Hotel demolition ====
Demolition of the old Waldorf–Astoria began on October 1, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/10/02/94184775.pdf|title=Razing Of Waldorf Started By Smith; Ceremony on Roof Marks the Beginning of Demolition of Historic Hotel|date=October 2, 1929|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 22, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stripping the building down was an arduous process, as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been. Furthermore, the old hotel's granite, wood chips, and &quot;'precious' metals such as lead, brass, and zinc&quot; were not in high demand resulting in issues with disposal.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=198–199}} Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby 30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. Much of the other materials that made up the old hotel, including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Sandy Hook]], New Jersey.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=200}}{{sfn|Douglas|2004|p=111}}

By the time the hotel's demolition started, Raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the building.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=268}} The plan was to start construction later that year but, on October 24, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] suffered a [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|sudden crash]] marking the beginning of the decade-long [[Great Depression]]. Despite the economic downturn, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=80}} Neither Raskob, who had ceased [[speculation]] in the stock market the previous year, nor Smith, who had no stock investments, suffered financially in the crash.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=268}} However, most of the investors were affected and as a result, in December 1929, Empire State Inc. obtained a $27.5&amp;nbsp;million loan from [[MetLife|Metropolitan Life Insurance Company]] so construction could begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1929/12/14/92028848.pdf|title=Approves $27,500,000 For Smith Project; Metropolitan Life Grants Loan to the Empire State Building Company.|date=December 14, 1929|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 22, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock market crash resulted in no demand in new office space, Raskob and Smith nonetheless started construction,{{sfn|Rasenberger|2009|pp=394–395}} as canceling the project would have resulted in greater losses for the investors.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=80}}

==== Steel structure ====

A structural steel contract was awarded on January 12, 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Steel Contract Let; Empire State Building to Require Total of 50,000 Tons. | work=The New York Times | date=January 12, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/01/12/97787759.pdf | access-date=October 27, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; with excavation of the site beginning ten days later on January 22,{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=85}} before the old hotel had been completely demolished.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=203}} Two twelve-hour shifts, consisting of 300 men each, worked continuously to dig the {{convert|55|ft|m|adj=on}} foundation.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=85}} Small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=205}} Excavation was nearly complete by early March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Excavating Finished For Smith Building; Steel Construction on Empire State Structure Here Will Begin on March 15. | work=The New York Times | date=March 6, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/03/06/118367296.pdf | access-date=October 27, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction on the building itself started on March 17,{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=207}}{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=413}} with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been finished.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=206}} Around this time, Lamb held a press conference on the building plans. He described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows, the large-block [[Indiana Limestone]] facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks, and the tower's lines and rise.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=247}} Four colossal columns, intended for installation in the center of the building site, were delivered; they would support a combined {{convert|10000000|lb|kg}} when the building was finished.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=248}}

The structural steel was pre-ordered and [[prefabrication|pre-fabricated]] in anticipation of a revision to the city's building code that would have allowed the Empire State Building's structural steel to carry {{convert|18000|psi}}, up from {{convert|16000|psi}}, thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building. Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] did not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before construction was due to commence.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=207}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Standards For Steel Eased In New City Law; Bill Signed by Walker Allows 18,000-Pound Stress to the Square Inch. | work=The New York Times| date=March 26, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/03/26/113333006.pdf | access-date=October 27, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first steel framework was installed on April 1, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Start Empire State Building Frame. | work=The New York Times | date=April 1, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/04/01/96083643.pdf | access-date=October 27, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, construction proceeded at a rapid pace; during one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=204}}{{sfn|Jackson|2010|p=413}} This was made possible through precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the [[mass production]] of common materials such as windows and [[spandrel]]s.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=204–205}} On one occasion, when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark Hauteville marble, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=205}}

The scale of the project was massive, with trucks carrying &quot;16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, {{Convert|450|yd3|m3|disp=sqbr}} of sand and 300 bags of lime&quot; arriving at the construction site every day.&lt;ref name=nyt19300727/&gt; There were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=86}}{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=222}} Temporary water taps were also built so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground level.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=86}}{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=223}} Additionally, carts running on a small railway system transported materials from the basement storage{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=86}} to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19300727&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/07/27/102140403.pdf|title=Greatest Skyscraper Rises On A Clockwork Schedule; The Empire State Building Soars Upward, as a Modern Army Daily, Defeats Time, Far Above the Throngs on Fifth Avenue|last=Poore|first=C.G.|date=July 27, 1930|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 23, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Popular Mechanics|December 1930|p=922}}{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=222}} The {{convert|57480|ST|LT}} of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever single order of steel at the time, comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined.{{sfn|Bascomb|2004|p=246}}{{sfn|Rasenberger|2009|p=396}} According to historian [[John Tauranac]], building materials were sourced from numerous, and distant, sources with &quot;limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, [and] hardware from New England.&quot;{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=204}} The facade, too, used a variety of material, most prominently Indiana limestone but also [[Swedish black granite]], [[terracotta]], and [[brick]].{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=149}}

By June 20, the skyscraper's supporting [[steel frame|steel structure]] had risen to the 26th floor, and by July 27, half of the steel structure had been completed.&lt;ref name=nyt19300727/&gt; Starrett Bros. and Eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction, a goal that they almost reached with their pace of {{frac|4|1|2}} stories per week;{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=212}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/11/us/empire-state-building-fast-facts/index.html|title=Empire State Building Fast Facts|last=Library|first=CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to this, the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been {{frac|3|1|2}} stories per week.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=212}} While construction progressed, the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up (as opposed to the general design, which had been from the roof down).

The stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day's ''New York Times'', a U.S. currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930, a history of the site and building, and photographs of the people involved in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/09/10/118190517.pdf|title=Smith Lays Stone For Tallest Tower; 5,000 Witness Ceremony as Former Governor Wields Trowel at Empire State Building|work=The New York Times|date=September 10, 1930|accessdate=October 27, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=213}} The steel structure was topped out at {{convert|1048|ft|m}} on September 19, twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after the start of construction.{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=164}} Workers raised a flag atop the 86th floor to signify this milestone.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=212}}&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19300920&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Workers Raise Flag 1,048 Feet Above Fifth Av.

Afterward, work on the building's interior and crowning mast commenced.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt19300920&quot; /&gt; The mooring mast topped out on November 21, two months after the steelwork had been completed.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=213}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Empire State Tower Mast Up; Steel Workers Raise Flag | work=The New York Times | date=November 22, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/11/22/102190133.pdf | access-date=October 28, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th floor.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=214}} The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=86}} Because of the building's height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the [[Otis Elevator Company]] to make 66 cars that could speed at {{convert|1200|ft/min|0}}, which represented the largest-ever elevator order at the time.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=215}}

In addition to the time constraint builders had, there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly, and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic. This was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between 33rd and 34th Streets, and then storing the materials in the building's first floor and basements.

According to ''The New York Times'', builders and real estate speculators predicted that the {{convert|1250|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} Empire State Building would be the world's tallest building &quot;for many years&quot;, thus ending the great New York City skyscraper rivalry.

In 1932, the Fifth Avenue Association gave the tower its 1931 &quot;gold medal&quot; for architectural excellence, signifying that the Empire State had been the best-designed building on Fifth Avenue to open in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/02/24/105785983.pdf|title=Empire Tower Wins 1931 Fifth Av.

[[File:Looking Up at Empire State Building.JPG|thumb|A series of [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] causes the building to taper with height.]]

The Empire State Building's [[art deco]] design is typical of pre–World War II architecture in New York. The modernistic, [[stainless steel]] canopies of the entrances on 33rd and 34th Streets lead to two-story-high corridors around the elevator core, crossed by stainless steel and glass-enclosed bridges at the second-floor level.&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot; /&gt; The [[rivet]]ed steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building's gravitational stresses and [[wind load]]s.{{sfn|Taranath|2016|p=459}} The exterior of the building is clad in [[Indiana limestone]] panels sourced from the Empire Mill in [[Sanders, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonNYT1981&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/10/us/limestone-center-turns-to-tourism.html|title=Limestone Center Turns to Tourism|last=Peterson|first=Iver|date=November 10, 1981|website=The New York Times|access-date=September 5, 2016|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; which give the building its signature blonde color.{{sfn|Al-Kodmany|2017|p=72}} The amount of material used in the building's construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers, with a structural stiffness of {{convert|42|psf}} versus the [[Willis Tower]]'s {{convert|33|psf}} and the [[John Hancock Center]]'s {{convert|26|psf}}.{{sfn|Taranath|2016|p=527}} A December 1930 feature in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' estimated that a building with the Empire State's dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of {{convert|50|ST|LT}}.{{sfn|Popular Mechanics|December 1930|p=920}}

The Empire State Building design featured one major [[Setback (architecture)|setback]] and several smaller ones that reduce the level dimensions as the height increases, thus making upper 81 floors much smaller than the lower five floors. However, this design allows sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors and, in addition, positions these floors away from the noisy streets below.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=157}}{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|pp=8–9}} This design was mandated as per the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]], which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well.{{Efn|name=zoning|As per the 1916 Zoning Act, the wall of any given tower that faces a street could only rise to a certain height, proportionate to the street's width, at which point the building had to be set back by a given proportion. This system of setbacks would continue until the tower reaches a floor level in which that level's floor area was 25% that of the ground level's area. After that 25% threshold was reached, the building could rise without restriction.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}}{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Willis|1995|p=67}}

The 1916 Zoning Act was amended in 1961 so that buildings erected thereafter could not exceed a [[floor area ratio]] that was calculated for each zoning district.{{sfn|Kayden|Municipal Art Society|2000|pp=11–12}} The maximum ratio for the Empire State Building's district is 15, unless it includes a public plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/districts-tools/c6.page|title=Zoning Districts &amp; Tools : C6 - DCP|website=www1.nyc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[grandfather clause]] permits preexisting structures to continue under the old rule. Therefore, the Empire State Building's floor area ratio of 25 cannot be duplicated, or even approached, by a new building in that district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Willis | first = Carol | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1550360 | title = Form follows finance: The Empire State Building | journal = Landscape of Modernity: Essays on New York City, 1900–1940 | date = 1992 | editor1-last = Ward | editor1-first = David | editor2-last = Zunz | editor2-first = Olivier | page = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Normally, a building of the Empire State's dimensions would be permitted to build up to 12 stories on the Fifth Avenue side, and up to 17 stories on the 33rd/34th Streets side, before it would have to utilize setbacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Novel-Design-1930&quot;/&gt; However, the setbacks were arranged such that the largest setback was on the sixth floor, above the five-floor &quot;base&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Novel-Design-1930&quot;/&gt; so the rest of the building above the sixth floor would have a facade of uniform shape.{{sfn|Popular Mechanics|December 1930|p=920}}{{sfn|Willis|1995|p=96}}{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=81}}

====Lobby====
[[File:Empire State Building in Manhattan, New York, USA (9892744176).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aluminum relief of the building]]

The original main lobby is accessed from Fifth Avenue, on the building's east side, and contains an entrance with one set of [[double door]]s between a pair of [[revolving door]]s. At the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three &quot;crafts or industries&quot; used in the building's construction—Electricity, Masonry, and Heating.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=13}} The lobby contains two tiers of marble, a lighter marble on the top, above the storefronts, and a darker marble on the bottom, flush with the storefronts. There is a pattern of zigzagging [[terrazzo]] tiles on the lobby floor, which leads from the entrance on the east to the aluminum relief on the west.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}} The chapel-like three-story-high lobby, which runs parallel to 33rd and 34th Streets, contains storefronts on both its northern and southern sides.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12–13}} These storefronts are framed on each side by tubes of dark &quot;modernistically rounded marble&quot;, according to the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], and above by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}} Immediately inside the lobby is an airport-style security checkpoint.{{sfn|Fodor's|2010|p=153}}

The walls on both the northern and southern sides of the lobby house storefronts and escalators to a mezzanine level.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}}{{Efn|name=layout-lobby}} At the west end of the lobby is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built (i.e. without the antenna).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lepik2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Lepik | first=Andres | title=Skyscrapers | publisher=Prestel | year=2008 | isbn=978-3-7913-3992-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJJAQAAIAAJ | pages=53–54 | access-date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relief, which was intended to provide a welcoming effect,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=1}} contains an embossing of the building's outline, accompanied by what the Landmarks Preservation Commission describes as &quot;the rays of an aluminum sun shining out behind [the tower] and mingling with aluminum rays emanating from the spire of the Empire State Building&quot;. In the background is a state map of New York with the building's location marked by a &quot;medallion&quot; in the very southeast portion of the outline. A compass is located in the bottom right and a plaque to the tower's major developers is on the bottom left.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=14}}

The plaque at the western end of the lobby is located on the eastern interior wall of a one-story tall rectangular-shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators, with a similar design to the lobby.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12, 15}} The rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=12}} as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|pages=12, 15}} At both ends of the northern and southern corridors, there is a bank of four low-rise elevators in between the corridors.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=16}} The western side of the rectangular elevator-bank corridor extends north to the 34th Street entrance and south to the 33rd Street entrance. It borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators that go both to the second floor and to the basement. Going from west to east, there are secondary entrances to 34th and 33rd Streets from both the northern and southern corridors, respectively, at approximately the two-thirds point of each corridor.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=15}}{{Efn|name=layout-lobby|See {{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981}}, PDF page 26, for a diagram of the lobby.}}

Until the 1960s, an art deco mural, inspired by both the sky and the [[Machine Age]], was installed in the lobby ceilings.&lt;ref name=Lepik2008/&gt; Subsequent damage to these murals, designed by artist Leif Neandross, resulted in reproductions being installed. Renovations to the lobby in 2009, such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the Fifth Avenue lobby with an [[anemometer]] and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened, revived much of its original grandeur.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt20090923&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/nyregion/23empire.html |title=Overhead, a Lobby Is Restored to Old Glory |work=The New York Times |last=Barron|first= James |authorlink=James Barron (journalist) |date=September 22, 2009 |access-date=January 24, 2020 |language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in 1963 by Roy Sparkia and Renée Nemorov, in time for the [[1964 World's Fair]], depicting the building as the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]] alongside the traditional seven.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1981|page=16}}&lt;ref name=&quot;arbus-bio&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CveczaI95Q8C&amp;pg=PA215|title=Diane Arbus: A Biography|last=Bosworth|first=Patricia|date=1984|publisher=W.

===={{anchor|Dirigible (airship) terminal}}Above the 102nd floor====
The final stage of the building was the installation of a hollow mast, a {{convert|158|ft|m|adj=on}} steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities, above the 86th floor. At the top would be a conical roof and the 102nd-floor docking station.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=186}} The elevators would ascend {{convert|167|ft|m}} from the 86th floor ticket offices to a {{convert|33|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} 101st-floor{{efn|name=101st-floor}} waiting room.&lt;ref name=hearst/&gt;{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=82}} From there, stairs would lead to the 102nd floor,{{efn|name=101st-floor}} where passengers would enter the airships.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=186}} The airships would have been moored to the spire at the equivalent of the building's 106th floor.{{sfn|Langmead|2009|p=82}}{{sfn|Jackson|2010|pp=1344}}

====Broadcast stations====
[[File:Empirestatebuilding29122005.JPG|thumb|left|Antennae for broadcast stations are located at the top of the Building.]]

Broadcasting began at the Empire State Building on December 22, 1931, when [[NBC]] and [[RCA]] began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the spire, with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data. They leased the 85th floor and built a laboratory there.&lt;ref name=be196708/&gt; In 1934, RCA was joined by [[Edwin Howard Armstrong]] in a cooperative venture to test his FM system from the building's antenna.&lt;ref name=ZarkinZarkin2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lessing 1956 p. 20&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Lessing | first=L. | title=Man of High Fidelity: Edwin Howard Armstrong: A Biography | publisher=Lippincott | year=1956 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYAeAAAAIAAJ | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This setup, which entailed the installation of the world's first [[Frequency modulation|FM transmitter]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lessing 1956 p. 20&quot;/&gt; continued only until October of the next year due to disputes between RCA and Armstrong.&lt;ref name=be196708/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZarkinZarkin2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Zarkin | first=K. | last2=Zarkin | first2=M.J. | title=The Federal Communications Commission: Front Line in the Culture and Regulation Wars | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=Understanding our government | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-313-33416-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZ33mq1mLmAC&amp;pg=PA109 | access-date=October 23, 2017 | pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, NBC wanted to install more TV equipment in the room where Armstrong's transmitter was located.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lessing 1956 p. 20&quot;/&gt;

After some time, the 85th floor became home to RCA's New York television operations initially as experimental station W2XBS channel 1 then, from 1941, as commercial station WNBT channel 1 (now [[WNBC-TV]] channel 4). NBC's FM station, W2XDG, began transmitting from the antenna in 1940.&lt;ref name=be196708/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Radio Corporation of America | title=Radio Age | publisher=Radio Corporation of America | issue=v. 3–4 | year=1943 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaETAQAAMAAJ | language=en | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC retained exclusive use of the top of the building until 1950 when the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ordered the exclusive deal be terminated. The FCC directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant New York-area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted. Other television broadcasters would later join RCA at the building on the 81st through 83rd floors, often along with sister FM stations.&lt;ref name=be196708/&gt; Construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on July 27, 1950,&lt;ref name=&quot;bcd19500728&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspapers%252021%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Courier%2520Express%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Courier%2520Express%25201950%2FBuffalo%2520NY%2520Courier%2520Express%25201950%2520-%25207585.pdf|title=O'Dwyer Starts TV Tower Work|date=July 28, 1950|work=Buffalo Courier-Express|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=October 27, 2017|via=[[Fultonhistory.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with TV, and FM, transmissions starting in 1951.

[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|thumb|alt=The Empire State Building as seen from the Top of the Rock|Seen from the [[Top of the Rock]]]]

The placement of the stations in the Empire State Building became a major issue with the construction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers in the late 1960s, and early 1970s. The greater height of the Twin Towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the Empire State Building, eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=356}} Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the [[One World Trade Center#Original building|North Tower]], as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|pp=356–357}} Only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the Empire State Building.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=357}}

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 destroyed the World Trade Center and the broadcast centers atop it, leaving most of the city's stations without a station for ten days until a temporary tower was built in [[Alpine, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Guerrero et al.|2002|p=36}} By October 2001, nearly all of the city's commercial broadcast stations (both television and FM radio) were again transmitting from the top of the Empire State Building. In a report that [[United States Congress|Congress]] commissioned about the transition from [[analog television]] to [[digital television]], it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the Empire State Building was considered &quot;problematic&quot; due to interference from other nearby towers. In comparison, the Congressional report stated that the former Twin Towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference.{{sfn|Guerrero et al.|2002|p=37}} In 2003, a few FM stations were relocated to the nearby [[Condé Nast Building]] to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the Empire State Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cianci | first=P.J. | title=High Definition Television: The Creation, Development and Implementation of HDTV Technology | publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-7864-8797-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mbsfr38GTgC&amp;pg=PA254 | access-date=October 23, 2017 | page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven [[Television broadcasting|television]] stations and twenty-two [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations had signed 15-year leases in the building by May 2003. It was expected that a taller broadcast tower in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], or [[Governors Island]], would be built in the meantime with the Empire State Building being used as a &quot;backup&quot; since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bagli | first=Charles V. | title=Broadcasters Put Antennas in Midtown | work=The New York Times | date=May 12, 2003 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/12/nyregion/broadcasters-put-antennas-in-midtown.html | access-date=October 26, 2017 |language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the completion of [[1 World Trade Center]], some TV Stations began moving their transmitting facilities to 1 World Trade Center, while others, including [[WABC-TV]] remained at the Empire State Building, with no plans to consider a move to the new tower.

{{As of|2018}}, the Empire State Building is home to the following stations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomap.us/us-ny/new-york|title=Radio stations in New York, NY|publisher=World Radio Map|accessdate=October 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027025152/http://www.radiomap.us/us-ny/new-york|archive-date=October 27, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 102nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late 1990s to 2005.{{sfn|Fodor's|2010|p=154}} The observation decks were redesigned in mid-1979.&lt;ref name=oth19791128/&gt; The 102nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-Observatory-2019&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-Renewing-2019&quot;/&gt; An observatory on the 80th floor, opened in 2019, includes various exhibits as well as a mural of the skyline drawn by British artist [[Stephen Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ricciulli 2019&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS News 2019&quot;/&gt;

The building was originally equipped with white [[searchlight]]s atop the tower.

== Importance ==

===Iconic status===
As the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young Young 2007 p. 144&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Willis|Friedman|1998|p=56}} In 2013, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine noted that the Empire State Building &quot;seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Empire State Building: A City Icon Turns 82 Amid Battle to Go Public | website=TIME | date=May 1, 2013 | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/05/01/the-empire-state-building-an-icon-in-the-city/ | access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian John Tauranac calls the tower &quot;'the' twentieth-century New York building&quot;, despite the existence of taller and more [[Modern architecture|modernist]] buildings.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=19}} Early in the building's history, travel companies such as [[Short Line Motor Coach Service]] and [[New York Central Railroad]] used the building as an icon to symbolize the city.{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=20}} After the construction of the first World Trade Center, architect [[Paul Goldberger]] noted that the Empire State Building &quot;is famous for being tall, but it is good enough to be famous for being good.&quot;&lt;ref name=oth19791128/&gt;

As an icon of the United States, it is also very popular among Americans. In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was &quot;America's favorite building&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Empire State Building is America's Favorite | website=Bloomberg | date=February 9, 2007 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-02-09/empire-state-building-is-americas-favoritebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice | access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young Young 2007 p. 144&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Young | first=William H. | last2=Young | first2=Nancy K. | title=The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia | publisher=Greenwood Press | series=The Great Depression in America: A Cultural Encyclopedia | issue=v. 2 | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-313-33522-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBljswTLaIEC&amp;pg=PA144 | access-date=October 25, 2017 | pages=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was &quot;a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men (both clients and construction workers) who were themselves new Americans.&quot;{{sfn|Flowers|2001|p=72}} The architectural critic [[Jonathan Glancey]] refers to the building as an &quot;icon of American design&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glancey 2013&quot;/&gt;

The Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a &quot;[[Wonders of the World|wonder of the world]]&quot; due to the massive effort expended during construction. ''[[The Washington Star]]'' listed it as part of one of the &quot;seven wonders of the modern world&quot; in 1931, while ''[[Holiday (magazine)|Holiday]]'' magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State's height would be taller than the combined heights of the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].{{sfn|Tauranac|2014|p=19}} The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building &quot;A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States&quot; in 1958, and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCE Metropolitan Section&quot;/&gt; Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the &quot;seven wonders of engineering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Ron | title=Seven Wonders of Engineering | publisher=Ebsco Publishing | series=Seven Wonders | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-7613-5989-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R0nN1h_1e7YC&amp;pg=PA15 | access-date=October 25, 2017 | pages=7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often been called the [[Eighth Wonder of the World]] as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupre 2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated Press&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Perez | first=Judith | title=Empire State Building: The 8th World Wonder – A History in Photos | website=ABC News | date=May 1, 2012 | url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/the-8th-world-wonder/ | access-date=October 25, 2017 |url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026054240/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/the-8th-world-wonder/ | archivedate=October 26, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, showing the seven original wonders alongside the Empire State Building.&lt;ref name=arbus-bio/&gt;

===Empire State Building Run-Up===
The Empire State Building Run-Up, a foot race from ground level to the 86th-floor observation deck, has been held annually since 1978. Its participants are referred to both as runners and as climbers, and are often [[tower running]] enthusiasts. The race covers a vertical distance of 1,050&amp;nbsp;feet (320&amp;nbsp;m) and takes in 1,576 steps. The record time is 9&amp;nbsp;minutes and 33&amp;nbsp;seconds, achieved by Australian professional cyclist [[Paul Crake]] in 2003, at a climbing rate of {{convert|6593|ft|0|abbr=on}} per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrr.org/races/pro/esbru/07story01.asp|title=NYRR Empire State Building Run-Up Crowns Dold and Walsham as Champions|date=February 6, 2007|work=New York Road Runners|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716112650/http://www.nyrr.org/races/pro/esbru/07story01.asp|archivedate=July 16, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_specialevents_runup_previous.cfm|title=Past Race Winners|publisher=Empire State Building|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102185933/http://esbnyc.com/tourism/tourism_specialevents_runup_previous.cfm|archivedate=January 2, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
