'''Erin Brockovich''' (born '''Pattee'''; June 22, 1960) is an American [[Paralegal|legal clerk]], consumer advocate, and environmental activist, who, despite her lack of formal education in the law, was instrumental in building a case against the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] (PG&amp;E) of [[California]] in 1993. Her successful lawsuit was the subject of a 2000 film, ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', which starred [[Julia Roberts]]. Since then, Brockovich has become a media personality as well, hosting the TV series ''Challenge America with Erin Brockovich'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and ''Final Justice'' on [[Zone Reality]]. She is the president of Brockovich Research &amp; Consulting. She also works as a consultant for [[Girardi &amp; Keese]],&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brockovich was born Erin Pattee in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], the daughter of Betty Jo (born O'Neal; {{circa}} 1923–2008), a journalist, and [[Frank Pattee]] (1924–2011), an industrial engineer and football player. She has two brothers, Frank Jr. and Thomas (1954–1992), and a sister, Jodie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/obituaries/2008/mar/23/betty_jo_p/|title=Obituaries / LJWorld.com|work=ljworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Lawrence High School (Kansas)|Lawrence High School]], then attended [[Kansas State University]], in [[Manhattan, Kansas]], and graduated with an Associate in Applied Arts Degree from [[Wade College]] in Dallas, Texas. She worked as a management trainee for [[Kmart]] in 1981 but quit after a few months and entered a beauty pageant. She won Miss [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] in 1981 and left the beauty pageant after the win.  She has lived in California since 1982.

==Pacific Gas and Electric litigation==
{{Main|Hinkley groundwater contamination}}
The case (''Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas and Electric,'' file BCV 00300) alleged contamination of drinking water with [[hexavalent chromium]] (also written as &quot;chromium VI&quot;, &quot;Cr-VI&quot; or &quot;Cr-6&quot;) in the southern California town of [[Hinkley, California|Hinkley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skillmd.com/erin-brockovich-and-hexavalent-chromium/|title=Erin Brockovich and Hexavalent Chromium|website=SkillMD|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the center of the case was a facility, the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a [[natural gas|natural-gas]] pipeline connecting to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Between 1952 and 1966, PG&amp;E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight [[corrosion]]. The waste water was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some percolated into the [[groundwater]], affecting an area near the plant approximately {{convert|2|by|1|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/pge/index.shtml  PG&amp;E Hinkley Chromium Cleanup] California Environmental Protection Agency, 9/10/08&lt;/ref&gt; The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) put the PG&amp;E site under its regulations in 1968.

The case was [[settlement (law)|settled]] in 1996 for [[United States dollar|US$]]333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in U.S. history. [[Edward L. Masry|Masry &amp; Vititoe]], the law firm for which Brockovich was a legal clerk, received $133.6 million of that settlement, and Brockovich herself was given a bonus of $2.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/10/gender.uk|title=What Erin Brockovich did next|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|date=10 December 2001|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry showed that cancer rates in Hinkley &quot;remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008&quot;.&lt;ref name=cancer&gt;Schwartz, Naoki (2010-12-13) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/12/13/survey_shows_unremarkable_cancer_rate_in_ca_town/ &quot;Survey shows unremarkable cancer rate in CA town&quot;], ''[[The Boston Globe]] Dec 13, 2010''&lt;/ref&gt; An [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] involved in the study said that the 196 cases of [[cancer]] reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were fewer than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer.&lt;ref name=cancer/&gt; However, in June 2013 ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine featured a critique from the [[Center for Public Integrity]] of the author's work on the later epidemiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/05/erin-brockovich-hinkley-california-junk-science|title=Erin Brockovich's Biggest Debunker, Debunked|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2016}}, average Cr-6 levels in Hinkley were recorded as 1.19 ppb with a peak of 3.09 [[parts per notation|ppb]]. For comparison, the PG&amp;E [[Topock, Arizona|Topock]] Compressor Station on the California-Arizona border averaged 7.8 ppb with peaks of 31.8 ppb based on a PG&amp;E Background Study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/rwqcb6/water_issues/projects/pge/docs/pge_background_study_faq2.pdf PG&amp;E Background Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other litigation==
Working with [[Edward L. Masry]], a lawyer based in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One suit accused the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in [[Willits, California]]. Another, which listed 1,200 [[plaintiff]]s, alleged contamination near PG&amp;E's Kettleman Hills compressor station in [[Kings County, California]], along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/7834421/BP-Oil-Disaster-Major-compensation-payouts-from-other-global-corporations.html|title=BP Oil Disaster: Major compensation payouts from other global corporations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 from two parties and an undisclosed amount from a third party to settle her lawsuit alleging [[toxic mold]] in her [[Agoura Hills]], California, home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACTIVIST+ERIN+BROCKOVICH+SETTLES+HOME+MOLD+SUIT.-a0107814985|title=Activist Erin Brockovich Settles Home Mold Suit|accessdate=October 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027224346/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ACTIVIST+ERIN+BROCKOVICH+SETTLES+HOME+MOLD+SUIT.-a0107814985|archive-date=October 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; After experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the [[Conejo Valley]], Brockovich became a prominent activist and educator in this area as well.

Brockovich and Masry filed suit against the [[Beverly Hills Unified School District]] in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a [[Beverly Hills Oil Field|cluster of oil wells]] on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140105,00.html Beverly Hills Mystery] ''People Magazine''. May 19, 2003, Accessed May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate a substantial link, and [[Los Angeles County]] Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjac.org/newsandresearch/balance/bal3-07.pdf &quot;More Brockovich Claims Tossed.&quot;] ''Balance''.

Brockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], [[Missouri]], in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors (70 since 1996) around the town of [[Cameron, Missouri|Cameron]], [[Missouri]], which is currently{{when|date=August 2019}} being investigated by the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/105/story/1157579.html Lawsuit alleges fertilizer was contaminated around Cameron, Mo.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428171343/http://www.kansascity.com/105/story/1157579.html |date=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in [[Midland, Texas|Midland]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/10/earlyshow/main5076625.shtml &quot;Brockovich: Midland, Texas Water Sullied.&quot;] CBS News. June 10, 2009. Accessed June 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Significant amounts&quot; of hexavalent chromium were found in the water of more than 40 homes in the area, some of which have now been fitted with state-monitored filters on their water supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt; Brockovich said &quot;The only difference between here and Hinkley is that I saw higher levels here than I saw in Hinkley.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt;

In 2012, Brockovich got involved in the mysterious case of 14 students from [[LeRoy, New York]], who began reporting perplexing medical symptoms including tics and speech difficulty.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN-LeRoy-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/03/us/new-york-students-illness/|title=N.Y. town still baffled by teens' mysterious tics|publisher=CNN|date=February 4, 2012|author=Steve Almasy and Jim Spellman|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brockovich believed [[environmental pollution]] from the [[1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment]] was the cause and conducted testing in the area. Brockovich was supposed to return to town to present her findings, but never did; in the meantime the students' doctors determined the cause was [[mass psychogenic illness]] and that the media exposure was making it worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/201715/37/What-Really-Happened-To-The-Girls-In-Le-Roy|title=What Really Happened To The Girls In Le Roy?|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=2013-06-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628022636/http://www.wgrz.com/news/article/201715/37/What-Really-Happened-To-The-Girls-In-Le-Roy|archivedate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No environmental causes were found after repeat testing and the students improved once the media attention died down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/23/us-students-twitcnew-york-h-idUSBRE85M0DF20120623 | work=Reuters | title=School's end clears up New York students' mystery twitching | date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early 2016, Brockovich became involved in potential litigation against [[Southern California Gas]] for a large methane leak from its underground storage facility near the community of [[Porter Ranch]] north of Los Angeles (see [[Aliso Canyon gas leak]]).
