'''Edwin Austin Abbey''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (April 1, 1852{{snd}}August 1, 1911) was an American muralist, illustrator, and painter. He flourished at the beginning of what is now referred to as the &quot;golden age&quot; of illustration, and is best known for his drawings and paintings of Shakespearean and Victorian subjects, as well as for his painting of [[Edward VII]]'s coronation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Saint-Guadens |first=Homer |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 1908 |title=Edwin Austin Abbey: The Career Of A Great American Artist |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XVI |issue= |pages=10191–10124 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=naaZD2r_coMC&amp;pg=PA10191|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous set of murals, ''The Quest and Achievement of the [[Holy Grail]]'', adorns the [[Boston Public Library]].

==Biography==
[[File:Edward Austin Abbey by John Singer Sargent.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|''Edwin Austin Abbey'' (1888), by [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Yale University Art Gallery]].]]
Abbey was born in [[Philadelphia]] in 1852. He studied art at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]&lt;ref name=&quot;LeonardMarquis1908&quot;/&gt; under Christian Schuessele. Abbey began as an illustrator, producing numerous illustrations and sketches for such magazines as [[Harper's Weekly]] (1871–1874) and [[Scribner's Magazine]]. His illustrations began appearing in [[Harper's Weekly]] at an early age: before Abbey was twenty years old. He moved to New York City in 1871. His illustrations were strongly influenced by French and German black and white art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Souter, Nick and Tessa 2012 16&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Souter, Nick and Tessa|title=The Illustration Handbook: A guide to the world's greatest illustrators|year=2012|publisher=Oceana|isbn=978-1-84573-473-2|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also illustrated several best-selling books, including ''Christmas Stories'' by [[Charles Dickens]] (1875), ''Selections from the Poetry of [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]'' (1882), and ''She Stoops to Conquer'' by [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (1887). Abbey also illustrated a four-volume set of ''The Comedies of Shakespeare'' for Harper &amp; Brothers in 1896.

He moved to England in 1878, at the request of his employers, to gather material for illustrations of the poems of [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|authorlink=|editor-first=|editor-last=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abbey, Edwin Austin|edition=15th|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A–Ak – Bayes|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/12 12]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/12}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1882,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y |wstitle=Abbey, Edwin Austin |volume=1 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he settled permanently there in 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colliers&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Swenson|first1=Eleanor B.|editor-first=Bernard|editor-last=Johnston|encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Edwin Austin Abbey|edition=First |year=1997|publisher=P.F. Collier|volume=I A to Ameland|location=New York, NY|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, he was elected to the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; About this time, he was appraised critically by the American writer, [[Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin|S.G.W. Benjamin]]:
{{quote|It must be taken into consideration that he is still very young; that he now for the first time visits the studios and galleries of Europe; that his advantages for a regular art education have been very moderate, and that he is practically self-educated. And then compare with these disadvantages the amount and the quality of the illustrations he has turned out, and we see represented in him genius of a high order, combining almost inexhaustible creativeness, clearness and vividness of conception, a versatile fancy, a poetic perception of beauty, a quaint, delicate humor, a wonderful grasp of whatever is weird and mysterious, and admirable chiaro-oscuro, drawing, and composition. When we note such a rare combination of qualities, we cease to be surprised at the cordial recognition awarded his genius by the best judges, both in London and Paris, even before he had left this country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Greene Wheeler Benjamin|S.G.W. Benjamin]], ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/40604/40604-h/40604-h.htm Art in America: A Critical and Historical Sketch]'', Harpers, 1880&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also created illustrations for [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith's]] ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1887), for a volume of ''Old Songs'' (1889), and for the comedies (and a few of the tragedies) of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Among his water-colours are &quot;The Evil Eye&quot; (1877), &quot;The Rose in October&quot; (1879), &quot;An Old Song&quot; (1886), &quot;The Visitors&quot; (1890), and &quot;The Jongleur&quot; (1892). Possibly his best known pastels are &quot;Beatrice,&quot; &quot;Phyllis,&quot; and &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Edwin Austin Abbey King Lear, Act I, Scene I The Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumbnail|right|320px|''King Lear, Act I, Scene I'' (1897-98), [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]
In 1890 he made his first appearance with an oil painting, &quot;A May Day Morn,&quot; at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in London. He exhibited &quot;Richard duke of Gloucester and the Lady Anne&quot; there in 1896, and in that year was elected [[Royal Academy of Arts#Membership|A.R.A.]], becoming a full member in 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; In 1902 he was chosen to paint the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. It was the official painting of the occasion and, hence, resides at [[Buckingham Palace]]. He did receive a knighthood,&lt;ref name=&quot;Colliers&quot;/&gt; although some say he refused it in 1907. Friendly with other expatriate American artists, he summered at [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], Worcestershire, England, where he painted and vacationed alongside [[John Singer Sargent]] at the home of [[Francis Davis Millet]].

He completed murals for the Boston Public Library in the 1890s. The frieze for the Library was titled &quot;The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail&quot;. It took Abbey eleven years to complete this series of murals in his England studio.

In 1904 he painted a mural for the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], London ''Reconciliation of the Skinners &amp; Merchant Taylors' Companies by Lord Mayor Billesden, 1484''.

===Pennsylvania State Capitol===
In 1908–09, Abbey began an ambitious program of murals and other artworks for the newly completed [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], Pennsylvania. These included [[allegorical]] medallion murals representing ''Science'', ''Art'', ''Justice'', and ''Religion'' for the dome of the [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]], four large lunette murals beneath the dome, and multiple works for the House and Senate Chambers. For the Senate chamber he finished only one painting, ''Von Steuben Training the American Soldiers at Valley Forge'',&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1922&quot;&gt;{{EB1922|inline=y|wstitle=Abbey, Edwin Austin|volume=30|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was working on the ''Reading of the Declaration of Independence'' mural in early 1911, when his health began to fail. He was diagnosed with cancer. Studio assistant William Simmonds continued work on the mural with little supervision from Abbey, and with small contributions by [[John Singer Sergeant]].

Abbey died in August 1911. William Simmonds travelled from England to install the completed murals with Abbey's widow Gertrude.  The remaining two rooms, which Abbey had been unable to finish, were given to [[Violet Oakley]], who completed the commission using her own designs.

==Legacy==
Abbey was elected to the [[National Academy of Design]], in 1902,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; and [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]]. He was honorary member of the [[Royal Bavarian Society]] and the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], and was made a chevalier of the French [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; He was a prolific illustrator, and attention to detail, including historical accuracy, influenced successive generations of illustrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Souter, Nick and Tessa 2012 16&quot;/&gt;

In 1890, Edwin married Gertrude Mead, the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant. Mrs Abbey encouraged her husband to secure more ambitious commissions, although with their marriage commencing when both were in their forties, the couple remained childless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gertrude&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=30314&amp;back= | title=Oakley. L.,  'Abbey, Edwin Austin (1852–1911)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband's death, Gertrude was active in preserving her husband's legacy, writing about his work and giving her substantial collection and archive to [[Yale University|Yale]]. Edwin had been a keen supporter of the newly founded [[British School at Rome]] (BSR), so, in his memory, she donated £6000 to assist in building the artists' studio block and, in 1926, founded the Incorporated Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Scholarships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abbey.org.uk/about_the_awards.php |title=Abbey Awards website }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarships were established to enable British and American painters to pursue their practice. Recipients of Abbey funding – Scholars and, more recently, Fellows – devote their scholarship to working in the studios at the BSR, where there has, ever since, been at least one Abbey-funded artist in residence. Previous award holders include [[Stephen Farthing]], [[Chantal Joffe]] and [[Spartacus Chetwynd]]. [[British School at Rome#Awards and Fellowships|The Abbey Fellowships]] (formerly 'Awards') were established in their present form in 1990, and the Abbey studios also host the BSR's other fine art residencies, such as the [[Derek Hill (painter)#Rome and the Derek Hill Foundation|Derek Hill Foundation Scholarship]] and the [[British School at Rome#Awards and Fellowships|Sainsbury Scholarship in Painting and Drawing]]. A bust of Edwin Abbey, by [[Sir Thomas Brock]], stands in the courtyard of the BSR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bust&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/brock/38.html | title=Edwin Abbey by Thomas Brock on The Victorian Web website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin also left bequests of his works to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and to the [[National Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1922&quot;/&gt;

Abbey is buried in the churchyard of [[Old St Andrew's Church, Kingsbury|Old St Andrew's Church]] in [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]], London. His grave is [[Grade II listed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1267873|desc= Tombstone to Edwin Austin Abbey in St Andrews Old Churchyard, Wembley|accessdate= 18 February 2016|mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
