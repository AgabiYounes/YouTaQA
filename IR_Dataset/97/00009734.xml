&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The American Prisoner (film)|adapted into a film by the same name]] in 1929.  The story concerns an English woman who lives at [[Fox Tor]] farm, and an American captured during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and held at the prison at [[Princetown, England|Princetown]] on [[Dartmoor]].

The heroine's father, Maurice Malherb, is based on Thomas Windeatt.

In the novel ''Malherb'' is a miscreant who destroys [[Childes Tomb|Childe's tomb]] and beats his servant.  He is depicted as a victim of his own bad temper rather than a sadist.

Malherb is introduced as the younger son of a noble family and he builds the Fox Tor house to be the impressive gentleman's residence suggested by [[William Crossing]] rather than the humble cottage which it actually is.
