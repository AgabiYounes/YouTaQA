An '''exoplanet''' or '''extrasolar planet''' is a [[planet]] outside the [[Solar System]]. The first possible evidence of an exoplanet was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20171101&quot; /&gt; The first confirmation of detection occurred in 1992. This was followed by the confirmation of a different planet, originally detected in 1988. {{Extrasolar planet counts|full}}

There are many [[methods of detecting exoplanets]]. [[Transit (astronomy)|Transit photometry]] and [[Doppler spectroscopy]] have found the most, but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star; thus, 85% of the exoplanets detected are inside the [[tidal locking]] zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=F.

The discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's [[habitable zone]], where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for [[life]] on Earth, to exist on the surface. The study of [[planetary habitability]] also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20150106-DB&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=As Ranks of Goldilocks Planets Grow, Astronomers Consider What's Next |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/science/space/as-ranks-of-goldilocks-planets-grow-astronomers-consider-whats-next.html |date=6 January 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;section begin=nomenclature /&gt;{{Main|Exoplanet naming convention}}
The convention for designating exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU). For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the IAU designation is formed by taking the designated or proper name of its parent star, and adding a lower case letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_exoplanets/|title=International Astronomical Union {{!}} IAU|website=www.iau.org|access-date=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letters are given in order of each planet's discovery around the parent star, so that the first planet discovered in a system is designated &quot;b&quot; (the parent star is considered to be &quot;a&quot;) and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of [[circumbinary planet]]s. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.&lt;section end=nomenclature /&gt;

== History of detection ==
For centuries scientists, philosophers, and science fiction writers suspected that extrasolar planets existed, but there was no way of knowing whether they existed, how common they were, or how similar they might be to the planets of the [[Solar System]]. Various detection claims made in the nineteenth century were rejected by astronomers.

The first evidence of a possible exoplanet, orbiting [[Van Maanen 2]], was noted in 1917, but was not recognized as such. The astronomer [[Walter Sydney Adams]], who later became director of the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], produced a spectrum of the star using [[Mount_Wilson_Observatory#60-inch_telescope|Mount Wilson's 60-inch telescope]]. He interpreted the spectrum to be of an [[F-type main-sequence star]], but it is now thought that such a spectrum could be caused by the residue of a nearby exoplanet that had been pulverized into dust by the gravity of the star, the resulting dust then falling onto the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20171101&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |title=Overlooked Treasure: The First Evidence of Exoplanets |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6991 |date=12 November 2017 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=1 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Discoveries of exoplanets#1988.E2.80.931994|first suspected scientific detection]] of an exoplanet occurred in 1988. Shortly afterwards, the first confirmation of detection came in 1992, with the discovery of several terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolszczan&quot; /&gt; The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a [[main-sequence]] star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star [[51 Pegasi]]. Some exoplanets have been [[Direct imaging|imaged directly]] by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the [[transit method]] and the [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial-velocity method]]. In February 2018, researchers using the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], combined with a planet detection technique called [[microlensing]], found evidence of planets in a distant galaxy, stating &quot;Some of these exoplanets are as (relatively) small as the moon, while others are as massive as Jupiter. Unlike Earth, most of the exoplanets are not tightly bound to stars, so they're actually wandering through space or loosely orbiting between stars. We can estimate that the number of planets in this [faraway] galaxy is more than a trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/exoplanets-discovery-milky-way-galaxy-spd/|title=These May Be the First Planets Found Outside Our Galaxy|magazine=National Geographic|date=5 February 2018|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early speculations ===
{{Rquote |right |This space we declare to be infinite... In it are an infinity of worlds of the same kind as our own.|Giordano Bruno (1584)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Infinity and Beyond: A Cultural History of the Infinite |author=Eli Maor |chapter=Chapter 24: The New Cosmology |date=1987 |isbn=978-1-4612-5396-9 |publisher=Birkhäuser |location=Boston, MA |page=198 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v0btBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198|others=Originally in ''De l'infinito universo et mondi'' [''On the Infinite Universe and Worlds''] by Giordano Bruno (1584).}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the sixteenth century, the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], an early supporter of the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun ([[heliocentrism]]), put forward the view that the fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets.

In the eighteenth century, the same possibility was mentioned by [[Isaac Newton]] in the &quot;[[General Scholium]]&quot; that concludes his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. Making a comparison to the Sun's planets, he wrote &quot;And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of ''One''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Newton|first = Isaac|author2 = I.

In 1952, more than 40 years before the first [[hot Jupiter]] was discovered, [[Otto Struve]] wrote that there is no compelling reason why planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the Solar System, and proposed that [[Doppler spectroscopy]] and the [[transit method]] could detect [[super-Jupiter]]s in short orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Proposal for a project of high-precision stellar radial velocity work|last=Struve|first= Otto |journal= The Observatory|volume=72|pages=199–200 |year=1952|bibcode = 1952Obs....72..199S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discredited claims ===
Claims of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest involve the [[binary star]] [[70 Ophiuchi]]. In 1855 [[William Stephen Jacob]] at the [[East India Company]]'s [[Madras Observatory]] reported that orbital anomalies made it &quot;highly probable&quot; that there was a &quot;planetary body&quot; in this system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacob, W.

J. See]] of the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[United States Naval Observatory]] stated that the orbital anomalies proved the existence of a dark body in the 70&amp;nbsp;Ophiuchi system with a 36-year [[orbital period|period]] around one of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=See |first=T.

As of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}, a total of {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} confirmed exoplanets are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, including a few that were confirmations of controversial claims from the late 1980s.{{Extrasolar planet counts|ref}}  The first published discovery to receive subsequent confirmation was made in 1988 by the Canadian astronomers Bruce Campbell, G. A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the [[University of Victoria]] and the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = B. | last2 = Walker | first2 = G.

Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been [[brown dwarf]]s, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lawton |first1=A.

On 9 January 1992, radio astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR B1257+12|PSR 1257+12]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolszczan&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolszczan | first1 = A. |bibcode=1992Natur.355..145W| last2 = Frail | first2 = D.

Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://tech.mit.edu/V114/N22/psr.22w.html | title=Scientists Uncover Evidence of New Planets Orbiting Star | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] via [[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech Online]] | first=Robert | last=Holtz | date=22 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the [[supernova]] that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the [[Chthonian planet|remaining rocky cores]] of [[gas giant]]s that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.

On 6 October 1995, [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the first definitive detection of [[51 Pegasi b|an exoplanet]] orbiting a [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star, nearby [[G-type star]] [[51 Pegasi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayor&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/378355a0| title = A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star| journal = Nature| volume = 378| issue = 6555| pages = 355–359| year = 1995| last1 = Mayor | first1 = M. | last2 = Queloz | first2 = D. | bibcode = 1995Natur.378..355M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gibn&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibney|first1=Elizabeth|title=In search of sister earths|journal=Nature|date=18 December 2013|volume=504|issue=7480|pages=357–65|doi=10.1038/504357a|pmid=24352276|bibcode = 2013Natur.504..357. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery, made at the [[Observatoire de Haute-Provence]], ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery, and was recognized by a share of the 2019 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution [[spectroscopy]], led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets: astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their [[gravity|gravitational]] influence on the motion of their host stars. More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet transited in front of it.

Initially, most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars. Astronomers were surprised by these &quot;[[hot Jupiter]]s&quot;, because theories of [[Nebular hypothesis#Formation of planets|planetary formation]] had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars. But eventually more planets of other sorts were found, and it is now clear that hot Jupiters make up the minority of exoplanets. In 1999, [[Upsilon Andromedae]] became the first main-sequence star known to have multiple planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lissauer_multiple99&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/19409| year = 1999| last1 = Lissauer | first1 = J.

The apparent brightness ([[apparent magnitude]]) of a planet depends on how far away the observer is, how reflective the planet is (albedo), and how much light the planet receives from its star, which depends on how far the planet is from the star and how bright the star is. So, a planet with a low albedo that is close to its star can appear brighter than a planet with high albedo that is far from the star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phl.upr.edu/library/notes/theapparentbrightnessandsizeofexoplanetsandtheirstars The Apparent Brightness and Size of Exoplanets and their Stars], Abel Mendez, updated 30 June 2012, 12:10&amp;nbsp;pm&lt;/ref&gt;

The darkest known planet in terms of [[geometric albedo]] is [[TrES-2b]], a [[hot Jupiter]] that reflects less than 1% of the light from its star, making it less reflective than coal or black acrylic paint.

For [[gas giant]]s, geometric albedo generally decreases with increasing metallicity or atmospheric temperature unless there are clouds to modify this effect. Increased cloud-column depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths, but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths. Optical albedo increases with age, because older planets have higher cloud-column depths. Optical albedo decreases with increasing mass, because higher-mass giant planets have higher surface gravities, which produces lower cloud-column depths. Also, elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition, which can have a significant effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfirstreturn&quot;&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1412.6097|last1=Burrows|first1=Adam|title=Scientific Return of Coronagraphic Exoplanet Imaging and Spectroscopy Using WFIRST|class=astro-ph.EP|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared wavelengths for massive and/or young gas giants. So, although optical brightness is fully [[Planetary phase|phase]]-dependent, this is not always the case in the near infrared.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfirstreturn&quot; /&gt;

Temperatures of gas giants reduce over time and with distance from their star. Lowering the temperature increases optical albedo even without clouds. At a sufficiently low temperature, water clouds form, which further increase optical albedo. At even lower temperatures ammonia clouds form, resulting in the highest albedos at most optical and near-infrared wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;wfirstreturn&quot; /&gt;

In 2014, a magnetic field around [[HD 209458 b]] was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/27828-alien-planet-magnetic-field-strength.html Unlocking the Secrets of an Alien World's Magnetic Field], Space.com, by Charles Q.

Earth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but in massive super-Earths with high pressure, different compounds may form which do not match those created under terrestrial conditions. Compounds may form with greater viscosities and high melting temperatures which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Forms of magnesium oxide such as MgSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; could be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kean&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kean|first1=Sam|title=Forbidden plants, forbidden chemistry|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|page=5|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/forbidden-planet-forbidden-chemistry|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/18604-super-earth-planets-liquid-metal.html Super-Earths Get Magnetic 'Shield' from Liquid Metal], Charles Q.

[[Hot Jupiter]]s have been observed to have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between the [[stellar wind]] and the planet's magnetosphere creating an [[Joule heating|electric current through the planet that heats]] it up causing it to expand. The more magnetically active a star is the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/765/2/L25| title = Stellar Magnetic Fields As a Heating Source for Extrasolar Giant Planets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 765| issue = 2| pages = L25| year = 2013| last1 = Buzasi | first1 = D.|arxiv = 1302.1466 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...765L..25B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, scientists announced the transformation of gaseous [[deuterium]] into a [[Metallic hydrogen|liquid metallic form]]. This may help researchers better understand [[Gas giant|giant gas planets]], such as [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] and related exoplanets, since such planets are thought to contain a lot of liquid metallic hydrogen, which may be responsible for their observed powerful [[magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20180816&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Settling Arguments About Hydrogen With 168 Giant Lasers – Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said they were &quot;converging on the truth&quot; in an experiment to understand hydrogen in its liquid metallic state. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/science/metallic-hydrogen-lasers.html |date=16 August 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=18 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCI-20180816&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Staff |title=Under pressure, hydrogen offers a reflection of giant planet interiors – Hydrogen is the most-abundant element in the universe and the simplest, but that simplicity is deceptive |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180816143205.htm |date=16 August 2018 |journal=[[Science Daily]] |accessdate=18 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scientists previously announced that the magnetic fields of close-in exoplanets may cause increased [[stellar flare]]s and starspots on their host stars, in 2019 this claim was demonstrated to be false in the [[HD 189733]] system.  The failure to detect &quot;star-planet interactions&quot; in the well-studied HD 189733 system calls other related claims of the effect into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Route|first1=Matthew|title=The Rise of ROME.

In 2019 the strength of the surface magnetic fields of 4 [[hot Jupiter]]s were estimated and ranged between 20 and 120 [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] compared to Jupiter's surface magnetic field of 4.3 gauss.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/hot-jupiter-magnetic-fields-measured-for-first-time.html Magnetic Fields of 'Hot Jupiter' Exoplanets Are Much Stronger Than We Thought], July 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09068 Magnetic field strengths of hot Jupiters from signals of star-planet interactions], P.

=== Plate tectonics ===

In 2007, two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] on larger [[super-Earth]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2009.07.015|title=Convection scaling and subduction on Earth and super-Earths|date=2009|last1=Valencia|first1=Diana|last2=O'Connell|first2=Richard J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=286|issue=3–4|pages=492–502|bibcode = 2009E&amp;PSL.286..492V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2011.07.029|title=Plate tectonics on super-Earths: Equally or more likely than on Earth|date=2011|last1=Van Heck|first1=H.J.|last2=Tackley|first2=P.J.|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=310|issue=3–4|pages=252–261|bibcode = 2011E&amp;PSL.310..252V }}&lt;/ref&gt; with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2007GL030598 |title=Geological consequences of super-sized Earths|date=2007 |last1=O'Neill |first1=C. |last2=Lenardic |first2=A. |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=34|issue=19|pages=L19204 |bibcode = 2007GeoRL..3419204O |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8340e771fd2b397ac2efc272765887a84315eb6b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-Earths even if the planet is dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Diana |last1=Valencia |first2=Richard J.|last2=O'Connell |first3=Dimitar D |last3=Sasselov |date=November 2007 |title=Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths|journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=670 |issue=1 |pages=L45–L48 |doi=10.1086/524012 |arxiv=0710.0699|ref=CITEREFValenciaO'ConnellSasselov2007 |bibcode=2007ApJ...670L..45V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If super-Earths have more than 80 times as much water as Earth then they become [[ocean planet]]s with all land completely submerged. However, if there is less water than this limit, then the deep water cycle will move enough water between the oceans and mantle to allow continents to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astrobiology.com/2014/01/super-earths-likely-to-have-both-oceans-and-continents.html Super Earths Likely To Have Both Oceans and Continents], astrobiology.com. 7 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/781/1/27| title = Water Cycling Between Ocean and Mantle: Super-Earths Need Not Be Waterworlds| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 781| issue = 1| page = 27| year = 2014| last1 = Cowan | first1 = N.

=== Volcanism ===
Large surface temperature variations on [[55 Cancri e]] have been attributed to possible volcanic activity releasing large clouds of dust which blanket the planet and block thermal emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150506-volcano-planet-space-cancri-astronomy/|title=Astronomers May Have Found Volcanoes 40 Light-Years From Earth|author=Michael D.

=== Rings ===
The star [[1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6]] is orbited by an object that is circled by a [[ring system]] much larger than [[Saturn's rings]]. However, the mass of the object is not known; it could be a brown dwarf or low-mass star instead of a planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Scientists_Discover_a_Saturn_like_Ring_System_Eclipsing_a_Sun_like_Star_999.html Scientists Discover a Saturn-like Ring System Eclipsing a Sun-like Star], Space Daily, 13 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-6256/143/3/72| title = Planetary Construction Zones in Occultation: Discovery of an Extrasolar Ring System Transiting a Young Sun-Like Star and Future Prospects for Detecting Eclipses by Circumsecondary and Circumplanetary Disks| journal = The Astronomical Journal| volume = 143| issue = 3| page = 72| year = 2012| last1 = Mamajek | first1 = E.

The brightness of optical images of [[Fomalhaut b]] could be due to starlight reflecting off a circumplanetary ring system with a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius, about the size of the orbits of the [[Galilean moon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kalas2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1166609| title = Optical Images of an Exosolar Planet 25 Light-Years from Earth| journal = Science| volume = 322| issue = 5906| pages = 1345–8| year = 2008| last1 = Kalas | first1 = P.| last2 = Graham | first2 = J.

The rings of the Solar System's gas giants are aligned with their planet's equator. However, for exoplanets that orbit close to their star, tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet's orbital plane around the star. A planet's innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet's equator so that if the planet has a [[axial tilt|tilted rotational axis]], then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1104.3863|bibcode = 2011ApJ...734..117S |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/734/2/117 | volume=734 |issue = 2 |title=Warm Saturns: On the Nature of Rings around Extrasolar Planets That Reside inside the Ice Line |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=117|year = 2011 |last1 = Schlichting |first1 = Hilke E. |last2 = Chang |first2 = Philip }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moons ===

In December 2013 a candidate [[exomoon]] of a [[rogue planet]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/785/2/155|arxiv=1312.3951| title = MOA-2011-BLG-262Lb: A sub-Earth-mass moon orbiting a gas giant or a high-velocity planetary system in the galactic bulge| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 785| issue = 2| page = 155| year = 2014| last1 = Bennett | first1 = D.

=== Atmospheres ===
{{main|Exoplanet atmosphere}}
[[File:Cloudy versus clear atmospheres on two exoplanets.jpg|thumb|Clear versus cloudy atmospheres on two exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloudy versus clear atmospheres on two exoplanets|url=https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1722a/|website=www.spacetelescope.org|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Atmospheres have been detected around several exoplanets. The first to be observed was [[HD 209458 b]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charbonneau|first=David|display-authors=etal|year=2002|title=Detection of an Extrasolar Planet Atmosphere|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=568|issue=1|pages=377–384|arxiv=astro-ph/0111544|bibcode=2002ApJ...568..377C|doi=10.1086/338770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, glints of light from [[Earth]], seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20170519&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GRL-201760515&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point|date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202|bibcode = 2017GeoRL..44.5197M |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology used to determine this may be useful in studying the atmospheres of distant worlds, including those of exoplanets.

==== Comet-like tails ====
[[KIC 12557548 b]] is a small rocky planet, very close to its star, that is evaporating and leaving a trailing tail of cloud and dust like a [[comet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2012-08-evaporating-exoplanet.html Evaporating exoplanet stirs up dust]. Phys.org. 28 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The dust could be ash erupting from volcanos and escaping due to the small planet's low surface-gravity, or it could be from metals that are vaporized by the high temperatures of being so close to the star with the metal vapor then condensing into dust.&lt;ref&gt;Woollacott, Emma (18 May 2012) [http://www.tgdaily.com/space-features/63469-new-found-exoplanet-is-evaporating-away New-found exoplanet is evaporating away]. ''TG Daily''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, scientists reported that the atmosphere of [[GJ 436 b]] was evaporating, resulting in a giant cloud around the planet and, due to radiation from the host star, a long trailing tail {{convert|9|e6mi|e6km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20150625&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhanoo |first=Sindya N. |title=A Planet with a Tail Nine Million Miles Long |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/summer-of-science-2015/latest/exoplanet-tail |date=25 June 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Insolation pattern ===
[[Tidally locked]] planets in a 1:1 [[spin–orbit resonance]] would have their star always shining directly overhead on one spot which would be hot with the opposite hemisphere receiving no light and being freezing cold. Such a planet could resemble an eyeball with the hotspot being the pupil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautil.us/blog/forget-earth_likewell-first-find-aliens-on-eyeball-planets Forget &quot;Earth-Like&quot;—We'll First Find Aliens on Eyeball Planets], Nautilus, Posted by Sean Raymond on 20 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Planets with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric orbit]] could be locked in other resonances. 3:2 and 5:2 resonances would result in a double-eyeball pattern with hotspots in both eastern and western hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.12.017|bibcode = 2015Icar..250..395D | volume=250 | title=Insolation patterns on eccentric exoplanets |journal=Icarus |pages=395–399|year = 2015 |last1 = Dobrovolskis |first1 = Anthony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Planets with both an eccentric orbit and a [[axial tilt|tilted axis of rotation]] would have more complicated insolation patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2013.06.026|bibcode = 2013Icar..226..760D | volume=226 |issue = 1 | title=Insolation on exoplanets with eccentricity and obliquity|journal=Icarus |pages=760–776|year = 2013 |last1 = Dobrovolskis |first1 = Anthony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habitability ===
{{see also|Astrobiology|Circumstellar habitable zone|Planetary habitability}}
As more planets are discovered, the field of [[exoplanetology]] continues to grow into a deeper study of extrasolar worlds, and will ultimately tackle the prospect of [[Astrobiology|life on planets]] beyond the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollivier2014&quot;/&gt; At cosmic distances, [[life]] can only be detected if it is developed at a planetary scale and strongly modified the planetary environment, in such a way that the modifications cannot be explained by classical physico-chemical processes (out of equilibrium processes).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollivier2014&quot;/&gt; For example, molecular [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) in the [[atmosphere of Earth]] is a result of [[photosynthesis]] by living plants and many kinds of microorganisms, so it can be used as an [[Biomarker|indication of life]] on exoplanets, although small amounts of oxygen could also be produced by non-biological means.&lt;ref name='NAOJ2014'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astrobiology.com/2015/09/oxygen-is-not-definitive-evidence-of-life-on-extrasolar-planets.html |title=Oxygen Is Not Definitive Evidence of Life on Extrasolar Planets |work=NAOJ|publisher=Astrobiology Web |date=10 September 2015 |accessdate=11 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a potentially habitable planet must orbit a stable [[star]] at a distance within which [[planetary-mass object]]s with sufficient [[atmospheric pressure]] can support [[liquid water]] at their surfaces.&lt;ref name=kopparapu-2013&gt;{{cite journal  |title=A revised estimate of the occurrence rate of terrestrial planets in the habitable zones around kepler m-dwarfs |author=Kopparapu, Ravi Kumar |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=2013 |volume=767 |issue=1 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/767/1/L8 |arxiv=1303.2649 |pages=L8|bibcode = 2013ApJ...767L...8K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCI-20130503&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cruz |first1=Maria |last2=Coontz |first2=Robert |title=Exoplanets - Introduction to Special Issue |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=340 |page=565|doi=10.1126/science.340.6132.565 |pmid=23641107 |issue=6132 |date=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
