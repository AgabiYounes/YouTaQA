'''Equuleus''' {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|k|w|uː|l|i|ə|s}} is a [[constellation]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;little horse&quot;, a [[foal]]. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after [[Crux]]), spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the [[apparent magnitude|fourth magnitude]].

===Stars===
{{see|List of stars in Equuleus}}
The brightest star in Equuleus is [[Alpha Equulei]], traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3.9, 186 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means &quot;the section of the horse&quot;.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}}

There are few [[variable star]]s in Equuleus.  Only around 25 are known, most of which are faint. [[Gamma Equulei]] is an [[alpha CVn star]], ranging between magnitudes 4.58 and 4.77 over a period of around 12½ minutes.&lt;!-- not cited to Ridpath and Tirion 2001 --&gt; It is a white star 115 light-years from Earth, and has an [[optical binary|optical companion]] of magnitude 6.1, [[6 Equulei]]. It is divisible in binoculars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}} [[R Equulei]] is a [[Mira variable]] that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 15.7 over nearly 261 days.

Equuleus contains some [[double star]]s of interest.  γ Equ consists of a primary star with a magnitude around 4.7 (slightly variable) and a secondary star of magnitude 11.6, separated by 2 [[arcsecond]]s.  [[Epsilon Equulei]] is a triple star also designated 1 Equulei. The system, 197 light-years away, has a primary of magnitude 5.4 that is itself a binary star; its components are of magnitude 6.0 and 6.3 and have a period of 101 years. The secondary is of magnitude 7.4 and is visible in small telescopes. The components of the primary are becoming closer together and will not be divisible in amateur telescopes beginning in 2015.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}} [[Delta Equulei|δ Equ]] is a [[binary star]] with an orbital period of 5.7 years, which at one time was the shortest known orbital period for an optical binary.  The two components of the system are never more than 0.35 arcseconds apart.

===Deep-sky objects===
Due to its small size and its distance from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Equuleus contains no notable deep sky objects. Some very faint [[galaxy|galaxies]] between magnitudes 13 and 15 include [[NGC 7015]], [[NGC 7040]], [[NGC 7045]] and [[NGC 7046]].

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Pegasus and Equuleus (best currently available version - 2014).jpg|thumb|Seen in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
In [[Greek mythology]], one myth associates Equuleus with the foal Celeris (meaning &quot;swiftness&quot; or &quot;speed&quot;), who was the offspring or brother of the winged horse [[Pegasus]]. Celeris was given to [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]] by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. Other myths say that Equuleus is the horse struck from [[Poseidon]]'s trident, during the contest between him and [[Athena]] when deciding which would be the superior. Because this section of stars rises before [[Pegasus]], it is often called Equus Primus, or the First Horse. Equuleus is also linked to the story of [[Philyra (mythology)|Philyra]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Created by [[Hipparchus]] and included by [[Ptolemy]], it abuts Pegasus; unlike the larger horse it is depicted as a horse's head alone.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=144-145}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars that correspond to Equuleus are located within the [[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise of the North]] (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|zh}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0605/ap060515.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 5 月 15 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Equuleus is briefly mentioned in the ''[[Martha Speaks (TV series)|Martha Speaks]]'' episode &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; as one of Helen Lorraine's favorite constellations.
