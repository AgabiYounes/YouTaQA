The '''biosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] βίος ''bíos'' &quot;life&quot; and σφαῖρα ''sphaira'' &quot;sphere&quot;), also known as the '''ecosphere''' (from Greek οἶκος ''oîkos'' &quot;environment&quot; and σφαῖρα), is the worldwide sum of all [[ecosystem]]s. It can also be termed the zone of [[life]] on [[Earth]], a closed system (apart from [[Sun|solar]] and [[cosmic radiation]] and [[heat]] from the interior 
of the Earth), and largely self-regulating.&lt;ref name = &quot;ColumbiaEncyc&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the most general [[Geophysiology|biophysiological]] definition, the biosphere is the global [[ecology|ecological]] system integrating all [[living beings]] and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]], [[geosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The biosphere is postulated to have [[evolution|evolved]], beginning with a process of [[origin of life|biopoiesis]] (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or [[biogenesis]] (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. | author2 = Brad Williamson | author3 = Robin J.

== Origin and use of the term ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Oceanography]] ---&gt;
[[Image:90 mile beach.jpg|thumb|A [[beach]] scene on Earth, simultaneously showing the lithosphere (ground), hydrosphere (ocean) and atmosphere (air)]]
The term &quot;biosphere&quot; was coined by geologist [[Eduard Suess]] in 1875, which he defined as the place on Earth's surface where life dwells.&lt;ref&gt;Suess, E. (1875) ''Die Entstehung Der Alpen'' [''The Origin of the Alps'']. Vienna: W. Braunmuller.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the concept has a geological origin, it is an indication of the effect of both [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Matthew F. Maury]] on the [[Earth sciences]]. The biosphere's ecological context comes from the 1920s (see [[Vladimir I. Vernadsky]]), preceding the 1935 introduction of the term &quot;[[ecosystem]]&quot; by Sir [[Arthur Tansley]] (see [[Ecology (history)|ecology history]]). Vernadsky defined [[ecology]] as the science of the biosphere. It is an [[interdisciplinary]] concept for integrating [[astronomy]], [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[biogeography]], [[evolution]], [[geology]], [[geochemistry]], [[hydrology]] and, generally speaking, all life and Earth sciences.

=== Narrow definition ===
Geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms (the &quot;[[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]&quot; or &quot;[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]&quot; as referred to by biologists and ecologists). In this sense, the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model, the other three being ''[[geosphere]]'', ''[[hydrosphere]]'', and ''[[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]''. When these four component spheres are combined into one system, it is known as the [[Ecosphere (planetary)|Ecosphere]]. This term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Möller |first=Detlev|date=December 2010|title=Chemistry of the Climate System|publisher=De Gruyter |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-3-11-022835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second International Conference on Closed Life Systems defined ''biospherics'' as the science and technology of analogs and [[model (abstract)|models]] of [[Earth]]'s biosphere; i.e., artificial Earth-like biospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bebarta |first=Kailash Chandra|date=2011|title=Dictionary of Forestry and Wildlife Science|publisher=Concept Publishing Company |location = New Delhi| page=45 |isbn=978-81-8069-719-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may include the creation of artificial non-Earth biospheres—for example, human-centered biospheres or a native [[Mars|Martian]] biosphere—as part of the topic of biospherics.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Every part of the planet, from the [[polar region|polar]] ice caps to the [[equator]], features life of some kind. Recent advances in [[microbiology]] have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the Earth's terrestrial surface, and that the total mass of [[microbial]] life in so-called &quot;uninhabitable zones&quot; may, in [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], exceed all animal and plant life on the surface. The actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure. Birds typically fly at altitudes as high as {{convert|1,800|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} and fish live as much as {{convert|8,372|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} underwater in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2006&quot; /&gt;

There are more extreme examples for life on the planet: [[Rüppell's vulture]] has been found at [[altitude]]s of {{convert|11,300|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}; [[bar-headed goose|bar-headed geese]] migrate at altitudes of at least {{convert|8,300|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}; [[yak]]s live at elevations as high as {{convert|5,400|m|ft mi|abbr=on}} above sea level; [[mountain goat]]s live up to {{convert|3,050|m|ft mi|abbr=on}}. Herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens, grasses, and herbs.

Life forms live in every part of the Earth's biosphere, including [[soil]], [[hot spring]]s, [[endolith|inside rocks]] at least {{convert|12|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} deep underground, the deepest parts of the ocean, and at least {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} high in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD-19980625-UG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Georgia |title=First-Ever Scientific Estimate Of Total Bacteria On Earth Shows Far Greater Numbers Than Ever Known Before |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/08/980825080732.htm |date=25 August 1998 |work=[[Science Daily]] |accessdate=10 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110162101/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/08/980825080732.htm |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABM-20150112&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hadhazy |first=Adam |title=Life Might Thrive a Dozen Miles Beneath Earth's Surface |url=http://www.astrobio.net/extreme-life/life-might-thrive-dozen-miles-beneath-earths-surface/ |date=12 January 2015 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312065614/http://www.astrobio.net/extreme-life/life-might-thrive-dozen-miles-beneath-earths-surface/ |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-20151124&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Fox-Skelly |first=Jasmin |title=The Strange Beasts That Live In Solid Rock Deep Underground |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151124-meet-the-strange-creatures-that-live-in-solid-rock-deep-underground |date=24 November 2015 |work=[[BBC online]] |accessdate=11 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125013248/http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151124-meet-the-strange-creatures-that-live-in-solid-rock-deep-underground |archive-date=25 November 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microorganism]]s, under certain test conditions, have been observed to [[Panspermia#Research in outer space|survive the vacuum of outer space]].&lt;ref name=Dose&gt;{{cite journal |title=ERA-experiment &quot;space biochemistry&quot; |journal=Advances in Space Research |first1=K.

Our biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by fairly similar [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]]. On land, biomes are separated primarily by [[latitude]]. Terrestrial biomes lying within the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle]]s are relatively barren of [[plant]] and [[animal]] life, while most of the more populous biomes lie near the [[equator]]. &lt;!---Terrestrial organisms in temperate and Arctic biomes have relatively small amounts of total biomass, smaller energy requirements, and display prominent adaptations to cold, including world-spanning migrations, social adaptations, [[homeothermy]], [[estivation]] and multiple layers of insulation.---&gt;

[[File:Biosphere 2 4888964549.jpg|thumb|Biosphere 2 4888964549|Biosphere 2 in Arizona.]]
Experimental biospheres, also called [[closed ecological system]]s, have been created to study ecosystems and the potential for supporting life outside the Earth. These include spacecraft and the following terrestrial laboratories:
* [[Biosphere 2]] in [[Arizona]], United States, 3.15 acres (13,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
* BIOS-1, BIOS-2 and [[BIOS-3]] at the Institute of Biophysics in [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Siberia]], in what was then the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=BioScience | date=Oct 1997 | volume=47 |issue=9 | pages=575–85 | title= Bios-3: Siberian experiments in bioregenerative life support | author=Salisbury FB | author2=Gitelson JI | author3=Lisovsky GM | doi=10.2307/1313164 | pmid=11540303| jstor=1313164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial biospheres==
No biospheres have been detected beyond the Earth; therefore, the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical. The [[rare Earth hypothesis]] suggests they should be very rare, save ones composed of [[microbe|microbial]] life only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Peter D.|last2=Brownlee|first2=Donald|title=Rare earth: why complex life is uncommon in the universe|date=2004|publisher=Copernicus|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-95289-5|edition=2nd rev.|title-link=Rare Earth (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Earth analog]]s may be quite numerous, at least in the [[Milky Way galaxy]], given the large number of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choi|first1=Charles Q.|title=New Estimate for Alien Earths: 2 Billion in Our Galaxy Alone|url=https://www.space.com/11188-alien-earths-planets-sun-stars.html|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=Space.com|date=21 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824002233/https://www.space.com/11188-alien-earths-planets-sun-stars.html|archive-date=24 August 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the planets discovered orbiting [[TRAPPIST-1]] could possibly contain biospheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rees|first1=Sir Martin|title=These new worlds are just the start. There are many more life-supporting planets out there waiting to be discovered|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/02/22/many-life-supporting-planets-soon-will-see-clearly/|accessdate=25 September 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=22 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925175603/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/02/22/many-life-supporting-planets-soon-will-see-clearly/|archive-date=25 September 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given limited understanding of [[abiogenesis]], it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres.

Based on observations by the [[Kepler Space Telescope]] team, it has been calculated that provided the probability of abiogenesis is higher than 1 to 1000, the closest alien biosphere should be within 100 light-years from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Amri Wandel, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269116658_On_the_abundance_of_extraterrestrial_life_after_the_Kepler_mission On the abundance of extraterrestrial life after the Kepler mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817225423/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269116658_On_the_abundance_of_extraterrestrial_life_after_the_Kepler_mission |date=2018-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created in the future, for example on [[Terraforming of Mars|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Robert Zubrin ; With Richard Wagner ; Foreword by Arthur C|title=The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must|date=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1451608113|edition=Rev., Updated|title-link=The Case for Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt;
