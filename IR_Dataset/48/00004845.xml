'''Blood alcohol content''' ('''BAC''') is a measurement of [[alcohol intoxication]] used for legal or medical purposes.&lt;ref name=Med2019/&gt; A BAC of 0.10 (0.10% or one tenth of one percent) means that there are 0.10 g of alcohol for every 100 ml of blood which is the same as 21.7 mmol/l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCune |first1=Anne |title=ABC of Alcohol |date=2015 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-54396-2 |page=14 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/ABC_of_Alcohol/G_TqCAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=l&amp;pg=PA14 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BAC of 0.0 is [[sobriety|sober]], while in the United States 0.08 is legally intoxicated, and above that is very impaired.&lt;ref name=Med2019/&gt; BAC levels above 0.40 are potentially fatal.&lt;ref name=Med2019&gt;{{cite web |title=Blood Alcohol Level: MedlinePlus Lab Test Information |url=https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/blood-alcohol-level/ |website=medlineplus.gov |accessdate=25 December 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimation by intake ==
{{Further|Standard drink}}
To calculate estimated peak blood alcohol concentration (EBAC), a variation, including drinking period in hours, of the Widmark formula was used. The formula is:&lt;ref name=PMC2724514 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;EBAC =    \left(\frac {0.806 \times SD \times 1.2}{BW \times Wt} - MR \times DP\right) \times  10  &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* 0.806 is a constant for body water in the blood (mean 80.6%),
* SD is the number of [[standard drink]]s, that being 10 grams of ethanol each,
* 1.2 is a factor to convert the amount in grams to Swedish standards set by The Swedish National Institute of Public Health,
* BW is a body water constant (0.58 for males and 0.49 for females),
* Wt is body weight (kilogram),
* MR is the metabolism constant (0.015 for males and 0.017 for females) and
* DP is the drinking period in hours.&lt;ref name=PMC2724514&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-9-229 |title=Alcohol use among university students in Sweden measured by an electronic screening instrument |year=2009 |last1=Andersson |first1=Agneta |last2=Wiréhn |first2=Ann-Britt |last3=Ölvander |first3=Christina |last4=Ekman |first4=Diana |last5=Bendtsen |first5=Preben |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=9 |pages=229 |pmid=19594906 |pmc=2724514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10 converts the result to permillage of alcohol

Regarding metabolism (MR) in the formula; females demonstrated a higher average rate of elimination (mean, 0.017; range, 0.014–0.021 g/210 L) than males (mean, 0.015; range, 0.013–0.017 g/210 L). Female subjects on average had a higher percentage of body fat (mean, 26.0; range, 16.7–36.8%) than males (mean, 18.0; range, 10.2–25.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=J. M. |last2=Weathermon |first2=A. |last3=McCutcheon |first3=J. R. |last4=Oliver |first4=R. D. |title=Determination of Volume of Distribution for Ethanol in Male and Female Subjects |journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology |date=1 September 1996 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=287–290 |doi=10.1093/jat/20.5.287 |pmid=8872236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, men are, on average, heavier than women but it is not strictly accurate to say that the water content of a person alone is responsible for the dissolution of alcohol within the body, because alcohol does dissolve in fatty tissue as well. When it does, a certain amount of alcohol is temporarily taken out of the blood and briefly stored in the fat. For this reason, most calculations of alcohol to body mass simply use the weight of the individual, and not specifically his/her water content.  Finally, it is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up [[alcohol intoxication]] by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster.

Examples:
* 80&amp;nbsp;kg male drinking 3 standard drinks in two hours:
:&lt;math&gt; EBAC = (0.806 \cdot 3 \cdot 1.2)/(0.58 \cdot 80) - (0.015 \cdot 2) = 0.032534483 \approx 0.033 g/dL&lt;/math&gt;
* 70&amp;nbsp;kg woman drinking 2.5 standard drinks in two hours:
:&lt;math&gt; EBAC = (0.806 \cdot 2.5 \cdot 1.2)/(0.49 \cdot 70) - (0.017 \cdot 2) = 0.036495627 \approx 0.036 g/dL&lt;/math&gt;

== Binge drinking ==
{{See also|Binge drinking}}
The [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) define the term &quot;[[binge drinking]]&quot; as a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above.  This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;&gt;&quot;Quick Stats: Binge Drinking.&quot; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. April 2008.[https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/quickstats/binge_drinking.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Units of measurement ==
There are several different units in use around the world for defining blood alcohol concentration. Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood (never a volume per volume). 1 milliliter of blood has a mass of approximately 1.06&amp;nbsp;grams. Because of this, units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass. In the U.S. the concentration unit 1% w/v (percent mass/volume, equivalent to 10&amp;nbsp;g/l or 1&amp;nbsp;g per 100&amp;nbsp;ml) is in use. This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath, as with a [[breathalyzer]]. The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1:2100. Therefore, a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10&amp;nbsp;mg/L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001×2100 g/10dL, or 0.021 g/dL of blood alcohol (the units of the BAC in the United States). While a variety of units (or sometimes lack thereof) is used throughout the world, many countries use the g/L unit, which does not create confusion as percentages do. Usual units are highlighted in the table below.

[[File:Map of European countries by maximum blood alcohol level.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Europe showing countries' blood alcohol limits as defined in g/dl for the general population.]]

For purposes of law enforcement, blood alcohol content is used to define intoxication and provides a rough measure of impairment. Although the degree of impairment may vary among individuals with the same blood alcohol content, it can be measured objectively and is therefore legally useful and difficult to contest in court. Most countries disallow operation of motor vehicles and heavy machinery above prescribed levels of blood alcohol content. Operation of boats and aircraft is also regulated.

The alcohol level at which a person is considered legally impaired varies by country. The list below gives limits by country. These are typically blood alcohol content limits for the operation of a vehicle.

It is illegal to have any measurable alcohol in the blood while driving in these countries. Most jurisdictions have a tolerance slightly higher than zero to account for false positives and naturally occurring alcohol in the body. Some of the following jurisdictions have a general [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

== Test assumptions ==
{{More citations needed|date=July 2007}}
Blood alcohol tests assume the individual being tested is average in various ways. For example, on average the ratio of blood alcohol content to breath alcohol content (the ''partition ratio'') is 2100 to 1. In other words, there are 2100 parts of alcohol in the blood for every part in the breath. However, the actual ratio in any given individual can vary from 1300:1 to 3100:1, or even more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Significance of variations in blood: breath partition coefficient of alcohol.| pmc=1689868 | pmid=793681|volume=2| issue=6050 |year=1976|pages=1479–81|vauthors=Alobaidi TA, Hill DW, Payne JP |journal=Br Med J|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6050.1479}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ratio varies not only from person to person, but within one person from moment to moment.  Thus a person with a true blood alcohol level of .08% but a partition ratio of 1700:1 at the time of testing would have a .10 reading on a Breathalyzer calibrated for the average 2100:1 ratio.

===Extrapolation===
Retrograde [[extrapolation]] is the mathematical process by which someone's blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving is estimated by projecting backwards from a later chemical test. This involves estimating the absorption and elimination of alcohol in the interim between driving and testing. The rate of elimination in the average person is commonly estimated at .015 to .020&amp;nbsp;grams per deciliter per hour (g/dl/h),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15287399209531639 |title=Retrograde extrapolation of blood alcohol data: An applied approach |year=1992 |last1=Montgomery |first1=Mark R. |last2=Reasor |first2=Mark J. |journal=Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=281–92 |pmid=1507264}}&lt;/ref&gt; although again this can vary from person to person and in a given person from one moment to another. Metabolism can be affected by numerous factors, including such things as body temperature, the type of alcoholic beverage consumed, and the amount and type of food consumed.

In an increasing number of states, laws have been enacted to facilitate this speculative task: the blood alcohol content at the time of driving is legally presumed to be the same as when later tested.  There are usually time limits put on this presumption, commonly two or three hours, and the defendant is permitted to offer evidence to rebut this presumption.

Forward extrapolation can also be attempted. If the amount of alcohol consumed is known, along with such variables as the weight and sex of the subject and period and rate of consumption, the blood alcohol level can be estimated by extrapolating forward. Although subject to the same infirmities as retrograde extrapolation—guessing based upon averages and unknown variables—this can be relevant in estimating BAC when driving and/or corroborating or contradicting the results of a later chemical test.

==Metabolism==
{{More citations needed|date=May 2007}}
Alcohol is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, but more slowly in the stomach than in the small or large intestine.  For this reason, alcohol consumed with food is absorbed more slowly, because it spends a longer time in the stomach.  Furthermore, [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] is present in the stomach lining.  After absorption, the alcohol passes to the liver through the [[hepatic portal vein]], where it undergoes a first pass of metabolism before entering the general bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of alcoholic beverages : technical, analytical and nutritional aspects|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-97665-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNc34oNpg0AC&amp;pg=PT219|editor=Alan J.Buglass|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is removed from the bloodstream by a combination of [[metabolism]], excretion, and evaporation.

Alcohol is metabolized mainly by the group of six [[enzyme]]s collectively called [[alcohol dehydrogenase]].  These convert the ethanol into [[acetaldehyde]] (an intermediate more toxic than ethanol).  The enzyme [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]] then converts the acetaldehyde into non-toxic acetic acid.

Many physiologically active materials are removed from the bloodstream (whether by [[metabolism]] or excretion) at a rate proportional to the current concentration, so that they exhibit [[exponential decay]] with a characteristic [[half-life#Half-life in biology and pharmacology|halflife]] (see [[pharmacokinetics]]). This is not true for alcohol, however. Typical doses of alcohol actually saturate the enzymes' capacity, so that alcohol is removed from the bloodstream at an approximately constant rate. This rate varies considerably between individuals. Another sex based difference is in the elimination of alcohol. People under 25{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/0-306-47138-8_9 |chapter=Gender Differences in Alcohol Metabolism |title=Recent Developments in Alcoholism |year=2002 |last1=Thomasson |first1=Holly R. |isbn=978-0-306-44921-5 |volume=12 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/recentdevelopment12gala/page/163 163–72] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/recentdevelopment12gala/page/163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or with liver disease may process alcohol more slowly.  False High (BAC) readings are related to patients with proteinuria and hematuria, due to kidney-liver metabolism and failure (for example, Hematuria 1+ protenuria 1+ )

Such persons have impaired [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which causes acetaldehyde levels to peak higher, producing more severe [[hangover]]s and other effects such as flushing and tachycardia.  Conversely, members of certain ethnicities that traditionally did not use alcoholic beverages have lower levels of alcohol dehydrogenases and thus &quot;sober up&quot; very slowly, but reach lower aldehyde concentrations and have milder hangovers.  Rate of detoxification of alcohol can also be slowed by certain drugs which interfere with the action of alcohol dehydrogenases, notably [[aspirin]], [[furfural]] (which may be found in [[fusel alcohol]]), fumes of [[trichloroethylene|certain solvents]], many [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], and some [[pyrazole]] compounds. Also suspected of having this effect are [[cimetidine]], [[ranitidine]], and [[paracetamol|acetaminophen]] (paracetamol).

Currently, the only known substance that can increase the rate of metabolism of alcohol is [[fructose]]. The effect can vary significantly from person to person, but a 100&amp;nbsp;g dose of fructose has been shown to increase alcohol metabolism by an average of 80%. Fructose also increases false positives of high BAC ratio readings in anyone with proteinuria and hematuria, due to kidney-liver metabolism.&lt;ref name=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Fructose &amp; ethanol{{synthesis inline|date=March 2019}}

===Full stomachs===
Alcohol absorption can be slowed by ingesting alcohol on a full stomach.&lt;ref name=ARFs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhs.umn.edu/alcohol-drugs/absorption-rate-factors.htm |title=Absorption Rate Factors |website=BHS.UMN.edu |archive-date=18 January 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118020512/http://www.bhs.umn.edu/alcohol-drugs/absorption-rate-factors.htm |quote=When food is ingested, the pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach will close in order to hold food in the stomach for digestion and thus keep the alcohol from reaching the small intestine. The larger the meal and closer in time to drinking, the lower the peak of alcohol concentration; some studies indicate up to a 20% reduction in peak blood alcohol level.&lt;br&gt;Stress causes the stomach to empty directly into the small intestine, where alcohol is absorbed even faster.&lt;br&gt;Liquor mixed with soda or other bubbly drinks speeds up the passage of alcohol from the stomach to the small intestine, which increases the speed of absorption.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief that the food absorbs the alcohol is a common misconception.  Alcohol absorption is slowed because the stomach [[sphincter]] closes in order to break down the food.  The alcohol cannot be absorbed through the stomach, thus cannot be absorbed until the sphincter is opened and the consumed alcohol can flow to the small intestine.

There have been reported cases of blood alcohol content higher than 1%:

* In 1982, a 24-year-old woman was admitted to the UCLA emergency room with a serum alcohol content of 1.51%, corresponding to a BAC of 1.33%. She was alert and oriented to person and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(82)91285-5 |title=Survival After a Serum Ethanol Concentration of 11/2% |year=1982 |last1=Johnson |first1=R |journal=The Lancet |volume=320 |issue=8312 |pages=1394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serum alcohol concentration is not equal to nor calculated in the same way as blood alcohol content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2002JChEd..79..803L |doi=10.1021/ed079p803 |title=Conversion of Serum-Alcohol Concentrations to Corresponding Blood-Alcohol Concentrations |year=2002 |last1=Labianca |first1=Dominick A. |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=803}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1984, a 30-year-old man survived a blood alcohol concentration of 1.5% after vigorous medical intervention that included [[dialysis]] and [[intravenous therapy]] with [[fructose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinte.1984.00350150255052 |title=Survival After High Blood Alcohol Levels: Association with First-Order Elimination Kinetics |year=1984 |last1=O'Neill |first1=Shane |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=641–2 |pmid=6703836 |last2=Tipton |first2=KF |last3=Prichard |first3=JS |last4=Quinlan |first4=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1995, a man from [[Rzeszów]], Poland, caused a car accident near his hometown. He had a blood alcohol content of 1.48% ; he was tested five times, with each test returning the same reading. He died a few days later of injuries from the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;eOstroleka 2012&quot;/&gt;
* In 2004, an unidentified Taiwanese woman died of alcohol intoxication after immersion for twelve hours in a bathtub filled with 40% ethanol. Her blood alcohol content was 1.35%. It was believed that she had immersed herself as a response to the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.06.014 |title=Fatal alcohol immersion during the SARS epidemic in Taiwan |year=2005 |last1=Wu |first1=Yen-Liang |last2=Guo |first2=How-Ran |last3=Lin |first3=Hung-Jung |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=149 |issue=2–3 |pages=287 |pmid=15749375}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In South Africa, a man driving a [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] light van containing 15 sheep allegedly stolen from nearby farms was arrested on December 22, 2010, near [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]] in [[Eastern Cape]]. His blood had an alcohol content of 1.6%. Also in the vehicle were five boys and a woman, who were also arrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2010/12/24/drunkest-driver-in-sa-arrested Drunkest driver in SA arrested] ''Sowetan''&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 26 October 2012, a man from [[Gmina Olszewo-Borki]], Poland, who died in a car accident, recorded a blood alcohol content of 2.23%; however, the blood sample was collected from a wound and thus possibly contaminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;eOstroleka 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Łuba|first1=Marcin|title=Śmiertelny rekord: Kierowca z powiatu ostrołęckiego miał 22 promile alkoholu!

* On 26 July 2013 a 40-year-old man from [[Alfredówka]], Poland, was found by Municipal Police Patrol from [[Nowa Dęba]] lying in the ditch along the road in Tarnowska Wola. At the hospital, it was recorded that the man had a blood alcohol content of 1.374%.
