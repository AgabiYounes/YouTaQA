A '''bachelor''' is a [[man]] who is not and has never been married.&lt;ref name=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Bachelors are, in [[Richard Pitt|Pitt]] &amp; al.'s phrasing, &quot;men who live independently, outside of their parents' home and other institutional settings, who are neither married nor cohabitating&quot;. ({{citation |last=Pitt |first=Richard |author2-last=Borland |author2-first=Elizabeth |ref={{harvid|Pitt &amp; al.|2008}} |date=2008 |contribution-url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-180029368/bachelorhood-and-men-attitudes.html |contribution=Bachelorhood and Men's Attitudes about Gender Roles |title=The Journal of Men's Studies |volume=Vol.&amp;nbsp;16 |pp=140–158}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is first attested as the 12th-century ''bacheler'', a [[knight bachelor]], a [[knight]] too young or poor to gather vassals under [[knights banneret|his own banner]].&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; The [[Old French]] ''{{lang|fro|bacheler}}'' presumably derives from [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ''{{lang|pro|bacalar}}'' and [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|baccalare}}'',&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; but the ultimate source of the word is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197&quot;&gt;{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bachelor |volume=3 |pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1st ed. &quot;[https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14313 bachelor, ''n.'']&quot; Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[linguistic reconstruction|proposed]] [[Medieval Latin]] *''{{lang|la|baccalaris}}'' (&quot;vassal&quot;, &quot;field hand&quot;) is only attested late enough that it may have derived from the vernacular languages,&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; rather than from the southern French and northern Spanish Latin&lt;ref name=&quot;Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197&quot;/&gt; ''{{lang|la|baccalaria}}''.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{citation |last=Du Cange |first=Charles du Fresne, sieur |author-link=Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange |date=1733 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=no9IWJhHTxIC&amp;pg=PA905 |title=Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis|volume = 1 |language = Latin |pp=906–912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|baculum}}'' (&quot;a stick&quot;), in reference to the wooden sticks used by knights in training.&lt;ref&gt;For further [[etymology|etymological]] discussion, with sources, see [[Uwe Friedrich Schmidt|Schmidt]],({{citation |last=Schmidt |first=Uwe Friedrich |title=Praeromanica der Italoromania auf der Grundlage des LEI (A und B) |series=Europäische Hochschulschriften; Vol.&amp;nbsp;49, No.&amp;nbsp;9 |language=de}}) reprinted by [[Peter Lang (publisher) |Lang]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Schmidt |first=Uwe Friedrich |contribution=Praeromanica der Italoromania auf der Grundlage des LEI (A und B) |title=Italienische Sprache und Literatur |publisher=Peter Lang |date=2009 |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OPrKYUOFvgC&amp;pg=PA117 |pp=117–120 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [[guild]] (otherwise known as &quot;yeomen&quot;) or [[university]] and then for low-level ecclesiastics, as young [[monk]]s and recently appointed [[Canon (priest)|canons]].{{Refn|Severtius, ''De Episcopis Lugdunensibus'', p.&amp;nbsp;377 cited in [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]].&lt;ref name=dc/&gt;}} As an inferior grade of scholarship, it came to refer to one holding a &quot;[[bachelor's degree]]&quot;. This sense of ''{{lang|la|baccalarius}}'' or ''{{lang|la |baccalaureus}}'' is first attested at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]] as applied to scholars still ''{{lang|la|in statu pupillari}}''. There were two classes of ''{{lang|la |baccalarii}}'': the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii cursores}}'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the ''{{lang|la|baccalarii dispositi}}'', who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Bachelor |volume=3 |page=132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Victorian era]], the term [[eligible bachelor]] was used in the context of [[upper class]] [[arranged marriage|matchmaking]], denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered &quot;eligible&quot; in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term &quot;[[confirmed bachelor]]&quot; denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.

By the later 19th century, the term &quot;bachelor&quot; had acquired the general sense of &quot;unmarried man&quot;. The expression [[bachelor party]] is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent &quot;bachelor-girl&quot; was coined, replaced in US English by &quot;[[bachelorette]]&quot; by the mid-1930s. After [[World War II]], this terminology came to be seen as antiquated and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term &quot;[[single person|single]]&quot; (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term &quot;bachelor&quot; remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favor of &quot;single.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=R.I.P Bachelors and Spinsters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605024708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|archive-date=5 June 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, &quot;bachelor&quot; can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725 |title=Hundreds of 'bachelors' crammed in squalid and dilapidated buildings |publisher=GulfNews.com |date=2009-05-03 |accessdate=2015-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103201823/http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725 |archive-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a colloquial term &quot;executive bachelor&quot; is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130125101719/http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor|url-status=dead|title=executive-bachelor - Google Search|date=25 January 2013|archivedate=25 January 2013|website=archive.is}}{{better source|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bachelors have been subject to [[penal law]]s in many countries, most notably in [[Ancient history|Ancient]] [[Sparta]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197&quot;/&gt; At Sparta, men unmarried after a certain age were subject to various penalties ({{lang-grc-gre|ἀτιμία}}, ''atimía''): they were forbidden to watch women's gymnastics; during the winter, they were made to march naked through the [[agora]] singing a song about their dishonor;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197&quot;/&gt; and they were not provided with the traditional respect due to the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Lyc''., 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] laws were similar.&lt;ref&gt;Schomann, ''Gr. Alterth.'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;I, 548.&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelors in Rome fell under the [[Lex Julia]] of 18&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}} and the [[Lex Papia Poppaea]] of {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;9: these lay heavy fines on unmarried or childless people while providing certain privileges to those with several children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197&quot;/&gt; 

In [[UK|Britain]], taxes occasionally fell heavier on bachelors than other persons: examples include 6 &amp; 7 Will. III, the 1785 Tax on Servants, and the 1798 Income Tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baynes 1878, pp. 196–197&quot;/&gt; Over time, some punishments developed into no more than a teasing game. In some parts of [[Germany]], for instance, men who were still unmarried by their 30th birthday were made to sweep the stairs of the [[town hall]] until kissed by a &quot;virgin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/11499529/Bizarre-German-birthday-traditions-explained.html|title=Bizarre German birthday traditions explained|last=Melican|first=Brian|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2015-03-31|access-date=2019-12-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
