'''Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.''' is an American [[video game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] based in [[Irvine, California]], and is a subsidiary of [[Activision Blizzard]]. The company was founded on February 8, 1991, under the name '''Silicon &amp; Synapse, Inc.''' by three graduates of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLAHonorDinner2006_11_06&quot; /&gt; [[Michael Morhaime]], Frank Pearce and Allen Adham. The company originally concentrated on the creation of game [[Porting|ports]] for other studios' games before beginning development of their own software in 1993 with games like ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]''. In 1994, the company became '''Chaos Studios, Inc.''', then Blizzard Entertainment after being acquired by distributor [[Davidson &amp; Associates]].

Shortly thereafter, Blizzard released ''[[Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans]]''. Blizzard created several other video games, including ''[[Warcraft]]'' sequels, the ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' series, the ''[[StarCraft]]'' series, and in 2004, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. Their most recent projects include the first expansion for ''[[Diablo III]]'', ''[[Diablo III: Reaper of Souls|Reaper of Souls]]'', the online [[collectible card game]] ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]],'' the seventh expansion for ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth|Battle for Azeroth]]'', the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] ''[[Heroes of the Storm]],'' the third and final expansion for ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]'', ''[[StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void|Legacy of the Void]]'', and the [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[First-person shooter|first-person]] [[hero shooter]] ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]''.

On July 9, 2008, [[Activision]] merged with [[Vivendi Games]], culminating in the inclusion of the Blizzard brand name in the title of the resulting holding company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Activision_Blizzard_Close_English&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=320652 |title=Vivendi and Activision complete transaction to create Activision Blizzard |date=July 10, 2008 |author=Activision, Inc |accessdate=May 19, 2015 |publisher=Vivendi Universal |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810191741/http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=320652 |archivedate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from majority owner Vivendi.

===Founding (1991-1994)===
[[File:Mike_Morhaime_BlizzCon_2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Blizzard co-founder and former CEO [[Mike Morhaime]]]]
Blizzard Entertainment was founded by [[Michael Morhaime]], Allen Adham, and Frank Pearce as Silicon &amp; Synapse in February 1991, after all three had earned their [[bachelor's degree]]s from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the year prior.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameSpy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLAHonorDinner2006_11_06&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineer.ucla.edu/newsroom/featured-news/archive/2006/november/ucla-engineering-celebrates-accomplishments-at-annual-awards-dinner |title=UCLA Engineering Celebrates Accomplishments at Annual Awards Dinner |publisher=UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science |date=November 6, 2006 |accessdate=September 22, 2007 |author=M.

Ports include titles such as ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (1990 video game)|J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]]'' and ''Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess''.&lt;ref name=&quot;blizz_tline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/timeline.shtml |title=Blizzard Timeline |publisher=Blizzard Entertainment |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215105033/http://www.blizzard.com/blizz-anniversary/timeline.shtml |archivedate=February 15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/blizzard-entertainment-inc/ported-by/list-games/ |title=Ported by Blizzard Entertainment Inc. |publisher=Mobygames |access-date=March 10, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228220612/http://www.mobygames.com/browse/games/blizzard-entertainment-inc/ported-by/list-games/ |archive-date=February 28, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the company developed games such as ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[The Lost Vikings]]'' (published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]]).

Around 1993, co-founder Adham told the other executives that he did not like the name &quot;Silicon &amp; Synapse&quot; anymore, as people outside the company were confusing the meaning of [[silicon|silicon the chemical element]] used in microchips with [[Silicone|silicone the materials used in breast implants]]. By the end of 1993, Adham changed the name to &quot;Chaos Studios&quot;, reflecting on the haphazardness of their development processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer naming&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/how-blizzard-got-its-name/ | title = How Blizzard got its name | first= Tom | last = Marks | date = December 7, 2016 | accessdate = December 11, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1994, they were acquired by distributor [[Davidson &amp; Associates]] for $6.75&amp;nbsp;million (${{Inflation|US|6.75|1994|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).&lt;ref&gt;Dean Takahashi: ''[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-03-13/business/fi-33584_1_video game-development Co-Founder Looks at Chaos in Early Stages and Future Challenges.] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120707041727/http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-03-13/business/fi-33584_1_video |date=July 7, 2012 }}'' In: Los Angeles Times, March 13, 1994. – Interview with Allen Adham.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this point, they were contacted by a Florida company, Chaos Technologies, who wanted the company to pay {{USD|100,000}} to keep the name.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Takahashi: ''[http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-05-24/business/fi-61596_1_chaos-studios Briefcase: Technology.] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120629025604/http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-05-24/business/fi-61596_1_chaos-studios |date=June 29, 2012 }}'' In: Los Angeles Times, May 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Not wanting to pay that sum, the executives decided to change the studio's name to &quot;Orge Studios&quot; by April 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer naming&quot;/&gt; However, Davidson &amp; Associated did not like this name, and forced the company to change it. According to Morhaime, Adham began running through a dictionary from the start, writing down any word that seemed interesting and passing it to the legal department to see if it had any complications. One of the first words they found to be interest and cleared the legal check was &quot;blizzard&quot;, leading them to change their name to &quot;Blizzard Entertainment&quot; by May 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer naming&quot;/&gt; By May, Chaos Studios was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-05-24/business/fi-61596_1_chaos-studios | title = Briefcase: Technology | first=  Dean | last=  Takahashi | date = May 24, 1994 | accessdate = December 11, 2019 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120629025604/http://articles.latimes.com/print/1994-05-24/business/fi-61596_1_chaos-studios | archivedate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit ''[[Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans]]'', a [[real-time strategy game|real-time strategy]] (RTS) game in a high-fantasy setting.

===Acquisition by Vivendi and ''World of Warcraft'' (1995-2007)===
Blizzard has changed hands several times since then. Davidson was acquired along with [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] by a company called [[CUC International]] in 1996. CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called [[HFS Corporation]] to form [[Cendant]] in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger. Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line (which included Blizzard) to French publisher [[Havas]] in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by [[Vivendi]]. Blizzard was part of the [[Vivendi Games]] group of Vivendi. 

{{anchor|Blizzard South}}
In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games of [[San Mateo, California]], which had been working on the [[action role-playing game]] (ARPG) ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed [[Blizzard North]], with Blizzard's main headquarters in Irving renamed to Blizzard South to distinguish the two.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns merge&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/97046/Blizzard_Merges_Blizzard_North_Into_Blizzard_South.php | title = Blizzard Merges Blizzard North Into Blizzard South | first = Nich | last = Maragos | date = August 1, 2005 | accessdate = December 11, 2019 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diablo'' was released at the very start of 1997 alongside [[Battle.net]], a matchmaking service for the game. Blizzard North developed the sequel ''[[Diablo II]]'' (2000), and its expansion pack ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction|Lord of Destruction]]'' (2001). Following these releases, a number of key staff from Blizzard North departed for other opportunities, such as [[Bill Roper (video game producer)|Bill Roper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ns merge&quot;/&gt; Vivendi made the decision in August 2005 to [[Consolidation (business)|consolidate]] Blizzard North into Blizzard South, relocating staff to the main Blizzard offices in Irvine, and subsequently dropping the &quot;Blizzard South&quot; name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ns merge&quot;/&gt;

Following the success of ''Warcraft II'', Blizzard began development on a science-fiction themed RTS ''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'' and released the title in March 1998. The title was the top-selling PC game for the year,&lt;ref name=&quot;1998sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=StarCraft Named No. 1 Seller in 1998 |website=IGN |date=January 20, 1999 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/01/21/starcraft-named-1-seller-in-1998 |accessdate=February 16, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303025909/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/01/21/starcraft-named-1-seller-in-1998 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to further growth of the Battle.net service and the use of the game for [[esport]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;polygon ghost&quot;/&gt; Around 2000, Blizzard engaged with [[Nihilistic Software]] to work on a version of ''StarCraft'' for home consoles for Blizzard. Nihilisitic was co-founded by Robert Huebner, who had worked on ''StarCraft'' and other games while a Blizzard employee before leaving to found the studio. The game, ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]'', was a [[stealth game|stealth-oriented game]] compared to the RTS features of ''StarCraft'', and was a major feature of the 2002 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. However, over the next few years, the game entered [[development hell]] with conflicts between Nihilisitic and Blizzard on its direction. Blizzard ordered Nihilistic to stop work on ''StarCraft: Ghost'' in July 2004, and instead brought on Swingin' Ape Studios, a third-party studio that had just successfully released ''[[Metal Arms: Glitch in the System]]'' in 2003, to reboot the development of ''Ghost''.&lt;ref name=&quot;polygon ghost&quot;/&gt; Blizzard fully acquired Swingin' Ape Studios in May 2005 to continue on ''Ghost''. However, while the game was scheduled to be released in 2005, it was targeted at the consoles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]], such as the [[PlayStation 2]] and original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], while the industry was transitioning to the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation]]. Blizzard decided to cancel ''Ghost'' rather than extend its development period to work on the newer consoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;polygon ghost&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/5/11819438/starcraft-ghost-what-went-wrong | title = StarCraft: Ghost - What Went Wrong | date = July 5, 2016 | accessdate = December 12, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Blizzard was able to reacquire rights for three of its earlier Silicon &amp; Synapse titles, ''[[The Lost Vikings]]'', ''[[Rock n' Roll Racing]]'' and ''[[Blackthorne]]'', from [[Interplay Entertainment]] and re-release them for [[Game Boy Advance]], a handheld console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.blizzard.com/us/insider/011/lostvikings.html |title=The Making of The Lost Vikings |date=November 22, 2002 |accessdate=June 23, 2007 |last=Morhaime |first=Mike |interviewer=Blizzard Insider |work=Blizzard Insider |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211022815/http://www.blizzard.com/insider/011/lostvikings.shtml |archivedate=February 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, Blizzard opened European offices in the Paris suburb of [[Vélizy-Villacoublay|Vélizy]], Yvelines, France. 

Blizzard released ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) based on the ''Warcraft'' franchise, on November 23, 2004 in North America, and on February 11, 2005 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.games-fusion.net/press/content/blizzard_entertainment_announc.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103122615/http://www.games-fusion.net/press/content/blizzard_entertainment_announc.php |archivedate=November 3, 2007 |title=Blizzard Entertainment announces World of Warcraft}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 2004, the game was the fastest-selling PC game in the United States, and by March 2005, had reached 1.5 million subscribers worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra wow timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128323/Seven_Years_Of_World_Of_Warcraft.php | title =  Seven Years Of World Of Warcraft | first=  Tom | last = Curtis | date = November 23, 2011 | accessdate = December 12, 2019  |work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blizzard partnered with Chinese publisher [[The9]] to publisher and distribute ''World of Warcraft'' in China, as foreign companies could not directly publish into the country themselves.

With the success of ''World of Warcraft'', Blizzard organized the first [[BlizzCon]] fan convention in October 2005 held at the [[Anaheim Convention Center]]. The inaugural event drew about 6,000 people and became an annual event which Blizzard uses to announce new games, expansions, and content for its properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra wow timeline&quot;/&gt;

===Vivendi merger with Activision and continued growth (2008-current)===
Up through 2006, [[Bobby Kotick]], the CEO of [[Activision]], had been working to rebound the company from near-bankruptcy, and had established a number of new studios. However, Activision lacked anything in the MMO market. Kotick saw that ''World of Warcraft'' was bringing in over {{USD|1.1 billion}} a year in subscription fees, and began approaching Vivendi's CEO [[Jean-Bernard Lévy]] about potential acquisition of their struggling Vivendi Games division, which included Blizzard Entertainment. Lévy was open to a merger, but would only allow it if he controlled the majority of the combined company, knowing the value of ''World of Warcraft'' to Kotick.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes kotick&quot;/&gt; Among those Kotick spoke to for advice included Blizzard's Morhaime, who told Kotick that they had begun establishing lucrative in-roads into the [[Video gaming in China|Chinese market]]. Kotick accepted Lévy's deal, with the deal approved by shareholders in December 2007. By July 2008, the merger was complete, with Vivendi Games effectively dissolved except for Blizzard, and the new company was named [[Activision Blizzard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes kotick&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html#788254c31a16 |title=Activision's Unlikely Hero |first=Peter |last=Beller |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 12, 2019 |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806105646/https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0202/052.html#788254c31a16 |archive-date=August 6, 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blizzard established a distribution agreement with the Chinese company [[NetEase]] in August 2008 to publish Blizzard's games in China. The deal focused on ''StarCraft II'' which was gaining popularity as an [[esport]] within southeast Asia, as well as for other Blizzard games with the exception of ''World of Warcraft'', still being handled by The9. The two companies established the Shanghai EaseNet Network Technology for managing the games within China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2008/08/12/blizzard-cuts-deal-with-neteasecom-to-take-starcraft-2-to-china/ | title = Blizzard cuts deal with NetEase.com to take Starcraft II to China | first= Dean | last = Takahashi | date = August 12, 2008 | accessdate = December 12, 2019 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blizzard and The9 prepared to launch the ''World of Warcraft'' expansion ''[[World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King|Wrath of the Lich King]]'', but the expansion came under scrutiny by China's content regulation board, the [[General Administration of Press and Publication]], which rejected publication of it within China in March 2009, even with preliminary modifications made by The9 to clear it. Rumors of Blizzard's dissatisfaction with The9 from this and other previous complications with ''World of Warcraft'' came to a head when, in April 2009, Blizzard announced it was terminating its contract with The9, and transferred operation of ''World of Warcraft'' in China to NetEase.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra wow timeline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114174/The9_Loses_China_World_Of_Warcraft_Deal_to_NetEase.php | title = The9 Loses China World Of Warcraft Deal to NetEase | first1 = Dave | last1 =Jenkins | first2 =Kris | last2 = Graft | date = April 16, 2009 | accessdate = December 12, 2019 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://www.engadget.com/2014/01/17/wow-archivist-wow-in-china-an-uncensored-history/ | title = WoW Archivist: WoW in China, an uncensored history | first= Scott | last=  Andrews | date = January 17, 2014 | accessdate = December 12, 2019  |work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the merger, Blizzard found it was relying on its well-established properties, but at the same time, the industry was experiencing a shift towards [[indie game]]s. Blizzard established a few small teams within the company to work on developing new concepts based on the indie development approach that it could potentially use. One of these teams quickly came onto the idea of a [[collectible card game]] based on the ''Warcraft'' narrative universe, which ultimately became ''[[Hearthstone]]'', released as a free-to-play title in March 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/hearthstone-blizzard-strategy-trading-cards-greg-austin | title = Hearthstone: how a game developer turned 30m people into card geeks | work = [[The Guardian]] | first = Keith | last = Stewart | date = June 25, 2015 | accessdate = April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hearthstone'' reached over 25 million players by the end of 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matulef|first1=Jeffrey|title=Destiny has more than 16 million registered users|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-05-destiny-has-more-than-16-million-registered-users|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=February 6, 2015|date=February 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exceeded 100 million players by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-celebrates-100-million-hearthstone-players-with-free-card-packs-for-everyone/ | title=  Blizzard celebrates 100 million Hearthstone players with free card packs for everyone | first = Andy | last=  Chalk | date = November 5, 2018 | accessdate = November 5, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another small internal team began work around 2008 on a new intellectual property known as ''[[Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)|Titan]]'', a more contemporary or near-future MMORPG that would have co-existed alongside ''World of Warcraft''. The project gained more visibility in 2010 as a result of some information leaks. Blizzard continued to speak on ''Titan''{{'}}s development over the next few years, with over 100 people within Blizzard working on the project. However, ''Titan''{{'}}s development was troubled, and, internally, in May 2013, Blizzard cancelled the project (publicly reporting this in 2014), and reassigned most of the staff but left about 40 people, led by [[Jeff Kaplan]], to either come up with a fresh idea within a few weeks or have their team reassigned to Blizzard's other departments. The small team came upon the idea of a team-based multiplayer shooter game, reusing many of the assets from ''Titan'' but set in a new near-future narrative. The new project was greenlit by Blizzard and became known as ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', which was released in May 2016. ''Overwatch'' became the fourth main intellectual property of Blizzard, following ''Warcraft'', ''Starcraft'', and ''Diablo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespot kaplan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-story-of-overwatch-the-complete-jeff-kaplan-in/1100-6439202/ |title=The Story of Overwatch: The Complete Jeff Kaplan Interview |first1=Danny |last1=O'Dwyer |first2=Justin |last2=Haywald |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |work=[[GameSpot]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530205229/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-story-of-overwatch-the-complete-jeff-kaplan-in/1100-6439202/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''Hearthstone'' and ''Overwatch'', Blizzard continued to produce sequels and expansions to its established properties during this period, including ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]'' (2010) and ''[[Diablo III]]'' (2012). They released an improved version of Battle.net (Battle.net 2.0) in March 2009 which included improved matchmaking, storefront features, and better support for all of Blizzard's existing titles particularly ''World of Warcraft''.&lt;ref name=&quot;New B.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5342994/upcoming-blizzard-battlenet-feature-draw-from-warcraft-xbox-live-life |title=Upcoming Blizzard Battle.Net Feature Draw From Warcraft, Xbox Live, Life – Blizzcon 09 |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=August 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games ==
{{main|List of Blizzard Entertainment games}}
Blizzard Entertainment has developed 19 games since 1991, in addition to developing 8 [[porting|ports]] between 1992 and 1993; 11 of those games are in the ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and ''[[StarCraft]]'' series. Since the release of ''[[Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans]]'' (1994), ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' (1997), and ''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'' (1998), Blizzard has focused almost exclusively on those three series. The sole exception has been the company's latest title, ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' (2016).

=== Main franchises ===
Currently, Blizzard has four main franchises: ''Warcraft'', ''Diablo'', ''StarCraft'', and ''Overwatch''. Each franchise is supported by other media based around its intellectual property such as novels, collectible card games, comics and video shorts. Blizzard Entertainment announced in 2006 that they would be producing a [[Warcraft (film)|''Warcraft'' live-action movie]]. The movie was directed by [[Duncan Jones]], financed and produced by [[Legendary Pictures]], [[Atlas Entertainment]], and others, and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blizzard.com/press/060509.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526064526/http://www.blizzard.com/press/060509.shtml |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |title=Blizzard Entertainment – Press Release |accessdate=August 31, 2006 |date=May 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in June 2016.

=== Unreleased games ===
Notable unreleased titles include ''[[Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans]]'', which was canceled on May 22, 1998, ''Shattered Nations'', and ''[[StarCraft: Ghost]]'', which was &quot;Postponed indefinitely&quot; on March 24, 2006 after being in [[development hell]] for much of its lifespan. After seven years of development, Blizzard revealed the cancellation of an unannounced MMO codenamed ''[[Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)|&quot;Titan&quot;]]'' on September 23, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc |title=Blizzard cancels its next-gen MMO Titan after seven years |last=Kollar |first=Philip |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=September 23, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923203528/http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc |archivedate=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also has a history of declining to set release dates, choosing to instead take as much time as needed, generally saying a given product is &quot;done when it's done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=GamePro Staff |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/79448/gamepro-q-a-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-on-the-burning-crusade/ |title=GamePro Q&amp;A: Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan on The Burning Crusade |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=August 29, 2006 |accessdate=September 30, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114012421/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/79448/gamepro-q-a-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-on-the-burning-crusade/ |archivedate=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pax Imperia II'' was originally announced as a title to be published by Blizzard. Blizzard eventually dropped ''Pax Imperia II'', though, when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project, which became known as ''[[StarCraft]]''. THQ eventually contracted with Heliotrope and released the game in 1997 as ''[[Pax Imperia: Eminent Domain]]''.

== Technology ==

=== Warden client ===

Blizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the 'Warden Client'. The Warden client is known to be used with Blizzard's online games such as ''Diablo'' and ''World of Warcraft'', and the Terms of Service contain a clause consenting to the Warden software's RAM scans while a Blizzard game is running.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html WoW -&gt; Legal -&gt; Terms of Use] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511183010/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/legal/termsofuse.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}. Worldofwarcraft.com (December 9, 2010). Retrieved July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warden client scans a small portion of the [[code segment]] of running processes in order to determine whether any third-party programs are running. The goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game. This determination of third party programs is made by [[Hash function|hashing]] the scanned [[String (computer science)|strings]] and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*hh_/www.rootkit.com/blog.php?newsid=358 rootkit.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Warden's reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened. This incident banned many Linux users after an update to Warden caused it to incorrectly detect [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]] as a cheat program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080216041937/http://www.linuxlookup.com/2006/nov/15/linux_users_banned_from_world_of_warcraft Linux Users Banned From World of Warcraft? | Linuxlookup].

=== Battle.net 2.0 ===
{{main|Battle.net}}
Blizzard released its revamped Battle.net service in 2009. This service allows people who have purchased Blizzard products (''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'', ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II]]'', ''[[Diablo II]]'', and ''[[Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos|Warcraft III]]'', as well as their expansions) to download digital copies of games they have purchased, without needing any physical media.

On November 11, 2009, Blizzard required all ''World of Warcraft'' accounts to switch over to Battle.net accounts. This transition means that all current Blizzard titles can be accessed, downloaded, and played with a singular Battle.net login.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml World of Warcraft] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309102730/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml |date=March 9, 2009 }}. World of Warcraft. Retrieved July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Battle.net 2.0 is the platform for matchmaking service for Blizzard games, which offers players a host of additional features. Players are able to track their friend's achievements, view match history, avatars, etc. Players are able to unlock a wide range of achievements (rewards for completing game content) for Blizzard games.

The service allows players to chat simultaneously with players from other Blizzard games. For example, players no longer need to create multiple user names or accounts for most Blizzard products. To enable cross-game communication, players need to become either Battletag or Real ID friends.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=This information is useful, but where did it come from?}}

During an October 2019 ''Hearthstone Grandmasters'' streaming event in [[Taiwan]], one player Ng Wai Chung, going by his online alias &quot;Blitzchung&quot; used an interview period to show support for the protestors in the [[2019 Hong Kong protests]]. Shortly afterwards, on October 7, 2019, Blitzchung was disqualified from the current tournament and forfeited his winnings to date, and banned for a one-year period. The two shoutcasters engaged in the interview were also penalized with similar bans.
