The '''Balfour Declaration of 1926''', issued by the [[1926 Imperial Conference]] of [[British Empire]] leaders in London, was named after [[Lord President of the Council]] (and former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]) [[Arthur Balfour]]. It declared the United Kingdom and the [[Dominion]]s to be:
{{quote|... autonomous Communities within the [[British Empire]], equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to [[the Crown]], and freely associated as members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Clause II, at https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/cth11_doc_1926.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Inter-Imperial Relations Committee, chaired by Balfour, drew up the document preparatory to its unanimous approval by the imperial premiers on 15 November 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Balfour Formula&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall |first=Sir Peter |date=September 2001 |title=The Balfour Formula and the Evolution of the Commonwealth |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=90 |issue=361 |pages=541â€“53 |url= |quote= |doi=10.1080/00358530120082823 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 December 2008 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was first proposed by South African Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and Canadian [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]].

The Declaration accepted the growing political and diplomatic independence of the Dominions in the years after [[World War I]]. It also recommended that the [[Governor-General|governors-general]], the representatives of the King who acted for [[the Crown]] as ''de facto'' head of state in each dominion, should no longer also serve automatically as the representative of the British government in diplomatic relations between the countries. In following years, [[High Commissioner]]s were gradually appointed, whose duties were soon recognised to be virtually identical to those of an ambassador. The first such British High Commissioner was appointed to [[Ottawa]] in 1928.

The conclusions of the imperial premiers conference of 1926 were re-stated by the 1930 conference and incorporated in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of December 1931, by which the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]] renounced any legislative authority over dominion affairs, except as specifically provided in law.
