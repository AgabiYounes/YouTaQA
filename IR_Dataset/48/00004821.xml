'''Unification or Death''' ({{lang-sr|Уједињење или смрт / Ujedinjenje ili smrt}}), popularly known as the '''Black Hand''' (Црна рука / Crna ruka), was a [[secret society|secret military society]] formed in 1901 by officers in the [[Army of the Kingdom of Serbia]], best known for being allegedly involved in [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] and the earlier conspiracy to [[May Coup (Serbia)|assassinate the Serbian royal couple in 1903]], under the aegis of Captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] ({{aka}} &quot;Apis&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Black-Hand-secret-Serbian-society|title=Black Hand {{!}} secret Serbian society|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed with the aim of uniting all of the territories with a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] majority not ruled by either Serbia or [[Montenegro]]. Its inspiration was primarily the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]] in 1859–70 but also that of [[Unification of Germany|Germany]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/Gavrilo_Princip|title=Gavrilo Princip and the Black Hand organization|publisher=Bookrags}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Cassels|title=Ideology and international relations in the modern world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkN6M2mvh9EC&amp;pg=PA122|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=15 November 1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-11926-9|pages=122–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its connections to the June 1914 [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which was committed by the members of youth movement [[Young Bosnia]], the Black Hand is often viewed as having contributed to the start of [[World War I]] by precipitating the [[July Crisis|July Crisis of 1914]], which eventually led to Austria-Hungary's [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|invasion]] of the Kingdom of Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, 1914-1918, 2012 Penguin, reissue, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{see also|May Coup (Serbia)}} [[File:Black Hand Members.jpg|thumb|Early members of the Black Hand.]]
In August 1901, a group of lower officers headed by captain [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] &quot;Apis&quot; established a conspiracy group (called the '''Black Hand''' in literature), against the dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;RatkovićĐurišić1972&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Borislav Ratković|author2=Mitar Đurišić|author3=Savo Skoko|title=Srbija i Crna Gora u balkanskim ratovima 1912-1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBAvAAAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Beogradski izdavačko-grafički zavod|quote=Y августу 1901. нижи официри су, под руководством капетана Драгутина Димитр^евиhа — Аписа, створили заверенички покрет против ди- насти е (&quot;Црна рука&quot;).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting was held on 6 September 1901. In attendance were captains [[Radomir Aranđelović]], [[Milan F. Petrović]], and [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]], as well as lieutenants [[Antonije Antić]], [[Dragutin Dulić]], Milan Marinković, and [[Nikodije Popović]].{{sfn|Antić|2010-11-20}} They made a plan to kill the royal couple—[[Alexander I of Serbia|King Alexander I Obrenović]] and [[Draga Mašin|Queen Draga]]. Captain Apis personally led the group of Army officers who killed the royal couple in the [[Old Palace (Belgrade)|Old Palace]] at [[Belgrade]] on the night of 28/29 May 1903 ([[Old Style]]).

===Narodna Odbrana===
 {{main article|Narodna Odbrana}}
On 8 October 1908, just two days after [[Bosnian crisis|Austria annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina]], some Serbian ministers, officials, and generals held a meeting at the City Hall in Belgrade. They founded a semi-secret society, the ''[[Narodna Odbrana]]'' (&quot;National Defense&quot;) which gave [[Pan-Serbism]] a focus and an organization. The purpose of the group was to liberate Serbs under the Austro-Hungarian occupation. They also undertook anti-Austrian propaganda and organized spies and saboteurs to operate within the occupied provinces. Satellite groups were formed in [[Slovenia]], Bosnia, Herzegovina and [[Istria]]. The Bosnian group became deeply associated with local groups of pan-Serb activists such as ''Mlada Bosna'' (&quot;[[Young Bosnia]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Clark |title=The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914|publisher=Penguin UK |year=2012 |isbn=9780718192952|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1911–12, Narodna Odbrana had established ties with the Black Hand, and the two became &quot;parallel in action and overlapping in membership&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Roudometof|title=Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9p_m7oXQ00C&amp;pg=PA170|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31949-5|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1911–13==
The organization used the magazine ''Pijemont'' (the Serbian name for [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]], the kingdom that led the unification of Italy, under the House of Savoy) for the dissemination of their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NIN. nedeljne informativne novine|issue=2791-2794|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EtjlAAAAMAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Politika.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was founded by [[Ljuba Čupa]] in August 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Пијемонт|work=Veliki rat|publisher=National Library of Serbia|url=http://velikirat.nb.rs/collections/show/188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Hand committed numerous massacres, burning and looting, on Albanian civilians in Kosovo as Serb army advanced in 1912-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clodfelter |first1=Micheal |title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts: A Statistical Encyclopedia of Casualty and Other Figures, 1492-2015, 4th ed. |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-2585-0 |page=341 |url=https://books.google.se/books?id=kNzCDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341&amp;dq=Albanian+civilians+1912&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYh8LP5t_mAhWFyKYKHdoxAywQ6AEIcjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Albanian%20civilians%201912&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 December 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1914==
By 1914, there were hundreds of members, many of whom were Serbian Army officers. The goal of [[Pan-Serbism|uniting Serb-inhabited territories]] was implemented through the training of guerilla fighters and saboteurs. The Black Hand was organized at the grassroots level in 3 to 5-member cells, supervised by district committees and by a Central committee in Belgrade whose ten-member Executive Committee was led, more or less, by Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] &quot;Apis&quot;. To ensure secrecy, members rarely knew much more than the members of their own cell and one superior above them. New members swore the oath:

{{quote|I (...), by entering into the society, do hereby swear by the Sun which shineth upon me, by the Earth which feedeth me, by God, by the blood of my forefathers, by my honour and by my life, that from this moment onward and until my death, I shall faithfully serve the task of this organisation and that I shall at all times be prepared to bear for it any sacrifice. I further swear by God, by my honour and by my life, that I shall unconditionally carry into effect all its orders and commands. I further swear by my God, by my honour and by my life, that I shall keep within myself all the secrets of this organisation and carry them with me into my grave. May God and my brothers in this organisation be my judges if at any time I should wittingly fail or break this oath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressonline.rs/sr/vesti/magazin/story/56166/Tadi%C4%87ev+deda+bio+zadu%C5%BEen+za+ubistvo+Ferdinanda!.html Pressonline.rs] Press (2011-10-07). Retrieved on 2011-11-08. {{in lang|sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Black Hand took over the terrorist actions{{which|date=March 2014}} of ''Narodna Odbrana'', and worked deliberately at obscuring any distinctions between the two groups, trading on the prestige and network of the older organization. Black Hand members held important army and government positions. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Crown Prince Alexander]] was an enthusiastic and financial supporter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The group held influence over government appointment and policy. The Serbian government was fairly well informed of Black Hand activities.
Friendly relations had fairly well cooled by 1914. The Black Hand was displeased with Prime Minister [[Nikola Pašić]]. They thought he did not act aggressively enough towards the Pan-Serb cause. They engaged in a bitter power struggle over several issues, such as who would control territories Serbia annexed in the [[Balkan Wars]]. By this point, disagreeing with the Black Hand was dangerous, as political murder was one of their tools.

It was also in 1914 that Apis allegedly decided that Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir-apparent of Austria, should be assassinated, as he was trying to pacify the Serbians, and if this happened then a revolution would never occur. Towards that end it is claimed that three young Bosnian Serbs were recruited to kill the Archduke. They were definitely trained in bomb throwing and marksmanship by current and former members of the Serbian military. [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]] and [[Trifko Grabež]] were smuggled across the border back into Bosnia via a chain of [[Underground Railroad|underground-railroad]] style contacts.
The decision to kill the Archduke was apparently initiated by Apis, and not sanctioned by the full Executive Committee (assuming Apis was involved at all, a question that remains in dispute&lt;ref&gt;Vladimer Dedijer, ''The Road to Sarajevo''&lt;/ref&gt;). Those involved probably realized that their plot would result in war between Austria and Serbia, and had every reason to expect that Russia would side with Serbia. They likely did not, however, anticipate that the assassination would start a chain of events leading to World War I.
Others in the government and some of the Black Hand Executive Council were not as confident of Russian aid. Russia had let them down recently. When word of the plot allegedly percolated through Black Hand leadership and the Serbian government (the Prime Minister Pašić was definitely informed of two armed men being smuggled across the border; it is not clear if Pašić knew the planned assassination), Apis was supposedly told not to proceed. He may have made a half-hearted attempt to intercept the young assassins at the border, but they had already crossed. Other sources say the attempted 'recall' was only begun after the assassins had reached Sarajevo. This 'recall' appears to make Apis look like a loose cannon, and the young assassins as independent zealots. In fact, the 'recall' took place a full two weeks before the Archduke's visit. The assassins idled around in [[Sarajevo]] for a month. Nothing more was done to stop them.

==Ideology==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
The group encompassed a range of ideological outlooks, from conspiratorially-minded army officers to idealistic youths, sometimes tending towards republicanism, despite the acquisition of nationalistic royal circles in its activities (the movement's leader, Colonel [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]] or &quot;Apis,&quot; had been instrumental in the [[May Overthrow|June 1903 coup]] which had brought King [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Karađorđević]] to the [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian throne]] following 45 years of rule by the rival [[Obrenovic|Obrenović]] dynasty). The group was denounced as [[nihilism|nihilist]] by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] press and compared to the Russian [[People's Will]] and the [[Chinese Assassination Corps]].

==Legacy==
In 1938 a [[Konspiracija (secret society)|conspiracy group]] to overthrow the [[Yugoslav regency]] was founded by, among others, members of the [[Serbian Cultural Club]] (SKK).{{sfn|Kazimirović|1995|p=653}} The organization was modeled after the Black Hand, including the recruitment process.{{sfn|Kazimirović|1995|p=654}} Two members of the Black Hand, Antonije Antić, and Velimir Vemić were the organization's military advisors.{{sfn|Zečević|2003|p=335}}
