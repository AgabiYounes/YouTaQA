'''Budweiser''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʌ|d|w|aɪ|z|ər}}) is an [[American lager|American-style]] [[pale lager]] produced by [[Anheuser-Busch]], currently part of the transnational corporation [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] and produced in various breweries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Lisa |date=October 11, 2016  |title=A-B InBev finalizes $100B billion acquisition of SABMiller, creating world's largest beer company |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-megabrew-ab-inbev-sabmiller-merger-20161010-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |access-date=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an unrelated lager also called Budweiser, originating centuries ago in [[České Budějovice]], [[Czechia]] (historically known as ''Budweis''); the existence of the two separate beers has given rise to [[Budweiser trademark dispute|a trademark dispute]] preventing Anheuser-Busch from using the &quot;Budweiser&quot; name in some regions, leading to the exclusive use of &quot;Bud&quot; in those markets.

Introduced in 1876 by Carl Conrad &amp; Co. of [[St. Louis, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sha.org/bottle/pdffiles/CarlConradCo.pdf|title = Carl Conrad &amp; Co. – The Original American Budweiser|year = 2006|accessdate = May 30, 2015|website = Society for Historical Archeology|last = Lockhart|first = Bill|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budweiser has become one of the largest-selling [[beers in the United States]]. The lager is available in over 80 countries, though not under the Budweiser name where Anheuser-Busch does not own the trademark.  Budweiser is a [[filtered beer]], available on [[draught beer|draft]] and in bottles and cans, made (unlike the Czech lager) with up to 30% rice in addition to the [[hops]] and [[barley]] [[malt]] used by all lagers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protz-CgtwBeer&quot;&gt;Protz, R., ''The Complete Guide to World Beer'' (2004), {{ISBN|1-84442-865-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name origin and dispute==
{{Main|Budweiser trademark dispute}}
[[File:Bud and Budvar.jpg|thumb|American Budweiser is sold in most of the [[European Union]] as &quot;Bud&quot; (left). At right is a bottle of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery|Budweiser]]]]

The name ''Budweiser'' is a [[German language|German]] derivative adjective, meaning &quot;of Budweis&quot;.
Beer has been brewed in ''Budweis'' (now [[České Budějovice]], [[Czechia]]) since it was founded in 1245. In 1876, German-born [[Adolphus Busch]] and his friend Carl Conrad developed a &quot;Bohemian-style&quot; lager in the [[United States]], inspired after a trip to Bohemia and produced it in their brewery in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

Anheuser–Busch has been involved in a trademark dispute with the [[Budweiser Budvar Brewery]] of [[České Budějovice]] over the trademark rights to the name &quot;Budweiser&quot;.

In the [[European Union]], excluding the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Spain, the American beer is marketed as ''Bud'', as the Budweiser trademark name is owned solely by the Czech beer maker, [[Budweiser Budvar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703578104575397070661513504 |title=EU Rejects Appeal for Bud Trademark|work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Susan|last1=Carey|first2=Peppi|last2=Kiviniemi|date=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ekonomika.ihned.cz/c1-45317230-pripad-uzavren-znacka-budweiser-v-eu-patri-do-ceskych-budejovic-rozhodl-soud Případ uzavřen: Značka Budweiser v EU patří do Českých Budějovic, rozhodl soud] {{in lang|cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries both the Budvar and Anheuser–Busch lagers are available under the Budweiser name.

The Budweiser from Budějovice has been called &quot;The Beer of Kings&quot; since the 16th century. Adolphus Busch adapted this slogan to &quot;The King of Beers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamhof.org/bio1.html |title=GAMHOF Adolphus Busch Biography |publisher=GAMHOF – German-American Hall of Fame |year=2008 |accessdate=April 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504131220/http://gamhof.org/bio1.html |archive-date=May 4, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite news |last=McGrath Goodman |first=Leah |date=November 3, 2016 |title=Budweiser's Battle for Beer Market Dominance Hinges on the U.S. |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/11/budweiser-merger-beer-market-516396.html |work=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=May 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This history notwithstanding, Anheuser Busch owns the trademark to these slogans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Manning |first=Rob |date=June 4, 2002 |title=The King of Beers vs. the Beer of Kings |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-1056-the-king-of-beers-vs-the-beer-of-kings.html |newspaper=[[Willamette Week]] |location=Portland, Oregon |access-date=February 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Bud Light ran an advertising campaign centered around a canine mascot, [[Spuds MacKenzie]] with the catchphrase, &quot;BudLight, Drink it......all&quot;.

In 2010, the Bud Light brand paid $1&amp;nbsp;billion for a six-year licensing agreement with the [[NFL]].&lt;ref name=imr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imrpublications.com/free-samples.aspx?sid=38&amp;rid=2 |title=Beer – global sponsorship analysis |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=imrpublications.com |publisher=IMR Publications |access-date=March 31, 2017 |quote=In 2010, eyebrows were raised when Bud Light paid a record breaking $1&amp;nbsp;billion for its six-year deal for NFL rights, roughly twice the amount incumbent, MillerCoors had been paying.

Budweiser has produced a number of TV advertisements, such as the [[Budweiser Frogs]], lizards impersonating the Budweiser frogs, a campaign built around the phrase &quot;[[Whassup?]]&quot;, and a team of [[Clydesdale horse]]s commonly known as the [[Budweiser Clydesdales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shikes, Jonathan |url=http://blogs.westword.com/cafesociety/2011/08/post_31.php |title=The five most memorable Budweiser Clydesdale commercials; the horses are leaving Fort Collins|work= West World Blogs |date=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budweiser also advertises extensively in motorsports, from [[Bernie Little]]'s [[Miss Budweiser]] hydroplane boat to sponsorship of the Budweiser King Top Fuel Dragster driven by Brandon Bernstein. Anheuser-Busch has sponsored the [[Champ Car|CART]] championship. It is the &quot;Official Beer of [[NHRA]]&quot;&lt;ref name=nhra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testandtune.com/Drag/nhraSponsors.asp |title=NHRA Official Sponsors |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=testandtune.com |publisher=NHRA |access-date=April 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the &quot;Official Beer of [[NASCAR]]&quot; from 1998 to 2007. It has sponsored motorsport events such as the [[Daytona Speedweeks]], [[Budweiser Shootout]], [[Budweiser Duel]], [[Budweiser Pole Award]], [[Budweiser 500 (Spring Dover)|Budweiser 500]], [[Budweiser 400]], [[Budweiser 300]], [[Budweiser 250]], [[Budweiser 200 (Dover)|Budweiser 200]], and [[Carolina Pride / Budweiser 200]]. However, starting in 2016, the focus of A-B's NASCAR sponsorship became its Busch brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anheuser-Busch to promote Busch brand in NASCAR starting in 2016 |url = http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/kevin-harvick-stewart-haas-racing-budweiser-busch-sponsorship-2016-sprint-cup-series-082415|publisher = Fox Sports|access-date = February 18, 2016|first = Fox|last = Sports|date = August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budweiser has been sponsor of NASCAR teams such as [[Junior Johnson]], [[Hendrick Motorsports]], [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]], and [[Stewart-Haas Racing]]. Sponsored drivers include [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] (1999–2007), [[Kasey Kahne]] (2008–2010), and [[Kevin Harvick]] (2011–2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kevin Harvick to switch beer sponsorship from Budweiser to Busch |url = https://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/8/24/9200857/kevin-harvick-budweiser-busch-beer-sponsorship |website = SBNation.com |access-date = February 18, 2016 |first = Jordan |last = Bianchi |date = August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[IndyCar]], Budweiser sponsored [[Mario Andretti]] (1983–1984), [[Bobby Rahal]] (1985–1988), [[Scott Pruett]] (1989–1992), [[Roberto Guerrero]] (1993), [[Scott Goodyear]] (1994), [[Paul Tracy]] (1995), [[Christian Fittipaldi]] (1996–1997), and [[Richie Hearn]] (1998–1999).

Between 2003 and 2006, Budweiser was a sponsor of the [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|BMW Williams]] [[Formula One]] team.

Anheuser-Busch has placed Budweiser as an official partner and sponsor of [[Major League Soccer]] and [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and was the headline sponsor of the [[British Basketball League]] in the 1990s. Anheuser-Busch has also placed Budweiser as an official sponsor of the [[Premier League]] and the presenting sponsor of the [[FA Cup]].

In the early 20th century, the company commissioned a play-on-words song called &quot;[[Under the Anheuser Bush]],&quot; which was recorded by several early phonograph companies.

In 2009, Anheuser-Busch partnered with popular Chinese [[video-sharing]] site, [[Tudou.com]] for a user-generated online video contest. The contest encourages users to suggest ideas that include ants for a Bud TV spot set to run in February 2010 during the [[Chinese New Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Madden, Normandy |title=Chinese Beer Consumers to Create the Next Budweiser Spot Through Online Contest |url=http://adage.com/globalnews/article?article_id=138666 |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=August 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Budweiser produced an online reality TV series, called ''Bud House,'' centered around the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa, following the lives of 32 international football fans (one representing each nation in the World Cup) living together in a house in South Africa.&lt;ref name=adage_dreams&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/news/bud-make-dreams-true/227579/ |title=Bud Will Make Your Dreams Come True |date=May 16, 2011 |work=Advertising Age |accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2012, Anheuser-Busch asked [[Paramount Pictures]] to obscure or remove the Budweiser logo from the film ''[[Flight (2012 film)|Flight]]'' (2012), directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]] and starring [[Denzel Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/apnewsbreak-this-buds-not-for-you-anheuser-busch-wants-budweiser-removed-from-film-flight/2012/11/05/fcc86832-27a8-11e2-ac64-5d52a2c5953e_story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209013539/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/apnewsbreak-this-buds-not-for-you-anheuser-busch-wants-budweiser-removed-from-film-flight/2012/11/05/fcc86832-27a8-11e2-ac64-5d52a2c5953e_story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 9, 2013|title=APNewsBreak: This Bud’s not for you: Anheuser-Busch wants Budweiser removed from film ‘Flight’|work=Washington Post|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Containers and packaging==

===Containers===
Over the years, Budweiser has been distributed in many sizes and containers. Until the early 1950s Budweiser was primarily distributed in three packages: [[keg]]s, {{convert|12|U.S.floz|ml|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} bottles and {{convert|1|usqt|l}} bottles. Cans were first introduced in 1936, which helped sales to climb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anheuser-busch.com/s/index.php/our-heritage/history/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106110755/http://www.anheuser-busch.com/s/index.php/our-heritage/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2012|title=Official website: Our History|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 August Busch Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9000617/August-Anheuser-Busch-Jr |title=August Anheuser Busch, Jr. – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=September 29, 1989 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a strategic move to expand Budweiser's national brand and distributor presence. Along with this expansion came advances in bottling automation, new bottling materials and more efficient distribution methods. These advances brought to market many new containers and package designs. {{As of|2011}} Budweiser is distributed in four large container volumes: half-barrel kegs ({{Convert|1/2|USbeerbbl|USgal+l|sigfig=3|disp=out}}), quarter-barrel kegs ({{Convert|1/4|USbeerbbl|USgal+l|sigfig=3|disp=out}}), 1/6 barrel kegs ({{Convert|1/6|USbeerbbl|USgal+l|sigfig=3|disp=out}}) and {{Convert|5.2|USgal|l}} &quot;beer balls&quot;. Budweiser produces a variety of cans and [[beer bottle|bottles]] ranging from {{convert|7|-|40|USfloz}}. On August 3, 2011, Anheuser-Busch announced its twelfth can design since 1936, one which emphasizes the [[bowtie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/08/03/2313953/business-briefs.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204190406/http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/08/03/2313953/business-briefs.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title=Business Briefs |work=[[The Sun News]] |date=August 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Packages are sometimes tailored to local customs and traditions. In [[St. Mary's County]], [[Maryland]], ten ounce cans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gazette.net/stories/111705/busipgl154036_31896.shtml |title=St. Mary's celebrates 10-ounce beer |publisher=Gazette.net |accessdate=September 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012230823/http://www.gazette.net/stories/111705/busipgl154036_31896.shtml |archive-date=October 12, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336207 |title=Where the 10-Ounce Bud Is the King of Beers |publisher=NPR |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the preferred package.

===Bottle===
The Budweiser bottle has remained relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1876. A small label is affixed to the neck of the bottle with the Budweiser &quot;bow-tie&quot; logo. The main label is red with a white box in the center, overlaid with a Budweiser logo resembling a [[coat of arms]], with the word &quot;Budweiser&quot; below it.

===Cans===
[[Image:StLouisABPackaging Plant.JPG|thumbnail|right|The packaging plant at the [[Anheuser-Busch]] headquarters in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]]]
In attempt to re-stimulate interest in their beer after the repeal of Prohibition, Budweiser began canning their beer in 1936. This new packaging led to an increase in sales which lasted until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anheuser-busch.com/s/index.php/our-heritage/history/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106110755/http://www.anheuser-busch.com/s/index.php/our-heritage/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2012|title=Official website: Our History|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Budweiser cans have undergone various design changes in response to market conditions and consumer tastes. Since 1936, 12 major can design changes have occurred, not including the temporary special edition designs.&lt;ref name=bowtie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrnewmedia.com/2011/anheuser-busch/bud_design/main.html|title=Budweiser Unveils New &quot;Bowtie&quot; Design|accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budweiser cans have traditionally displayed patriotic American symbols, such as eagles and the colors red, white, and blue. In 2011, there was a branding redesign that eliminated some of the traditional imagery. The new design was largely in response to the huge decline in sales threatening Budweiser's status as America's best-selling beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/budweiser-cans-a/229076/|title=Budweiser Cans Get a New Look—the Bow Tie|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to regain the domestic market share that Budweiser has lost, the company tried to update its appearance by giving the can a more contemporary look. The company hopes that the new design will offset the effects that unemployment had on its sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budweiser Can Redesigned&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=14223187#.T1FyB_USYTA|title=Budweiser Can Redesigned|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the more modern design is intended for young male Americans, the new design was also part of an attempt to focus on the international market.&lt;ref name=bowtie /&gt; Budweiser began selling its beer in Russia in 2010, and is currently expanding its operations in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budweiser Can Redesigned&quot;/&gt;

Budweiser is produced using [[barley]] malt, rice, water, [[hops]] and [[yeast]]. Malt gives color and the sugar that is needed for the beer to ferment. Yeast is key in the flavor. The hops gives the beer spice, aroma and bitterness. Another ingredient is rice, helping Budweiser achieve crispness in its flavor. Finally, there is the water, which is filtered to make sure it's pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.budweisertours.com/commitment-to-quality/ingredients.html|title=Ingredients {{!}} Commitment to Quality|website=www.budweisertours.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brewing happens in 7 steps: milling, mashing, straining, brew kettle, primary fermentation, beechwood lagering and finishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.budweisertours.com/commitment-to-quality/brewing-process.html|title=Brewing Process {{!}} Commitment to Quality|website=www.budweisertours.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is lagered with [[beech]]wood chips in the aging vessel. While beechwood chips are used in the maturation tank, there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood, mainly because they are boiled in [[sodium bicarbonate]] (baking soda) for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and, as such, [[flocculation]] of the yeast occurs much more quickly. Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation, with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on. This is also combined with a [[Brewing#Conditioning|krausening]] procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank, therefore reactivating the fermentation process. Placing the beechwood chips at the bottom of the tank keeps the yeast in suspension longer, giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors, such as [[acetaldehyde]] and [[diacetyl]], that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability.{{clarify|date=December 2012}}

Budweiser and ''Bud Light'' are sometimes advertised as [[vegan]] beers, in that their ingredients and conditioning do not use animal by-products. Some may object to the inclusion of genetically engineered rice&lt;ref name=&quot;gp2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-exposes-anheuser-bu# | title=Greenpeace Exposes Anheuser Busch's Use of Genetically Engineered Rice in Beer Brewing Process | publisher=Greenpeace | date=October 8, 2007 | accessdate=December 26, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128193838/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-exposes-anheuser-bu | archivedate=November 28, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and animal products used in the brewing process. In July 2006, Anheuser-Busch brewed a version of Budweiser with organic rice, for sale in Mexico. It has yet to extend this practice to any other countries.
