The '''British Army''' is the principal [[Army|land warfare force]] of the [[United Kingdom]], a part of [[British Armed Forces]]. {{as of|2019}}, the British Army comprises just over 79,300 trained regular (full-time) personnel and just over 27,200 trained [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|reserve (part-time)]] personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/847640/1_October_2019_SPS.pdf|title=UK Armed Forces Quarterly Service Personnel Statistics 1 October 2019|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern British Army traces back to 1707, with an antecedent in the [[English Army]] that was created during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660. The term ''British Army'' was adopted in 1707 after the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] between England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zDxnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22british+army%22+1660&amp;dq=%22british+army%22+1660|title=Redcoats and courtesans: the birth of the British Army (1660–1690)|last=Williams|first=Noel T.

The British Army has seen action in major wars between the world's [[great power]]s, including the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Crimean War]] and the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second World Wars]].

Until the [[English Civil War]], England never had a [[standing army]] with professional officers and careerist corporals and sergeants.  It relied on militia organised by local officials, or private forces mobilised by the nobility, or on hired mercenaries from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 24–45.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[later Middle Ages]] until the English Civil War, when a foreign expeditionary force was needed, such as the one that [[Henry V of England]] took to France and that fought at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415), the army, a professional one, was raised for the duration of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/victorious-army-making-raising-king-henry-vs-army-1415/|title=A victorious army in the making: Raising King Henry V's army of 1415|date=11 August 2015|first=Benjamin|last=Trowbridge|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018013732/http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/victorious-army-making-raising-king-henry-vs-army-1415/|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the English Civil War, the members of the [[Long Parliament]] realised that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the [[Eastern Association]]), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The [[Self-denying Ordinance]] forbade members of parliament (with the notable exception of [[Oliver Cromwell]]) from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent ([[Congregational]]) in theology, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation for the creation of a Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General [[Thomas Fairfax]], which became known as the [[New Model Army]] (originally new-modelled Army).{{sfn|Rogers|1968|pp=207–211}}

While this proved to be a war winning formula, the New Model Army, being organised and politically active, went on to dominate the politics of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the alleged excesses of the New Model Army under [[the Protectorate]] of Oliver Cromwell were used as propaganda (and still feature in Irish folklore) and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H. Firth ed. 1913) 1:136-38&lt;/ref&gt;  The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 'Charles II, 1661: An Act declaring the sole Right of the Militia to be in King and for the present ordering &amp; disposing the same.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819),|pages= 308–309|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47290|accessdate= 5 March 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215615/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47290|archive-date= 27 September 2007|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his [[Cavalier]] supporters favoured a new army under royal control; and immediately after the Restoration began working on its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;David Chandler, ''The Oxford History of the British Army'' (2003) p. 46.

After the Restoration Charles II pulled together four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of £122,000 from his general budget. This became the foundation of the permanent English Army. By 1685 it had grown to 7,500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1,400 men permanently stationed in garrisons.  A [[Monmouth Rebellion|rebellion]] in 1685 allowed [[James II of England|James II]] to raise the forces to 20,000 men.  There were 37,000 in 1678, when England played a role in the closing stage of the Franco-Dutch War.  After [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary's]] accession to the throne England involved itself in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], primarily to prevent a French invasion restoring James II (Mary's father).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|2000|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000, and then to 94,000 in 1694.  Parliament was very nervous, and reduced the cadre to 7000 in 1697.  Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were unofficially merged with the English force.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, ed., ''The Oxford history of the British army'' (1996) pp 46–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Correlli Barnett, ''Britain and her army, 1509–1970: a military, political and social survey'' (1970) pp 90–98, 110–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the 1707 [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were combined under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands for the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Although all the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment,&lt;ref name=Chandler2003&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandler|first1=David|title=The Oxford history of the British Army|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280311-5|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOgs8WpJI9AC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=british+army+founded+1660#v=snippet&amp;q=British%20army%20from%20the%20Act%20of%20Union|quote=It is generally accepted that the regular standing army in Britain was officially created – in the sense of being fully accommodated within parliamentary control in 1689, although it is, strictly speaking, only correct to refer to the British army from the Act of Union with Scotland in 1707.}}&lt;/ref&gt; they remained under the old operational-command structure and retained much of the institutional ethos, customs and traditions of the standing armies created shortly after the [[restoration (England)|restoration of the monarchy]] 47 years earlier. The order of seniority of the most-senior British Army line regiments is based on that of the English army. Although technically the Scots [[Royal Regiment of Foot]] was raised in 1633 and is the oldest Regiment of the Line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23301.aspx|publisher=British Army|accessdate=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118061954/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23301.aspx|archive-date=18 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army on the date of their arrival in England (or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment). In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the [[Scots Greys]] were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688, when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and the Scots Greys eventually received the British Army rank of 2nd Dragoons.{{sfn|Royal Scots Greys|1840|pp=56–57}}

After 1700 British continental policy was to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power during the previous two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its influence was now waning. The territorial ambitions of the French, however, led to the War of the Spanish Succession&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref name=ma165/&gt;

Although the [[Royal Navy]] is widely regarded as vital to the rise of the [[British Empire]], the British Army played an important role in the formation of colonies, [[protectorate]]s and [[dominion]]s in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India and [[Australasia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; British soldiers captured strategically important territories, and the army was involved in wars to secure the empire's borders and support friendly governments.

The British Army was heavily involved in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], participating in a number of campaigns in Europe (including continuous deployment in the [[Peninsular War]]), the [[Caribbean]], North Africa and [[War of 1812|North America]]. The war between the British and the [[First French Empire]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] stretched around the world; at its peak in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A coalition of Anglo-Dutch and Prussian armies under the [[Duke of Wellington]] and [[Field Marshal von Blücher]] finally defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English were involved politically and militarily in Ireland since receiving the [[Lordship of Ireland]] from the pope in 1171. The campaign of English republican Protector [[Oliver Cromwell]] involved uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns (most notably [[Drogheda]] and [[Wexford]]) which supported the Royalists during the [[English Civil War]]. The English Army (and the subsequent British Army) remained in Ireland primarily to suppress Irish revolts or disorder.  In addition to its conflict with Irish nationalists, it was faced with the prospect of battling Anglo-Irish and [[Ulster-Scots|Ulster Scots]] in Ireland who were angered by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain. With other Irish groups, they raised a volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met. Learning from their experience in America, the British government sought a political solution. The British Army fought Irish rebels—Protestant and Catholic—primarily in [[Ulster]] and [[Leinster]] ([[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone's]] [[United Irishmen]]) in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml The 1798 Irish Rebellion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207080021/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/irish_reb_01.shtml |date=7 February 2011 }} BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain was challenged by other powers, primarily the [[German Empire]] and the [[Third Reich]], during the 20th century. A century earlier it vied with Napoleonic France for global pre-eminence, and [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] Britain's natural allies were the kingdoms and principalities of [[northern Germany]]. By the middle of the 19th century, Britain and France were allies in preventing Russia's appropriation of the [[Ottoman Empire]], although the fear of French invasion led shortly afterwards to the creation of the Volunteer Force. By the first decade of the 20th century, the United Kingdom was allied with France (by the [[Entente Cordiale]]) and Russia (which had a secret agreement with France for mutual support in a war against the [[Prussia]]n-led German Empire and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Anglo-Russian_Entente|title=Agreement concerning Persia|accessdate=23 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708181007/https://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Anglo-Russian_Entente|archive-date=8 July 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the First World War broke out in August 1914 the British Army sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), consisting mainly of [[Standing army|regular army]] troops, to [[Western Front (World War I)|France and Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ensor|1980|pp=525–526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting bogged down into static [[trench warfare]] for the remainder of the war. In 1915 the army created the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] to invade the [[Ottoman Empire]] via [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], an unsuccessful attempt to capture [[Constantinople]] and secure a sea route to [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=3}}

The First World War was the most devastating in [[Military history of the United Kingdom|British military history]], with nearly 800,000 men killed and over two&amp;nbsp;million wounded. Early in the war, the BEF was virtually destroyed and was replaced first by [[Kitchener's Army|volunteers]] and then by a [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscript]] force. Major battles included those at [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]] and [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mallinson|2009|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in technology saw the advent of the [[tank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/nonflash_tank.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014050900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/nonflash_tank.shtml |archivedate=14 October 2007 |title=Mark I tank |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and the creation of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]) and advances in aircraft design (and the creation of the [[Royal Flying Corps]]) which would be decisive in future battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/ww1.cfm|title=RAF – World War 1|last=here|first=RAF Details|website=www.raf.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129020520/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/ww1.cfm|archive-date=29 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trench warfare dominated Western Front strategy for most of the war, and the use of [[Chemical weapons in World War I|chemical weapons]] (disabling and poison gases) added to the devastation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821004525/http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |archive-date=21 August 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the British Army recovered from its earlier defeats, it defeated the Germans and Italians at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] in 1942–1943 and helped drive them from Africa. It then fought through [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]{{sfn|Taylor|1976|p=157}} and, with the help of American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and Free French forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/faq.htm#casualties|title=D-Day and the Battle of Normandy|publisher=Ddaymuseum.co.uk|accessdate=28 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517231809/http://www.ddaymuseum.co.uk/d-day/d-day-and-the-battle-of-normandy-your-questions-answered#casualties|archive-date=17 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day invasion of Normandy]] on 6 June 1944; nearly half the Allied soldiers were British.{{sfn|Gilbert|2005|p=301}} In the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Far East]], the British Army rallied against the Japanese in the [[Burma Campaign]] and regained the British Far Eastern colonial possessions.{{sfn|Taylor|1976|p=210}}

The British Army has been a volunteer force since national service ended during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;M 384&quot; /&gt; Since the creation of the part-time, reserve [[Territorial Force]] in 1908 (renamed the Army Reserve in 2014), the full-time British Army has been known as the Regular Army. In October 2019 there were just over 79,330 trained Regulars and 27,250 [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reservists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/847640/1_October_2019_SPS.pdf|title=UK Armed Forces Monthly Personnel Statistics|last=|first=|date=October 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211082425/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/584256/Monthly_service_personnel_statistics-_December_2016.pdf|archive-date=11 February 2017|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]] (SDSR) and the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015]] the British Army adopted an evolving structure (known as [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine)]] that would see the number of Regular personnel set at 82,000 and see an increase in the number of Reservists to 30,000. This would bring the ratio of regular to part-time personnel in line with the US and Canada and better integrate the Army Reserve into the Regular Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Future Reserves 2020 | date=July 2011 | url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/263D5F71-30CE-45BC-9442-398B1DC12C93/0/futurereserves_2020.pdf | location=London, UK | publisher=Ministry of Defence | accessdate=13 May 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403211555/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/263D5F71-30CE-45BC-9442-398B1DC12C93/0/futurereserves_2020.pdf | archive-date=3 April 2012 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Category A is mandatory, with the length of time in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ragular-Reserve&quot;/&gt; similar to the Army Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/reserves-and-cadets-strengths/2013-04-01/2013.pdf dasa.mod – reserves and cadet strengths] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202123403/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/reserves-and-cadets-strengths/2013-04-01/2013.pdf | date=2 February 2014 }}, table 3-page 13 – read note 2.

{{main|List of equipment of the British Army}}

==== Infantry ====
The British Army's basic weapon is the [[SA80|L85A2]] or [[SA80|L85A3]] assault rifle, with some specialist personnel using the L22A2 carbine variant (pilots and some tank crew). The weapon was traditionally equipped with either [[iron sights]] or an optical [[SUSAT]], although other optical sights have been subsequently purchased to supplement these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23222.aspx|title=The British Army – SA80 individual weapon|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616184526/http://army.mod.uk/equipment/23222.aspx|archive-date=16 June 2017|access-date=9 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The weapon can be enhanced further utilising the [[Picatinny rail]] with attachments such as the [[L17A2 UGL|L17A2]] under-barrel grenade launcher.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/small-arms-and-support-weapons/|title=Small arms and support weapons|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some soldiers are equipped with the [[Lewis Machine and Tool Company|L129A1 sharpshooter rifle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/small-arms-and-support-weapons/|title=L129A1 sharpshooter Rifle|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140733/https://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/small-arms-and-support-weapons/|archive-date=12 June 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2018 formally replaced the [[L86 LSW|L86A2]] Light Support Weapon. Support fire is provided by the [[L7 (machine gun)|L7 general-purpose machine gun]] (GPMG),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23226.aspx|title=The British Army – General purpose machine gun|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126172854/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23226.aspx|archive-date=26 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and indirect fire is provided by [[L16 81mm mortar]]s. Sniper rifles include the [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|L118A1]]&amp;nbsp;7.62&amp;nbsp;mm, [[L115A3]] and the [[AW50F]], all manufactured by [[Accuracy International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23223.aspx|title=The British Army – L115A3 Long range 'sniper' rifle|last=cgsmediacomma-amc-dig-shared@mod.uk|first=The British Army|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410084543/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23223.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Army utilises the [[Glock|Glock 17]] as its side arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

==== Armour ====
The army's [[main battle tank]] is the [[Challenger 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_challenger.html Challenger 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210618/http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_challenger.html |date=21 June 2007 }} BA Systems&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/equipment/CFE-vehicles-and-aircraft/2013/2013.pdf|title=&quot;UKDS 2013&quot;|access-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927100113/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/equipment/CFE-vehicles-and-aircraft/2013/2013.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by the [[Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle]] as the primary [[armoured personnel carrier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23237.aspx|title=The British Army – Warrior infantry fighting vehicle|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410035242/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23237.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the many variants of the [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] and [[FV432|Bulldog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/m/MLV.htm|title=Multi-role Light Vehicle|date=26 July 2006|publisher=Defense-update.com|accessdate=28 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429185833/http://www.defense-update.com/products/m/MLV.htm|archive-date=29 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light armoured units often utilise the [[MWMIK|Supacat &quot;Jackal&quot; MWMIK]] and [[Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle|Coyote]] for reconnaissance and fire support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23234.aspx|title=The British Army – Reconnaissance vehicles|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316023100/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23234.aspx|archive-date=16 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Artillery ====
The army has three main artillery systems: the [[MLRS|Multi Launch Rocket System]] (MLRS), the [[AS-90]] and the [[L118 light gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23208.aspx|title=The British Army – Artillery and air defence|last=cgsmediacomma-amc-dig-shared@mod.uk|first=The British Army|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410084443/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23208.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLRS, first used in [[Operation Granby]], has an {{convert|85|km|adj=on}} range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/uk-complex-weapons/guided-multiple-launch-rocket-system-gmlrs/|title=Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) – Think Defence|work=Think Defence|access-date=17 March 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318084429/http://www.thinkdefence.co.uk/uk-complex-weapons/guided-multiple-launch-rocket-system-gmlrs/|archive-date=18 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AS-90 is a 155&amp;nbsp;mm self-propelled armoured gun with a {{convert|24|km|adj=on}} range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0046.html |title=AS-90 |publisher=Armedforces.co.uk |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426043554/http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0046.html |archive-date=26 April 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The L118 light gun is a 105&amp;nbsp;mm towed gun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_105mm_light_gun.html 105 mm Light Gun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220040742/http://www.baesystems.com/ProductsServices/l_and_a_ls_105mm_light_gun.html |date=20 February 2011 }} BAe Systems&lt;/ref&gt; To identify artillery targets, the army operates weapon locators such as the [[Mobile Artillery Monitoring Battlefield Radar|MAMBA Radar]] and utilises [[artillery sound ranging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/regiments/24678.aspx|title=The British Army – 5 Regiment|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420013606/http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/regiments/24678.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For air defence it uses the Short-Range Air Defence (SHORAD) [[Rapier (missile)|Rapier FSC missile system]], widely deployed since the [[Falklands War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armedforces-int.com/projects/rapier_missile.html |title=Rapier missile |publisher=Armedforces-int.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513121332/http://www.armedforces-int.com/projects/rapier_missile.html |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Very Short-Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) [[Starstreak (missile)|Starstreak HVM]] (high-velocity missile) launched by a single soldier or from a vehicle-mounted launcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/events/exhibitions/dsei2007/sections/daily/day1/starstreak-ii-sighted.shtml Starstreak II sighted] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412045238/http://www.janes.com/events/exhibitions/dsei2007/sections/daily/day1/starstreak-ii-sighted.shtml |date=12 April 2009 }} Janes&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protected mobility ====
Where armour is not required or mobility and speed are favoured the British Army utilises protected patrol vehicles, such as the Panther variant of the [[Iveco LMV]], the [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]], and variants of the [[Cougar (vehicle)|Cougar]] family (such as the Ridgeback, Husky and Mastiff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23235.aspx|title=The British Army – Protected patrol vehicles|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410084656/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23235.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For day-to-day utility work the army commonly uses the [[Land Rover Wolf]], which is based on the [[Land Rover Defender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/defender/|title=Land Rover Defender|publisher=Landrover.com|accessdate=28 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405215951/http://www.landrover.com/gb/en/lr/defender/|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Engineers, utility and signals ====

Specialist engineering vehicles include bomb-disposal robots and the modern variants of the [[Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers]], including the Titan bridge-layer, [[Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers|Trojan]] combat-engineer vehicle, [[Terrier Armoured Digger]] and [[Python Minefield Breaching System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23253.aspx|title=The British Army – Engineering equipment|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211082357/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23253.aspx|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day-to-day utility work uses a series of support vehicles, including six-, nine- and fifteen-tonne trucks (often called &quot;Bedfords&quot;, after a historic utility vehicle), heavy-equipment transporters (HET), close-support tankers, quad bikes and ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23267.aspx|title=The British Army – All-terrain mobility platform (ATMP)|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211082155/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23267.aspx|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23207.aspx|title=The British Army – Engineering and logistics|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508211348/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23207.aspx|archive-date=8 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactical communication uses the [[Bowman (communications system)|Bowman]] radio system, and operational or strategic communication is controlled by the [[Royal Corps of Signals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/signals/signals.aspx|title=The British Army – Royal Corps of Signals|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123002754/http://www.army.mod.uk/signals/signals.aspx|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aviation ====

The [[British Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] (AAC) provides direct aviation support, with the [[Royal Air Force]] providing support helicopters. The primary attack helicopter is the [[Westland WAH-64 Apache]], a [[Licensed production|licence-built]], modified version of the US [[AH-64 Apache]] which replaced the Westland Lynx AH7 in the anti-tank role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx |title=Apache |publisher=Army.mod.uk |accessdate=28 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315075815/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/aircraft/1531.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other helicopters include the [[Westland Gazelle]] (a light surveillance aircraft),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23289.aspx|title=The British Army – Gazelle|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410023734/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23289.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bell 212]] (in jungle &quot;hot and high&quot; environments)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avhuey.html |title=Bell Huey |publisher=Vectorsite.net |accessdate=28 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405092751/http://www.vectorsite.net/avhuey.html |archivedate= 5 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat]], a dedicated [[intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance]] (ISTAR) helicopter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23210.aspx|title=The British Army – Aircraft|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207044743/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23210.aspx|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Eurocopter AS 365N Dauphin]] is used for [[special operations]] aviation,{{sfn|Ripley|2008|p=10}} and the [[Britten-Norman Islander]] is a light, fixed-wing aircraft used for airborne reconnaissance and [[command and control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britten-norman.com/products/bn2b/ |title=Islander |publisher=Britten-norman.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101541/http://www.britten-norman.com/products/bn2b/ |archive-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The army operates two [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s ('UAV's) in a surveillance role: the small [[Lockheed Martin Desert Hawk III]] and the larger [[Thales Watchkeeper WK450]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/british-army-praises-performance-of-watchkeeper-during-debut-406159/|title=British Army praises performance of Watchkeeper during debut deployment|publisher=Flight global|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810012220/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/british-army-praises-performance-of-watchkeeper-during-debut-406159/|archive-date=10 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23278.aspx|title=The British Army – Unmanned Air Systems|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410161349/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23278.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

! [[Bermuda]]
| 1701
| [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]]: Colonial Militia and volunteers existed from 1612 to 1816. The regular English Army, then British Army, [[Bermuda Garrison]] was first established by an [[Independent Company]] in 1701.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/britarmy.htm|title=British Army in Bermuda from 1701 to 1977|publisher=Bermuda On Line|accessdate=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723035420/http://www.bermuda-online.org/britarmy.htm|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers were recruited into the regular army and the [[Board of Ordnance]] Military Corps for part-time, local-service from the 1830s to the 1850s due to the lack of a Militia. The British Government considered Bermuda as an Imperial fortress, rather than a colony. After the French Revolution, the [[Governor of Bermuda]] was normally a military officer (usually a Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers) in charge of all military forces in Bermuda, with the Bermuda Garrison falling under the Nova Scotia Command. From 1868, the Bermuda Garrison became the independent Bermuda Command, with Governors being Lieutenant-Generals or Major Generals occupying the role of Commander-in-Chief or General Officer Commanding (GOC). Locally recruited reserve units, the Royal Artillery-badged [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] (BVRC) were raised again from 1894, later joined by the Royal Engineers-badged [[Bermuda Volunteer Engineers]] (1931-1946), [[General Service Corps]]-badged [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (1939-1946), and a Home Guard (1942-1946). After the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] was redesignated a naval base in 1951, the army garrison was closed in 1957, leaving only the part-time BMA (re-tasked as infantry in 1953, though still badged and uniformed as Royal Artillery) and BVRC (renamed Bermuda Rifles in 1949). The Bermuda Command Headquarters and all regular army personnel other than members of the Permanent Staff of the local Territorials and the [[Aide-de-Camp]] to the Governor of Bermuda (today normally a Captain from the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] employed full-time for the duration of the appointment) were withdrawn. Home defence has been provided by the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] since formed by the 1965 amalgamation of the BMA and Bermuda Rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-anglian-soldiers-boost-bermuda-regiment|title=Royal Anglian soldiers boost Bermuda Regiment|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723035810/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/royal-anglian-soldiers-boost-bermuda-regiment|archive-date=23 July 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Formation and structure}}Structure ==
{{British Army Arms}}
{{Main|Units of the British Army}}

[[Army Headquarters (United Kingdom)|Army Headquarters]] is located in [[Andover, Hampshire]]. The army's structure is broadly similar to the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]], in that the four-star (general-equivalent) field commands have been eliminated. Under the Army 2020 Command structure, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] is in charge of Army Headquarters. There are four lieutenant-general posts in Army headquarters: the [[Deputy Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Deputy Chief of the General Staff]], the [[Commander Field Army]], the Commander [[Home Command (British Army)|Home Command]] and the Commander [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482984/20151201-FOI201510480_76137_CFA_Restructure_ArmySec.pdf|title=Freedom of Information Act answer from Army Headquarters|publisher=Army Headquarters|accessdate=13 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222154409/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482984/20151201-FOI201510480_76137_CFA_Restructure_ArmySec.pdf|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army Headquarters is responsible for providing forces at operational readiness for employment by the [[Permanent Joint Headquarters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

The command structure is hierarchical, with [[Division (military)|divisions]] and [[brigade]]s controlling groups of units. Major units are [[regiment]]/[[battalion]]-sized, and minor units are [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized units (or [[platoon]]s). All units are Regular (full-time) or [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] (part-time).&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Naming conventions of units differ for historical reasons, creating some confusion; the term &quot;battalion&quot; in the infantry is synonymous with a cavalry, artillery or engineer regiment, and the infantry &quot;company&quot; is synonymous with an engineer or cavalry squadron and an artillery battery. The table below illustrates the different names for equivalent units.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot; /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|Squadron

|}
Adding to the confusion is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the [[Royal Artillery]] consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] are not [[corps]]-sized, but corps in this instance are administrative branches consisting of several battalions or regiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

=== Operational structure ===
{{See also|List of units and formations of the British Army 2020}}

The forces of the British Army after the [[Army 2020 Refine]] reforms are organised in garrison as:
*The [[3rd (United Kingdom) Division|3rd Division]] and A modified [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] will be the Army's primary armoured war-fighting force. Comprising: 1st Armoured Infantry Brigade, 12th Armoured Infantry Brigade, 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade, 1st Artillery Brigade, 101st Logistic Brigade, 25th Engineer Group, 7th Air Defence Group. By 2020, this division will reorganise and consist of two armoured infantry brigades and two strike brigades.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/33449.aspx|title=The British Army – Army 2020 Refine|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126104357/http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/33449.aspx|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review – Army:Written statement – HCWS367|website=UK Parliament|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220190956/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|archive-date=20 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Division]], with its blend of lighter infantry, logistics, engineer and medics will provide more strategic choice and a range of capabilities, conducting capacity building, stabilization operations, disaster relief and UK resilience operations. It will include: 4th (Infantry) Brigade, 7th (Infantry) Brigade, 11th (Infantry) Brigade, 51st (Infantry) Brigade, 8th Engineer Brigade, 102nd Logistic Brigade, 104th Logistic Brigade, 2nd Medical Brigade;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; 
* The [[6th (United Kingdom) Division]], which will provide forces for asymmetric warfare, intelligence, counter-intelligence, [[cyber warfare]] and unconventional fighting will include: 1st Signal Brigade, 11th Signal Brigade, 1st Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Brigade, 77th Brigade and the Specialist Infantry Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Army restructures to confront evolving threats |url=https://www.army.mod.uk/news-and-events/news/2019/08/army-restructures-to-confront-evolving-threats/ |work=British Army |location=Upavon |date=1 August 2019 |access-date=2 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For operational tasks the most common unit is the [[Battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]], formed around a combat unit and supported by units (or sub-units) from other areas. An example of a battlegroup in the Reactive Force (e.g. the 1st Brigade) would be two companies of armoured infantry (e.g. from the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment), one squadron of heavy armour (e.g. A Squadron of the Royal Tank Regiment), a company of engineers (e.g. B Company of the 22nd Engineer Regiment), a battery of artillery (e.g. D Battery of the 1st Regiment of the Royal Horse Artillery) and smaller attachments from medical, logistic and intelligence units. Typically organised and commanded by a battlegroup headquarters and named after the unit which provided the most combat units, in this example it would be the 1 Mercian Battlegroup). This creates a self-sustaining mixed formation of armour, infantry, artillery, engineers and support units, typically 600 to 1,000 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot; /&gt;

The table below demonstrates how three or four battlegroups make up a [[brigade]] and three or four brigades make up a [[Division (military)|division.]]  A division is currently the largest unit the British Army is capable of deploying independently, although it could be grouped with three or four other divisions from a multi-national coalition to form a [[corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SAS&quot;&gt;

[[File:1945 Order of Precedence of the British Army.jpg|thumb|1945 Order of Precedence of the British Army]]
The British Army historically included many units from what are now separate [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] realms. When the [[English Empire]] was established in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies in the early 17th century there was no standing English Army, only the [[Militia (British Dominions and Crown Colonies)|Militia]], and this was extended to the colonies. Colonial militias defended colonies single-handedly at first against indigenous peoples and European competitors. Once the standing English Army, later the British Army, came into existence, the colonial militias fought side-by-side with it in a number of wars, including the [[Seven Years' War]]. Some of the colonial militias rebelled during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]]. Militia fought alongside the regular British Army (and native allies) in defending British North America from their former countrymen during the [[War of 1812]]. With the growth of the empire around the world, ''&quot;non-European&quot;'' (i.e. non-white, except for officers) units were recruited in many colonies and [[protectorate]]s, but most were deemed auxiliaries and not part of the British Army. The [[West India Regiment]]s were an exception, as they were fully incorporated into the British Army, but were kept outside of Europe and non-whites were denied commissions. Locally raised units in strategically-located colonies (including Bermuda, Gibraltar, Malta) and the Channel Islands were generally more fully integrated into the British Army as evident from their appearances in British Army lists, unlike units such as the [[King's African Rifles]]. The larger colonies (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, etc.) mostly achieved [[Dominion|Commonwealth Dominion]] status before or after the First World War and were granted full legislative independence in 1931. While remaining within the British Empire, this placed their governments on a par with the British government, and hence their military units comprised separate armies (e.g. the [[Australian Army]]), although Canada retained the term &quot;militia&quot; for its military forces until the Second World War. From the 1940s, these dominions and many colonies chose full independence, usually becoming [[Commonwealth realm]]s (as member states of the Commonwealth are known today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 | work=National Archives of Australia: Documenting a Democracy | url = http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 | accessdate=8 August 2005 | url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075624/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=96 |archivedate=16 July 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html|last=Bowden |first=James | first2=Philippe |last2=Lagassé | title=Succeeding to the Canadian throne | date=6 December 2012 |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen | accessdate=6 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding%2BCanadian%2Bthrone/7651371/story.html |archivedate=10 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the army primarily recruits within the United Kingdom, it accepts applications from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens and (occasionally) those from friendly nations who meet certain criteria. In 2016, it was decided to open all roles to women in 2018; women had not previously been permitted to join the [[Combat Arms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/join/Women-in-the-Army.aspx|title=The British Army – Women in the Army|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202170721/http://www.army.mod.uk/join/Women-in-the-Army.aspx|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Army is an equal-opportunity employer (with some exceptions due to its medical standards), and does not discriminate based on race, religion or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/join/Equality-and-diversity.aspx|title=The British Army – Diversity|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212094121/http://www.army.mod.uk/join/Equality-and-diversity.aspx|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimum age is 16 (after the end of [[GCSE]]s), although soldiers under 18 may not serve in operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/24453.aspx|title=The British Army – Contact us/FAQs|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420233723/http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/24453.aspx|archive-date=20 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum recruitment age is 35 years and 6 months, and the maximum age for Army Reserve soldiers is 49 years old, {{as of|2018|November|lc=y}}. A soldier would traditionally enlist for a term of 22 years, although recently there has been a shift towards 12-year terms with a 22-year option. A soldier is not normally permitted to leave until they have served for at least four years, and must give 12 months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|title=British Army Terms of Service|date=April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623005208/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/TermsofService.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oath of allegiance ===
All soldiers and commissioned officers must take an oath of allegiance upon joining the Army, a process known as attestation. Those who wish to swear by [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] use the following words:&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|I, [soldier's or commissioned officer's name], swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]], her heirs and successors and that I will as in duty bound honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, her heirs and successors in person, [[British Crown|crown]] and dignity against all enemies and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors and of the generals and officers set over me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-oath-of-allegiance.html#selfless|title=British Army Oath of Allegiance|accessdate=29 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224084204/http://www.whodareswins.com/british-army-oath-of-allegiance.html#selfless|archive-date=24 December 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Each regiment and corps has distinctive insignia, such as a [[cap badge]], [[beret]], [[tactical recognition flash]] or [[stable belt]]. Many units also call soldiers of different ranks by different names; a NATO OR-1 (private) is called a guardsman in Guards regiments, a gunner in artillery units and a sapper in engineer units. These names do not affect a soldier's pay or role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/structure/32321.aspx|title=The British Army – Ranks|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041202/https://www.army.mod.uk/structure/32321.aspx|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Army uniform has sixteen categories, ranging from ceremonial uniforms to combat dress to evening wear. No. 8 Dress, the day-to-day uniform, is known as &quot;Personal Clothing System – Combat Uniform&quot; (PCS-CU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23215.aspx|title=The British Army – Personal clothing|website=www.army.mod.uk|language=en|access-date=9 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410145655/http://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/23215.aspx|archive-date=10 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of a [[Multi-Terrain Pattern]] (MTP) windproof smock, a lightweight jacket and trousers with ancillary items such as [[Long underwear|thermals]] and [[Raincoat|waterproofs]].&lt;ref name=dresscodes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forces80.com/dresscodes.htm|title=Dress Codes and Head Dress|publisher=Forces 80|accessdate=7 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219085020/http://www.forces80.com/dresscodes.htm|archive-date=19 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army has introduced [[tactical recognition flash]]es (TRFs); worn on the right arm of a combat uniform, the insignia denotes the wearer's regiment or corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30077060|title=badge, unit, tactical recognition flash, British, Royal Corps of Signals|publisher=Imperial War Museum|accessdate=7 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308135136/http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30077060|archive-date=8 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working [[Headgear|headdress]] is typically a [[beret]], whose colour indicates its wearer's type of regiment.
