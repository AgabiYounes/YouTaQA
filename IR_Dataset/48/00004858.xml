The extent of the civil parish corresponds fairly closely to that of the town so is mostly urban in character. It is bordered to the east by [[Cardinham]] parish, to the southeast by [[Lanhydrock]] parish, to the southwest and west by [[Lanivet]] parish, and to the north by [[Helland]] parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapping.cornwall.gov.uk/website/ccmap/|title=Cornwall Council online mapping|publisher=Mapping.cornwall.gov.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050041/http://mapping.cornwall.gov.uk/website/ccmap/ |archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodmin had a population of 14,736 as of the 2011 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/data-and-research/data-by-topic/population/town-populations|title=Bodmin Population 2011|accessdate=5 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205171836/http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/data-and-research/data-by-topic/population/town-populations|archivedate=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly the [[county town]] of Cornwall until the Crown Courts moved to [[Truro]] which is also the administrative centre (before 1835 the county town was [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]]). Bodmin was in the administrative [[North Cornwall]] District until local government reorganisation in 2009 abolished the District (''see also [[Politics of Cornwall|Cornwall Council]]''). The town is part of the [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]] parliamentary constituency, which is represented by [[Scott Mann (politician)|Scott Mann]] MP.

Bodmin Town Council is made up of sixteen councillors who are elected to serve a term of four years. Each year, the Council elects one of its number as Mayor to serve as the town's civic leader and to chair council meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodmin.gov.uk|title=Bodmin Council website|publisher=Bodmin.gov.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022161430/http://www.bodmin.gov.uk/ |archivedate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation and origin of the name==
Bodmin lies in the east of Cornwall, south-west of [[Bodmin Moor]]. It has been suggested that the town's name comes from an archaic word in the [[Cornish language]] &quot;bod&quot; (meaning a dwelling; the later word is &quot;bos&quot;) and a contraction of &quot;menegh&quot; (monks). The &quot;monks' dwelling&quot; may refer to an early monastic settlement instituted by St. Guron, which [[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] took as his site. Guron is said to have departed to [[St Goran]] on the arrival of Petroc.

The hamlets of Cooksland, [[Dunmere, Cornwall|Dunmere]] and [[Turfdown]] are in the parish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorebritain.info/browse/cornwall/ |title=Cornwall; Explore Britain|publisher=Explorebritian.info|accessdate=17 September 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602231052/http://www.explorebritain.info/browse/cornwall/ |archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Saint Petroc|St. Petroc]] founded a monastery in Bodmin in the 6th century&lt;ref&gt;[[Doble, G. H.]] (1965) ''The Saints of Cornwall: part 4''. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 132–166&lt;/ref&gt; and gave the town its alternative name of ''Petrockstow''. The monastery was deprived of some of its lands at the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] but at the time of [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] still held eighteen manors, including Bodmin, Padstow and Rialton.&lt;ref&gt;Thorn, C. et al. (eds.) (1979) ''Cornwall''. Chichester: Phillimore; entries 4,3–4.22&lt;/ref&gt; Bodmin is one of the oldest towns in Cornwall, and the only large Cornish settlement recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opendomesday.org/place/SX0767/bodmin/|title=Bodmin – Domesday Book|first=Anna|last=Powell-Smith|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century the Norman church of St Petroc was largely rebuilt and stands as one of the largest churches in Cornwall (the largest after the cathedral at Truro). Also built at that time was an abbey of canons regular, now mostly ruined. For most of Bodmin's history, the [[tin]] industry was a mainstay of the economy.

The name of the town probably derives from the Cornish &quot;Bod-meneghy&quot;, meaning &quot;dwelling of or by the sanctuary of monks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HoB&quot;&gt;{{cite web

An inscription on a stone built into the wall of a summer house in Lancarffe furnishes proof of a settlement in Bodmin in the early [[Middle Ages]]. It is a memorial to one &quot;Duno[.]atus son of Me[.]cagnus&quot; and has been dated from the 6th to 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Discussion, photo and bibliography in Okasha, Elisabeth (1993).

[[File:Ancient Stone Cross on Old Callywith Road - geograph.org.uk - 757140.jpg|thumb|A Cornish cross on Old Callywith Road]]
Arthur Langdon (1896) records three Cornish crosses at Bodmin; one was near the Berry Tower, one was outside Bodmin Gaol and another was in a field near Castle Street Hill.&lt;ref&gt;He also mentions a fourth cross which is missing, but may have been the same as the third.--Langdon, A. G. (1896) ''Old Cornish Crosses''. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 46, 57, 74 &amp; 227&lt;/ref&gt; There is also [[Carminow Cross]] at a road junction southeast of the town.
   
The [[Black Death]] killed half of Bodmin's population in the mid 14th century (1,500 people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5749|title=Black Death|accessdate=17 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025033431/http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=5749 |archivedate=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebellions===
Bodmin was the centre of three Cornish uprisings. The first was the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] when a Cornish army, led by [[Michael An Gof]], a [[blacksmith]] from [[St. Keverne]] and [[Thomas Flamank]], a [[lawyer]] from Bodmin, marched to [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in London where they were eventually defeated by 10,000 men of the King's army under Baron Daubeny. Then, in the autumn of 1497, [[Perkin Warbeck]] tried to usurp the throne from [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Warbeck was proclaimed King Richard IV in Bodmin but Henry had little difficulty crushing the uprising. In 1549, Cornishmen, allied with other rebels in neighbouring [[Devon]], rose once again in rebellion when the staunchly Protestant [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] tried to impose a new [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]]. The lower classes of Cornwall and Devon were still strongly attached to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion and again a Cornish army was formed in Bodmin which marched across the border into Devon to lay siege to [[Exeter]]. This became known as the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]]. Proposals to translate the Prayer Book into Cornish were suppressed and in total 4,000 people were killed in the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Sturt, John (1987) Revolt in the West: the Western Rebellion of 1549. Exeter: Devon Books&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodmin Borough Police===
The Borough of Bodmin was one of the 178 municipal boroughs which under the auspices of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] was mandated to create an electable council and a Police Watch Committee responsible for overseeing a police force in the town. The new system directly replaced the Parish Constables that had policed the borough since time immemorial and brought paid, uniformed and accountable law enforcement for the first time. Bodmin Borough Police was the municipal police force for the Borough of Bodmin from 1836 to 1866. The creation of the [[Cornwall Constabulary]] in 1857 put pressure on smaller municipal police forces to merge with the county. The two-man force of Bodmin came under threat almost immediately, but it would take until 1866 for the Mayor of Bodmin and the Chairman of the Police Watch Committee to agree on the terms of amalgamation. After a public enquiry, the force was disbanded in January 1866 and policing of the borough was deferred to the county from thereon.

===&quot;Bodmin Town&quot;===
The song &quot;Bodmin Town&quot; was collected from the Cornishman William Nichols at [[Whitchurch, Devon|Whitchurch]], [[Devon]], in 1891 by [[Sabine Baring-Gould]] who published a version in his ''A Garland of Country Song'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;A more authentic version based on the Baring-Gould MSS. appeared in 1974 in Gordon Hitchcock's ''Songs of the West Country''.--Dave Arthur's notes on Martyn Wyndham Read's ''Andy's Gone'' Broadside BRO 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parish church of St Petroc===
{{Main|St Petroc's Church, Bodmin}}
[[File:St Petroc's Church, Bodmin - geograph.org.uk - 51028.jpg|thumb|St Petroc's Church]]
The existing church building is dated 1469–72 and was until the building of [[Truro Cathedral]] the largest church in Cornwall. The tower which remains from the original Norman church and stands on the north side of the church (the upper part is 15th century) was, until the loss of its spire in 1699, 150&amp;nbsp;ft high. The building underwent two Victorian restorations and another in 1930. It is now listed Grade I. There are a number of interesting monuments, most notably that of Prior Vivian which was formerly in the Priory Church (Thomas Vivian's effigy lying on a chest: black [[Catacleuse stone]] and grey marble). The font of a type common in Cornwall is of the 12th century: large and finely carved.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''; second ed. Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Harold Sedding|Sedding, Edmund H]]. (1909) ''Norman Architecture in Cornwall: a handbook to old ecclesiastical architecture''. London: Ward &amp; Co.; pp. 21–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other churches===
The Chapel of St Thomas Becket is a ruin of a 14th-century building in Bodmin churchyard. The holy well of St Guron is a small stone building at the churchyard gate. The Berry Tower is all that remains of the former church of the Holy Rood and there are even fewer remains from the substantial Franciscan Friary established ca. 1240: a gateway in Fore Street and two pillars elsewhere in the town. The Roman Catholic [[Abbey of St Mary and St Petroc]], formerly belonging to the [[Canons Regular]] of the Lateran was built in 1965 next to the already existing seminary.&lt;ref name=&quot;pevsner1970&quot;&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner, N.]] (1970) ''Cornwall'', second ed. Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic parish of Bodmin includes a large area of North Cornwall and there are churches also at Wadebridge, Padstow and Tintagel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarysbodmin.org.uk/ |title=Parish of St Mary, Bodmin |accessdate=13 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520182701/http://stmarysbodmin.org.uk/ |archivedate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 the Roman Catholic mass was celebrated in Bodmin for the first time since 1539. A church was planned in the 1930s but delayed by the [[Second World War]]: the Church of St Mary and St Petroc was eventually consecrated in 1965:&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, Peter (2005) ''Tintagel: a portrait of a parish''. Cambridge: Cambridge Books {{ISBN|978-0-9550097-0-9}}; p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; it was built next to the already existing seminary.&lt;ref name=&quot;pevsner1970&quot;/&gt; There are also five other churches in Bodmin, including a Methodist church.

===Institutions===
[[Bodmin Jail]], operational for over 150 years but now a semi-ruin, was built in the late 18th century, and was the first British prison to hold prisoners in separate cells (though often up to ten at a time) rather than communally. Over fifty prisoners condemned at the Bodmin [[Assize Court]] were hanged at the prison. It was also used for temporarily holding prisoners sentenced to transportation, awaiting transfer to the prison hulks lying in the highest navigable reaches of the [[River Fowey]]. Also, during the [[First World War]] the prison held some of Britain's priceless national treasures including the [[Domesday Book]], the ring and the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]].

==='Beating the bounds' and 'hurling'===
In 1865–66 [[William Robert Hicks]] was mayor of Bodmin, when he revived the custom of [[Beating the bounds]] of the town. He was – according to the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] – a very good man of business. This still takes place more or less every five years and concludes with a game of [[Cornish hurling]]. Hurling survives as a traditional part of beating the bounds at Bodmin, commencing at the close of the 'Beat'. The game is organised by the [[Rotary club]] of Bodmin and was last played in 2015. The game is started by the Mayor of Bodmin by throwing a silver ball into a body of water known as the &quot;Salting Pool&quot;. There are no teams and the hurl follows a set route. The aim is to carry the ball from the &quot;Salting Pool&quot; via the old [[A30 road|A30]], along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street. The participant carrying the ball when it reaches the turret clock will receive a £10 reward from the mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 |title=2010 Bodmin Hurl Rules|website=Rotary Club of Bodmin|accessdate=2 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005032340/http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&amp;ClubID=1019 |archivedate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2015, beating of the bounds and Cornish hurling took place at Bodmin 8 April organised by the [[Rotary club]] of Bodmin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.php?PgID=479138&amp;ClubID=1019 |accessdate=15 April 2015|title=Beating the Town Bounds {{ndash}} Photos|website=Rotary &amp; Lions Clubs of Bodmin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
