'''Bolventor''' ({{lang-kw|Bedhasbold}}) is a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] in [[Cornwall]], England, United Kingdom. It is situated in [[Altarnun]] [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] between [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] and [[Bodmin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 201 ''Plymouth &amp; Launceston'' {{ISBN|978-0-319-23146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy==
The hamlet has been said to take its name from the &quot;Bold Venture&quot; that it must have appeared to build a farm in this moorland, but this is probably [[folk etymology]], as &quot;Bol-&quot; is a common prefix in Cornish placenames. It is much more likely that the name derives from the 'Bold Adventure' tin-working area which was in operation near Jamaica Inn during the 1840s-1850s &lt;ref&gt;R. D. Penhallurick ''Tin in Antiquity'' (2008) Maney; p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jamaica Inn==
Bolventor is the location of the famous [[Jamaica Inn]] [[coaching inn]]. It is bypassed by a [[dual carriageway]] section of the [[A30 road|A30]] trunk road; before the bypass was built the hamlet straddled the A30 road.

[[Daphne du Maurier]], a former resident, chose Bolventor as the setting for her novel about Cornish [[smuggling|smugglers]] titled ''[[Jamaica Inn (novel)|Jamaica Inn]]''.  The inn that inspired the novel, Jamaica Inn, has stood beside the main road through the village since 1547. It is now a tourist attraction in its own right and dominates the hamlet. The Jamaica Inn was the subject of a paranormal investigation during a 2004 episode of reality television programme ''[[Most Haunted]]''.

==Church==

The former [[Holy Trinity Church, Bolventor|Holy Trinity Church]] that lies to the east of the hamlet closed some years ago. A mile from Bolventor there was a chapel of St Luke (from the 13th to the early 16th century): the font is now at the church of [[Tideford]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Church Guide'' (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Bolventor parish was established in 1846 (before that date the village was in St Neot parish; the new parish was made up of parts of St Neot, Altarnun and Cardinham parishes&lt;ref&gt;Beacham, Peter &amp; Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). ''Cornwall''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-300-12668-6}}; p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;) but has now been merged with [[Altarnun]].
