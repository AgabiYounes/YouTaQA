'''Robert Bellarmine''' ({{lang-it|Roberto Francesco Romolo Bellarmino}};  4 October 1542 – 17 September 1621) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Jesuit]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]].  He was [[canonization|canonized a saint]] in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jestice |first1=Phyllis G. |title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia |date=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-355-1 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=Robert+Bellarmine+canonization#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Bellarmine%20canonization&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named [[Doctor of the Church]], one of only 36.  He was one of the most important figures in the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Bellarmine was a professor of theology and later [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Roman College]], and in 1602 became [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Capua|Archbishop of Capua]]. He supported the reform decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. He is also widely remembered for his role in the [[Giordano Bruno]] affair, the [[Galileo affair]], and the trial of Friar [[Fulgenzio Manfredi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbings|first=Richard|url=https://archive.org/stream/werehereticseve00churgoog|title=Were &quot;Heretics&quot; Ever Burned Alive at Rome?|location=London|publisher=John Petheram|date=1852|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2019}}

==Early life==
Bellarmine was born at [[Montepulciano]], the son of noble, albeit impoverished, parents, Vincenzo Bellarmino and his wife Cinzia Cervini, who was the sister of [[Pope Marcellus II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=St. Robert Francis Romulus Bellarmine|volume=2|first=Sydney Fenn|last=Smith|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02411d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy he knew [[Virgil]] by heart and composed a number of poems in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin]]. One of his hymns, on [[Mary Magdalene]], is included in the [[Roman Breviary]].

He entered the Roman Jesuit novitiate in 1560, remaining in Rome three years. He then went to a Jesuit house at [[Mondovì]], in [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], where he learned [[Greek language|Greek]]. While at Mondovì, he came to the attention of [[Francis Adorno|Francesco Adorno]], the local Jesuit [[Provincial Superior]], who sent him to the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rule|first1=William Harris|title=Celebrated Jesuits|volume=2|year=1853|publisher=John Mason|location=London|page=20|chapter=A Jesuit cardinal: Robert Bellarmine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bellarmine's systematic studies of [[theology]] began at Padua in 1567 and 1568, where his teachers were adherents of [[Thomism]]. In 1569 he was sent to finish his studies at the [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]] in [[Flanders]]. There he was ordained, and obtained a reputation both as a professor and as a preacher. He was the first Jesuit to teach at the university, where the subject of his course was the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His residency in Leuven lasted seven years. In poor health, in 1576 he made a journey to Italy. Here he remained, commissioned by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] to lecture on [[polemical theology]] in the new [[Roman College]], now known as the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. Later, he would promote the cause of the beatification of [[Aloysius Gonzaga]], who had been a student at the college during Bellarmine's tenure.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

===New duties after 1589===
{{Jesuit}}
Until 1589, Bellarmine was occupied as professor of theology. After the murder in that year of [[Henry III of France]], [[Pope Sixtus V]] sent [[Enrico Caetani]] as [[Papal legate|legate]] to Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1585-ii.htm#Caetani|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Biographical Dictionary – Consistory of December 18, 1585|last=Miranda|first=Salvador|website=www2.fiu.edu|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to negotiate with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]], and chose Bellarmine to accompany him as theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1599#Bellarmino|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church – Biographical Dictionary – Consistory of March 3, 1599|last=Miranda|first=Salvador|website=www2.fiu.edu|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the city during its siege by [[Henry of Navarre]].

The next pope, [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]], said of him, &quot;the Church of God had not his equal in learning&quot;.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Bellarmine was made rector of the [[Roman College]] in 1592, examiner of [[bishop]]s in 1598, and cardinal in 1599. Immediately after his appointment as Cardinal, Pope Clement made him a [[Inquisition|Cardinal Inquisitor]], in which capacity he served as one of the judges at the trial of [[Giordano Bruno]], and concurred in the decision which condemned Bruno to be [[burned at the stake]] as a [[heretic]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;47&amp;ndash;48)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Pope Sixtus V in 1590, the Count of Olivares wrote to King Philip III of Spain, &quot;Bellarmine ... would not do for a Pope, for he is mindful only of the interests of the Church and is unresponsive to the reasons of princes.&quot;&lt;ref name=rice/&gt; In 1602 he was made [[archbishop of Capua]]. He had written against pluralism and non-residence of bishops within their [[diocese]]s. As bishop he put into effect the reforming decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. He received some votes in the 1605 [[papal election|conclaves]] which elected [[Pope Leo XI]], [[Pope Paul V]], and in 1621 when [[Pope Gregory XV]] was elected, but him being a Jesuit stood against him in the judgment of many of the cardinals.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] saw Bellarmine in Rome at a service on All Saints Day (1 November) 1614 and, exempting him alone from a general castigation of cardinals, described him as &quot;a little lean old man&quot; who lived &quot;more retired&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=Thomas Hobbes: a Biography|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|date=1999|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Galileo case===
{{Main|Galileo affair}}
In 1616, on the orders of Paul V, Bellarmine summoned [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], notified him of a forthcoming [[decree]] of the [[Congregation of the Index]] condemning the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] doctrine of the mobility of the Earth and the immobility of the Sun, and ordered him to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p. 126)]].&lt;div id=&quot;disputedinjunction&quot; zoompage-fontsize=&quot;12&quot;&gt; The Vatican archives contain an unsigned copy of a more strongly worded formal injunction purporting to have been served on Galileo shortly after Bellarmine's admonition, ordering him &quot;not to hold, teach, or defend&quot; the condemned doctrine &quot;in any way whatever, either orally or in writing&quot;, and threatening him with imprisonment if he refused to obey.&lt;/div&gt;  However, whether this injunction was ever properly served on Galileo is a subject of much scholarly disagreement.[[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(Blackwell, 1991, p. 127&amp;ndash;128)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo agreed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p.119)]]. Some scholars have suggested that Galileo's agreement was only obtained after some initial resistance. Otherwise, the formal injunction purporting to have been served on him during his meeting with Bellarmine [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]] would have been contrary to the Pope's instructions [[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|(Fantoli. 2005, pp.121, 124)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Galileo later complained of rumours to the effect that he had been forced to abjure and do penance, Bellarmine wrote out a certificate denying the rumors, stating that Galileo had merely been notified of the decree and informed that, as a consequence of it, the Copernican doctrine could not be &quot;defended or held&quot;. Unlike the previously mentioned formal injunction [[#disputedinjunction|(see earlier footnote)]], this certificate would have allowed Galileo to continue using and teaching the mathematical content of Copernicus's theory as a purely theoretical device for predicting the apparent motions of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell [[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|(1991, p.127)]]. Maurice Finocchiaro's English translations of the purported [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#specinj formal injunction], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#indexdecree decree] of the Congregation of the Index and Cardinal Bellarmine's [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#certificate certificate] are available on-line.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=v1gFDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT124&amp;dq=bellarmine+galileo#v=onepage&amp;q=bellarmine%20galileo&amp;f=false |title = Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible|isbn = 9780268158934|last1 = Blackwell|first1 = Richard J.|date = 31 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some of his letters, Cardinal Bellarmine believed that a demonstration for heliocentrism could not be found because it would contradict the unanimous consent of the [[Fathers of the Church|Fathers]]' [[scriptural exegesis]], to which the [[Council of Trent]], in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth Session of the Council of Trent|date=8 April 1546|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds2.v.i.i.ii.html#v.i.i.ii-p0.55}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dogmatic definition|defined]] all Catholics must adhere. In other passages, Bellarmine argued that he did not support the heliocentric model for the lack of evidence of the time (&quot;I will not believe that there is such a demonstration, until it is shown me&quot;).

Bellarmine wrote to [[heliocentrism|heliocentrist]] [[Paolo Antonio Foscarini]] in 1615:&lt;ref name=&quot;letter to Foscarini&quot;&gt;Bellarmine's letter of 12 April 1615 to Foscarini, translated in {{Cite book|last=Finocchiaro|first=Maurice A. (ed.)|title=The Galileo Affair: a Documentary History|location=Berkeley|publisher=U. California P.|date=1989|pages=67–8|isbn=0520066626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Council [of Trent] prohibits interpreting Scripture against the common consensus of the Holy Fathers; and if Your Paternity wants to read not only the Holy Fathers, but also the modern commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Joshua, you will find all agreeing in the literal interpretation that the sun is in heaven and turns around the earth with great speed, and that the earth is very far from heaven and sits motionless at the center of the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;and&lt;blockquote&gt;I say that if there were a true demonstration that the sun is at the center of the world and the earth in the third heaven, and that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun, then one would have to proceed with great care in explaining the Scriptures that appear contrary, and say rather that we do not understand them, than that what is demonstrated is false. But I will not believe that there is such a demonstration, until it is shown me. Nor is it the same to demonstrate that by supposing the sun to be at the center and the earth in heaven one can [[Saving the phenomena|save the appearances]], and to demonstrate that in truth the sun is at the center and the earth in heaven; for I believe the first demonstration may be available, but I have very great doubts about the second, and in case of doubt one must not abandon the Holy Scripture as interpreted by the Holy Fathers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1633, nearly twelve years after Bellarmine's death, Galileo was again called before the Inquisition in this matter. Galileo produced Bellarmine's certificate for his defense at the trial.

In his article on Bellarmine in the ''[[Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]'', [[Ernan McMullin]] cites [[Pierre Duhem]]  and [[Karl Popper]] as prominent adherents to an &quot;often repeated&quot; view that &quot;in one respect, at least, Bellarmine had shown himself a better scientist than Galileo&quot;, insofar as he supposedly denied that a &quot;strict proof&quot; of the Earth's motion could be possible on the grounds that an astronomical theory merely 'saves the appearances' without necessarily revealing what 'really happens.{{' &quot;}} McMullin himself emphatically rejects that view as untenable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|first=Ernan|last=McMullin|title=Robert Bellarmine|url=|publisher=Scribner &amp; American Council of Learned Societies|editor-last=Gillispie|editor-first=Charles|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]|year=2008|ref=Reference-McMullin-2008|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bellarmine retired to the Jesuit college of St. Andrew in Rome, where he died on 17 September 1621, aged 78.
[[File:San Roberto Bellarmino.jpg|thumb|271x271px|16th-century portrait of Bellarmine]]

==Works==
Bellarmine's books bear the stamp of their period; the effort for literary elegance (so-called ''&quot;maraviglia&quot;'') had given place to a desire to pile up as much material as possible, to embrace the whole field of human knowledge, and incorporate it into theology. His controversial works provoked many replies, and were studied for some decades after his death.{{Efn|''On Laymen or Secular People''; ''On the Temporal Power of the Pope. Against William Barclay''; and ''On the Primary Duty of the Supreme Pontiff'', are included in Bellarmine, [https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/on-temporal-and-spiritual-authority ''On Temporal and Spiritual Authority''], Stefania Tutino (ed.) trans., Indianapolis, IN: Liberty Fund, 2012|name=|group=}} At Leuven he made extensive studies in the [[Church Fathers]] and [[scholastic theologian]]s, which gave him the material for his book ''De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis'' (Rome, 1613). It was later revised and enlarged by [[Sirmond]], [[Labbeus]], and [[Casimir Oudin]]. Bellarmine wrote the preface to the new [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]].&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;. St. Robert Bellarmine also prepared for posterity his very own commentary on each of the Psalms. An English translation from the Latin was published in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecatholic2000.com/bell/psalms.shtml#_toc417747136|title=A COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF PSALMS|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ecatholic2000.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dogmatics===
{{main|Disputationes}}
From his research grew ''[[Disputationes de controversiis christianae fidei]]'' (also called ''Controversiae''), first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in 1581&amp;ndash;1593. This major work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various religious disputes between Catholics and Protestants. Bellarmine calmly and fairly reviewed the issues&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/chr/bellarmine.html|title=The Galileo Project {{!}} Christianity {{!}} Robert Cardinal Bellarmine|website=galileo.rice.edu|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and devoted eleven years to it while at the Roman College. In August 1590 [[Pope Sixtus V]] decided to place the first volume of the ''Disputationes'' on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index]] because Bellarmine argued in it that the Pope is not the temporal ruler of the whole world and that temporal rulers do not derive their authority to rule from God but from the [[consent of the governed]]. However Sixtus died before the revised Index was published, and the next Pope, [[Pope Urban VII|Urban VII]], removed the book from the Index during his brief twelve-day reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Richard J.|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=v1gFDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;lpg=PT123&amp;dq=Galileo,+Bellarmine+and+the+Bible,+Richard+J+Blackwell+urban+viii&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vBdFXv94hF&amp;sig=ACfU3U1kJgsqXLJEAitwAVSLqq4Z5zF2fw&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjmruGondnnAhWRyKQKHZwKBMYQ6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=urban%20vii%20index&amp;f=false%20Blackwell%20urban%20viii|title=Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible|date=1991-01-31|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|year=|isbn=978-0-268-15893-4|location=|page=30|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter 2: Bellarmine's Views Before the Galileo Affair|doi=10.2307/j.ctvpg847x|quote=Bellarmine himself was not a stranger to theological condemnation.

However Sixtus died before the revised ''Index'' was published, and the next pope, Urban VII, who reigned for only twelve days before his own death, removed Bellarmine’s book from the list during that brief period.

===Venetian Interdict===
{{main|Venetian Interdict}}
Under [[Pope Paul V]] (reigned 1605&amp;ndash;1621), a major conflict arose between [[Venice]] and the [[Papacy]]. [[Paolo Sarpi]], as spokesman for the Republic of Venice, protested against the papal [[interdict]], and reasserted the principles of the [[Council of Constance]] and of the [[Council of Basel]], denying the pope's authority in secular matters. Bellarmine wrote three rejoinders to the Venetian theologians, and may have warned Sarpi of an impending murderous attack, when in September 1607, an unfrocked friar and brigand by the name of Rotilio Orlandini planned to kill Sarpi for the sum of 8,000 crowns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 4: Fra Paolo Sarpi'' (Cambridge University Press 1906), p. 671&lt;/ref&gt; Orlandini's plot was discovered, and when he and his accomplices crossed from Papal into Venetian territory they were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Alexander (1893) ''Fra Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians'', London: Sampson, Low, Marston &amp; Co. pp. 114–117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegiance oath controversy and papal authority===
{{details|Oath of Allegiance of James I of England}}
Bellarmine also became involved in controversy with King [[James I of England]]. From a point of principle for [[English Catholics]], this debate drew in figures from much of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, ''James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (1997), pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; It raised the profile of both protagonists, King James as a champion of his own restricted [[Calvinist]] Protestantism, and Bellarmine for [[Counter-Reformation|Tridentine Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/bellarmine-jefferson-and-the-declaration-of-independence|title=Bellarmine, Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence|work=National Catholic Register|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devotional works===
During his retirement, he wrote several short books intended to help ordinary people in their spiritual life: ''De ascensione mentis in Deum per scalas rerum creatorum opusculum'' (''The Mind's Ascent to God –'' 1614) which was translated into English as ''Jacob's Ladder'' (1638) without acknowledgement by [[Henry Isaacson (theologian)|Henry Isaacson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A08025.0001.001?view=toc|title=Iacob's ladder consisting of fifteene degrees or ascents to the knowledge of God by the consideration of his creatures and attributes.|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art of Dying Well'' (1619) (in Latin, English translation under this title by [[Edward Coffin]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Edward Coffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Seven Words on the Cross''.

==Canonization and final resting place==
Bellarmine was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1930;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tutino |first1=Stefania |title=Empire of Souls: Robert Bellarmine and the Christian Commonwealth |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-978058-7 |page=289 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k1czB51a8eEC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;lpg=PA289&amp;dq=Robert+Bellarmine+canonization#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Bellarmine%20canonization&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following year he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]]. His remains, in a cardinal's red robes, are displayed behind glass under a side altar in the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of Saint Ignatius]], the chapel of the Roman College, next to the body of his student, [[Aloysius Gonzaga]], as he himself had wished. In the [[General Roman Calendar]] Saint Robert Bellarmine's [[feast day]] is on 17 September, the day of his death; but some continue to use pre-1969 calendars, in which for 37 years his feast day was on 13 May. The [[ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|rank]] assigned to his feast has been &quot;double&quot; (1932&amp;ndash;1959), &quot;third-class feast&quot; (1960&amp;ndash;1968), and since the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] &quot;[[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]]&quot;.

==Legacy==
[[Bellarmine University]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], Kentucky, is named after him, as are [[Bellarmine College Preparatory]] in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, [[Saint Robert Bellarmine Parish]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], Illinois, and [[Bellarmine Preparatory School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], Washington. [[Saint Joseph's University]], [[Fairfield University]], and [[Seattle University]] all have a Bellarmine Hall dedicated to the saint. The Jesuit [[Sogang University]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], has a Bellarmino Dormitory, named after his Italian name. The [[Ateneo de Manila University]], another Jesuit institution in the [[Philippines]], also has a Bellarmine Hall, which serves as a classroom building and home of the [[Ateneo de Manila University Press|University Press]].

St. Robert Bellarmine Church in Warrington, [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Archdiocese of Philadelphia]], is also the site of St. Joseph's/St. Robert's School, a K-8 grade [[Private school|private]], [[Roman-Catholic]] school.
