Politically, Bengal is currently divided between [[Bangladesh]] (which covers two-thirds of the region) and the [[India]]n territories of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]]'s [[Barak Valley]] (altogether cover the remaining one-third). In 2011, the population of Bengal was estimated to be 250&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name=&quot;factsanddetails&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://factsanddetails.com/india/Minorities_Castes_and_Regions_in_India/sub7_4b/entry-4198.html |title=Bengalis|work=Facts and Details |access-date=15 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730013507/http://factsanddetails.com/india/Minorities_Castes_and_Regions_in_India/sub7_4b/entry-4198.html |archive-date=30 July 2017 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mazumdar2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Arijit Mazumdar |title=Indian Foreign Policy in Transition: Relations with South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHJeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |date=27 August 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-69859-3 |pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, an estimated 160&amp;nbsp;million people live in Bangladesh and 91.3&amp;nbsp;million people live in West Bengal. The predominant [[ethnolinguistic group]] is the [[Bengalis|Bengali people]], who speak the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[Bengali language]]. [[Bengali Muslims]] are the majority in Bangladesh and [[Bengali Hindus]] are the majority in West Bengal and Tripura, while Barak Valley contains almost equal proportions of Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims. Outside Bengal proper, the Indian territories of [[Jharkhand]], [[Bihar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] are also home to significant communities of Bengalis.

Dense woodlands, including hilly [[rainforest]]s, cover Bengal's northern and eastern areas; while an elevated forested plateau covers its central area. In the [[littoral]] southwest are the [[Sundarbans]], the world's largest mangrove forest and home of the [[Bengal tiger]]. In the coastal southeast lies [[Cox's Bazar]], the longest beach in the world at {{cvt|125|km}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;thingsasian&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thingsasian.com/story/coxs-bazar-bangladesh-worlds-longest-beach |title=Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh – the World's Longest Beach |website=ThingsAsian |access-date=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426004823/http://thingsasian.com/story/coxs-bazar-bangladesh-worlds-longest-beach |archive-date=26 April 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region has a [[monsoon]] climate, which the [[Bengali calendar]] divides into six seasons.

At times an independent regional empire, Bengal was a leading power in Southeast Asia and later the Islamic East, with extensive trade networks. In antiquity, its kingdoms were known as seafaring nations. Bengal was known to the Greeks as [[Gangaridai]], notable for mighty military power. It was described by Greek historians that [[Alexander the Great]] withdrew from India anticipating a counterattack from an alliance of Gangaridai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient India As Described By Megasthenes And Arrian by Mccrindle, J.W |url=https://archive.org/details/AncientIndiaAsDescribedByMegasthenesAndArrianByMccrindleJ.W |website=archive.org |publisher=Mccrindle, J. W. |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers noted merchant shipping links between Bengal and [[Roman Egypt]]. The Bengali [[Pala Empire]] was the last major [[Buddhist]] imperial power in the subcontinent,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sailendra1999&quot; /&gt; founded in 750 and becoming the dominant power in the northern Indian subcontinent by the 9th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Majumdar1977&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot; /&gt; before being replaced by the Hindu [[Sena dynasty]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sailendra1999&quot; /&gt; 

[[Islam]] was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kumar&quot;/&gt; Following the formation of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the 13th century, Islam spread across the Bengal region. During the Islamic [[Bengal Sultanate]], founded in 1352, Bengal was a major [[trading nation]] in the world and was often referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with.&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, J. N (2005). {{cite book |year=2005 | title=Bengal: the unique state | publisher=Concept Publishing Company. p. 10. | isbn=978-81-8069-149-2 | quote=Bengal [...] was rich in the production and export of grain, salt, fruit, liquors and wines, precious metals and ornaments besides the output of its handlooms in silk and cotton.

Bengal made significant contributions to the world's first [[Industrial Revolution]], but experienced its own [[deindustrialization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ray&quot; /&gt; The East India Company increased agriculture tax rates from 10% to up to 50%, which caused multiple famines such as the [[Great Bengal famine of 1770]] which caused the death of 10 million [[Bengalis]] and the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] which killed millions.

Bengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]], in which [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary groups]] were dominant. Armed attempts to overthrow the British Raj began with the rebellion of [[Titumir]], and reached a climax when [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] led the [[Indian National Army]] allied with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] to fight against the British. A large number of Bengalis died in the independence struggle and many were exiled in [[Cellular Jail]], located in [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]]. The United Kingdom Cabinet Mission of 1946 split the region between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], an action popularly known as the [[partition of Bengal (1947)]]. This was opposed by the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]], [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]], and nationalist leader [[Sarat Chandra Bose]]. They campaigned for a united and independent [[United Bengal|nation-state of Bengal]]. The initiative failed owing to [[British diplomacy]] and communal conflict between [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]]. Subsequently, Pakistan ruled [[East Bengal]] which later became the independent nation of [[Bangladesh]] by the [[Bangladesh War of Independence]] in 1971.

{{Main|Geography of Bangladesh|Geography of West Bengal}}
[[File:Gangesdelta klein.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Ganges-Brahmaputra delta]]]]
Most of the Bengal region lies in the [[Ganges-Brahmaputra delta]], but there are highlands in its north, northeast and southeast. The Ganges Delta arises from the confluence of the rivers [[Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The total area of Bengal is 232,752 &amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;—West Bengal is {{convert|88752|km2|0|abbr=on}} and Bangladesh {{convert|147570|km2|0|abbr=on}}.

The flat and fertile Bangladesh Plain dominates the [[geography of Bangladesh]].

The flat Bengal Plain, which covers most of Bangladesh and West Bengal, is one of the most [[fertile]] areas on Earth, with lush vegetation and farmland dominating its landscape. Bengali villages are buried among groves of [[mango]], [[jack fruit]], [[betel nut]] and [[date palm]]. [[Rice]], [[jute]], [[mustard plant|mustard]] and [[sugarcane]] plantations are a common sight. [[Body of water|Water bodies]] and [[wetland]]s provide a habitat for many aquatic plants in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta. The northern part of the region features Himalayan foothills (''[[Dooars]]'') with densely wooded [[Sal (tree)|Sal]] and other tropical [[evergreen]] trees. Above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300&amp;nbsp;ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical, with a predominance of temperate-forest trees such as [[oak]]s, [[conifer]]s and [[rhododendron]]s. Sal woodland is also found across central Bangladesh, particularly in the [[Bhawal National Park]]. The [[Lawachara National Park]] is a [[rainforest]] in northeastern Bangladesh. The Chittagong Hill Tracts in southeastern Bangladesh is noted for its high degree of [[biodiversity]].

The [[littoral]] [[Sundarbans]] in the southwestern part of Bengal is the largest [[mangrove forest]] in the world and a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The region has over [[List of mammals in Bangladesh|89 species of mammals]], [[List of birds of Bangladesh|628 species of birds]] and [[List of fishes in Bangladesh|numerous species of fish]].

Under [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]], Bengal was a center of the worldwide [[muslin]] and [[silk]] trades. During the Mughal era, the most important center of cotton production was Bengal, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka, leading to muslin being called &quot;daka&quot; in distant markets such as [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eaton&quot;&gt;Richard Maxwell Eaton (1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gKhChF3yAOUC&amp;pg=PA202 ''The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204–1760'', page 202], [[University of California Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically, much of India depended on Bengali products such as [[rice]], silks and cotton textiles.

Since the 16th century, European traders traversed the sea routes to Bengal, following the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] conquests of Malacca and Goa. The Portuguese established a [[Portuguese Chittagong|settlement in Chittagong]] with permission from the Bengal Sultanate in 1528, but were later expelled by the Mughals in 1666. In the 18th-century, the Mughal Court rapidly disintegrated due to [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|Nader Shah's invasion]] and internal rebellions, allowing European colonial powers to set up trading posts across the territory. The [[British East India Company]] eventually emerged as the foremost military power in the region; and defeated the last independent Nawab of Bengal at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.&lt;ref name=&quot;google7&quot; /&gt;

[[Company rule in India]] began under the [[Bengal Presidency]]. [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] was named the capital of [[British India]] in 1772. The presidency was run by a military-civil administration, including the [[Bengal Army]], and had the world's sixth earliest railway network.

The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] was initiated on the outskirts of Calcutta, and spread to Dhaka, Chittagong, Jalpaiguri, Sylhet and Agartala, in solidarity with revolts in North India. The failure of the rebellion led to the abolishment of the Mughal Court and direct rule by the [[British Raj]]. The late 19th and early 20th century [[Bengal Renaissance]] had a great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal and started a great advance in the literature and science of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1912, an [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|abortive attempt]] was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones, that included the short-lived province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] based in Dacca and Shillong.&lt;ref name=baxter3&gt;{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=39–40}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under British rule, Bengal experienced [[deindustrialization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ray&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Indrajit |year=2011 |title=Bengal Industries and the British Industrial Revolution (1757–1857) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHOrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |publisher=Routledge |pages=7–10 |isbn=978-1-136-82552-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;m

Bengal played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement]], in which [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary groups]] were dominant. Armed attempts to overthrow the British Raj began with the rebellion of [[Titumir]], and reached a climax when [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] led the [[Indian National Army]] against the British. Bengal was also central in the rising political awareness of the Muslim population—the [[All-India Muslim League]] was established in Dhaka in 1906. The Muslim homeland movement pushed for a sovereign state in eastern British India with the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1943.

West Bengal became one of India's most populous states. Calcutta, the former capital of the British Raj, became the state capital of West Bengal and continued to be India's largest city until the late 20th century, when severe power shortages, strikes and a violent [[Naxalite|Marxist-Naxalite]] movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure in the 1960s and 70s, leading to a period of economic stagnation. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent [[Indian National Congress]]. The Left Front, led by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)) governed the state for over three decades, which was the world's longest elected [[Communist]] administration in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Communist rule ends in Indian state of West Bengal |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13387058 |work=BBC News |date=13 May 2011 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818090451/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-13387058 |archive-date=18 August 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, West Bengal has experienced an economic rejuvenation, particularly in its [[IT]] industry.

By the 1950s, the region had a Bengali majority population due to the influx of Hindus from East Pakistan after partition. It became a [[Union Territory]] of India in November 1953. It was granted full statehood with an elected legislature in July 1963. An [[Insurgency in Northeast India|insurgency]] by indigenous people affected the state for several years.

In 1948, the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Government of the Dominion of Pakistan]] ordained [[Urdu]] as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when several student demonstrators were shot dead by police firing. As a result of the movement, Pakistan government in 1956 included Bengali as national lanuage along with Urdu. [[UNESCO]] in 1999 declared 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]] honoring the 1952 incident.

[[East Bengal]], which was later renamed to [[East Pakistan]] in 1955, was home to Pakistan's demographic majority and played an instrumental role in the founding of the new state.

President Zia was [[Assassination of Ziaur Rahman|assassinated]] in 1981 during a failed military coup. He was eventually succeeded by his army chief [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]]. Lasting for nine years, Ershad's rule witnessed continued pro-free market reforms and the [[devolution]] of some authority to local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=David |author-link=David Lewis (academic) |date=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lH40gT7xvYC |title=Bangladesh: Politics, Economy and Civil Society |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=78–90 |isbn=978-0-521-71377-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) was founded in [[Dhaka]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/userfiles/01-Dhaka-1stSummit1985.pdf |url-status=dead |title=Dhaka Declaration |website=SAARC Secretariat |access-date=7 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160607131812/http://www.saarc-sec.org/userfiles/01-Dhaka-1stSummit1985.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] government made [[Islam]] the [[state religion]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh profile – Timeline |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12651483 |work=BBC News |date=1 January 2016 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711040420/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12651483 |archive-date=11 July 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular uprising restored [[parliamentary democracy]] in 1991. Since then, Bangladesh has largely alternated between the premierships of [[Sheikh Hasina]] of the Awami League and [[Khaleda Zia]] of the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]], as well as technocratic [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker governments]]. [[State of emergency|Emergency rule]] was imposed by the military in 2007 and 2008 after widespread street violence between the League and BNP. The restoration of democratic government in 2009 was followed by the initiation of the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]] to prosecute surviving collaborators of the 1971 genocide. Today,  the country is one of the [[emerging and growth-leading economies]] of the world. It is listed as one of the [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next Eleven|Next Eleven]] countries, it also has one of the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest real GDP growth rates]]  . Its [[gross domestic product]] ranks [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|39th]] largest in the world in terms of market [[exchange rates]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|30th]] in [[purchasing power parity]]. Its [[per capita income]] ranks [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|143th]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|136th]] in two measures. In the field of human development, it has progressed ahead in life expectancy, maternal and child health, and gender equality. But it continues to face challenging problems, including [[Poverty in Bangladesh|poverty]], [[Corruption in Bangladesh|corruption]], [[Terrorism in Bangladesh|terrorism]], [[Education in Bangladesh|illiteracy]], and inadequate [[Health in Bangladesh|public healthcare]].&lt;ref name=salik&gt;{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-577264-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burke&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=S |year=1973 |title=The Postwar Diplomacy of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 |journal=Asian Survey |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=1036–1049 |doi=10.2307/2642858 |jstor=2642858 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical maps and flags of states ==
Bengal has been an independent territory during several periods in history, while at other times, it has been part of larger empires. Bengal has also been a regional empire, ruling over neighboring regions like [[Bihar]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], and parts of North India, [[Assam]] and [[Nepal]].

== Politics ==
Politically, the region is divided between the [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]], an independent [[Sovereign state|state]], and the eastern provinces of the [[India|Republic of India]], including [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]]. Politically both Bangladesh and Indian Bengal are socialist, with left wing parties dominating the region's politics.

=== Bangladeshi Republic ===
{{Main|Bangladesh}}
[[File:রাতের বেলায় বঙ্গভবনের সৌন্দর্য্য! 02.jpg|thumb|[[Bangabhaban]] (the ''House of Bengal'') is the official residence of the [[president of Bangladesh]]]]
The state of Bangladesh is a [[parliamentary republic]] based on the [[Westminster system]], with a [[Constitution of Bangladesh|written constitution]] and a [[President of Bangladesh|President]] elected by parliament for mostly ceremonial purposes. The [[Government of Bangladesh|government]] is headed by a [[Prime Minister]], who is appointed by the President from among the popularly elected 300 [[Members of Parliament]] in the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]], the national parliament. The Prime Minister is traditionally the leader of the single largest party in the Jatiyo Sangshad. Under the constitution, while recognising [[Islam]] as the country's [[established religion]], the constitution grants [[freedom of religion]] to non-Muslims.

Between 1975 and 1990, Bangladesh had a [[presidential system]] of government. Since the 1990s, it was administered by non-political technocratic [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker governments]] on four occasions, the last being under military-backed emergency rule in 2007 and 2008. The [[Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) are the two largest political parties in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh is a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank|ADB]], [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], [[Islamic Development Bank|IDB]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]] and the [[Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition|IMCTC]]. Bangladesh has achieved significant strides in [[List of countries by Human Development Index|human development]] compared to its neighbours.

=== Indian Bengal ===
{{Main|West Bengal|Tripura|Assam|Seven Sister States}}
[[File:Garden with Writers Building at Rear - Central Kolkata.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Writers' Building]], the former official seat of the [[Government of West Bengal]]]]
[[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] (home to the [[Barak Valley]]) are provincial states of the [[India|Republic of India]], with local [[State governments of India|executives]] and [[Vidhan Sabha|assemblies]]- features shared with other states in the Indian federal system. The [[president of India]] appoints a [[governor]] as the ceremonial representative of the [[Government of India|union government]]. The governor appoints the [[chief minister]] on the nomination of the [[legislative assembly]]. The chief minister is the traditionally the leader of the party or coalition with most seats in the assembly. [[President's rule]] is often imposed in Indian states as a direct intervention of the union government led by the [[prime minister of India]].

Each state has popularly elected members in the Indian lower house of parliament, the [[Lok Sabha]]. Each state nominates members to the Indian upper house of parliament, the [[Rajya Sabha]].

The state legislative assemblies also play a key role in electing the ceremonial president of India. The former president of India, [[Pranab Mukherjee]], was a native of West Bengal and a leader of the [[Indian National Congress]].

The two major political forces in the Bengali-speaking zone of India are the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] and the [[Trinamool Congress]], with the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) and the [[Indian National Congress]] being minor players.

=== Crossborder relations ===
{{Main|Bangladesh-India relations}}

India and Bangladesh are the world's second and eighth most populous countries respectively. [[Bangladesh-India relations]] began on a high note in 1971 when India played a major role in the [[liberation of Bangladesh]], with the Indian Bengali populace and media providing overwhelming support to the independence movement in the former East Pakistan. The two countries had a twenty five-year friendship treaty between 1972 and 1996. However, differences over river sharing, border security and access to trade have long plagued the relationship. In more recent years, a consensus has evolved in both countries on the importance of developing good relations, as well as a strategic partnership in South Asia and beyond. Commercial, cultural and defense cooperation have expanded since 2010, when Prime Ministers [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Manmohan Singh]] pledged to reinvigorate ties.

The Bangladesh High Commission in [[New Delhi]] operates a Deputy High Commission in [[Kolkata]] and a consular office in [[Agartala]]. India has a High Commission in [[Dhaka]] with consulates in [[Chittagong]] and [[Rajshahi]]. Frequent international air, bus and rail services connect major cities in Bangladesh and Indian Bengal, particularly the three largest cities- Dhaka, Kolkata and Chittagong. Undocumented immigration of Bangladeshi workers is a controversial issue championed by right-wing nationalist parties in India but finds little sympathy in West Bengal.&lt;ref name=natwarspeech&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mea.gov.in/incoming-visit-detail.htm |title=Address by External Affairs Minister Shri Natwar Singh at India-Bangladesh Dialogue Organised by Centre for Policy Dialogue and India International Centre |date=7 August 2005 |website=Speeches |publisher=Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi |accessdate=28 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505224301/http://www.mea.gov.in/incoming-visit-detail.htm?2663 |archive-date=5 May 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has since fenced the border which has been criticized by Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=migrHindu&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Chattopadhyay |first=S.

The Bengal region is one of the [[Population density|most densely populated areas]] in the world. With a population of 300&amp;nbsp;million, [[Bengalis]] are the third largest ethnic group in the world after the [[Han Chinese]] and [[Arabs]].{{NoteTag|Roughly 163 million in Bangladesh and 100&amp;nbsp;million in the [[India|Republic of India]] ([[CIA Factbook]] 2014 estimates, numbers subject to rapid population growth); about 3 million [[Bangladeshis in the Middle East]], 1 million [[Bengalis in Pakistan]], 0.4&amp;nbsp;million [[British Bangladeshi]].}}

[[Bengali language|Bengali]] is the main language spoken in Bengal. Many phonological, lexical, and structural differences from the standard variety occur in peripheral varieties of Bengali; these include [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]], [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri/Rajbangshi]], [[Hajong language|Hajong]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], and [[Tangchangya language|Tangchangya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BD/languages |title=Bangladesh |website=Ethnologue |access-date=26 June 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150626114709/http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BD/languages |archive-date=26 June 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English is often used for official work alongside Bengali. Other major [[Indo-Aryan languages]] such as [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], and [[Nepali language|Nepali]] are also familiar to Bengalis.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In addition, several minority ethnolinguistic groups are native to the region. These include speakers of other Indo-Aryan languages (e.g., [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri]], [[Sadri language|Oraon Sadri]], various [[Bihari languages]]), [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] (e.g., [[A'Tong language|A'Tong]], [[Chak language|Chak]], [[Koch language|Koch]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Megam language|Megam]], [[Meitei language|Meitei Manipuri]], [[Mizo language|Mizo]], [[Mru language|Mru]], [[Pangkhua language|Pangkhua]], [[Rakhine language|Rakhine]]/[[Marma Language|Marma]], [[Kok Borok language|Kok Borok]], [[Reang language|Riang]], [[Tippera language|Tippera]], [[Usoi language|Usoi]], various [[Chin languages]]), [[Austroasiatic languages]] (e.g., [[Khasi language|Khasi]], [[Koda language|Koda]], [[Mundari language|Mundari]], [[Pnar language|Pnar]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[War language|War]]), and [[Dravidian languages]] (e.g., [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]], [[Sauria Paharia language|Sauria Paharia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ethnologue.com&quot; /&gt;

About 20,000 people live on ''chars''. Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal, which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of the chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are [[Indian people|Indians]] or [[Bangladeshis]]. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive because of very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char, it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wanderinggaia.com |title=Wandering Gaia |publisher=&quot;The Give and Take of the Ganges&quot; WordPress.com |accessdate=13 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410040034/http://wanderinggaia.com/ |archive-date=10 April 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intra-Bengal trade ===
Bangladesh and India are the largest trading partners in South Asia, with two-way trade valued at an estimated US$6.9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UPDATE 1-India, Bangladesh sign historic land boundary agreement |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-india-enclaves-idUSL3N0YS06U20150606 |agency=Reuters |access-date=30 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610032627/http://www.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-india-enclaves-idUSL3N0YS06U20150606 |archive-date=10 June 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this trade relationship is centered on some of the world's busiest [[land port]]s on the [[Bangladesh-India border]], particularly the West Bengal section.

The partition of India severed the once strong economic links which integrated the region. Decades later, frequent air, rail and bus services are increasingly connecting cities in Bangladesh and West Bengal, as well as the wider region, including [[Northeast India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]. However the overall economic relationship remains well below potential.

== Strategic importance ==
[[File:Stacking Intermodal container in Port of Chittagong (11).jpg|thumb|The strategically important city of [[Chittagong]] is home to the busiest port on the Bay of Bengal]]
The Bengal region is located at the crossroads of two huge economic blocs, the [[SAARC]] and [[ASEAN]]. It gives access to the sea for the landlocked countries of [[Bhutan]] and [[Nepal]], as well as the [[Seven Sister States]] of [[North East India]]. It is also located near [[China]]'s southern landlocked region, including [[Yunnan]] and [[Tibet]].

Both India and Bangladesh plan to expand onshore and offshore [[oil and gas]] operations. Bangladesh is Asia's seventh-largest [[Natural gas in Bangladesh|natural gas]] producer. Its maritime exclusive economic zone potentially holds many of the largest gas reserves in the Asia-Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;thediplomat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/bangladesh-asias-new-energy-superpower/ |author=Jack Detsch, The Diplomat |publisher=thediplomat.com |title=Bangladesh: Asia's New Energy Superpower? &amp;#124; The Diplomat |accessdate=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229123448/http://thediplomat.com/2014/11/bangladesh-asias-new-energy-superpower/ |archive-date=29 December 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay of Bengal is strategically important for its vital shipping lanes and its central location between the Middle East and the Pacific. The [[Bay of Bengal Initiative]], based in [[Dhaka]], brings together Bangladesh, India, [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], Nepal, Bhutan and [[Sri Lanka]] to promote [[economic integration]] in the subregion. Other regional groupings include the [[Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation]] ([[BCIM]]) and the [[Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal]] ([[BBIN]]) Initiative.

Culturally, Bengal is significant for its huge Hindu and Muslim populations. [[Bengali Hindus]] make up the second largest linguistic community in India. [[Bengali Muslims]] are the world's second largest Muslim ethnicity (after [[Arab Muslims]]), and Bangladesh is the world's [[Islam by country|third largest Muslim-majority country]] (after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]).

=== Language ===
{{Main|Bengali language}}
[[File:Bengali letters.svg|thumb|left|[[Bengali alphabet|Bengali Letters]]]]
The [[Bengali language]] developed between the 7th and 10th centuries from [[Apabhraṃśa]] and [[Magadhi Prakrit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.britannica.com/topic/Bengali-language |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Bengali language &amp;#124; Britannica.com |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is written using the indigenous [[Bengali alphabet]], a descendant of the ancient [[Brahmi script]]. Bengali is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|10th most spoken language in the world]]. It is an eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] and one of the easternmost branches of the [[Indo-European language family]]. It is part of the [[Bengali-Assamese languages]]. Bengali has greatly influenced other languages in the region, including [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]]. It is the sole [[state language]] of Bangladesh and the third most spoken language in India.

Bengali binds together a culturally diverse region and is an important contributor to regional identity. The 1952 [[Bengali Language Movement]] in East Pakistan is commemorated by [[UNESCO]] as [[International Mother Language Day]], as part of global efforts to preserve linguistic identity.

In both Bangladesh and West Bengal, currency is commonly denominated as taka. The [[Bangladesh taka]] is an official standard bearer of this tradition, while the [[Indian rupee]] is also written as taka in Bengali script on all of its banknotes. The [[history of the taka]] dates back centuries. Bengal was home one of the world's earliest coin currencies in the first millennium BCE. Under the Delhi Sultanate, the taka was introduced by [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] in 1329. Bengal became the stronghold of the taka. The silver currency was the most important symbol of sovereignty of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]]. It was traded on the [[Silk Road]] and replicated in [[Nepal]] and China's [[Tibet]]an protectorate. The [[Pakistani rupee]] was scripted in Bengali as taka on its banknotes until Bangladesh's creation in 1971.

[[File:Tagore Iran.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rabindranath Tagore]], known as the Bengali Shakespeare, being hosted at the Parliament of [[Iran]] in the 1930s]]
Bengali literature has a rich heritage. It has a history stretching back to the 3rd century BCE, when the main language was [[Sanskrit]] written in the [[brahmi]] script. The [[Bengali language]] and [[Bengali–Assamese script|script]] evolved circa 1000&amp;nbsp;CE from [[Magadhi Prakrit]]. Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada|Chôrjapôdô]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'' or ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]''. Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernised through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Satyendranath Dutta]] and [[Jibanananda Das]]. In the 20th century, prominent modern Bengali writers included [[Syed Mujtaba Ali]], [[Jasimuddin]], [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], [[Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]], [[Buddhadeb Bose]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]] and [[Humayun Ahmed]].

Prominent contemporary Bengali writers in English include [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Tahmima Anam]], [[Jhumpa Lahiri]] and [[Zia Haider Rahman]] among others.

In [[Amar Sonar Bangla]], the national anthem of Bangladesh, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] has used the word &quot;Maa&quot; (Mother) numerous times to refer to the motherland i.e. Bengal.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Bengal}}
[[File:Momin Mosque after restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Bungalow]]s originated from [[Bengali architecture]]]]
Classical Bengali architecture features [[terracotta]] buildings. Ancient Bengali kingdoms laid the foundations of the region's architectural heritage through the construction of monasteries and temples (for example, the [[Somapura Mahavihara]]). During the [[Bengal Sultanate|sultanate period]], a distinct and glorious Islamic style of architecture developed the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;akdn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akdn.org/architecture/project/bait-ur-rouf-mosque |publisher=akdn.org |title=Bait Ur Rouf Mosque &amp;#124; Aga Khan Development Network |accessdate=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119103806/http://www.akdn.org/architecture/project/bait-ur-rouf-mosque |archive-date=19 November 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Islamic buildings were small and highly artistic terracotta mosques with multiple domes and no minarets. Bengal was also home to the largest mosque in South Asia at [[Adina Mosque|
Adina]]. Bengali vernacular architecture is credited for inspiring the popularity of the [[bungalow]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', &quot;bungalow&quot;; [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bungalow&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406071037/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bungalow&amp;searchmode=none |date=6 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bengal region also has a rich heritage of [[Indo-Saracenic architecture]], including numerous [[zamindar]] palaces and mansions. The most prominent example of this style is the [[Victoria Memorial, Kolkata]].

In the 1950s, [[Muzharul Islam]] pioneered the modernist terracotta style of architecture in South Asia. This was followed by the design of the [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]] by the renowned American architect [[Louis Kahn]] in the 1960s, which was based on the aesthetic heritage of Bengali architecture and geography.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldviewcities&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldviewcities.org/dhaka/islam.html |publisher=worldviewcities.org |title=WORLDVIEW |accessdate=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230094254/http://www.worldviewcities.org/dhaka/islam.html |archive-date=30 December 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldviewcities2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldviewcities.org/dhaka/philadelphia.html |publisher=worldviewcities.org |title=WORLDVIEW |accessdate=7 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102231001/http://www.worldviewcities.org/dhaka/philadelphia.html |archive-date=2 January 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boats ===
{{See also|Country boats in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Frans Balthasar Solvyns - Budgerow.jpg|thumb|left|18th century painting of a [[budgerow]]]]
There are 150 types of Bengali country boats plying the [[List of rivers in Bangladesh|700 rivers of the Bengal delta]], the vast [[floodplain]] and many [[oxbow lake]]s. They vary in design and size. The boats include the [[dinghy]] and [[sampan]] among others. Country boats are a central element of [[Bengali culture]] and have inspired generations of artists and poets, including the ivory artisans of the Mughal era. The country has a long [[shipbuilding]] tradition, dating back many centuries. Wooden boats are made of timber such as ''Jarul''  ([[dipterocarpus]] turbinatus),'' sal'' ([[shorea robusta]]), ''sundari'' ([[heritiera fomes]]), and ''[[Teak|Burma teak]]'' (tectons grandis). Medieval Bengal was shipbuilding hub for the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] navies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hossain |first=Khandakar Akhter |year=2012 |chapter=Shipbuilding Industry |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shipbuilding_Industry |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newagezakaria&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Prospects of shipbuilding industry in Bangladesh |url=http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2011-12-17&amp;nid=43675 |url-status=dead |newspaper=New Age |access-date=30 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217222253/http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2011-12-17&amp;nid=43675 |archive-date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Royal Navy]] later utilized Bengali shipyards in the 19th-century, including for the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].
