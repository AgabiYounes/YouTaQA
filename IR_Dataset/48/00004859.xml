'''Bodmin Moor''' ({{lang-kw|Goon Brenn}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=520 Place-names in the Standard Written Form (SWF)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515091028/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=520 |date=15 May 2013 }} : [http://www.magakernow.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docid=79ba408d-7c02-499e-8cd6-b18dd48de58d&amp;version=-1 List of place-names agreed by the MAGA Signage Panel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515071635/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docid=79ba408d-7c02-499e-8cd6-b18dd48de58d&amp;version=-1 |date=15 May 2013 }}. [[Cornish Language Partnership]].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[granite]] [[moorland]] in northeastern [[Cornwall]], England. It is {{convert|208|km2|sqmi}} in size, and dates from the [[Carboniferous]] period of [[geology|geological]] history. It includes [[Brown Willy]], the highest point in Cornwall, and [[Rough Tor]], a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the [[Neolithic]] era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the [[Bronze Age]] culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated.

The name Bodmin Moor is relatively recent. An early mention is in the ''Royal Cornwall Gazette'' of 28 November 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=To Mr. Flindell |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000177/18121128/013/0004 |newspaper=Royal Cornwall Gazette |location=England |date=28 November 1812 |accessdate=17 May 2018 |via=British Newspaper Archive |url-access=subscription  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The upland area was formerly known as '''Fowey Moor''' after the [[River Fowey]], which rises within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the English Parish: the culture of religion from Augustine to Victoria | first= Norman John Greville |last= Pounds| publisher= Cambridge University Press | year= 2000 | isbn= 978-0-521-63351-2 | pages= 593}}; p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Bodmin Moor is one of five [[granite]] [[pluton]]s in Cornwall that make up part of the [[Cornubian batholith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrology.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/3/571|author=Charoy, B|date=1986|title=''Genesis of the Cornubian Batholith (South West England): the example of the Carnmenellis Pluton''|publisher=Journal of Petrology; Oxford: OUP|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Geology of Cornwall]]).

Dramatic granite [[tor (rock formation)|tor]]s rise from the rolling moorland: the best known are [[Brown Willy]], the highest point in Cornwall at {{convert|417|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/|title=GENUKI: Cornwall|publisher=Genuki.org.uk|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rough Tor]] at {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}. To the south-east [[Kilmar Tor]] and [[Caradon Hill]] are the most prominent hills.&lt;ref name=OS/&gt; Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes (in hot summers these can dry out). The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/features.html |title=Bodmin Moor: Landscape and features |publisher=South Penquite Farm |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The moor contains about 500 holdings with around 10,000 beef cows, 55,000 breeding ewes and 1,000 horses and ponies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/history.html|title=The Bodmin Moor Pages ~ The History|publisher=Bodminmoor.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the moor is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI), ''Bodmin Moor, North'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodmin Moor, North |url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002227.pdf |publisher=[[Natural England]] |accessdate=26 October 2011 |year=1991 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211818/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002227.pdf |archivedate=24 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been officially designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB), as part of [[Cornwall AONB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwall-aonb.gov.uk/documents/12_bodmin_character.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127131041/http://www.cornwall-aonb.gov.uk/documents/12_bodmin_character.pdf |date=27 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The moor has been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) because it supports about 260 breeding pairs of [[European stonechat]]s as well as a wintering population of 10,000 [[Eurasian golden plover]]s.&lt;ref name=bli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Bodmin Moor |accessdate=2013-04-19 |work=Important Bird Areas factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630122358/http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=30 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The moor has also been recognised as a separate [[natural region]] and designated as [[national character area]] 153 by [[Natural England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/publications/nca/bodmin_moor.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007103205/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/publications/nca/bodmin_moor.aspx |date=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwall's rivers: they are mentioned here anti-clockwise from the south.

The [[River Fowey]] rises at a height of {{convert|290|m|ft|abbr=on}} and flows through [[Lostwithiel]] and into the [[Fowey]] estuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwallriversproject.org.uk/geography/fowey.htm|title=Cornwall Rivers Project - Geography - Fowey and Lerryn|publisher=Cornwallriversporject/org.uk|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[River Tiddy]] rises near Pensilva and flows southeast to its confluence with the [[River Lynher]] (the Lynher flows generally south-east until it joins the [[Hamoaze]] near Plymouth). The [[River Inny, Cornwall|River Inny]] rises near [[Davidstow]] and flows southeast to its confluence with the River Tamar.&lt;ref name=Rivers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/rivers.html |title=The Rivers of Bodmin Moor |publisher=South Penquite Farm |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[River Camel]] rises on Hendraburnick Down and flows for approximately {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} before joining the sea at [[Padstow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornwallriversproject.org.uk/geography/camel.htm|title=Cornwall Rivers Project - Geography - Camel and Allen|publisher=Cornwallriversproject.org.uk|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The River Camel and its tributary the [[De Lank River]] are an important habitat for the otter, and both have been proposed as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodminmoor.co.uk/rivers.html|title=The Rivers of Bodmin Moor - The Bodmin Moor Pages|publisher=Bodminmoore.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The De Lank River rises near [[Roughtor]] and flows along an irregular course before joining the Camel south of Wenford.&lt;ref name=Rivers/&gt;

The River Warleggan rises near [[Temple, Cornwall|Temple]] and flows south to join the Fowey.&lt;ref name=OS&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Bodmin and Launceston |work=Sheet 186, One-inch map of England and Wales |publisher=Ordnance Survey }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the southern slopes of the moor lies [[Dozmary Pool]]. It is Cornwall's only natural inland lake and is glacial in origin. In the 20th century three reservoirs have been constructed on the moor; these are [[Colliford Lake]], [[Siblyback Lake]] and [[Crowdy Reservoir|Crowdy reservoir]]s, which supply water for a large part of the county's population. Various species of waterfowl are resident around these waters.&lt;ref&gt;Bere, Rennie (1982) ''The Nature of Cornwall''. Buckingham: Barracuda Books, pp. 63-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and antiquities==

=== Prehistoric times ===
[[File:King arthurs hall.JPG|thumb|right|[[King Arthur's Hall]]]]
[[File:Kilmar Tor - geograph.org.uk - 7112.jpg|[[Kilmar Tor]]|thumb]]
10,000 years ago, in the [[Mesolithic]] period, [[hunter-gatherer]]s wandered the area when it was wooded. There are several documented cases of flint scatters being discovered by [[archaeology|archaeologists]], indicating that these hunter-gatherers practised [[Knapping|flint knapping]] in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley, C 1996&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Neolithic]] era, from about 4,500 to 2,300 BC, people began clearing trees and farming the land. It was also in this era that the production of various [[megalith]]ic monuments began, predominantly long [[cairn]]s (three of which have currently been identified, at Louden, Catshole and Bearah) and [[stone circle]]s (sixteen of which have been identified). It was also likely that the naturally forming [[tor (rock formation)|tor]]s were also viewed in a similar manner to the manmade ceremonial sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley, C 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=World Archaeology: The Power of Rocks: landscape and topography on Bodmin Moor |last=Tilley |first=C. |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |publisher=  |pages=151–176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following [[Bronze Age]], the creation of monuments increased dramatically, with the production of over 300 further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilley, C 1996&quot;/&gt; More than 200 [[Bronze Age]] settlements with [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]] and field patterns have been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2007_bod_t.html|title=Programmes - All - Channel 4|work=Channel 4|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many prehistoric stone [[tumulus|barrows]] and [[stone circle|circles]] lie scattered across the moor.  In a programme shown in 2007 [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Time Team]] ''investigated a 500-metre cairn and the site of a Bronze Age village on the slopes of [[Rough Tor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2007_bod_found.html|title=Bodmin Moor, Cornwall|date=8 April 2007|work=Channel 4: Time Team|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[King Arthur's Hall]], thought to be a late [[Neolithic]] or early [[Bronze Age]] ceremonial site, can be found to the east of [[St Breward]] on the moor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/secretcornwall.htm|title=Secret cornwall - Bodmin moor and its environs|publisher=Whitedragon.org.uk|accessdate=27 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425221358/http://www.whitedragon.org.uk/articles/secretcornwall.htm|archive-date=25 April 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval and modern times ===
[[File:Hawk's Tor.jpg|thumb|[[Hawk's Tor, North Hill|Hawk's Tor]], west of [[North Hill, Cornwall|North Hill]]]]
Where practicable, areas of the moor were used for pasture by herdsmen from the parishes surrounding the moor. Granite boulders were also taken from the moor and used for stone posts and to a certain extent for building (such material is known as moorstone).&lt;ref&gt;Clifton-Taylor, A. &quot;Building materials&quot; in: Pevsner, N. (1970) ''Cornwall''. 2nd ed. Penguin Books, p. 29-34&lt;/ref&gt; Granite quarrying only became reasonably productive when gunpowder became available.

The moor gave its name (Foweymore) to one of the medieval districts called [[Stannary|stannaries]] which administered tin mining: the boundaries of these were never defined precisely. Until the establishment of a turnpike road through the moor (the present [[A30 road|A30]]) in the 1770s the size of the moorland area made travel within Cornwall very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C5474308 |title=County: [Cornwall]. Description of Courts: Manorial Courts. Places: Foweymore (Foymore)... |work=heNational Archives |publisher= |accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its Cornish name, Goen Bren, is first recorded in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Weatherhill, Craig (2009) ''A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names''. Westport, co. Mayo: Evertype; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamaica Inn]] is a traditional inn on the Moor. Built as a coaching inn in 1750 and having an association with smuggling, it was used as a staging post for changing horses.

===Monuments and ruins===
Roughtor was the site of a medieval chapel of St Michael and is now designated as a memorial to the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division|43rd Wessex Division]] of the British Army. In 1844 on Bodmin Moor the body of 18-year-old Charlotte Dymond was discovered. Local labourer Matthew Weeks was accused of the murder, and at noon on 12 August 1844 he was led from [[Bodmin Gaol]] and hanged. The murder site now has a monument erected from public money, and the grave is at  [[Davidstow]] churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parmaq.com/truecrime/CharlotteDymond.htm|title=The Murder of Charlotte Dymond|publisher=Parmaq.com|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends and traditions==
[[Dozmary Pool]] is identified by some people with the lake in which, according to [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legend, [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] threw [[Excalibur]] to [[The Lady of the Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;''Cornish Archaeology''; No 34, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend relating to the pool concerns [[Jan Tregeagle]].

The [[Beast of Bodmin]] has been reported many times but never identified with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beast of Bodmin Moor |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/bm_01.htm |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407053236/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/mammals/beast-of-bodmin-moor/bm_01.htm |archivedate=7 April 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
