Afghanistan is bordered by [[Pakistan]] to the east and south;{{efn|1 = Afghanistan is regarded as a border country also by the [[Government of India]], which considers all of [[Kashmir]] to be part of India. However, this is [[Kashmir conflict|disputed]], and the region of Kashmir bordering Afghanistan is administered by Pakistan.

Occupying {{convert|652000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest. [[Kabul]] is the capital and largest city.  The population is around 38 million, mostly composed of ethnic [[Pashtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]] and [[Uzbeks]].

Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] Era, and the country's strategic location along the [[Silk Road]] connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed [[Invasions of Afghanistan|numerous military campaigns]], including those by Alexander the Great, [[Maurya Empire|Mauryas]], Muslim Arabs, Mongols, British, Soviets, and by the United States with allied countries. The land also served as the source from which the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]], [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]], [[Saffarid Empire|Saffarids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghorids]], [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], [[Hotak Empire|Hotaks]], [[Durrani dynasty|Durranis]], and others have risen to form major empires.

The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century, with [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] being considered as the founder of the state. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the &quot;[[The Great Game|Great Game]]&quot; between British India and the Russian Empire. Its border with British India, the [[Durand Line]], was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under [[Amanullah Khan]], until almost 50 years later when [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] was overthrown and a republic was established. In 1978, after a second coup Afghanistan first became a socialist state and then a Soviet protectorate. This evoked the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in the 1980s against [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|mujahideen]] rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist group the [[Taliban]], who ruled as a totalitarian regime for over five years. Following the 9/11 attacks, an intervention by the US and its allies forcibly removed the Taliban from power, and a new democratically-elected government was formed, but the Taliban still control a significant portion of the country.

Afghanistan is a unitary presidential [[Islamic republic]]. The country has high levels of terrorism, poverty, child malnutrition, and corruption. It is a member of the United Nations, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[Group of 77]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by [[purchasing power parity]]; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afghānistān'' ({{lang-ps|افغانستان}}) is believed to be as old as the [[ethnonym]] [[Afghan (ethnonym)|''Afghan'']], which is documented in the 10th-century [[geography]] book ''[[Hudud ul-'alam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Afghans|last1=Vogelsang|first1=Willem|year=2002|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19841-5|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA18|access-date=6 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709112010/https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA18|archive-date=9 July 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[root (linguistics)|root]] name &quot;[[Afghan]]&quot; was used [[history|historically]] in reference to a member of the ethnic [[Pashtuns]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghan&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ch. M.

Therefore, Afghanistan translates to ''land of the Afghans''{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=159}} or, more specifically in a historical sense, to ''land of the Pashtuns''. However, the modern [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that &quot;[t]he word Afghan shall apply to every [[Demographics of Afghanistan|citizen of Afghanistan]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=https://www.afghanembassy.us/about-afghanistan/constitution/|year=2004|accessdate=16 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920112856/http://www.afghanembassy.us/about-afghanistan/constitution/|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [[Egypt]] in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;JFS&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |title=Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– John Ford Shroder, University of Nebraska |publisher=Encarta |accessdate=19 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040717092902/http://encarta.msn.com/text_761569370___42/Afghanistan.html |archivedate=17 July 2004 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1881896-1,00.html |title=Afghanistan: A Treasure Trove for Archaeologists |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] | date=26 February 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726153721/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1881896-1%2C00.html |archivedate=26 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within vast regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], and the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity|author=George Erdosy|page=321|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6ZRShEIFwMC|isbn=3110144476|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its success in resisting foreign occupation during the 19th and 20th centuries, Afghanistan has been called the &quot;graveyard of empires,&quot;{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=255}} though it is unknown who coined the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Nordland| first = Rod| title = The Empire Stopper| work = The New York Times| date = 29 August 2017| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/world/asia/afghanistan-graveyard-empires-historical-pictures.html| quote = Afghanistan has long been called the &quot;graveyard of empires&quot; — for so long that it is unclear who coined that disputable term.| access-date = 18 November 2019| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181205023840/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/world/asia/afghanistan-graveyard-empires-historical-pictures.html| archive-date = 5 December 2018| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilization today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JFS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin F.

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]]. Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au | date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived in Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC-pdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan | date=August 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Runion|2007|page=44}}

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]]s who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. They were replaced by the [[Turk Shahi]] in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk Shahi of Kabul was replaced by a Hindu dynasty before the Saffarids conquered the area in 870, this Hindu dynasty was called [[Hindu Shahi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wink|first=André|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7Th-11th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2002|publisher=BRILL|isbn=0-391-04173-8|page=125|access-date=11 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201142728/https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&amp;pg=PA125|archive-date=1 December 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by [[Buddhist]] culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Habibi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023100306/http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm|archivedate=23 October 2008 |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Higham|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&amp;pg=PA141|year=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] was fought over perceived Russian influence, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] replaced [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]], and Britain gained control of Afghanistan's [[foreign policy|foreign relations]] as part of the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] of 1879.

After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 |title=Afghanistan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the reforms that were put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of several co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders, and this led to the [[Afghan Civil War (1928–1929)]].

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. The [[Afghan tribal revolts of 1944–1947|tribal revolts of 1944–1947]] saw Zahir Shah's reign being challenged by Zadran, Safi and Mangal tribesmen led by [[Mazrak Zadran]] and [[Salemai]] among others. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law, and a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] nationalist who sought the creation of a [[Pashtunistan]], leading to highly tense relations with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1103837.html|title=Afghanistan: History Of 1973 Coup Sheds Light On Relations With Pakistan|accessdate=6 July 2019|date=18 July 2003|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|author=Ron Synovitz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626230602/https://www.rferl.org/a/1103837.html|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his ten years at the post until 1963, Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]].

King Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the [[United Kingdom]]. Close relations with the Muslim states [[Turkey]], the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] and [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran/Persia]] were also pursued, while further international relations were sought by joining the [[League of Nations]] in 1934. The 1930s saw the development of roads, infrastructure, the founding of a [[Da Afghanistan Bank|national bank]], and increased education. Road links in the north played a large part in a growing [[cotton]] and [[textile]] industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eur2002&quot;/&gt; The country built close relationships with the [[Axis powers]], with [[Germany]] having the largest share in Afghan development at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Afghanistan under Soviet Domination, 1964–91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nvO-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-21948-3|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]] thereafter. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the [[United States]] vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On a per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. Afghanistan had, therefore, good relations with both Cold War enemies. In 1973, while the King was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a [[1973 Afghan coup|bloodless coup]] and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]], abolishing the monarchy.

In April 1978, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in the [[Saur Revolution]], a [[coup d'état]] against then-President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]. The PDPA declared the establishment of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], with its first President named as [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]].{{sfn|Ewans|2002|page=186-88}}

Opposition to PDPA reforms, such as its land redistribution policy and modernization of civil and marriage laws, led to unrest which became an open revolt by October 1978, first in eastern Afghanistan. That uprising quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla ''[[mujahideen]]'' against regime forces countrywide. The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the [[Soviet Union]] sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |title=Pakistan and the Emergence of Islamic Militancy in Afghanistan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=108–109 |isbn=978-0-7546-4434-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Operation Cyclone|supported]] Afghan ''mujahideen'' fighters through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI).&lt;ref name=Meher&gt;{{cite book |last=Meher |first=Jagmohan |title=America's Afghanistan War: The Success that Failed |publisher=Gyan Books |year=2004 |pages=68–69, 94 |isbn=978-81-7835-262-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&amp;nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&amp;nbsp;— resulted (in July–August 1979) in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1850438571|author=Rasanayagam, Angelo|page=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/73 73]|url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange|url-access=registration|access-date=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1979, President Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. The situation in the country deteriorated under Amin and thousands of people went missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/83854.stm|title=Afghanistan: 20 years of bloodshed|publisher=BBC|date=26 April 1998|accessdate=4 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217184807/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/83854.stm|archive-date=17 February 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union was displeased with Amin's government and decided to intervene and invade the country on 27 December 1979, killing Amin that same day.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=234}}

Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support. In March 1989, mujahideen groups launched an attack on [[Jalalabad]], instigated by the Pakistani ISI, but the attack failed.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=241}} With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 and the ending of [[Russia]]n support, President Najibullah was left without foreign aid. In March 1991, mujahideen forces attacked and conquered the city of [[Khost]].

In March 1992, President Najibullah agreed to step aside and make way for a mujahideen coalition government. At this time there were seven main mujahideen groups: [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin|Hezb-e Islami (Gulbuddin faction)]], [[Hezb-i Islami Khalis|Hezb-e Islami (Khalis faction)]], [[Jamiat-e Islami]], [[Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan]], the [[National Islamic Front (Afghanistan)|National Islamic Front for Afghanistan]], the [[Jebh-e-Nejat-e Melli|National Liberation Front]], and the [[Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami|Islamic Revolution Movement]]. Their leaders [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|came together]] in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, to negotiate a coalition government, but Hezbi Islami's leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] refused to confer and instead invaded Kabul.

The population of Afghanistan increased steadily until the 1980s, when civil war caused millions to flee to other countries such as Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Wickramasekara, P., Sehgal, J., Mehran, F., Noroozi, L., Eisazadeh (2006).

UNHCR-ILO Cooperation. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/455835d92.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country in the world, a title held for 32 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News p.&quot;/&gt; Millions have since returned. Afghanistan's healthcare has improved since the turn of the century, causing falls in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy. This, combined with the average Afghan woman having at least 5 children, has led to a rapid population growth that has only started to recently slow down.

The only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul.  After Kabul the other five large cities are [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Kunduz]] and [[Jalalabad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;official population&quot;/&gt;

Afghanistan is a predominantly tribal society, with different regions of the country having their own cultures.  In the southern and eastern region, the people live according to the [[Pashtun culture]] by following [[Pashtunwali]] (the Pashtun way).&lt;ref&gt;US Library of Congress: Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) Ethnic Groups (''Pashtun'')] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120714044422/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) |date=14 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key tenets of Pashtunwali include [[melmastia|hospitality]], the provision of [[nanawatai|sanctuary]] to those seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood.{{sfn|Dupree|1997|page=126}} The Pashtuns (and Baloch) are largely connected to the culture of South Asia. The remaining Afghans are culturally [[Persianization|Persian]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]. Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called [[Pashtunization]], while some Pashtuns have been [[Persianization|Persianized]]. Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations.

Afghans, particularly Pashtuns, are noted for their tribal solidarity and high regard for personal honor.{{sfn|Barfield|2012|page=59}} One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote&quot;&gt;Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) &quot;The Afghan Wars 1839–1919&quot;, Sellmount Staplehurst.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various [[ethnic groups in Afghanistan|Afghan tribes]], and an estimated 2–3 million [[Kochi people|nomads]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76794 Afghanistan: Kuchi nomads seek a better deal]&quot;.
