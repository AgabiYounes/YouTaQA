He is best known for his 1818 work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (expanded in 1844), wherein he characterizes the [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] world as the product of a blind and insatiable [[Schopenhauer#The world as will|metaphysical will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|author=Arthur Schopenhauer|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/23 23]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary.

Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime, Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science. His writing on [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|aesthetics]], [[morality]], and [[psychology]] influenced thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

[[File:Gdansk Schopenhauer House.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer's birthplace house, ul. Św. Ducha (formerly Heiligegeistgasse)]]
Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in the city of Danzig (then part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; present-day [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) on Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as Św. Ducha 47), the son of [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] (née Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer,&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Books&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fW5Dl-tUS_oC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+%2222+February%22|title=Chronology|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|author2=Günter Zöller|author3=Eric F.

Neither of them was very religious;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; both supported the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and were [[Republicanism|republicans]], [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitans]] and [[Anglophilia|Anglophiles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  When Danzig became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1793, Heinrich moved to [[Hamburg]]—a free city with a republican constitution, protected by Britain and Holland against Prussian aggression—although his firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained.  [[Adele Schopenhauer|Adele]], Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.

In 1797 Arthur was sent to [[Le Havre]] to live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Grégoire de Blésimaire. He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flute&quot; /&gt;{{rp|30}}  In 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of [[Netherlands|Holland]], Britain, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited some of his business associates. Heinrich gave his son a choice—he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education. Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious. He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity, which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results. Heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated43&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, Heinrich died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg. Although it was possible that his death was accidental, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), p. 12. &quot;There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;/&gt;  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated43&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children. Arthur Schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority. He invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArthurSchopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|Schopenhauer as a youth]]
Arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father, and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; His mother moved, with her daughter Adele, to [[Weimar]]—then the centre of [[German literature]]—to enjoy social life among writers and artists. Arthur and his mother were not on good terms. In one letter to him she wrote, &quot;You are unbearable and burdensome, and very hard to live with; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit, and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wallace|first= W.|date= 2003|title= Life of Arthur Schopenhauer|url= |location= Honolulu|publisher= University Press of the Pacific|page= 59|isbn= 978-1410206411|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur left his mother, and though she died 24 years later, they never met again. Some of negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, The Story of Philosophy, Garden City Publishing Co., Inc., New York, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;
Arthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anthime who was also studying to become a merchant.

After quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with some encouragement from his mother, he dedicated himself to studies at the [[Gotha]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Gymnasium Ernestinum Gotha|de|3=Ernestinum Gotha|lt=Gymnasium illustre zu Gotha}}) in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  He left Gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the lecturers.  Although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated129&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
He moved to Weimar but didn't live with his mother, who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated131&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences.  He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated131&quot;/&gt;  His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative—and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated129&quot;/&gt;  Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater.  By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]].  Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there—though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student.  It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in 1809.  There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but Göttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]].  Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 141–144&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810–11 and he left Göttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;).  He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated170&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  During his days at Göttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811–12.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.  Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated159&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated159&quot;/&gt;—seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 165–169&lt;/ref&gt;  He also attended the lectures of the famous theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] whom he also quickly came to dislike.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated170&quot;/&gt;  He attended philological courses by [[August Böckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early work ===
Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig Müller von Gerstenbergk (1778–1838),  a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.  He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]].  He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar.  She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit.  She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the &quot;rubbish&quot; she wrote was totally forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of &quot;Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer&quot; |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A. Brockhaus AG|Brockhaus publishing firm]] held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well. Hans Brockhaus (1888–1965) later claimed that his predecessors &quot;...saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to please one of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus'[s] reputation.&quot;&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{citation |last=Fredriksson |first=Einar H. |contribution=The Dutch Publishing Scene: Elsevier and North-Holland |pages=61–76 |title=A Century of Science Publishing: A Collection of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwWrRYyck6AC&amp;pg=PA61 |editor-last=Fredriksson |editor-first=Einar H. |display-editors=0 |isbn=978-4-274-90424-0 |publisher=IOS Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in [[Leipzig]] for the edification of his new editors.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;

Also contrary to his mother's prediction, Schopenhauer's dissertation made an impression on Goethe to whom he sent it as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is doubtful that Goethe agreed with Schopenhauer's philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  Their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero.  They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]].  Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's.  Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements—and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence—soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 247–265&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer – a historian of religion, [[Orientalism|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] – who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]] and put them at par with Plato and Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;  Although he loved [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts he was more interested in [[Buddhism]], which he came to regard as the best religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;  However, his early studies were constrained by the lack of adequate literature, and were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]]. He also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently, and only later realized the similarities with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 274–276&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815. Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl]]
As the relationship with his mother fell to a new low he left Weimar and moved to [[Dresden]] in May 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  He continued his philosophical studies, enjoyed the cultural life, socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;  His friends in Dresden were [[Johann Gottlob von Quandt]], [[Friedrich Laun]], [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] and Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl, a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of Schopenhauer's unattractive physical features.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  His criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his main occupation during his stay in Dresden was his seminal philosophical work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 (see {{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recommended to [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]] by Baron Ferdinand von Biedenfeld, an acquaintance of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the publisher accepted his manuscript, Schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after it was published in December 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 285–289&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1818, while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer left Dresden for a yearlong vacation in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;  He visited [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]], [[Naples]] and [[Milan]], travelling alone or accompanied by mostly English tourists he met.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent winter months in [[Rome]] where he accidentally met his acquaintance [[Karl Witte]] and engaged in numerous quarrels with German tourists in [[Antico Caffè Greco|Caffe Greco]], among them [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer]] who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt;  He enjoyed art, architecture, ancient ruins, attended plays and operas, continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 346–350&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his affairs supposedly became serious, and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich Italian noblewoman—but despite his mentioning this several times, no details are known and it may have been Schopenhauer exaggerating.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (1991) Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy. Harvard University Press. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;  He corresponded regularly with his sister Adele and became close to her as her relationship with Johanna and Gerstenbergk also deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  She informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of A. L. Muhl in Danzig—in which her mother invested their whole savings and Arthur a third of his—was near bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  The women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while Arthur, using his business knowledge, took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 354–356&lt;/ref&gt;  The affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of Schopenhauer family.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

He shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Muhl and returned to Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;  Disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him both with income and the opportunity to promote his views.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted his friends at universities in Heidelberg, Göttingen and Berlin and found [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] most attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 358–362&lt;/ref&gt;  He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whom Schopenhauer described as a &quot;clumsy charlatan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to &quot;On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason,&quot; p. 1 ([[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]] on Wikisource.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was especially appalled by Hegel's supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in March 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were [[Carlsbad Decrees|fired]], while Schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own, Hegel still voted to accept Schopenhauer to the university.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of [[academia]]. A late essay, ''On University Philosophy'', expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

=== Later life ===
After his academic failure he continued to travel extensively, visiting [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Vevey]], [[Milan]] and spending eight months in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;  However, before he left for his three-year travel, he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor, forty-seven-year-old seamstress Caroline Louise Marquet.  The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 408–411&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 411–414&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his last visit to the country.  He left for [[Munich]] and stayed there for a year, mostly recuperating from various health issues, some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases (the treatment his doctor used suggests [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted publishers offering to translate Hume into German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language.  He liked [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and especially [[Baltasar Gracián]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works.  Few attempts to revive his lectures—again scheduled at the same time as Hegel's—also failed, as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 429–432&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Berlin years Schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;  For a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17-year-old Flora Weiss, who was 22 years younger than he was.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;  His unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of [[monogamy]] but still not advocating [[polygyny]]—instead musing about a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship he called ''tetragamy''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 404–408&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an on and off relationship with a young dancer Caroline Richter (she also used surname Medon after one of her ex-lovers).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  They met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin Opera. She had already had numerous lovers and a son out-of-wedlock, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt;  As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to a [[cholera]] epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left behind her young son.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;/&gt;  She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto3&quot;/&gt;

Schopenhauer claimed that in his last year in Berlin, he had a prophetic dream that urged him to escape the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;  As he arrived in his new home in [[Frankfurt]] he supposedly had another supernatural experience, an apparition of his dead father and his mother, who was still alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;/&gt;  This experience led him to spend some time investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].  He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 437–452&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;  He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 454–457&lt;/ref&gt;  By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn't bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;  Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;  His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz.  In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''.  In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection.  He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy.  Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. 
 
However, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenstädt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy.  He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto5&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenstädt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 507–508&lt;/ref&gt;   They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;   He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto5&quot;/&gt;

In 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848–49|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered.  He became worried for his own safety and property.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto6&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto6&quot;/&gt;  The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] for restoring order.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto7&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans—and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto7&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Lunteschütz]]
In 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy.  It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 524&lt;/ref&gt;  The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto8&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto8&quot;/&gt;  His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto9&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 381–386&lt;/ref&gt; or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;  Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;  His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work.  In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]’s very critical essay.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Lunteschütz]] made a first of his four portraits of him—which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like—that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;  As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]
He remained healthy in his old age, which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 544–545&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;auto10&quot;&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 545&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto10&quot;/&gt;  The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''.  In the spring of 1860 his health started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;  His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm Gwinner and, according to him, Schopenhauer was concerned that he wouldn't be able to finish his planned additions to ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' but was at peace with dying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 546–547&lt;/ref&gt;  He died of [[Respiratory failure|pulmonary-respiratory failure]],&lt;ref&gt;Dale Jacquette, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', Routledge, 2015: &quot;Biographical sketch&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.&lt;ref&gt;''Schopenhauer: his life and philosophy'' by H. Zimmern – 1932 – G. Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

=== The world as representation ===
Schopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own. As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':
{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=§ 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: &quot;The world is my representation.&quot; We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of § 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E. Cartwright |author2=Edward E. Erdmann|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=xvi–xvii|quote=He had also rehearsed for the first time his physiological arguments for the intellectual nature of intuition [Anschauung, objective perception] in his On Vision and Colours, and he had discussed how his philosophy was corroborated by the sciences in On Will in Nature. ... Like the German Idealists, Schopenhauer is convinced that Kant’s great unknown, the thing in itself, is the weak point of the critical philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances, as Kant argued. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1 Criticism of the Kantian philosophy|location=|pages=|translator-last=J. Kemp|quote=With the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to Kant precisely as with that of the a priori nature of the law of causality. Both doctrines are true, but their proof is false. They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of perception ===
In November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich weiß, daß durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, – in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in größern.&lt;/ref&gt; he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.

Kant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.

The difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is &quot;given&quot; to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=§ 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=§ 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality. Hereby Hume's skepticism is disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, § 4.|location=|pages=|quote=The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,—that is, its a priori character—can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.

Schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in § 21.

=== The world as will ===
{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}
Schopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].

{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me &quot;representation&quot;) and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}

For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: &quot;Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants.&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: &quot;The world is ''for'' a subject.&quot; This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena—an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.&lt;ref name=&quot;inveigles&quot;/&gt; He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: &quot;The world is my representation.&quot; [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.

=== Art and aesthetics ===
{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}
[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who &quot;directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For Schopenhauer, human desiring, &quot;willing&quot;, and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s &quot;''Sublimation''&quot;). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''&quot;one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception&quot;'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''&quot;subject of cognition&quot;'' to a perception that is ''&quot;Pure, will-less, timeless&quot;'' (section 34) where the essence, &quot;ideas&quot;, of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], &quot;Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt; He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.&lt;ref name=Music &gt;{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
Schopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]—and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space—Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].

{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of &quot;less than two right angles&quot;), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his writings,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&amp;nbsp;...&quot; ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.

{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&amp;nbsp;...}}

Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.&lt;ref&gt;This comment by Schopenhauer was called &quot;an acute observation&quot; by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, &quot;Note on Common Notion 4&quot;, Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark &quot;was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory&quot;. Helmholtz had &quot;maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space&quot; and is therefore &quot;dependent on mechanics&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,&lt;ref&gt;What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another&quot;, is not rather attacked. For ''&quot;coinciding with one another&quot;'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;}}
This follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.&quot; (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}
The task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, § 53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, § 23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.

What is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, § 66.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.

What motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=§ 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eternal justice ====
Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others—the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, § 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, &quot;has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 § 63&lt;/ref&gt; Eternal justice, &quot;rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;World as will and idea Vol. 1 § 63&quot;&gt;World as will and idea Vol. 1 § 63&lt;/ref&gt; Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, &quot;to the point where the two become one.&quot;... &quot;Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;World as will and idea Vol. 1 § 63&quot;/&gt;

Suffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]

==== Quietism ====
He who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascetic&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, § 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascetic&quot;/&gt;

Human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.

{{Quotation|The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascetic&quot;/&gt;}}

Schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.

=== Psychology ===
Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

He named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (''Wille zum Leben''), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force that inveigles&lt;ref name=&quot;inveigles&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Schopenhauer|isbn=978-0-19-861248-3|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], guaranteeing the quality of the human race:

{{quote|The ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it. What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation'', Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has often been argued that Schopenhauer's thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the [[evolution|theory of evolution]], a claim that seems to have been met with satisfaction by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as he included a quote of the German philosopher in his ''[[Descent of Man]]'' after having read such a claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been noted about [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nearly a century before Freud ... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body.&quot; Safranski p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and social thought ===

==== Politics ====
[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]
Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.

In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should &quot;leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],&quot; and so long as government was thus limited, he would &quot;prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats&quot;—i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He declared monarchy as &quot;that which is natural to man&quot; for &quot;intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity&quot; and disparaged republicanism as &quot;unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid &quot;to political affairs of [his] day&quot;.  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of &quot;minding not the times but the eternities&quot;.  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, &quot;For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern &quot;white races&quot; due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of &quot;[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches&quot; as &quot;belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', &quot;On Ethics,&quot; Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly &quot;Jewish&quot; spirit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fragments for the history of philosophy&quot;, ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Punishment ====
The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing &quot;beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twwr62&quot;&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...&amp;nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.&quot; Plato, &quot;[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]&quot;, 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should &quot;be an example to other men not to offend&quot;. Plato, &quot;[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]&quot;, Book IX, 863.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].

==== Views on women ====
In Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called &quot;Teutonico-Christian stupidity&quot; of reflexive unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=Über die Weiber, §369}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that &quot;Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.&quot; He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer &quot;a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy&quot;. He claimed that &quot;woman is by nature meant to obey&quot;. The essay does give some compliments, however: that &quot;women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are&quot;, and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''
PA Cain – Ga. L. Rev., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Young2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&amp;pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130–47|jstor=43469632}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], &quot;I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]

Schopenhauer viewed personality and [[intellect]] as being inherited. He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, &quot;From the brave and good are the brave descended&quot; (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', &quot;Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base&quot; (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.&lt;ref&gt;On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books – Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love – placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the &quot;final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.&quot; This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E. F. J. Payne |volume=II | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-21762-8 |page=527 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis: &quot;If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the [[despotism]] of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by [[mating]] the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts (e.g., [[Keith Ansell-Pearson]]) have suggested that Schopenhauer's anti-[[egalitarianism|egalitarianist]] sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and modern German thought'' by K. Ansell-Pearson – 1991 – Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal welfare ====
{{See also|Animal_rights#Arthur_Schopenhauer|label 1=Arthur Schopenhauer's views on animal rights}}
As a consequence of his [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Gerhardt, &quot;Thinking With: Animals in Schopenhauer, Horkheimer and Adorno.&quot; Critical Theory and Animals. Ed. John Sanbonmatsu. Lanham: Rowland, 2011. 137–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Puryear, [https://philpapers.org/rec/PURSOT &quot;Schopenhauer on the Rights of Animals.&quot; ''European Journal of Philosophy'' 25/2 (2017):250-269].&lt;/ref&gt; For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word &quot;will&quot; designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection. ''On the Will in Nature'', &quot;Physiology and Pathology&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

{{quote|Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.|''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19}}
{{quote|Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.|''On the basis of morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.|''On the basis of morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun &quot;it&quot; in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.&quot; ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt; belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: &quot;Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours&amp;nbsp;...&quot; This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, &quot;whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.&quot; ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Views on pederasty ====
In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that &quot;the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that &quot;by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual interests and affinities===

====[[Indology]]====
[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]

Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (&quot;The Great Secret&quot;). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them &quot;the production of the highest human wisdom&quot;, and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature &quot;the greatest gift of our century&quot; and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813–1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahāvākyas|Mahāvākya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993).
[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}. ''Philosophy East and West'' Volume 43, Number 2, pp. 255–278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[taṇhā]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four &quot;truths of the Buddha&quot; correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Burton 2004, page 22&quot;&gt;David Burton, &quot;Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.&quot; Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puruṣārtha]] or goals of life in [[Vedānta]] [[Hinduism]].

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:
* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or
* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.

However, Buddhist [[nirvāṇa]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the &quot;extinguishing&quot; (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (born 1945) stated, &quot;It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', p. 38. Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-932813-35-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orientalism]] reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of [[Leon Poliakov]], to &quot;free themselves from [[Judeo-Christian]] fetters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Arktos'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;Schopenhauer is often said to be the first, or indeed the only, modern Western philosopher of any note to attempt any integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.&quot; (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14–15, 316–321). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin – 2001 – University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.&lt;ref&gt;

====Magic and occultism====

Some traditions in [[Western esotericism]] and [[parapsychology]] interested Schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories. He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth of Disenchantment&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187–188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual. This theory notably parallels [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of magick and its emphasis on human will.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth of Disenchantment&quot; /&gt; Given the importance of the Will to Schopenhauer's overarching system, this amounts to &quot;suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer rejected the theory of [[disenchantment]] and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic, which he believed amount to &quot;practical metaphysics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoplatonism]], including the traditions of [[Plotinus]] and to a lesser extent [[Marsilio Ficino]], has also been cited as an influence on Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson |first=Mark |title=Pure: Modernity, Philosophy, and the One |chapter=Experimental Subversions of Modernity |date=2009 |publisher=Sophia Perennis |isbn=978-1597310949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==

Schopenhauer had a wide range of interests, from science and opera to occultism and literature.

In his student years Schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy. He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flute&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}}

Many evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flute&quot; /&gt;{{rp|30}}

As a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flute&quot; /&gt;{{rp|240}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Thoughts on other philosophers ==

=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===
Schopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. &quot;Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinoza and Bruno&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy. Note 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Presentation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/arthur-schopenhauers-handschriftlicher-nachlass-vorlesungen-und-abhandlungen-4993/3|title=Handschriftlicher, Nachlass, Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen.|last=|first=|date=|website=Gutenberg Spiegel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer expressed his regret that Spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of [[scholasticism]] and [[Cartesian philosophy]], and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of the vagueness and wideness of the definitions. It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spinoza and Bruno&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Presentation&quot; /&gt;

Schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. In fact, it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life-affirmation, if one completely ignores morality and self-denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abschnitt: Handschriftlicher Nachlaß|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=§ 588|quote=Es kann daher eine vollkommen wahre Philosophie geben, die ganz von der Verneinung des Lebens abstrahirt, diese ganz ignorirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is yet even more remarkable that Schopenhauer mentions Spinoza as an example of the denial of the will, if one uses the French biography by Jean Maximilien Lucas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vie_de_Spinoza|title=Vie de Spinoza - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the key to ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=§ 68|quote=We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay, ''De Emendatione Intellects'', a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I know of stilling the storm of the passions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
{{See also|Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}
The importance of Kant for Schopenhauer, in philosophy as well as on a personal level, can hardly be overstated. The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.

In his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer. Pessimist and Pagan.|last=Jerauld McGill|first=Vivian|publisher=|year=1931|isbn=|location=|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bond which Schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of Königsberg may be esteemed in a poem he dedicated to Kant:

{{quotation|With my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky,

And there thy flight dissolved from view.

Alone I stayed in the crowd below,

Thy word and thy book my only solace. —|sign=|source=}}

Schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, ''The World as Will and Representation'', to a criticism of the Kantian philosophy.

===Post-Kantian school===
The leading figures of [[German idealism|post-Kantian philosophy]], Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked &quot;the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to &quot;Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,&quot; trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, they were merely sophists who, excelling in the art of beguiling the public, pursued their own interests and professional advancement. 

{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to &quot;Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,&quot; trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] was deemed the most talented of the three, and Schopenhauer wrote that he would recommend his &quot;elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant&quot; concerning the intelligible character, if he had been honest enough to admit he was showing off with the thoughts of Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Freedom of the Will|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], whom he considered unworthy even of Fichte and Schelling. Whereas Fichte was merely a windbag (''Windbeutel''), Hegel was a &quot;commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive, and ignorant charlatan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. I, &quot;Fragments for the History of Philosophy&quot;, Sec. 13, trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Popper]] agreed with this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Open Society and Her Enemies|journal=Nature|volume=157|issue=3987|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1946|isbn=|location=|page=52|bibcode=1946Natur.157..387R|doi=10.1038/157387a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel, Schopenhauer wrote in the preface to his ''Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics,'' not only &quot;performed no service to philosophy, but he has had a detrimental influence on philosophy, and thereby on German literature in general, really a downright stupefying, or we could even say a pestilential influence, which it is therefore the duty of everyone capable of thinking for himself and judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics,'' Preface to the First Edition, trans.

==Influence==
[[File:Arthur_Schopenhauer_by_Elisabet_Ney.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|Sculpture of Schopenhauer]] by [[Elisabeth Ney]]]]
Schopenhauer had a large posthumous effect and remained the most influential German philosopher until the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860–1900|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0198768715|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ...

Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers, which consisted of [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Paul Deussen]], Lazar von Hellenbach, [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], Ernst Otto Lindner, [[Philipp Mainländer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Olga Plümacher and Agnes Talbert. His legacy shaped the intellectual debate, and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him, [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]], to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly.&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz/&gt; The French writer [[Maupassant]] commented that &quot;to-day even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beside Schopenhauer's Corpse&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include [[Hans Vaihinger]], [[Johannes Volkelt|Volkelt]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]] and [[Otto Weininger|Weininger]].

Schopenhauer was well read amongst physicists, most notably Einstein, [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Pauli greatly admired Schopenhauer. ...

When [[Erwin Schrödinger]] discovered Schopenhauer (&quot;the greatest savant of the West&quot;) he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schrödinger's Cat: How Two Great Minds Battled Quantum Randomness to Create a Unified Theory of Physics|last=Halpern|first=Paul|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-0465040650|location=|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard&quot; /&gt;{{rp|132}} [[Wolfgang Pauli]] accepted the main tenet of Schopenhauer's metaphysics, that the [[thing-in-itself]] is will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6149849|title=Schopenhauers Metaphysics and Contemporary Quantum Theory|last=Raymond B.

But most of all Schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists. [[Richard Wagner]] became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the Schopenhauerian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Magee (2000) 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; The admiration was not mutual, and Schopenhauer proclaimed: &quot;I remain faithful to Rossini and Mozart!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism|last=Nicholas Mathew, Benjamin Walton|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So he has been [[philosopher nicknames|nickname]]d &quot;the artist's philosopher&quot;.&lt;ref name=iep/&gt; See also [[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]].

Under the influence of Schopenhauer [[Leo Tolstoy]] became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self-renunciation. When he read his philosophy he exclaimed &quot;at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. ... It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy's letter to Afanasy Fet on August 30, 1869. &quot;Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights as I've never experienced before. I have brought all of his works and read him over and over, Kant too by the way. Assuredly no student has ever learned and discovered so much in one semester as I have during this summer. I do not know if I shall ever change my opinion, but at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. You say he is so-so, he has written a few things on philosophy? What is so-so? It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection. I have started to translate him. Won't you help me? Indeed, I cannot understand how his name can be unknown. The only explanation for this can only be the one he so often repeats, that is, that there is scarcely anyone but idiots in the world.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He said that what he has written in ''[[War and Peace]]'' is also said by Schopenhauer in ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/316432|title=Quietism from the Side of Happiness: Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, War and Peace|last=Thompson|first=Caleb|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}

Other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer were [[Thomas Mann]], [[Afanasy Fet]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans|J.-K. Huysmans]] and [[George Santayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Santayana and Schopenhauer|last=Caleb Flamm|first=Matthew|journal=Transactions of the Charles S.

[[Sergei Prokofiev]], although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism, became fascinated with Schopenhauer after reading ''Aphorisms on the Wisdom of Life'' in ''Parerga and Paralipomena.'' &quot;With his truths Schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sergey Prokofiev and His World|last=Morrison|first=Simon|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780691138954|location=|pages=19, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.

[[File:DBP 1988 1357 Arthur Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|Commemorative stamp of the Deutsche Bundespost]]

As a teenager, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he rejected epistemological [[transcendental idealism]] for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual [[Metaphysical realism|realism]]. In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker: &quot;Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture &amp; Value, p.24, 1933–4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Norman. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir. Oxford University Press, 1958, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Bertrand Russell]] had a low opinion on the philosopher, and attacked him in his famous  [[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|''History of Western Philosophy'']] for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|page=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite aisle of Russell on the foundations of mathematics, the Dutch mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] incorporated the ideas of Kant and Schopenhauer in [[intuitionism]], where mathematics is considered a purely mental activity, instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed. Brouwer was also influenced by Schopenhauer's metaphysics, and wrote an essay on mysticism.
