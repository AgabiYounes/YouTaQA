The International System of Units defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current. The earlier [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Derivation of CGS units in electromagnetism|CGS measurement system]] had two different definitions of current, one essentially the same as the SI's and the other using [[electric charge]] as the base unit, with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates. The ampere was then defined as one [[coulomb]] of charge per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = David Bodanis| last = Bodanis | first = David | year = 2005 | title = Electric Universe | place = New York | publisher = Three Rivers Press | ISBN = 978-0-307-33598-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In SI, the unit of charge, the coulomb, is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second.

==Definition==
The ampere is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the [[elementary charge]] {{math|''e''}} to be 1.602 176 634 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of {{math|∆''ν''&lt;sub&gt;Cs&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ampere (A) |url=https://www.npl.co.uk/si-units/ampere |website=www.npl.co.uk |accessdate=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SI unit of charge, the [[coulomb]], &quot;is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf | title = The International System of Units (SI) | edition = 8th | page = 144 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131105051930/http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf | archivedate = 5 November 2013 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second:
:&lt;math&gt;\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, charge {{math|''Q''}} is determined by steady current {{math|''I''}} flowing for a time {{math|''t''}} as {{math|1=''Q'' = ''It''}}.

Constant, instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes (as in &quot;the charging current is 1.2&amp;nbsp;A&quot;) and the charge accumulated (or passed through a circuit) over a period of time is expressed in coulombs (as in &quot;the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] charge is {{val|30000|u=C}}&quot;). The relation of the ampere (C/s) to the coulomb is the same as that of the [[watt]] (J/s) to the [[joule]].

== History ==
{{main|International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units}}
The ampere is named for French physicist and mathematician [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775-1836), who studied [[electromagnetism]] and laid the foundation of [[electrodynamics]]. In recognition of Ampère's contributions to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 [[International Exposition of Electricity]], established the ampere as a standard unit of electrical measurement for electric current.

The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of [[electric current]] in the [[centimetre–gram–second system of units]]. That unit, now known as the [[abampere]], was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020214114359/http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_page.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 February 2002 |title=A short history of the SI units in electricity |publisher=Montclair |last=Kowalski |first=L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[MKS system of units|MKSA]] system would be conveniently sized.

The &quot;international ampere&quot; was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|0.001118|u=grams}} of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm |title=History of the ampere |publisher=Sizes |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2017|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020170913/http://sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is {{val|0.99985|u=A}}.

Since [[power (physics)|power]] is defined as the product of current and voltage, the ampere can alternatively be expressed in terms of the other units using the relationship {{math|1=''I'' = ''P''/''V''}}, and thus 1&amp;nbsp;A = 1&amp;nbsp;W/V. Current can be measured by a [[multimeter]], a device that can measure electrical voltage, current, and resistance.

== Realization ==
The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a [[Kibble balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electrical quantities&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html |title=SI brochure |chapter=Appendix 2: Practical realization of unit definitions: Electrical quantities |publisher=BIPM|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414093725/http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html|archivedate=14 April 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10{{sup|7}}, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.&lt;ref name= &quot;Electrical quantities&quot; /&gt;
