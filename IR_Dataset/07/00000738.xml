It shares [[land border]]s with [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]]{{Small|{{efn|name=status}}}} to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the east, [[Greece]] to the south and [[maritime border]]s with Greece, Montenegro and [[Italy]] to the west.

[[Geography of Albania|Geographically]], the country displays varied climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions, defined in an area of {{convert|28748|sqkm|abbr=on}}. It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the [[Albanian Alps]] as well as the [[Korab]], [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg]], [[Pindus Mountains|Pindus]] and [[Ceraunian Mountains]] to the hot and sunny coasts of the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast|Albanian Adriatic]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea]] along the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Sea]].

[[History of Albania|Historically]], the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Venetian Empire|Venetians]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The [[Albanians]] established the autonomous [[Principality of Arbër]] in the 12th century. The [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] and [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Principality of Albania]] formed between the 13th and 14th centuries. Prior to the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman conquest of Albania]] in the 15th century, the [[Skanderbeg#Rebellion against the Ottomans|Albanian resistance]] to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg]] won them acclaim over most of Europe.

{{Main|Names of the Albanians and Albania|l1=Etymology of Albania}}

The term Albania is the [[medieval Latin]] name of the country. It may be derived from the [[Illyrian tribe]] of [[Albani (Illyrian tribe)|Albani]] ({{lang-sq|Albanët}}) recorded by [[Ptolemy]], the geographer and astronomer from [[Alexandria]], who drafted a map in 150&amp;nbsp;AD which shows the city of [[Albanopolis]] located northeast of [[Durrës]].&lt;ref&gt;Madrugearu A, Gordon M. The wars of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Barrington|49 &amp; notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called [[Principality of Arbanon|Albanon]] or Arbanon, although it is not certain that this was the same place.&lt;ref&gt;The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-631-19807-9}}, page 279,&quot;We cannot be certain that the Arbanon of Anna Comnena is the same as Albanopolis of the Albani, a place located on the map of Ptolemy (3.12)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his history written in the 10th century, the [[Byzantine]] historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was the first to refer to [[Albanoi]] as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of [[Dyrrachium]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Elsei. ''The Albanian lexicon of Dion Von Kirkman. Earliest reference to the existence of the Albanian language'', pp. 113–122.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Albanians|Albanian]]s called their country ''{{lang|sq|Arbëri or Arbëni}}'' and referred to themselves as ''{{lang|sq|[[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] or Arbëneshë}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pinocacozza.it/|title=www.pinocacozza.it|website=www.pinocacozza.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/|title=Radio-Arberesh.eu|author=Casanova|publisher=Radio-Arberesh|accessdate=13 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402063902/http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/|archive-date=2 April 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, Albanians call their country ''{{lang|sq|Shqipëri or Shqipëria}}''. The words ''Shqipëri'' and ''Shqiptar'' are attested from 14th century onward,&lt;ref name=Matasović&gt;{{cite book|last=Matasović|first=Ranko|year=2019|title=A Grammatical Sketch of Albanian for Students of Indo European|url=http://mudrac.ffzg.unizg.hr/~rmatasov/Albanian.pdf|place=Zagreb|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëreshë'' amongst [[Albanian language|Albanian]] speakers.&lt;ref name=Matasović /&gt;&lt;ref name = Lloshi&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloshi|first=Xhevat|chapter=Albanian|editor1-last=Hinrichs|editor1-first=Uwe|editor2-last=Büttner|editor2-first= Uwe|title=Handbuch der Südosteuropa-Linguistik|year=1999|location=Wiesbaden|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=9783447039390|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbuch_der_S%C3%BCdosteuropa_Linguistik.html?id=Phyvk2tPaYQC&amp;redir_esc=y|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two terms are popularly interpreted as &quot;Land of the Eagles&quot; and &quot;Children of the Eagles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kristo Frasheri.

[[File:Kamenicë Tumulus, Albania 2018 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The remains of [[Kamenica Tumulus]] in the [[county of Korçë]].]]

The first attested traces of [[neanderthal]] presence in the territory of Albania dates back to the [[Middle Paleolithic|middle]] and [[upper Paleolithic]] period and were discovered in [[Xarrë]] and at [[Mount Dajt]] in the adjacent region of [[Tirana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prendi&quot;&gt;F. Prendi, &quot;The Prehistory of Albania&quot;, ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', 2nd edn., vol. 3, part 1: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&amp;pg=PA187 The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries B.C.]'', ed. John Boardman et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1982), 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological sites from this period include the [[Kamenica Tumulus]], [[Konispol|Konispol Cave]] and [[Pellumbas Cave]].

The discovered objects in a cave near Xarrë include [[flint]] and [[jasper]] objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]]. They also demonstrate notable similarities with objects of the equivalent period found at Crvena Stijena in [[Montenegro]] and northwestern [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prendi&quot;/&gt;

Multiple artefacts from the [[Iron Age|Iron]] and [[Bronze Age]]s near [[tumulus]] burials have been unearthed in central and southern Albania, which has similar affinity with the sites in southwestern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Lefkada]]. Archaeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium BC by [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European people]] who spoke a [[Proto-Greek language]].

Few years after the dissolution of Arbanon, [[Charles I of Naples|Charles of Anjou]] concluded an agreement with the Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties. In 1272, he established the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]] and conquered regions back from the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. The kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from [[Dyrrhachium]] along the Adriatic Sea coast down to [[Butrint]]. A catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading [[Catholicism]] in the Balkan Peninsula. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou]], a cousin of Charles of Anjou. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility|last = Etleva|first = Lala|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs' most powerful medieval ruler, [[Stefan Dusan]], to establish a [[Serbian Empire|short-lived empire]] that included all of Albania except Durrës.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbarian Invasions&quot;/&gt; In 1367, various Albanian rulers established the [[Despotate of Arta]].

The Albanians, as Christians, were considered as an [[Rayah|inferior class]] of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy [[Jizya|tax]]es among others by the [[Devshirme]] system that allowed the [[Sultan]] to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the [[Janissary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Raymond Zickel and Walter R.

Skanderbeg consistently pursued the goal relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to constitute a European coalition against the Ottomans. He thwarted every attempt by the Ottomans to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and Western Europe. His unequal fight against them won the esteem of Europe also among others financial and military aid from the [[Papacy]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium – Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in [[Spain]]. The city of [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=Arnawutlu/&gt;

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;referenceworks.brillonline&quot;/&gt; Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were, according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;referenceworks.brillonline&quot;/&gt; Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, mostly catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while orthodox Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

[[File:NaumVeqilharxhi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Naum Veqilharxhi]] was among the most important figures of the early [[Albanian National Awakening|National Renaissance]].]]

The [[Albanian Renaissance]] was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an [[Independent Albania|independent nation]]. Modern [[Albanian culture]] flourished too, especially [[Albanian literature]] and [[Albanian art|arts]], and was frequently linked to the influences of the [[Romanticism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sarah Amsler |title=Theorising Social Change in Post-Soviet Countries: Critical Approaches |publisher=Peter Lang, 2007 |isbn=9783039103294 |pages=96105 |edition=Balihar Sanghera, Sarah Amsler, Tatiana Yarkova |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MzXP_r6oAxwC&amp;pg=PA96 |language=English|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism]], Albania was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire for almost five centuries, and Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the Albanian people. Through literature, Albanians started to make a conscious effort to awaken feelings of pride and unity among their people that would call to mind the rich history and hopes for a more decent future.

The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the [[Russian-Ottoman War]]s resulted the execution of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] which overlooked to assign Albanian-populated lands to the Slavic and Greek neighbors. However, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. From this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the Albanian-populated lands into an unitary nation, leading to the formation of the [[League of Prizren]].

[[File:Dora_d%27Istria.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dora d'Istria]] was among the main advocates in [[Europe]] for the [[Albanian Renaissance|Albanian cause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Observator Cultural |title=Dor de Dunăre şi alte nostalgii cosmopolite |url=https://www.observatorcultural.ro/articol/dor-de-dunare-si-alte-nostalgii-cosmopolite-2/ |website=observatorcultural.ro |language=Romanian|author1-link=Observator Cultural }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The league had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords connected with the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman administration]]. They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defense of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league [[League of Prizren#Formation|Committee of the Real Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kopecek |first=Michal |first2= Ahmed|last2= Ersoy|first3=Maciej|last3=Gorni |first4=Vangelis |last4= Kechriotis |first5= Boyan |last5= Manchev |first6= Balazs |last6= Trencsenyi |first7= Marius |last7= Turda |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA349|accessdate= 18 January 2011 |volume= 1|year=2006 |publisher=Central European University Press |location= Budapest, Hungary|isbn=978-963-7326-52-3 |page= 348 |quote= The position of the League in the beginning was based on religious solidarity.

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under [[Abdyl Frashëri]], became focused on working toward Albanian autonomy and requested merging four [[Ottoman vilayet|vilayet]]s, including [[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Shkodër]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Ioannina]], into an unified vilayet, the [[Albanian Vilayet]]. The league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [[Plav Municipality|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] assigned to Montenegro. After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops, such as the [[Battle of Novšiće]], the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions. The league was later defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the sultan.&lt;ref name=&quot;League of Prizren&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Albanian League|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12553/Albanian-League|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the government of [[Fan Noli]], the parliament adopted a new constitution and proclaimed the country as a parliamentary republic in which King [[Zog I of Albania]] (Ahmet Muhtar Zogu) served as the [[head of state]] for a seven-year term. Immediately after, [[Tirana]] was endorsed officially as the country's permanent capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Albanians: A Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher=I.B.

The politics of Zogu was authoritarian and conservative with the primary aim of the maintenance of stability and order. He was forced to adopt a policy of cooperation with Italy where a pact had been signed between both countries, whereby Italy gained a monopoly on shipping and trade concessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Albanians: A Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher=I.B.

Zogu remained a conservative but initiated reforms and placed great emphasis on the development of infrastructure.

In an attempt at social modernization, the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped. He also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals. The armed forces were trained and supervised by instructors from Italy, and as a counterweight, he kept British officers in the [[Gendarmerie]] despite strong Italian pressure to remove them.

After being militarily occupied by Italy from 1939 until 1943, the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Kingdom of Albania]] was a [[protectorate]] and a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] governed by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] and his government. In October 1940, Albania served as a staging ground for an unsuccessful Italian [[Greco-Italian War|invasion of Greece]]. A counterattack resulted in a sizable portion of southern Albania coming under Greek military control until April 1941 when Greece capitulated during the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]]. In April 1941, territories of [[Yugoslavia]] with substantial Albanian population were annexed to Albania inclusively western Macedonia, a strip of eastern Montenegro, the town of [[Tutin, Serbia|Tutin]] in central Serbia and most of Kosovo{{Small|{{efn|name=status}}}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;BogdaniLoughlin2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogdani|first1=Mirela|last2=Loughlin|first2=John|title=Albania and the European Union: The Tumultuous Journey Towards Integration and Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&amp;pg=PA230|date=15 March 2007|publisher=I.B.

During the last years of the war, the country fell into a civil war-like state between the communists and nationalists. The communists defeated the last anti-communist forces in the south in 1944.

The partisans entirely liberated the country from German occupation on 29 November 1944.

At this point, the country started to develop foreign relations with other communist countries, among others with the [[China|People's Republic of China]].

During this period, the country experienced an increasing industrialisation and urbanization, a rapid collectivisation and economic growth which led to a higher standard of living.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albanian Nationalism&quot;/&gt; The government called for the development of infrastructure and most notably the introduction of a [[Hekurudha Shqiptare|railway system]] that completely revamped transportation.

The new land reform laws were passed granting ownership of the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it. Agriculture became [[Worker cooperative|cooperative]], and production increased significantly, leading to the country becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. In the field of education, illiteracy was eliminated among the country's adult population.&lt;ref&gt;''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani&lt;/ref&gt; The government also oversaw the emancipation of women and the expansion of healthcare and education throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Qori|first=Arlind |date=22 February 2019 |title=From Faculty to Factory|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/albania-student-movement-higher-education|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]] |access-date=14 March 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today a [[secular state]] without any [[official religion]], [[Freedom of religion in Albania|religious freedoms]] and practices were severely curtailed during the communist era with all forms of worship being outlawed. In 1945, the Agrarian Reform Law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups were nationalized, mostly the [[waqfs]] along with the estates of mosques, tekkes, monasteries and dioceses. Many believers, along with the [[ulema]] and many priests, were arrested and executed. In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies, Albania: Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign&lt;/ref&gt;

After hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries containing priceless manuscripts were destroyed, Hoxha proclaimed Albania the world's first [[State atheism|atheist state]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Kombësia dhe feja në Shqipëri, 1920–1944 / Roberto Morocco dela Roka; e përktheu nga origjinali Luan Omari.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie p27&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|last=Elsie|first=Robert|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|edition=2nd|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe, No. 75|location=Lanham, MD, and Plymouth|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA27 27]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The churches had not been spared either and many were converted into cultural centers for young people. A 1967 law banned all fascist, religious, and antisocialist activity and propaganda. Preaching religion carried a three to ten-year prison sentence.

Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice their beliefs secretly. The anti-religious policy of Hoxha attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later: &quot;The state recognizes no religion&quot;, states the 1976 constitution, &quot;and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie p27&quot;/&gt;

After forty years of communism and [[Isolationism|isolation]] as well as the [[revolutions of 1989]], people, most notably students, became politically active and campaigned against the government that led to the transformation of the existing order. Following the popular support in the first [[multi-party elections]] of [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1991|1991]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/publications/report-elections-albania | title=Report: The Elections in Albania| date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the communists retained a stronghold in the [[Parliament of Albania|parliament]] until the victory in the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1992|general elections]] of 1992 led by the [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]].

Considerable economic and financial resources have been devoted to the [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi]] [[Pyramid schemes in Albania|pyramid schemes]] that were widely supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jarvis, Christopher|year=2000|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2000/03/jarvis.htm |title=The Rise and Fall of the Albanian Pyramid Schemes|journal=Finance and Development|volume= 37|issue=1|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bezemer, Dirk|year=2001|title=Post-socialist Financial Fragility: The Case of Albania|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=25|issue=1|pages= 1–25|doi=10.1093/cje/25.1.1|jstor=23599718|hdl=10419/85494|hdl-access=free|url=http://papers.tinbergen.nl/99045.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the warnings of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Musaraj, Smoki|year= 2011|title=Tales from Albarado: The Materiality of Pyramid Schemes in Post-socialist Albania|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume= 26|issue=1|pages=84–110|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01081.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded with fire. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The [[1997 rebellion in Albania|resulting crisis]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.&lt;ref&gt;For the most part, the [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian refugees]] emigrated to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]], or North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis led both [[Aleksandër Meksi]] and [[Sali Berisha]] to resign from office in the wake of the general election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a [[United Nations|UN]] peacekeeping force led by [[Italy]], entered the country with two goals exclusively to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organizations. The main international organization, that was involved, was the [[Western European Union]]'s [[Albanian civil war of 1997#International intervention|multinational]] [[Albanian Police]] element, which worked with the government to restructure the [[Judicial system of Albania|judicial system]] and simultaneously the Albanian Police.

The [[Albania-NATO relations|admission]] of Albania into the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] was considered by Albanian politicians as a primary ambition for the country. The country has been extensively engaged with the organization and has maintained its position as a stability factor and a strong ally of the United States and European Union in the troubled and divided region of the [[Balkans]].

Albania and [[Kosovo]] are culturally, socially and economically very closely rooted due to the Albanian majority population in Kosovo. In 1998, the country contributed in supporting allied efforts to end the [[Kosovo War|humanitarian tragedy in Kosovo]] and secure the peace after the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the [[Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]] in the west of the country. However, the [[Albanian Riviera]] in the southwest has the most scenic and pristine beaches, and is often called the pearl of the Albanian coast. Its coastline has a considerable length of {{convert|446|km|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sustainable Development of Sea-Corridors and Coastal Waters: The TEN ECOPORT project in South East Europe|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319113852|page=85|edition=Chrysostomos Stylios, Tania Floqi, Jordan Marinski, Leonardo Damiani |date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coast has a particular character because it is rich in varieties of virgin beaches, capes, coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves and many landforms.

Transportation in Albania has undergone significant changes and improvements in the past two decades. Continual improvements to the [[public transport]], road and rail [[infrastructure]], water and [[air travel]] have all led to a vast enhancement in transportation.

The [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza|international airport]] of [[Tirana]] serves as the premier gateway to the country, and it is the main hub for Albania's national flag carrier, [[Air Albania]]. The airport carries almost 2.5 million passengers per year with connections to many destinations in other countries around [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Institute of Statistics of Albania (INSTAT) |title=Statistikat e transportit Dhjetor 2017 |url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/3745/statistikat-e-transportit-dhjetor-2017.pdf |website=instat.gov.al |location=Tirana |page=2 |language=English |author1-link=Institute of Statistics (Albania) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Institute of Statistics of Albania (INSTAT) |title=Statistikat e transportit Gusht, 2018 |url=http://www.instat.gov.al/media/4776/statistikat-e-transportit-gusht-2018.pdf |website=instat.gov.al |location=Tirana |page=2 |language=Albanian |author1-link=Institute of Statistics (Albania) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country plans to progressively increase the number of airports especially in the south with possible locations in [[Sarandë]], [[Gjirokastër]] and [[Vlorë International Airport|Vlorë]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Tirana Times |title=Turkish consortium bids to build Vlora airport as Albania prepares to launch national carrier |url=http://www.tiranatimes.com/?p=135404 |website=tiranatimes.com |language=English |date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Highways in Albania|highways]] and [[motorways in Albania]] are properly maintained and often still under construction. The [[A1 motorway (Albania)|A1]] represents a major transportation corridor in Albania and the longest motorway of the country.

[[File:Panorama of Durres Port.jpg|thumb|right|The highly advantageous location of [[Durrës]] makes [[Port of Durrës|its port]] the busiest in Albania and among the largest in the [[Adriatic Sea]].]]

[[Port of Durrës|Durrës]] is the busiest and largest [[seaport]] in the country followed by [[Port of Vlorë|Vlorë]], [[Port of Shëngjin|Shëngjin]] and [[Port of Sarandë|Sarandë]]. {{as of|2014}}, it is as one of the largest passenger ports on the [[Adriatic Sea]] with annual passenger volume of approximately 1.5 million. The principal ports serve a system of ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in Croatia, Greece and Italy.

The rail network is administered by the national railway company [[Hekurudha Shqiptare]] which was extensively promoted by the dictator [[Enver Hoxha]]. There has been a considerable increase in private car ownership and bus usage while rail use decreased since the end of communism. However, a new railway line from Tirana and its airport to Durrës is currently planned. The specific location of this railway, connecting the most populated urban areas in Albania, merely makes it an important economic development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rabeta|first1=Lorenc|title=Trenat e rinj Tiranë-Durrës-Rinas me 222 pasagjerë, 112 të ulur|url=http://shqiptarja.com/news.php?IDNotizia=396302|website=dailynews.al|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hekurudha Tiranë-Rinas-Durrës, Haxhinasto: Projekti përfundon në 2019|url=http://www.top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=329857|website=top-channel.tv|language=Albanian|date=25 June 2016|access-date=4 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928055749/http://top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=329857|archive-date=28 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explanation for the recent population decrease is the [[fall of communism in Albania]]. It was marked by large economic [[mass migration|mass emigration]] from Albania to [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]. 40 years of [[Communism in Albania|isolation]] from the world, combined with its disastrous economic, social and political situation, had caused this exodus. The [[Human migration|external migration]] was prohibited outright during the communist era, while [[Human migration|internal migration]] was quite limited, hence this was a new phenomenon. At least, 900,000 people left Albania during this period, about 600,000 of them settling in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=239 Albania: Looking Beyond Borders]&quot;. Migration Policy Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The migration affected the country's internal population distribution. It decreased particularly in the north and south, while it increased in the center within the cities of [[Tirana]] and [[Durrës]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} According to the [[Institute of Statistics (Albania)|Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)]] {{as of|2015|January|1|lc=y}}, the population of Albania is 2,893,005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Republic of Albania Institute of Statistics |title=Population of Albania 1 January 2016 |url=http://www.instat.gov.al/al/themes/popullsia/publications/books/2016/popullsia-e-shqipërisë,-1-janar-2016.aspx |access-date=29 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713221549/http://www.instat.gov.al/al/themes/popullsia/publications/books/2016/popullsia-e-shqip%C3%ABris%C3%AB,-1-janar-2016.aspx |archive-date=13 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minorities ===
{{split section|Minorities of Albania|date=October 2019}}

Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. Contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent Albanian majority in the country, minority groups (such as [[Greeks in Albania|Greeks]], [[Macedonians in Albania|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins of Albania|Montenegrins]], [[Roma in Albania|Roma]] and [[Aromanians in Albania|Aromanians]]) have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country's population. According to the disputed 2011 census, ethnic affiliation was as follows: [[Albanians]] 2,312,356 (82.6% of the total), [[Greeks in Albania|Greeks]] 24,243 (0.9%), [[Macedonians of Albania|Macedonians]] 5,512 (0.2%), [[Montenegrins of Albania|Montenegrins]] 366 (0.01%), [[Aromanians]] 8,266 (0.30%), [[Romani people|Romani]] 8,301 (0.3%), [[Balkan Egyptians]] 3,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities 2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant 44,144 (1.6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Population and Housing Census 2011&quot;/&gt; On the quality of the specific data the Advisory Committee on the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] stated that &quot;the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Opinion on Albania adopted on 23 November 2011|url=https://rm.coe.int/168008c633|publisher= Advisory Committee on the Framework for the Protection of National Minorities|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonian and some Greek minority groups have sharply criticized Article 20 of the Census law, according to which a $1,000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate.

During [[Modern history|modern times]], the Albanian republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. The country has never had an [[official religion]] either as a republic or as a kingdom. [[File:Kisha e Manastirit Te Rubikut 03.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rubik Monastery Church|Monastery of Rubik]].]] In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from the territories of Albania. The [[Communism in Albania|communist regime]] persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[anti-religious|banned religion]]. The country was then officially declared to be the world's first [[atheist state]]. Although, the country's [[religious freedom]] has returned, since the [[Fall of communism in Albania|end of communism]].

Albania shares many symbols associated with its history, culture and belief. These include the colours red and black, animals such as the [[golden eagle]] living across the country, costumes such as the [[fustanella]], [[Qeleshe|plis]] and [[opinga]] which are worn to special events and celebrations, plants such as the [[olive]] and [[Papaver rhoeas|red poppy]] growing as well across the country.

The [[flag of Albania]] is a red flag with a black [[double-headed eagle]] in the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flamuri&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Fletorja zyrtare e Republikës së Shqipërisë |title=PËR FORMËN DHE PËRMASAT E FLAMURIT KOMBËTAR, PËRMBAJTJEN E HIMNIT KOMBËTAR, FORMËN DHE PËRMASAT E STEMËS SË REPUBLIKËS TË SHQIPËRISË DHE MËNYRËN E PËRDORIMIT TË TYRE |url=http://www.qbz.gov.al/botime/fletore_zyrtare/2002/PDF-2002/48-2002.pdf |website=qbz.gov.al |location=Tirana |language=Albanian |access-date=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804012641/http://www.qbz.gov.al/botime/fletore_zyrtare/2002/PDF-2002/48-2002.pdf |archive-date=4 August 2016 |url-status=dead |author1-link=Center of Official Publications (Albania) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The red colour symbolizes the bravery, strength and valour of the [[Albanian people]] and the black colour appears as a symbol of freedom and heroism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flamuri&quot;/&gt; The eagle has been used by Albanians since the [[Middle Ages]] including the establishment of the [[Principality of Arbër]] and by numerous noble ruling families such as the [[Kastrioti family|Kastrioti]], [[Muzaka family|Muzaka]], [[Thopia family|Thopia]] and [[Dukagjini family|Dukagjini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Historia e popullit shqiptar |publisher=Botimet Toena, 2002 |location=Tirana |pages=294–298, 433–434 |edition=Instituti i Historisë (Akademia e Shkencave e RSH) |language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu]], who fought and began a rebellion against the [[Ottoman Empire]] which halted Ottoman advance into [[Europe]] for nearly 25 years, placed the double-headed eagle on his flag and seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Paulist Fathers |title=Catholic World, Band 23 |publisher=Paulist Fathers, 1876 |page=235 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybwRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=skanderbeg+double+headed+eagle#v=onepage&amp;q=skanderbeg%20double%20headed%20eagle&amp;f=false |language=English|year=1876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Francis Tapon |title=The Hidden Europe: What Eastern Europeans Can Teach Us |publisher=SonicTrek, Inc., 2011 |isbn=9780976581222 |page=441 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GlbAmn_cajYC&amp;pg=PA441&amp;dq=skanderbeg+double+headed+eagle#v=onepage&amp;q=skanderbeg%20double%20headed%20eagle&amp;f=false |language=English|date=8 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's national motto, ''[[Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar]]'' (&quot;You Albania, you give me honor, you give me the name Albanian&quot;), finds its origins in the [[Albanian National Awakening]]. The first to express this motto was [[Naim Frashëri]] in his poem ''Ti Shqipëri më jep nder''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bagëti e Bujqësia (analizë)|url=http://www.letersia.fajtori.com/Letersi/E_Rilindjes/Naim_Frasheri/bageti_e_bujqesia_analize.php|website=letersia.fajtori.com|page=1|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Albanian cuisine}}

[[File:Albanian_cuisine_-_Pite_dhe_Speca.jpg|thumb|left|Speca të ferguara (roasted [[Capsicum|pepper]]s) served with [[Pite (food)|pite]], a traditional and prominent layered Albanian pie.]]

Throughout the centuries, [[Albanian cuisine]] has been widely influenced by [[Albanian culture]], [[Geography of Albania|geography]] and [[History of Albania|history]], and as such, different parts of the country enjoy specific [[regional cuisine]]s. Cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south, owing to differing [[topography]] and [[climate]] that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of [[herb]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[vegetable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albania Mania|url=http://agroweb.org/archive//?id=10&amp;l=248&amp;ln=en&amp;url=albania-mania|website=agroweb.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Albanians produce and use many varieties of [[fruit]]s such as [[Lemon (fruit)|lemon]]s, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[Figs (fruit)|fig]]s, and most notably, [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]s, which are perhaps the most important element of Albanian cooking. [[Spice]]s and other [[herb]]s such as [[Basil (herb)|basil]], [[lavender]], [[Spearmint|mint]], [[oregano]], [[rosemary]], and [[thyme]] are widely used, as are [[vegetable]]s such as [[garlic]], [[onion]]s, [[Bell pepper|pepper]]s, [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, as well as [[legume]]s of all types.

With a coastline along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast|Adriatic]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, and [[seafood]] are a popular and an integral part of the Albanian diet. Otherwise, [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] is the traditional [[meat]] for different [[holiday]]s and [[religious festival]]s for both [[Christianity in Albania|Christians]] and [[Islam in Albania|Muslim]]s, although [[poultry]], [[beef]], and [[pork]] are also in plentiful supply.

[[Tavë kosi]] (&quot;[[soured milk]] [[casserole]]&quot;) is the [[national dish]] of Albania, consisting of lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of [[yogurt]]. Fërgesë is another national dish, made up of peppers, tomatoes, and [[cottage cheese]]. Pite is also popular, a baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of [[spinach]] and gjizë (curd) or mish ([[ground meat]]).

[[File:Bukë_kollomoqe,_bukë_misri.JPG|thumb|right|Bukë misri ([[cornbread]]) is a staple on the Albanian table.]]

Petulla, a traditional fried dough, is also a popular speciality, and is served with [[powdered sugar]] or [[feta cheese]] and different sorts of [[Fruit preserves|fruit jam]]s. [[Flia]] consists of multiple [[crêpe]]-like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream. [[Krofne]], similar to [[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner doughnuts]], are filled with jam, or chocolate and often eaten during cold winter months.

[[Coffee]] is an integral part of the Albanian lifestyle, and Albania has more coffee houses per capita than any other country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocnal.com/2018/02/albania-ranked-first-in-world-for.html|title=Albania ranked first in the World for the number of Bars and Restaurants per inhabitant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tea]] is also enjoyed both at home or outside at cafés, bars, or restaurants. Çaj mali ([[Sideritis|sideritis tea]]) is enormously beloved, and a part of the daily routine for most Albanians. It is cultivated across Southern Albania and noted for its medicinal properties. [[Black tea]] with a slice of lemon and sugar, milk, or honey is also popular.

[[Albanian wine]] is also common throughout the country, and has been cultivated for thousands of years. Albania has a long and ancient history of wine production, and belongs to the [[Old World wine|Old World of wine producing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Albania Is A Great Destination For Wine Drinkers|url=https://epicureandculture.com/albanian-wine/|website=epicureandculture.com|accessdate=5 January 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wines of Albania|url=http://www.winesofbalkans.com/index.php?balkan-states/albania|website=winesofbalkans.com|page=1|language=English|access-date=18 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107005025/http://www.winesofbalkans.com/index.php?balkan-states%2Falbania|archive-date=7 January 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its wine is characterized by its sweet taste and traditionally indigenous varieties.

[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Butrint]] has been included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s since 1992.]]
 
The [[Albanian art|artistic history]] of Albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval [[Civilization|people]], [[tradition]]s and [[religion]]s. It covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include [[painting]], [[pottery]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramic]]s and [[architecture]] all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and shape, in different regions and period.

The rise of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Middle Ages]] was accompanied by a corresponding growth in [[Christian art|Christian]] and [[Islamic art]] in the lands of Albania which are apparent in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=L. Shumka from [[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|location=Tirana|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.albanianart.net index_al&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Robert Elsie: Arti Shqiptar|url = http://www.albanianart.net/index_al.html|website = www.albanianart.net|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, the [[Albanian Renaissance]] proved crucial to the emancipation of the modern Albanian culture and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of literature and art whereas artists sought to return to the ideals of [[Impressionism]] and [[Romanticism (art)|Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=MaryLee Knowlton|title=Albania – Band 23 von Cultures of the world|publisher=Marshall Cavendish, 2004|isbn=9780761418528|pages=102–103|url=https://books.google.com/?id=alNsb0fpX9IC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=impressionism+in+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=impressionism%20in%20albania&amp;f=false|language=English|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Onufri]], [[Kolë Idromeno]], [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]] are the most eminent representatives of Albanian art.

The [[architecture of Albania]] reflects the legacy of various civilizations tracing back to the [[classical antiquity]]. Major cities in Albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [[architectural style]]s. In the 20th century, many historical as well as [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [[Communism in Albania|communist era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg – [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania – An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient architecture]] is found throughout Albania and most visible in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkodër]] and [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Durrës]]. Considering the long period of rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]], they introduced castles, citadels, churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of visible [[mural]]s and [[fresco]]s. Perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of [[Korçë]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopojë]] and [[Gjirokastër]]. Involving the introduction of [[Ottoman architecture]] there was a development of mosques and other Islamic buildings, particularly seen in Berat and Gjirokastër.

[[File:Castle_of_Bashtov%C3%AB.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fortress of Bashtovë]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] for inscribing it as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=The Castle of Bashtova|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6259/|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|author1-link=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neoclassicism]] merged into the 19th century, best exemplified in [[Korçë]]. The 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern [[Italianate architecture|Italian style]], which is present in [[Tirana]] such as the [[Skanderbeg Square]] and Ministries. It is also present in Shkodër, [[Vlorë]], [[Sarandë]] and [[Durrës]]. Moreover, other towns received their present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or economic influences.

[[Socialist classicism]] arrived during the [[Peoples Republic of Albania|communist era]] in Albania after the [[Second World War]]. At this period many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic and important buildings demolished. Notable examples of that style include the [[Mother Teresa Square (Tirana)|Mother Teresa Square]], [[Pyramid of Tirana]], [[Palace of Congresses]] and so on.

Three Albanian archaeological sites are included in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. These include the ancient remains of Butrint, the medieval [[Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastër]], and [[Ohrid Lake|Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid region]] site shared with [[North Macedonia]] since 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Butrint|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|author1-link=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO|title=Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastra|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|author1-link=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the royal [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Illyrian tombs]], the remains of [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], the ancient [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre]] of Durrës and the [[Fortress of Bashtovë]] has been included on the tentative list of Albania.

Albanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and continues to play a major part in overall [[Music of Albania|Albanian music]]. Folk music can be divided into two stylistic groups, mainly the northern [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] varieties, and southern [[Labëria|Lab]] and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] varieties. Northern and southern traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north, and the more relaxed southern form of music.

Many songs concern events from [[History of Albania|Albanian history]] and [[Culture of Albania|culture]], including traditional themes of honour, hospitality, treachery, and revenge. The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two [[Himara|Himariot]] musicians, [[Neço Muko|Neço Muka]] and Koço Çakali, in [[Paris]], during their work with Albanian soprano [[Tefta Tashko-Koço]]. Several [[Phonograph record|gramophone]] compilations were recorded at the time by the three artists, which eventually led to the recognition of [[Albanian iso-polyphony]] as a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/m/post.php?id=362126 |title=Kujtimet për Koço Çakalin, themeluesin e këngës himariote |publisher=shekulli.com.al |accessdate=23 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829090701/http://www.shekulli.com.al/m/post.php?id=362126 |archivedate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the [[Albanian language]] in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the northern of Albania, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the south. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the [[German language]]. [[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.
The earliest evidence dates from 1332&amp;nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durrës]], [[Pal Engjëlli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|Siege of Shkodër]] (''Rrethimi i Shkodrës'') from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti|Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis]] (''History of Skanderbeg'') from 1508. The ''History of Skanderbeg'' is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

[[Cinema of Albania|Cinematography]] became popular in the 20th century, when foreign films and documentaries were shown in the cities of [[Shkodër]] and [[Korçë]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aqshf.gov.al/|title=AQSHF|website=www.aqshf.gov.al}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first public showing to occur in Albania was a little-known title, Paddy the Reliable a comical story.

The first Albanian films were mostly [[documentaries]]; the first was about the [[Monastir Congress]] that sanctioned the [[Albanian alphabet]] in 1908. During communism, the Albanian Film Institute that later became known as [[Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re]] was founded with Soviet assistance, focusing mostly on propaganda of wartime struggles. After 1945, the [[communist state|communist government]] founded the [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re]] in 1952. This was followed by the first Albanian [[epic film]], the [[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg|Great Warrior Skanderbeg]], a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]]. In addition the film was awarded the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival]].

By 1990, about 200 movies had been produced, and Albania had over 450 theaters. With the economic transition after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the Kinostudio was broken up and privatised. A new [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|National Center of Cinematography]] was established, while cities built modern cinema theatres showing mostly American movies. The [[Tirana International Film Festival]] was established in 2003 and has become the premier and largest film festival in the country as well as in the Balkans. [[Durrës]] hosts the [[International Film Summerfest of Durrës]], the second largest international film festival in the country which takes place every year in late August or early September in [[Durrës Amphitheatre]].

{{Main|Albanian diaspora|Category:Albanian diaspora|l2=Albanian communities}}

The [[Albanian diaspora]] has been formed since the late [[Middle Ages]], when they emigrated to places such as [[Italy]], especially in [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]], and [[Greece]] to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]] of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historia e popullit shqiptar|author=Stafi i Akedemise se Shkencave|year=2003|publisher=Botimet Toena|p=252–254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of communism]], large numbers of Albanians have migrated to countries such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].
