The '''Baháʼí Faith''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑ:|i:|,_|b|ə|ˈ|h|aɪ}}; {{lang-fa |بهائی}} ''{{transl|fa|Bahāʼi}}'') is a [[religion]] teaching the essential worth of all religions, and the unity of all people.{{sfn|Dictionary|2017}} Established by [[Baháʼu'lláh]] in 1863, it initially grew in [[Persia]] and parts of the [[Middle East]], where it has faced ongoing persecution since its inception.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} It is estimated to have between 5 and 8 million adherents, known as Baháʼís, spread throughout most of the world's countries and territories.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010}}

It grew from the mid-19th-century [[Bábism|Bábí religion]], whose founder (the [[Báb]]) taught that God would soon send a [[prophet]] in the same way of [[Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]].{{sfn|A.V.|2017}} In 1863, after being banished from his native Iran, Baháʼu'lláh (1817–1892) announced that he was this prophet. He was further exiled, spending over a decade in the prison city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholch, Alexander. &quot;The Demographic Development of Palestine, 1850–1882.&quot; International Journal of Middle East Studies, vol. 17, no. 4, 1985, pp. 485–505. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/163415.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Baháʼu'lláh's death in 1892, leadership of the religion fell to his son [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] (1844–1921), and later his great-grandson [[Shoghi Effendi]] (1897–1957). Baháʼís around the world annually elect local, regional, and national [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]] that govern the affairs of the religion, and every five years the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies elect the [[Universal House of Justice]], the nine-member supreme governing institution of the worldwide Baháʼí community, which sits in [[Haifa]], Israel, near the [[Shrine of the Báb]].

Baháʼí teachings are in some ways similar to other monotheistic faiths: [[God in the Baháʼí Faith|God]] is considered single and all-powerful. However, Baháʼu'lláh taught that religion is orderly and progressively revealed by one God through [[Manifestations of God]] who are the founders of [[major world religions]] throughout history; [[Buddha]], Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh. Baháʼís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the [[Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all people]], openly rejecting notions of [[racism]] and [[nationalism]]. At the heart of Baháʼí teachings is the goal of a [[New world order (Baháʼí)|unified world order]] that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hatcher&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |chapter=Bahaʼi |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Global Religion |editor1=Mark Juergensmeyer |editor2=Wade Clark Roof |author=Moojan Momen |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=1 October 2011 |isbn=978-0-7619-2729-7 |doi=10.4135/9781412997898.n61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letters written by Baháʼu'lláh to various individuals, including some heads of state, have been collected and assembled into a canon of [[Baháʼí literature|Baháʼí scripture]] that includes works by his son [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]], and also [[Báb|the Báb]], who is regarded as Baháʼu'lláh's forerunner. Prominent among Baháʼí literature are the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'', ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', and ''[[The Dawn-Breakers]]''.

==Etymology==
In English-language use, the word ''Baháʼí '' is used either as an adjective to refer to the Baháʼí Faith or as a term for a follower of Baháʼu'lláh.{{sfn|Stockman|2006}} It is derived from the [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar-Latn|[[Greatest Name|Baháʼ]]}} ({{lang|ar|بهاء}}), meaning &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;splendor&quot;.{{NoteTag|Baháʼís prefer the orthographies ''Baháʼí'', ''Baháʼís'', ''the Báb'', ''Baháʼu'lláh'', and ''ʻAbdu'l-Bahá'', using a [[Baháʼí orthography|particular transcription]] of the Arabic and Persian in publications. &quot;Bahai&quot;, &quot;Bahais&quot;, &quot;Bahaʼi&quot;, &quot;the Bab&quot;, &quot;Bahaullah&quot; and &quot;Bahaʼullah&quot; are often used when [[diacritic]]s are unavailable.}}

The older term &quot;Bahaʼism&quot; (or &quot;Bahaism&quot;) is still used,&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Baha'i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denis McEoin (1994) ''Rituals in Babism and Bahaʼism''. British Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hvithamar, Warburg &amp; Warmind, eds. (2005) ''Bahaʼi and Globalisation''. Aarhus University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamad Tavakoli-Targhi, (2008) &quot;Anti-Bahaiʼism and Islamism in Iran&quot;. In Brookshaw &amp; Fazel, eds. ''Bahaʼis of Iran: '' Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leyla Melikova (2013) &quot;How Bahaʼism Travelled from the East to the West (Ideological Evolution of the Neo-Universalist Religious Doctrine). ''The Caucasus and Globalization'', vol. 7, no. 3–4, p. 115–130.&lt;/ref&gt; for example as a variant of &quot;Bahai Faith&quot; by the  U.S. [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bahai Faith |url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85010990.html |website=Library of Congress |accessdate=10 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is now less common&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We have used Bahaʼi Faith most frequently (rather than Bahaʼism) as this is the more commonly used name for the religion&quot;. 'Note on transliteration, dates and names', in Brookshaw &amp; Fazel, eds. ''Bahaʼis of Iran: Socio-historical studies.'' Routledge, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Baháʼí community prefers &quot;Baháʼí Faith&quot;.{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=xiii}}

==Beliefs==
{{Main|Baháʼí teachings}}
The teachings of Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, form the foundation for Baháʼí belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Esslemont |first1=J. E. |title=Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era |date=1980 |publisher=US Baháʼí Publishing Trust |page=5 |edition=Fifth |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/o/BNE/bne-9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three principles are central to these teachings: the [[God in the Baháʼí Faith|unity of God]], the [[Baháʼí Faith and the unity of religion|unity of religion]], and the [[Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]].{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} Baha'is believe that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=108–109}}

===God===
{{Main|God in the Baháʼí Faith}}
[[File:Bahaitemplesydney.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A white domed building|Baháʼí House of Worship in [[Ingleside, New South Wales|Ingleside]], Sydney, Australia]]
The Baháʼí writings describe a single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=106}} The [[existence of God]] and the [[universe]] is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed [[Manifestations of God]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=106–107}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=111–112}}

Baháʼí teachings state that God is too great for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a complete and accurate image of by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations.{{sfn|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}{{sfn|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}} In the Baháʼí religion, God is often referred to by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on [[monotheism]]. The Baháʼí teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path.{{sfn|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}{{sfn|Cole|1982|pp=1–38}} According to the Baháʼí teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as [[Prayer in the Baháʼí Faith|prayer]], [[Introspection|reflection]], and being of service to others.{{sfn|Hatcher|2005|pp=1–38}}

===Religion===

[[File:Wilmette how side.jpg|upright|alt=A white column with ornate designs carved into it, including a Star of David|left|thumb|Symbols of many religions on a pillar of the [[Baháʼí House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois)|Baháʼí House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.]]

Baháʼí notions of progressive religious revelation result in their accepting the validity of the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of [[dispensationalism|dispensations]], where each ''manifestation'' brings a somewhat broader and more advanced [[revelation]] that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true in substance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert H. Stockman |title=The Baha'i Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eezSINHndMC&amp;pg=PA41 |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-4411-0447-2 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; suited for the time and place in which it was expressed.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Baháʼí belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Baháʼís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Baháʼu'lláh's revelation.{{sfn|McMullen|2000|p=7}}

Baháʼí beliefs are sometimes described as [[Syncretism|syncretic]] combinations of earlier religious beliefs.{{sfn|Stockman|1997}} Baháʼís, however, assert that their religion is a distinct tradition with its own [[Baháʼí literature|scriptures]], [[Baháʼí teachings|teachings]], [[Baháʼí laws|laws]], and [[Baháʼí history|history]].{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}{{sfn|Bausani|2012}} While the religion was initially seen as a sect of Islam, most religious specialists now see it as an independent religion, with its religious background in [[Shiʻa Islam]] being seen as analogous to the Jewish context in which Christianity was established.{{sfn|Van der Vyer|1996|p=449}}  Muslim institutions and clergy, both [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]], consider Baháʼís to be deserters or [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates from Islam]], which has led to Baháʼís being [[Persecution of Baháʼís|persecuted]].{{sfn|Boyle|Sheen|1997|pp=119–120}}{{sfn|Afshari|2001|pp=119–120}} Baháʼís describe their faith as an independent world religion, differing from the other traditions in its relative age and in the appropriateness of Baháʼu'lláh's teachings to the modern context.{{sfn|Lundberg|2005}} Baháʼu'lláh is believed to have fulfilled the [[Eschatology|messianic expectations]] of these precursor faiths.{{sfb|Buck|2004|pp=143–178}}

===Human beings===
{{See also|Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity|Baháʼí Faith on life after death}}
[[File:Ringstone.svg|alt=A stylized Arabic figure which has intersecting lines that lock around rings and five-pointed stars to either side|thumb|right|The [[Baháʼí symbols#Ringstone symbol|ringstone symbol]], representing humanity's connection to God.]]
The Baháʼí writings state that human beings have a &quot;rational [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]&quot;, and that this provides the species with a unique capacity to recognize God's status and humanity's relationship with its creator. Every human is seen to have a duty to recognize God through his [[Manifestation of God|messengers]], and to conform to their teachings.{{sfn|McMullen|2000|pp=57–58}} Through recognition and obedience, service to humanity and regular prayer and spiritual practice, the Baháʼí writings state that the soul becomes closer to God, the spiritual ideal in Baháʼí belief. According to Baháʼí belief when a human dies the soul is permanently separated from the body and carries on in the next world where it is judged based on the person's actions in the physical world. Heaven and Hell are taught to be spiritual states of nearness or distance from God that describe relationships in this world and the next, and not physical places of reward and punishment achieved after death.{{sfn|Masumian|1995}}

The Baháʼí writings emphasize the essential equality of human beings, and the abolition of prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity.{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} The Baháʼí teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}

===Summary===
{{Baháʼí texts sidebar}}
[[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the religion from 1921 to 1957, wrote the following summary of what he considered to be the distinguishing principles of Baháʼu'lláh's teachings, which, he said, together with the laws and ordinances of the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'' constitute the bedrock of the Baháʼí Faith:

{{quote|The independent search after truth, unfettered by [[superstition]] or tradition; the oneness of the entire [[Human|human race]], the pivotal principle and fundamental doctrine of the Faith; the basic unity of all religions; the condemnation of all forms of [[prejudice]], whether religious, racial, class or national; the harmony which must exist between religion and [[Baháʼí Faith and science|science]]; the equality of men and women, the two wings on which the bird of human kind is able to soar; the introduction of compulsory education; the adoption of a [[Baháʼí Faith and auxiliary language|universal auxiliary language]]; the abolition of the extremes of wealth and poverty; the institution of a [[World government|world tribunal]] for the adjudication of disputes between nations; the exaltation of work, performed in the spirit of service, to the rank of [[worship]]; the glorification of justice as the ruling principle in human society, and of religion as a bulwark for the protection of all peoples and nations; and the establishment of a permanent and [[World peace|universal peace]] as the supreme goal of all mankind—these stand out as the essential elements [which Baháʼu'lláh proclaimed].{{sfn|Effendi|1944|pp=281–282}}}}

===Social principles===
The following principles are frequently listed as a quick summary of the Baháʼí teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=52–53}}{{sfn|Principles of the Baháʼí Faith|26 March 2006}} The list is not authoritative and a variety of such lists circulate.{{sfn|Bausani|2012}}{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=438–446|ps=: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bahaism-i {{nowrap|&quot;Bahaism: The Faith&quot;}} ]}}

Oxford: George Ronald. 2015. {{ISBN|978-085398-591-4}}}}
* Obedience to government and non-involvement in partisan politics.{{NoteTag|Obedience to government is not applicable when submission to law amounts to a denial of Faith. See for example: [http://www.bahaistudies.net/nonpolitical.html Political Non-involvement and Obedience to Government&amp;nbsp;– A compilation of some of the Messages of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice] (compiled by Dr. Peter J. Khan)}}
* Elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty
*Prohibition of [[slavery]].

With specific regard to the pursuit of world peace, Baháʼu'lláh prescribed a world-embracing [[collective security]] arrangement for the establishment of a temporary era of peace referred to in the Baha'i teachings as the Lesser Peace. For the establishment of a lasting peace (The Most Great Peace) and the purging of the &quot;overwhelming Corruptions&quot; it is necessary that all the people of the world universally unite under a universal Faith.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=266–267}}

===Covenant===
{{Main|Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh}}
The Baháʼí teachings speak of a &quot;Greater Covenant&quot;,{{sfn|Taherzadeh |1972}} being universal and endless, and a &quot;Lesser Covenant&quot;, being unique to each religious dispensation. The Lesser Covenant is viewed as an agreement between a Messenger of God and his followers and includes social practices and the continuation of authority in the religion. At this time Baháʼís view Baháʼu'lláh's revelation as a binding lesser covenant for his followers; in the Baháʼí writings being firm in the covenant is considered a virtue to work toward.{{sfn|Momen|1995|ps=: {{nowrap|&quot;Lower covenant&quot;}}}} The Greater Covenant is viewed as a more enduring agreement between God and humanity, where a Manifestation of God is expected to come to humanity about every thousand years, at times of turmoil and uncertainty.
With unity as an essential teaching of the religion, Baháʼís follow an [[Baháʼí administration|administration]] they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Baháʼu'lláh. Schisms have occurred over the succession of authority, but any [[Baháʼí divisions]] have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following.{{sfn|MacEoin|1989|p=448}} The followers of such divisions are regarded as [[Covenant-breaker]]s and shunned, essentially [[Excommunication|excommunicated]].{{sfn|Momen|1995|ps=: {{nowrap|&quot;Lower covenant&quot;}}}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=173}}

==Canonical texts==
{{Main|Baháʼí literature}}
The ''canonical texts'' are the writings of the [[Báb]], Baháʼu'lláh, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the [[Universal House of Justice]], and the authenticated talks of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=100–101|ps=: {{nowrap|&quot;Canonical texts&quot;}}}} Some of Baháʼu'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the ''Most Holy Book'', which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society,{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=46}} the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]], literally the ''Book of Certitude'', which became the foundation of much of Baháʼí belief,{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=137}} the [[Gems of Divine Mysteries]], which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the [[Seven Valleys]] and [[the Four Valleys]] which are mystical treatises.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=20}}

===Mystical writings===
Although the Baháʼí teachings have a strong emphasis on social and ethical issues, a number of foundational texts have been described as mystical.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} ''[[The Seven Valleys]]'' is considered Baháʼu'lláh's &quot;greatest mystical composition.&quot; It was written to a follower of [[Sufism]], in the style of [[Attar Neyshapuri|ʻAttar]], the [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslim poet,{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=311|ps=: {{nowrap|&quot;Seven Valleys&quot;}}}} and sets forth the stages of the soul's journey towards God. It was first translated into English in 1906, becoming one of the earliest available books of Baháʼu'lláh to the West. ''[[Hidden Words|The Hidden Words]]'' is another book written by Baháʼu'lláh during the same period, containing 153 short passages in which Baháʼu'lláh claims to have taken the basic essence of certain spiritual truths and written them in brief form.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=181|ps=: {{nowrap|&quot;Hidden Words&quot;}}}}

{{Main|History of the Baháʼí Faith}}
The Baháʼí Faith formed from the Iranian religion of the Báb, a merchant who began preaching a new interpretation of Shia Islam in 1844. The Báb's claim to divine revelation was rejected by the generality of Islamic clergy in Iran, ending in his public execution by authorities in 1850. The Báb taught that God would soon send a new messenger, and Baháʼís consider Baháʼu'lláh to be that person.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}} Although they are distinct movements, the Báb is so interwoven into Baháʼí theology and history that Baháʼís celebrate his birth, death, and declaration as [[Baháʼí Holy Days|holy days]], consider him one of their three central figures (along with Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá), and a historical account of the Bábí movement (''[[The Dawn-Breakers]]'') is considered one of three books that every Baháʼí should &quot;master&quot; and read &quot;over and over again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer dated 9 June 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baháʼí community was mostly confined to the [[Qajar dynasty|Iranian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires until after the death of Baháʼu'lláh in 1892, at which time he had followers in 13 countries of Asia and Africa.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|1987|p=125}} Under the leadership of his son, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, the religion gained a footing in Europe and America, and was consolidated in Iran, where it still suffers intense persecution.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} After the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in 1921, the leadership of the Baháʼí community entered a new phase, evolving from a single individual to an administrative order with both elected bodies and appointed individuals.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=56}}

On the evening of 22 May 1844, Siyyid ʻAlí-Muhammad of Shiraz gained his first convert and took on the title of &quot;the Báb&quot; ({{lang|ar|الباب}} &quot;the Gate&quot;), referring to his later claim to the status of [[Mahdi]] of Shiʻa Islam.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} His followers were therefore known as [[Bábism|Bábís]]. As the Báb's teachings spread, which the [[Islamic clergy]] saw as blasphemous, his followers came under increased persecution and torture.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} The conflicts escalated in several places to military sieges by the [[List of kings of Persia|Shah]]'s army. The Báb himself was imprisoned and eventually executed in 1850.{{sfn|Winter|1997}}

Baháʼís see the Báb as the forerunner of the Baháʼí Faith, because the Báb's writings introduced the concept of &quot;[[He whom God shall make manifest]]&quot;, a [[Messianic figure]] whose coming, according to Baháʼís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world's great religions, and whom Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, claimed to be in 1863.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} The Báb's tomb, located in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]], is an important place of [[Baháʼí pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for Baháʼís. The remains of the Báb were brought secretly from [[Iran]] to the Holy Land and eventually interred in the tomb built for them in a spot specifically designated by Baháʼu'lláh.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001}} The main written works translated into English of the Báb's are collected in [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb]] out of the estimated 135 works.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|September 2002|pp=349–350}}

===Baháʼu'lláh===
{{Main|Baháʼu'lláh}}
Mírzá Husayn ʻAlí Núrí was one of the early followers of the Báb, and later took the title of Baháʼu'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852–53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Shah]]. Although they acted alone, the government responded with [[collective punishment]], killing many Bábís. Baháʼu'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the [[Síyáh-Chál]] in [[Tehran]], he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the [[Maid of Heaven]].{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}}

Shortly thereafter he was expelled from Tehran to [[Baghdad]], in the Ottoman Empire;{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} then to Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]); and then to Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]). In 1863, at the time of his banishment from Baghdad to Constantinople, Baháʼu'lláh declared his claim to a divine mission to his family and followers. Tensions then grew between him and [[Subh-i-Azal]], the appointed leader of the Bábís who did not recognize Baháʼu'lláh's claim. Throughout the rest of his life Baháʼu'lláh gained the allegiance of most of the Bábís, who came to be known as Baháʼís. Beginning in 1866, he began declaring his mission as a Messenger of God in letters to the world's religious and secular rulers, including [[Pope Pius IX]], [[Napoleon III]], and [[Queen Victoria]].

He produced over 18,000 works in his lifetime, in both Arabic and Persian, of which only 8% have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Stockman, R. H. (2012). The Baha'i Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed. A&amp;C Black. pp. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Baháʼu'lláh was banished by Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] a final time in 1868 to the Ottoman penal colony of [[Acre, Israel|ʻAkká]], in present-day [[Israel]]. Towards the end of his life, the strict and harsh confinement was gradually relaxed, and he was allowed to live in a home near ʻAkká, while still officially a prisoner of that city.{{sfn|Cole|1989|pp=422–429|ps=: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baha-allah {{nowrap|&quot;BAHĀʾ-ALLĀH&quot;}} ]}} He died there in 1892. Baháʼís regard his resting place at [[Mansion of Bahjí|Bahjí]] as the [[Qiblih]] to which they turn in prayer each day.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=20–21, 28}}

===ʻAbdu'l-Bahá===
[[File:‘Abdu’l-Bahá portrait.jpg|thumb|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]]
{{Main|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá}}
ʻAbbás Effendi was Baháʼu'lláh's eldest son, known by the title of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá (Servant of Bahá). His father left a [[Tablets of Baháʼu'lláh#Kitáb-i-ʻAhd (Book of the Covenant)|will]] that appointed ʻAbdu'l-Bahá as the leader of the Baháʼí community, and designated him as the &quot;Centre of the Covenant&quot;, &quot;Head of the Faith&quot;, and the sole authoritative interpreter of Baháʼu'lláh's writings.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=47}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had shared his father's long exile and imprisonment, which continued until ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's own release as a result of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908. Following his release he led a life of travelling, speaking, teaching, and maintaining correspondence with communities of believers and individuals, expounding the principles of the Baháʼí Faith.{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}}

There are over 27,000 extant documents by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, mostly letters, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|September 2002|pp=349–350}}  Among the more well known are ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'', the ''[[Tablet to Dr. Forel|Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel]]'', and ''[[Some Answered Questions]]''. Additionally notes taken of a number of his talks were published in various volumes like ''[[Paris Talks]]'' during his [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|journeys to the West]].

===Shoghi Effendi===
{{Main|Shoghi Effendi}}

Baháʼu'lláh's ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' and ''The [[Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]]'' are foundational documents of the Baháʼí administrative order. Baháʼu'lláh established the elected [[Universal House of Justice]], and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá established the appointed hereditary Guardianship and clarified the relationship between the two institutions.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2001}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=55–57}} In his Will, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá appointed Shoghi Effendi, his eldest grandson, as the Guardian of the Baháʼí Faith.  Shoghi Effendi served for 36 years as the head of the religion until his death.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=55}}

Shoghi Effendi throughout his lifetime translated [[Baháʼí texts]]; developed global plans for the expansion of the Baháʼí community; developed the [[Baháʼí World Centre]]; carried on a voluminous correspondence with communities and individuals around the world; and built the administrative structure of the religion, preparing the community for the election of the Universal House of Justice.{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} He unexpectedly died after a brief illness on 4 November 1957, in London, England, under conditions that did not allow for a successor to be appointed.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=347–363}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=58–69}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nyti.ms/2GjeYzM|title=Shoghi Effendi, 61, Baha'i Faith Leader|last=|first=|date=6 November 1957|website=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Shoghi Effendi launched a seven-year plan for the Baháʼís of North America, followed by another in 1946.{{sfn|Danesh|Danesh|Danesh|1991}} In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the [[Ten Year Crusade|Ten Year World Crusade]]. This plan included extremely ambitious goals for the expansion of Baháʼí communities and institutions, the translation of [[Baháʼí texts]] into several new languages, and the sending of [[Pioneering (Baháʼí)|Baháʼí pioneers]] into previously unreached nations.{{sfn|Hassal|1996|pp=1–21}} He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade that it would be followed by other plans under the direction of the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then launched a nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Baháʼí community.{{sfn|Smith|Momen|1989|pp=63–91}}

Since 1963, the Universal House of Justice has been the elected head of the Baháʼí Faith. The general functions of this body are defined through the writings of Baháʼu'lláh and clarified in the writings of Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. These functions include teaching and education, implementing Baháʼí laws, addressing social issues, and caring for the weak and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Momen |first1=Moojan |title=Bayt-al-'Adl (House of Justice) |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bayt-al-adl-house-of-justice-a-bahai-administrative-institution |website=Encyclopædia Iranica |accessdate=4 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Justice directs the work of the Baháʼí community through a series of multi-year international plans that began with a nine-year plan in 1964.  In the current plan, the House of Justice encourages the Baháʼís around the world to focus on capacity building through children's classes, junior youth groups, devotional gatherings, and study circles.{{sfn|Gervais|2008}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|17 January 2003}} Additional lines of action include [[Socioeconomic development and the Baháʼí Faith|social action]] and participation in the prevalent discourses of society.{{sfn|Vahedi|2 March 2011}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|21 April 2010}} The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.{{sfn|Universal House Of Justice|2006}}  Annually, on 21 April, the Universal House of Justice sends a '[[Ridván]]' message to the worldwide Baháʼí community,{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=297|ps=: &quot;Ridván&quot;}} that updates Baháʼís on current developments and provides further guidance for the year to come.{{NoteTag|All Ridván messages can be found at [http://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages Bahai.org] and [http://bahaiprayers.net/Ridvan Bahaiprayers.net/Ridvan] (multi-lingual).}}

At local, regional, and national levels, Baháʼís elect members to nine-person [[Spiritual Assembly|Spiritual Assemblies]], which run the affairs of the religion. There are also [[Institution of the Counsellors|appointed individuals]] working at various levels, including locally and internationally, which perform the function of propagating the teachings and protecting the community. The latter do not serve as clergy, which the Baháʼí Faith does not have.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=160}} The [[Universal House of Justice]] remains the supreme governing body of the Baháʼí Faith, and its 9 members are elected every five years by the members of all National Spiritual Assemblies.{{sfn|Stockman|1995}} Any male Baháʼí, 21 years or older, is eligible to be elected to the Universal House of Justice; all other positions are open to male and female Baháʼís.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=205}}

===Exhortations===
The following are a few examples from Baháʼu'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are required or encouraged of his followers:
* Baháʼís over the age of 15 should individually recite an [[Obligatory Baháʼí prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day, using fixed words and form.
* In addition to the daily obligatory prayer, Baháʼís should offer daily devotional prayer and to meditate and study sacred scripture.
* Adult Baháʼís should observe a [[Nineteen-Day Fast]] each year during daylight hours in March, with certain exemptions.
* There are specific requirements for Baháʼí burial that include a specified prayer to be read at the interment. Embalming or cremating the body is strongly discouraged.
* Baháʼís should make a 19% voluntary payment on any wealth in excess of what is necessary to live comfortably, after the remittance of any outstanding debt. These [[Huqúqu'lláh]] payments are to be used for philanthropic purposes.

===Prohibitions===
[[File:Bahá'í gardens by David Shankbone.jpg|alt=Elaborate gardens with several gates and a walkway leading to a domed building in the distance|thumb|[[Baháʼí gardens]] in [[Haifa, Israel]]]]
The following are a few examples from Baháʼu'lláh's teachings on personal conduct that are prohibited or discouraged.
* [[Backbiting]] and gossip are prohibited and denounced.
* Drinking or selling [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] is forbidden.
* [[Sexual intercourse]] is only permitted between a husband and wife, and thus premarital, extramarital, or homosexual intercourse are forbidden. ''(See also [[Homosexuality and the Baháʼí Faith]])''
* Abstaining from [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] politics is required.
* Begging as a profession is forbidden.

While some of the laws from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are applicable at the present time, others are dependent upon the existence of a predominantly Baháʼí society, such as the punishments for arson or murder. The laws, when not in direct conflict with the civil laws of the country of residence, are binding on every Baháʼí,{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=158}} and the observance of personal laws, such as prayer or fasting, is the sole responsibility of the individual.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=223–225|ps=: &quot;Law&quot;}}{{sfn|Walbridge|1996}}

===Marriage===
{{Main|Baháʼí marriage}}
The purpose of marriage in the Baháʼí faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity between a man and a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=164–165}} The Baháʼí teachings on marriage call it a ''fortress for well-being and salvation'' and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of [[society|human society]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}} Baháʼu'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required [[chastity]] outside of marriage; Baháʼu'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other.{{sfn|Baha'is of Warwick|12 October 2003}} [[Interracial marriage]] is also highly praised throughout Baháʼí scripture.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}}

Baháʼís intending to marry are asked to obtain a thorough understanding of the other's character before deciding to marry.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}} Although parents should not [[Arranged marriage|choose partners for their children]], once two individuals decide to marry, they must receive the consent of all living biological parents, whether they are Baháʼí or not. The Baháʼí marriage ceremony is simple; the only compulsory part of the wedding is the reading of the wedding vows prescribed by Baháʼu'lláh which both the groom and the bride read, in the presence of two witnesses.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}} The vows are &quot;We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God.&quot;{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=164}}

===Work===
Baháʼu'lláh prohibited a [[Mendicancy|mendicant]] and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=154–155}} [[Monasticism]] is forbidden, and Baháʼís are taught to practice spirituality while engaging in useful work.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}} The importance of self-exertion and service to humanity in one's spiritual life is emphasised further in Baháʼu'lláh's writings, where he states that work done in the spirit of service to humanity enjoys a rank equal to that of prayer and worship in the sight of God.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}

===Calendar===
{{Main|Baháʼí calendar}}
The Baháʼí calendar is based upon the calendar established by the [[Báb]]. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five [[Ayyám-i-Há|intercalary days]], to make a full [[Tropical year|solar year]].{{sfn|Hutter|2005|pp=737–740}} The Baháʼí New Year corresponds to the traditional Iranian New Year, called [[Baháʼí Naw-Rúz|Naw Rúz]], and occurs on the [[Vernal equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|vernal equinox]], near 21 March, at the end of the month of fasting. Baháʼí communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a [[Nineteen Day Feast|Feast]] for worship, consultation and socializing.{{sfn|Daume|Watson|1992}}

Each of the 19 months is given a name which is an attribute of God; some examples include Baháʼ (Splendour), ʻIlm (Knowledge), and Jamál (Beauty).{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=188–190}} The Baháʼí week is familiar in that it consists of seven days, with each day of the week also named after an attribute of God. Baháʼís observe 11 [[Ascension of Baháʼu'lláh|Holy Days]] throughout the year, with work suspended on 9 of these. These days commemorate important anniversaries in the history of the religion.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=188}}

===Symbols===

{{Main|Baháʼí symbols}}
The symbols of the religion are derived from the Arabic word Baháʼ ({{lang|ar|بهاء}} &quot;splendor&quot; or &quot;glory&quot;), with a [[Abjad numerals|numerical value]] of 9, which is why the most common symbol is the [[nine-pointed star]].{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=167–168|ps=: {{nowrap|&quot;Greatest Name&quot;}}}} The ringstone symbol and calligraphy of the Greatest Name are also often encountered. The former consists of two five-pointed stars interspersed with a stylized Baháʼ whose shape is meant to recall the three onenesses,{{sfn|Faizi|1968}} while the latter is a calligraphic rendering of the phrase Yá Baháʼu'l-Abhá ({{lang|ar|يا بهاء الأبهى}} &quot;O Glory of the Most Glorious!&quot;).{{clear left}}The five-pointed star is the official symbol of the Baháʼí Faith,{{sfn|Effendi|1973|pp=51–52}}{{sfn|Bahai-library.com|Nine-Pointed Star}} known as the ''Haykal'' (&quot;temple&quot;).

Since its inception the Baháʼí Faith has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,{{sfn|Momen|1994|ps=: Section 9: Social and economic development}}  promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,{{sfn|Kingdon|1997}} and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural co-ops, and clinics.{{sfn|Momen|1994|ps=: Section 9: Social and economic development}}

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.{{sfn|Smith|Momen|1989|pp=63–91}}

Current initiatives of social action include activities in areas like health, sanitation, education, gender equality, arts and media, agriculture, and the environment.{{sfn|Baháʼí Office of Social and Economic Development|2018}} Educational projects include schools, which range from village tutorial schools to large secondary schools, and some universities.{{sfn|Momen|2007}} By 2017 there were an estimated 40,000 small scale projects, 1,400 sustained projects, and 135 Baháʼí inspired organizations.{{sfn|Baháʼí Office of Social and Economic Development|2018}}

===United Nations===
Baháʼu'lláh wrote of the need for [[world government]] in this age of humanity's collective life. Because of this emphasis the international Baháʼí community has chosen to support efforts of improving [[international relations]] through organizations such as the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]], with some reservations about the present structure and constitution of the UN.{{sfn|Momen|2007}} The [[Baháʼí International Community]] is an agency under the direction of the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, and has consultative status with the following organizations:{{sfn|McMullen|2000|p=39}}{{sfn|Baháʼí International Community|6 June 2000}}

Baháʼís continue to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Baháʼí Faith as an independent religion, but rather as [[apostasy from Islam]]. The most severe persecutions have occurred in [[Baháʼí Faith in Iran|Iran]], where more than 200 Baháʼís were executed between 1978 and 1998,{{sfn|International Federation of Human Rights|August 2003}} and in [[Baháʼí Faith in Egypt|Egypt]]. The rights of Baháʼís have been restricted to greater or lesser extents in numerous other countries, including [[Baháʼí Faith in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222323 Afghanistan]}} [[Indonesia]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222133 Indonesia]}} [[Iraq]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222291 Iraq]}} [[Morocco]],{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222305 Morocco]}} [[Yemen]],&lt;ref&gt;Baháʼí World News Service.

===Iran===
The marginalization of the Iranian Baháʼís by current governments is rooted in historical efforts by Muslim clergy to persecute the religious minority. When the Báb started attracting a large following, the clergy hoped to stop the movement from spreading by stating that its followers were enemies of God. These clerical directives led to mob attacks and public executions.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} Starting in the twentieth century, in addition to repression aimed at individual Baháʼís, centrally directed campaigns that targeted the entire Baháʼí community and its institutions were initiated.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}} In one case in Yazd in 1903 more than 100 Baháʼís were killed.{{sfn|Nash|1982}} Baháʼí schools, such as the Tarbiyat boys' and girls' schools in Tehran, were closed in the 1930s and 1940s, Baháʼí marriages were not recognized and Baháʼí texts were censored.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}}{{sfn|Sanasarian|2000|pp=52–53}}

During the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], to divert attention from economic difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Baháʼís was instituted.{{NoteTag|In line with this is the thinking that the government encouraged the campaign to distract attention from more serious problems, including acute economic difficulties. Beyond this lay the difficulty which the regime faced in harnessing the nationalist movement that had supported Musaddiq.{{harv|Akhavi|1980|pp=76–78}}}} An approved and coordinated anti-Baháʼí campaign (to incite public passion against the Baháʼís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Baháʼí propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}} During that campaign, initiated by Mulla Muhammad Taghi Falsafi,  the Baha'i center in Tehran was demolished at the orders of Tehran military governor, General Timor Bakhtiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nyti.ms/2zT84eS|title=Iran Razing Dome of Bahai Temple|last=|first=|date=|website=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Baháʼís.{{sfn|Abrahamian|1982|p=432}} Baháʼís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Baháʼís increased.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007}}{{sfn|Simpson|Shubart|1995|p=223}}

Since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 Iranian [[Isfahan|Baháʼís]] have regularly had their homes ransacked or have been banned from attending university or from holding government jobs, and several hundred have received prison sentences for their religious beliefs, most recently for participating in study circles.{{sfn|International Federation of Human Rights|August 2003}} Baháʼí cemeteries have been desecrated and property has been seized and occasionally demolished, including the House of Mírzá Buzurg, Baháʼu'lláh's father.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}} The House of the Báb in [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], one of three sites to which Baháʼís perform pilgrimage, has been destroyed twice.{{sfn|Affolter|2005|pp=75–114}}{{sfn|Netherlands Institute of Human Rights|8 March 2006}}{{sfn|Baháʼí World News Service|2005}}
In May 2018, the Iranian authorities expelled a young woman student from university of [[Isfahan]] because she was Baháʼí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woman Expelled From Iranian University Just Before Obtaining Degree Because She's Baha'i |url=https://iranhumanrights.org/2018/07/woman-expelled-from-iranian-university-just-before-obtaining-degree-because-shes-bahai/ |website=Center for Human Rights in Iran |accessdate=23 August 2018 |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, two more Baháʼí students were expelled  from universities in the cities of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]] and [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] because of their religion.

According to a US panel, attacks on Baháʼís in Iran increased under [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s presidency.{{sfn|CNN|16 May 2008}}{{sfn|Sullivan|8 December 2009}} The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] revealed an October 2005 confidential letter from Command Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Iran ordering its members to identify Baháʼís and to monitor their activities. Due to these actions, the [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|Special Rapporteur]] of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights stated on 20 March 2006, that she &quot;also expresses concern that the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of, and discrimination against, members of the Baháʼí faith, in violation of international standards. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.&quot;{{sfn|Jahangir|2006}}

On 14 May 2008, members of an informal body known as the &quot;Friends&quot; that oversaw the needs of the Baháʼí community in Iran were arrested and taken to [[Evin prison]].{{sfn|CNN|16 May 2008}}{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|15 May 2008}}  The Friends court case has been postponed several times, but was finally underway on 12 January 2010.{{sfn|CNN|12 January 2010}} Other observers were not allowed in the court. Even the defence lawyers, who for two years have had minimal access to the defendants, had difficulty entering the courtroom. The chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said that it seems that the government has already predetermined the outcome of the case and is violating international human rights law.{{sfn|CNN|12 January 2010}} Further sessions were held on 7 February 2010,{{sfn|Washington TV|2010}} 12 April 2010{{sfn|Djavadi|8 April 2010}} and 12 June 2010.{{sfn|Radio Free Europe|3 June 2010}} On 11 August 2010 it became known that the court sentence was 20 years imprisonment for each of the seven prisoners{{sfn|Siegal|2010}} which was later reduced to ten years.{{sfn|CNN|16 September 2010}} After the sentence, they were transferred to [[Gohardasht prison]].{{sfn|AFP|16 February 2011}} In March 2011 the sentences were reinstated to the original 20 years.{{sfn|AFP|31 March 2011}} On 3 January 2010, Iranian authorities detained ten more members of the Baha'i minority, reportedly including Leva Khanjani, granddaughter of Jamaloddin Khanjani, one of seven Baha'i leaders jailed since 2008 and in February, they arrested his son, Niki Khanjani.{{sfn|The Jerusalem Post|14 February 2010}}

The Iranian government claims that the Baháʼí Faith is not a religion, but is instead a political organization, and hence refuses to recognize it as a minority religion.{{sfn|Kravetz|1982|p=237}} However, the government has never produced convincing evidence supporting its characterization of the Baháʼí community.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2008|p=5}} Also, the government's statements that Baháʼís who recanted their religion would have their rights restored, attest to the fact that Baháʼís are persecuted solely for their religious affiliation.{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007|p=9}} The Iranian government also accuses the Baháʼí Faith of being associated with [[Zionism]].{{sfn|Iran Human Rights Documentation Center|2007|loc=Statement of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Buenos Aires, 26 September 1979}} These accusations against the Baháʼís have no basis in historical fact,{{sfn|Cooper|1993|p=20}}{{sfn|Simpson|Shubart|1995|p=223}}{{sfn|Tavakoli-Targhi|2008|p=200}} and the accusations are used by the Iranian government to use the Baháʼís as &quot;scapegoats&quot;.{{sfn|Freedman|26 June 2009}} In fact it was the Iranian leader [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] who banished Baháʼu'lláh from Iran to the Ottoman Empire and Baháʼu'lláh was later exiled by the Ottoman Sultan, at the behest of the Iranian Shah, to territories further away from Iran and finally to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in Syria, which only a century later was incorporated into the state of [[Israel]].{{sfn|Momen|2004|pp=27–29}}

===Egypt===
During the 1920s Egypt's religious Tribunal recognized the Baha'i Faith as a new, independent religion, totally separate from Islam, due to the nature of the 'laws, principles and beliefs' of the Baha'is.  At the same time the Tribunal condemned &quot;in most unequivocal and emphatic language the followers of Baha'u'llah as the believers in heresy, offensive and injurious to Islam, and wholly incompatible with the accepted doctrines and practice of its orthodox adherents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baha'i Administration, Selected Messages 1922 – 1932|last=Effendi|first=Shoghi|publisher=Baha'i Publishing Trust|year=1974|isbn=|location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baháʼí institutions and community activities have been illegal under Egyptian law since 1960. All Baháʼí community properties, including Baháʼí centers, libraries, and cemeteries, have been confiscated by the government and [[fatwa]]s have been issued charging Baháʼís with [[apostasy]].{{sfn|International Religious Freedom Report|2013|loc=[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2013&amp;dlid=222287 Egypt]}}

The [[Egyptian identification card controversy]] began in the 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of [[identity documents]], which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, Baháʼís were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with Baháʼí religious principle. Without documents, they could not be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships.{{sfn|Bigelow|16 November 2005}} Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the Baháʼís, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, amending the law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions.{{sfn|Baháʼí World News Service|17 April 2009}} The first identification cards were issued to two Baháʼís under the new decree on 8 August 2009.{{sfn|Baháʼí World News Service|14 August 2009}}
