'''Brian Russell De Palma''' (born September 11, 1940) is an American film director and screenwriter. With a career spanning over 50 years, he is best known for his work in the [[suspense]], [[Crime film|crime]] and [[psychological thriller]] genres. His prominent films include mainstream box office hits such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]''  (1980), ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' (1983), ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987), and ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996), as well as [[cult film|cult favorites]] such as ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'' (1973), ''[[Blow Out]]'' (1981), ''[[Body Double]]'' (1984), ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' (1993), and ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rose |first1=Steve |title=Steve Rose Talks to Director Brian De Palma |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/08/1 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the [[New Hollywood]] generation of film directors.&lt;ref name=AVprimer&gt;Murray, Noel; Tobias, Scott (March 10, 2011).

Retrieved 2012-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt; His directing style often makes use of quotations from other films or cinematic styles, and bears the influence of filmmakers such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]].&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt; His films have been criticised for their violence and sexual content but have also been championed by prominent critics such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Pauline Kael]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=KaelBO/&gt;&lt;ref name=FemmeFataleEbert/&gt;

==Early life==
De Palma was born on September 11, 1940, in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the youngest of three boys. His Italian-American parents were Vivienne DePalma (née Muti), and [[Anthony DePalma]], an [[orthopedic]] surgeon who was the son of immigrants from [[Alberona]], [[Province of Foggia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/80/Brian-De-Palma.html &quot;Brian De Palma Biography (1940–)&quot;]. Film Reference. Retrieved 2012-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, and [[New Hampshire]], and attended various [[Protestant]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] schools, eventually graduating from [[Friends' Central School]]. He had a poor relationship with his father, and would secretly follow him to record his adulterous behavior; this would eventually inspire the teenage character played by [[Keith Gordon]] in De Palma's 1980 film ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clark |first1=Ashley |title=Brian de Palma: 'Film lies all the time … 24 times a second' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/07/brian-de-palma-carrie-scarface-retrospective-documentary |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in high school, he built computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/brian-de-palma-talks-about-his-stylish-new-remake--102271 |title=Brian De Palma talks about his stylish new remake, Passion |newspaper=A.V.

==Career==
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2019}}
===1960s and early career===
Enrolled at [[Columbia University]] as a [[physics]] student, De Palma became enraptured with the filmmaking process after viewing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. After receiving his undergraduate degree in 1962, De Palma enrolled at the newly coed [[Sarah Lawrence College]] as a graduate student in their [[theater]] department, earning an [[M.A.]] in the discipline in 1964 and becoming one of the first male students among a female population. Once there, influences as various as drama teacher [[Wilford Leach]], the [[Albert and David Maysles|Maysles brothers]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] impressed upon De Palma the many styles and themes that would shape his own cinema in the coming decades.

An early association with a young [[Robert De Niro]] resulted in ''[[The Wedding Party (1969 film)|The Wedding Party]]''. The film, which was co-directed with Leach and producer Cynthia Munroe, had been shot in 1963 but remained unreleased until 1969, when De Palma's star had risen sufficiently within the [[Greenwich Village]] filmmaking scene. De Niro was unknown at the time; the credits mistakenly display his name as &quot;Robert {{sic|hide=y|Den|ero}}.&quot; The film is noteworthy for its invocation of silent film techniques and an insistence on the [[jump-cut]] for effect. De Palma followed this style with various small films for the [[NAACP]] and the [[U.S. Treasury Department|Treasury Department]].

During the 1960s, De Palma began making a living producing documentary films, notably ''The Responsive Eye'', a 1966 movie about ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'' [[op-art]] exhibit curated by William Seitz for [[MOMA]] in 1965. In an interview with Gelmis from 1969, De Palma described the film as &quot;very good and very successful. It's distributed by Pathe Contemporary and makes lots of money. I shot it in four hours, with synched sound. I had two other guys shooting people's reactions to the paintings, and the paintings themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gelmis |first=Joseph |authorlink= |title=The Film Director as Superstar |year=1970 |publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location=Garden City |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dionysus (film)|Dionysus in 69]]'' (1969) was De Palma's other major documentary from this period. The film records [[The Performance Group]]'s performance of Euripides' ''[[The Bacchae]]'', starring, amongst others, De Palma regular William Finley. The play is noted for breaking traditional barriers between performers and audience. The film's most striking quality is its extensive use of the [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]]. De Palma recalls that he was &quot;floored&quot; by this performance upon first sight, and in 1973 recounts how he &quot;began to try and figure out a way to capture it on film. I came up with the idea of split-screen, to be able to show the actual audience involvement, to trace the life of the audience and that of the play as they merge in and out of each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Knapp |first=Lawrence |title=Brian De Palma Interviews |year=2003 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Palma's most significant features from this decade are ''[[Greetings (1968 film)|Greetings]]'' (1968) and ''[[Hi, Mom!]]'' (1970). Both films star Robert De Niro and espouse a [[Leftist]] [[revolutionary]] viewpoint common to their era. ''Greetings'' was entered into the [[19th Berlin International Film Festival]], where it won a [[Silver Bear]] award.&lt;ref name=&quot;berlinale 1969&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Berlinale 1969: Prize Winners |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1969/03_preistr_ger_1969/03_Preistraeger_1969.html |accessdate=March 6, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other major film from this period is the slasher comedy ''[[Murder a la Mod]]''. Each of these films contains experiments in narrative and [[intertextuality]], reflecting De Palma's stated intention to become the &quot;American [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]]&quot; while integrating several of the themes which permeated Hitchcock's work.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Richard. ''Everything Is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard''. p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s: transition to Hollywood===
In the 1970s, De Palma went to Hollywood where he worked on bigger budget films. In 1970, De Palma left New York for Hollywood at age thirty to make ''[[Get to Know Your Rabbit]]'', starring [[Orson Welles]] and [[Tommy Smothers]]. Making the film was a crushing experience for De Palma, as Smothers did not  like many of De Palma's ideas.&lt;ref name=Salamon26&gt;Salamon, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several small, studio and independent released films that included stand-outs ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'', ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'', and ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'', a film based on the [[Carrie (novel)|1974 novel ''Carrie'']] was released, directed by Brian De Palma. The [[psychic]] thriller ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' is seen by some as De Palma's bid for a blockbuster. In fact, the project was small, underfunded by [[United Artists]], and well under the cultural radar during the early months of production, as the source novel by [[Stephen King]] had yet to climb the bestseller list. De Palma gravitated toward the project and changed crucial plot elements based upon his own predilections, not the saleability of the novel. The cast was young and relatively new, though [[Sissy Spacek]] and [[John Travolta]] had gained attention for previous work in, respectively, film and episodic [[situation comedy|sitcoms]]. ''Carrie'' became a hit, the first genuine box-office success for De Palma. It garnered Spacek and [[Piper Laurie]] Oscar nominations for their performances. Preproduction for the film had coincided with the casting process for [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', and many of the actors cast in De Palma's film had been earmarked as contenders for Lucas's movie, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url=http://www.life.com/gallery/61531/image/2661928/almost-cast-who-lost-iconic-roles#index/53 |title=Almost Cast: Who Lost Iconic Roles? |publisher=Life |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;shock ending&quot; finale is effective even while it upholds horror-film convention, its suspense sequences are buttressed by teen comedy tropes, and its use of [[split screen (film)|split-screen]], split-diopter and [[slow motion]] shots tell the story visually rather than through dialogue.

The financial and critical success of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' allowed De Palma to pursue more personal material. ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' was a novel that had fascinated De Palma since the late 1950s and appealed to his background in mathematics and [[avant-garde]] storytelling. Its unconventional unfolding of plot (exemplified in its mathematical layout of dialogue) and its stress on perception have analogs in De Palma's filmmaking. He sought to adapt it on numerous occasions, though the project would carry a substantial price tag, and has yet to appear onscreen ([[Steven Spielberg]]'s adaptation of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' bears striking similarities to De Palma's visual style and some of the themes of ''The Demolished Man''). The result of his experience with adapting ''The Demolished Man'' was ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'', a science fiction psychic thriller that starred [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Carrie Snodgress]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Amy Irving]]. The film was admired by [[Jean-Luc Godard]], who featured a clip in his mammoth ''[[Histoire(s) du cinéma]]'', and [[Pauline Kael]] who championed both ''The Fury'' and De Palma. The film boasted a larger budget than ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', though the consensus view at the time was that De Palma was repeating himself, with diminishing returns. As a film, it retains De Palma's considerable visual flair, but points more toward his work in mainstream entertainments such as ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', the thematic complex thriller for which he is now better known.

===1980s and breakthrough===
In 1984, he directed the music video of the Bruce Springsteen's single &quot;[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing in the Dark]]&quot;. The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films ''[[Dressed to Kill (1980 film)|Dressed to Kill]]'', ''[[Blow Out]]'', ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', ''[[Body Double]]'', and ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]''.

Later into the 1990s and 2000s, De Palma did other films. He attempted to do dramas and a few thrillers plus science fiction. Some of these movies (''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[Carlito's Way]]'') worked and some others (''Raising Cain'', ''Mission to Mars'', ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'') failed at the box office, as did ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'', though this has since developed a cult status amongst cinephiles.

A more political controversy erupted in a later movie from De Palma, ''[[Redacted (film)|Redacted]]'' (2007), which had the subject of American involvement in [[Iraq]], including the committing of war atrocities there. It received limited release in the United States and grossed less than $1 million.

In 2012, his film ''[[Passion (2012 film)|Passion]]'' was selected to compete for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[69th Venice International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;labiennale&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69/ |title=Venezia 69 |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |work=labiennale |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728223053/http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/off-sel/venezia69 |archivedate=July 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he was the subject of a documentary film, ''[[De Palma (film)|De Palma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David Rooney|title='De Palma': Venice Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/noah-baumbach-jake-paltrows-de-821141|accessdate=28 April 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, De Palma began shooting the [[Thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Domino (2019 film)|Domino]]'' in [[Málaga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=A.

==Trademarks and style==

===Themes===
De Palma's films can fall into two categories, his [[psychological thriller]]s (''Sisters'', ''Body Double'', ''Obsession'', ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Blow Out'', ''Raising Cain'') and his mainly commercial films (''Scarface'', ''The Untouchables'', ''Carlito's Way'', and ''Mission: Impossible''). He has often produced &quot;De Palma&quot; films one after the other before going on to direct a different genre, but would always return to his familiar territory. Because of the subject matter and [[graphic violence]] of some of De Palma's films, such as ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Scarface'' and ''Body Double'', they are often at the center of controversy with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], [[Film criticism|film critics]] and the viewing public.&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt;

De Palma is known for quoting and referencing other directors' work throughout his career. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Conversation]]'' plots were used for the basis of ''Blow Out''. ''The Untouchables''{{'}} finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the [[Odessa]] Steps sequence in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''. The main plot from ''[[Rear Window]]'' was used for ''Body Double'', while it also used elements of ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. ''Vertigo'' was also the basis for ''Obsession''. ''Dressed to Kill'' was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt;

===Camera shots===
Film critics have often noted De Palma's penchant for unusual camera angles and compositions throughout his career. He often frames characters against the background using a [[Dutch angle|canted angle shot]]. [[split screen (film)|Split-screen]] techniques have been used to show two separate events happening simultaneously.&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt; To emphasize the dramatic impact of a certain scene De Palma has employed a [[Circle|360-degree]] camera [[Panning (camera)|pan]]. Slow sweeping, panning and [[tracking shot]]s are often used throughout his films, often through precisely-choreographed [[long take]]s lasting for minutes without cutting. Split focus shots, often referred to as &quot;di-opt&quot;, are used by De Palma to emphasize the foreground person/object while simultaneously keeping a background person/object in focus. Slow-motion is frequently used in his films to increase suspense.&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:BrianDePalma09TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|De Palma at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
De Palma is often cited as a leading member of the [[New Hollywood]] generation of film directors, a distinct pedigree who either emerged from film schools or are overtly cine-literate.&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt; His contemporaries include [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Paul Schrader]], [[John Milius]], [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Ridley Scott]]. His artistry in directing and use of cinematography and suspense in several of his films has often been compared to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]].&lt;ref name=AVprimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=FemmeFataleEbert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-depalma24sep24,0,6512079.story|title=The Director's Craft: The death-deifying De Palma|accessdate=December 26, 2007|first=Peter|last=Rainier|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] Calendar|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325222433/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-ca-depalma24sep24%2C0%2C6512079.story|archivedate=March 25, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have been intrigued by De Palma's fascination with pathology, by the aberrant behavior aroused in characters who find themselves manipulated by others.&lt;ref name=Salamon27&gt;Salamon, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Palma has encouraged and fostered the filmmaking careers of directors such as [[Mark Romanek]] and [[Keith Gordon]]. Filmmakers influenced by De Palma include [[Quentin Tarantino]],&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmaurice, Larry (August 28, 2015).

''[[New Jersey Stage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with De Palma, Quentin Tarantino said that ''[[Blow Out]]'' is one of his all-time favorite films, and that after watching ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' he knew how to make his own film.

Critics who frequently admire De Palma's work include [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Roger Ebert]], among others. Kael wrote in her review of ''[[Blow Out]]'', &quot;At forty, Brian De Palma has more than twenty years of moviemaking behind him, and he has been growing better and better. Each time a new film of his opens, everything he has done before seems to have been preparation for it.&quot;&lt;ref name=KaelBO&gt;Kael, Pauline (July 27, 1981).

Retrieved 2012-02-03. &lt;!-- Link is to Criterion reprint of original article. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] wrote about the director: &quot;De Palma deserves more honor as a director. Consider also these titles: ''Sisters'', ''Blow Out'', ''The Fury'', ''Dressed to Kill'', ''Carrie'', ''Scarface'', ''Wise Guys'', ''Casualties of War'', ''Carlito's Way'', ''Mission: Impossible''. Yes, there are a few failures along the way (''Snake Eyes'', ''Mission to Mars'', ''The Bonfire of the Vanities''), but look at the range here, and reflect that these movies contain treasure for those who admire the craft as well as the story, who sense the glee with which De Palma manipulates images and characters for the simple joy of being good at it. It's not just that he sometimes works in the style of Hitchcock, but that he has the nerve to.&quot;&lt;ref name=FemmeFataleEbert&gt;Ebert, Roger (November 6, 2002).

==Criticism==
[[Julie Salamon]] has written that De Palma has been accused of being &quot;a perverse misogynist&quot; by critics.&lt;ref name=Salamon27/&gt; De Palma has responded to accusations of misogyny by saying: &quot;I'm always attacked for having an erotic, sexist approach - chopping up women, putting women in peril. I'm making suspense movies! What else is going to happen to them?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Caputi, Jane (June 15, 1987). ''The Age of Sex Crime''. Popular Press. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote in his entry for De Palma, &quot;There is a self-conscious cunning in De Palma's work, ready to control everything except his own cruelty and indifference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] objected to this characterisation, writing that there are films from the director which can be seen as &quot;straightforwardly empathetic and/or moralistic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/from-the-short-stack-david-thomson-on-brian-de-palma-in-the-new-biographical-dictionary-of-film/|title=From the Short Stack: David Thomson on Brian De Palma in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film|last=Seitz|first=Matt Zoller|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
