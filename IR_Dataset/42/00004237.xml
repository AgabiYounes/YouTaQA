'''Barnard College''' is a private women's [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts]] college located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Founded in 1889 by [[Annie Nathan Meyer]], who named it after [[Columbia University]]'s 10th president, [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard|Frederick Barnard]], it is one of many [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]] founded in the nineteenth century. Barnard College is one of Columbia University's four official undergraduate colleges. The acceptance rate of the Class of 2023 was 11.3%, the most selective and diverse class in the college's 129-year history.

The college was founded as a response to Columbia's refusal to admit women into their institution. Barnard is affiliated with but legally and financially separate from Columbia. Students share classes, clubs, [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek life]], sports teams, buildings and more with Columbia University. Students receive a diploma from both Barnard College and Columbia University.

Barnard offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree programs in about 50 areas of study. Students may also pursue elements of their education at greater [[Columbia University]], the [[Juilliard School]], the [[Manhattan School of Music]], and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|The Jewish Theological Seminary]], which are also based in New York City. Its {{Convert|4|acre|adj=on}} campus is located in the [[Upper Manhattan]] neighborhood of [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]], stretching along [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] between [[116th Street – Columbia University (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|116th]] and [[List of numbered streets in Manhattan|120th]] Streets. It is directly across from Columbia's main campus and near [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan#Description|several other academic institutions]]. The college is a member of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]], an association of seven prominent women's liberal arts colleges.

For its first 229 years [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]] of [[Columbia University]] admitted only men for undergraduate study.&lt;ref name=&quot;farmer20080825&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/record/coeducation.html|title=College Marks 25 years of Coeducation|website=The Record|last1=Farmer|first1=Melanie|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard College was founded in 1889 as a response to Columbia's refusal to admit women into its institution.

The college was named after [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]], a [[deaf]] American educator and mathematician who served as the tenth president of Columbia from 1864 to 1889. He advocated equal educational privileges for men and women, preferably in a coeducational setting, and began proposing in 1879 that Columbia admit women.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor368780&quot; /&gt; The board of trustees repeatedly rejected Barnard's suggestion,&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor368780&quot; /&gt; but in 1883 agreed to create a detailed syllabus of study for women. While they could not attend Columbia classes, those who passed examinations based on the syllabus would receive a degree. The first such woman graduate received her bachelor's degree in 1887. A former student of the program, [[Annie Nathan Meyer|Annie Meyer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg&quot; /&gt; and other prominent New York women persuaded the board in 1889 to create a women's college connected to Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor368780&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring 1991|title=Social and Cultural Stratification in Women's Higher Education: Barnard College and Teachers College, 1898–1912|journal=History of Education Quarterly|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–25|jstor=368780|author=Weneck, Bette|doi=10.2307/368780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnard College's original 1889 home was a rented [[brownstone]] at 343 Madison Avenue, where a faculty of six offered instruction to 14 students in the School of Arts, as well as to 22 &quot;specials&quot;, who lacked the entrance requirements in Greek and so enrolled in science.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}

=== Morningside campus ===
When Columbia University announced in 1892 its impending move to Morningside Heights, Barnard built a new campus nearby with gifts from Mary E. Brinckerhoff, [[Elizabeth Milbank Anderson]] and Martha Fiske.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 215&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these gifts were made with several stipulations attached. Brinckerhoff had offered $100,000 in 1892, on the condition that the Barnard acquire land within 1,000 feet of the Columbia campus within the next four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 209&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barnard trustees purchased land between 119th-120th Streets after receiving funds for that purpose in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 210&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1895/02/19/archives/gifts-to-barnard-college-two-hundred-thousand-dollars-for-a.html|title=GIFTS TO BARNARD COLLEGE; TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A BUILDING FUND.

Rich]] be hired.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart pp. 211-215&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|pp=211&amp;ndash;214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich designed the [[Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Fiske Halls]], built in 1897–1898;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart pp. 211-215&quot; /&gt; these were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris2&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a|dateform=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first classes at the new campus were held in 1897. Despite Brinckerhoff's, Anderson's, and Fiske's gifts, Barnard remained in debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 215&quot; /&gt;

[[Ella Weed]] supervised the college in its first four years; [[Emily James Smith Putnam|Emily James Smith]] succeeded her as Barnard's first dean.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor368780&quot; /&gt; [[Jessica Garretson Finch|Jessica Finch]] is credited with coining the phrase, &quot;current events,&quot; while teaching at Barnard College in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;obituary2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. John Cosgrave Is Dead Founded Finch Junior College: Was Institution's President Nearly 50 Years; Coined 'Current Events' Phrase|date=November 1, 1949|publisher=New York Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the college grew it needed additional space, and in 1903 it received the three blocks south of 119th Street from Anderson who had purchased a former portion of the Bloomingdale Asylum site from the New York Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Plimpton Papers, Barnard College Archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 217&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich provided a master plan for the campus, but only [[Brooks and Hewitt Halls|Brooks Hall]] was built, being constructed between 1906 and 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart pp. 218-219&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|pp=218&amp;ndash;219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv_ny2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10059|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Brooks and Hewitt Halls|author=Kathleen A.

[[Students' Hall]], now known as Barnard Hall, was built in 1916 to a design by [[Arnold W. Brunner|Arnold Brunner]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart pp. 220-221&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|pp=220&amp;ndash;221}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brooks and Hewitt Halls|Hewitt Hall]] was the last structure to be erected, in 1926–1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv_ny2&quot; /&gt; All three buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 223&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dolkart|1998|ps=.|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inability to raise funds precluded the construction of any other buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dolkart p. 223&quot; /&gt;

By the mid-20th century Barnard had succeeded in its original goal of providing a top tier education to women. Between 1920 and 1974, only the much larger [[Hunter College]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]] produced more women graduates who later received doctorate degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman20120314&quot; /&gt;

[[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in about 50 areas of study are offered to Barnard graduates.&lt;ref name=&quot;ataglance&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://admissions.barnard.edu/about/at-a-glance | title=Barnard at a Glance | publisher=Barnard College | accessdate=August 7, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803173349/http://admissions.barnard.edu/about/at-a-glance | archive-date=August 3, 2016 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint programs for the [[Bachelor of Science]] and other degrees exist with Columbia University, [[Juilliard School]], and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|The Jewish Theological Seminary]].

The liberal arts general education requirements are collectively called Foundations. Students must take two courses in the sciences (one of which must be accompanied by a laboratory course), study a single foreign language for two semesters, and take two courses in the arts/humanities as well as two in the social sciences. In addition, students must complete at least one three-credit course in each of the following categories, known as the Modes of Thinking: Thinking Locally—New York City, Thinking through Global Inquiry, Thinking about Social Difference, Thinking with Historical Perspective, Thinking Quantitatively and Empirically, and Thinking Technologically and Digitally. The use of AP or IB credit to fulfill these requirements is very limited, but Foundations courses may overlap with major or minor requirements. In addition to the distributional requirements and the Modes of Thinking, students must complete a first-year seminar, a first-year writing course, and one semester of physical education. Foundations replaced the old general education requirements, called the Nine Ways of Knowing, in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.barnard.edu/barnard-college/curriculum/requirements-liberal-arts-degree/foundations/|title=Foundations {{!}} Barnard College|website=barnard.edu|access-date=November 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student groups include [[theatre]] and vocal music groups, language clubs, [[literary magazines]], a freeform radio station called [[WBAR (college radio)|WBAR]], a biweekly magazine called the ''Barnard Bulletin'', community service groups, and others.

Barnard students can also join [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] or organizations at Columbia University, while Columbia University students are allowed in most, but not all, Barnard organizations. Barnard's McIntosh Activities Council (commonly known as McAC), named after the first President of Barnard, Millicent McIntosh, organizes various community focused events on campus, such as Big Sub and [[Midnight breakfast|Midnight Breakfast]]. McAC is made up of five sub-committees which are the Mosaic committee (formerly known as Multicultural), the Wellness committee, the Network committee, the Community committee, and the Action committee. Each committee has a different focus, such as hosting and publicizing identity and cultural events (Mosaic), having health and wellness related events (Wellness), giving students opportunities to be involved with Alumnae and various professionals (Network), planning events that bring the entire student body together (Community), and planning community service events that give back to the surrounding community (Action).

=== Societies and clubs ===
Barnard College officially banned sororities in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;[http://barnardarchives.wordpress.com/tag/sororities/ Sororities | Barnard College Archives]. Barnardarchives.wordpress.com (September 30, 2010). Retrieved on September 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; but Barnard students continue to participate in Columbia's six National Panhellenic Conference sororities—[[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Sigma Delta Tau]]—and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] Sororities- [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] (Lambda chapter) and [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (Rho chapter) as well as other sororities in the Multicultural Greek Council. Two [[National Panhellenic Conference]] organizations were founded at Barnard College. The [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] fraternity, founded on January 2, 1897, left campus during the 1913 ban but returned to establish its Alpha chapter in 2013. The [[Alpha Epsilon Phi]], founded on October 24, 1909, is no longer on campus. {{as of|2010}}, Barnard does not fully recognize the National Panhellenic Conference sororities at Columbia, but it does provide some funding to account for Barnard students living in Columbia housing through these organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2010/04/27/barnard-funding-sororities-not-recognition Barnard funding for sororities, but not recognition | Columbia Daily Spectator].

=== Traditions ===
'''Take Back the Night''': Each April, Barnard and Columbia students participate in the [[Take Back the Night (protest)|Take Back the Night]] march and speak-out. This annual event grew out of a 1988 [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] conference. The march has grown from under 200 participants in 1988 to more than 2,500 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/tbtn/|title=Take Back the Night|date=March 16, 2007|publisher=Columbia.edu|author=Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midnight breakfast|'''Midnight Breakfast''']] marks the beginning of finals week. As a highly popular event and long-standing college tradition, Midnight Breakfast is hosted by the student-run activities council, McAC (McIntosh Activities Council). In addition to providing standard breakfast foods, each year's theme is also incorporated into the menu. Past themes have included &quot;I YUMM the 90s,&quot; &quot;[[Grease (musical)|Grease]],&quot; and &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game|Take Me Out to the Ballgame]].&quot; The event is a school-wide affair as college deans, trustees and the president serve food to about a thousand students.

'''Big Sub''': Towards the beginning of each fall semester, Barnard College supplies a 700+ feet long [[Subway (restaurant)|subway]] sandwich. Students from the college can take as much of the sub as they can carry. The sub has kosher, dairy free, vegetarian, and vegan sections.

==== Before coeducation at Columbia ====
Smith and Columbia president [[Seth Low]] worked to open Columbia classes to Barnard students. By 1900 they could attend Columbia classes in philosophy, political science, and several scientific fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor368780&quot; /&gt; That year Barnard formalized an affiliation with the university which made available to its students the instruction and facilities of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;catalog2&quot; /&gt; [[Franz Boas]], who taught at both Columbia and Barnard in the early 1900s, was among those faculty members who reportedly found Barnard students superior to their male Columbia counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;zimmerman20120314&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/0314/Barnard-College-flap-Competition-among-women-shouldn-t-be-over-men|title=Barnard College flap: Competition among women shouldn't be over men|date=March 14, 2012|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=March 1, 2013|author=Zimmerman, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 Columbia and Barnard students could register for the other school's classes with the permission of the instructor; from 1973 no permission was needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg&quot; /&gt;

Except for Columbia College, by the 1940s other undergraduate and graduate divisions of Columbia University admitted women.&lt;ref name=&quot;farmer20080825&quot; /&gt; Columbia president [[William J. McGill]] predicted in 1970 that Barnard College and Columbia College would merge within five years. In 1973 Columbia and Barnard signed a three-year agreement to increase sharing classrooms, facilities, and housing, and cooperation in faculty appointments,&lt;ref name=&quot;spec198308292&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spec-archive.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19830829-01.2.35&amp;srpos=8&amp;dliv=none&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-barnard+columbia+merge----|title=The Road to Coeducation|date=August 29, 1983|work=Columbia Spectator|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they described as &quot;integration without assimilation&quot;;{{r|time19820201}} by the mid-1970s most Columbia dormitories were coed.&lt;ref name=&quot;crimson19741004&quot; /&gt; The university's financial difficulties during the decade increased its desire to merge&lt;ref name=&quot;crimson197409242&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/9/24/financial-difficulties-prompt-columbia-report-on/|title=Financial Difficulties Prompt Columbia Report on Merger|date=September 24, 1975|work=Harvard Crimson|accessdate=March 1, 2013|author=Hartocollis, Anemona}}&lt;/ref&gt; to end what Columbia described as the &quot;anachronism&quot; of single-sex education,{{r|time19820201}} but Barnard resisted doing so because of Columbia's large debt,&lt;ref name=&quot;crimson19741004&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1974/10/4/a-survey-of-co-education-in-the/?page=single|title=A Survey of Co-education in The Ivies|date=October 4, 1974|work=Harvard Crimson|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting in 1975 Columbia dean [[Peter Pouncey]]'s proposal to merge Barnard and the three Columbia undergraduate schools.{{r|spec198308292}} The 1973–1976 chairwoman of the board at Barnard, Eleanor Thomas Elliott, led the resistance to this takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=Eleanor Thomas Elliott, 80, Barnard Figure|date=December 6, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college's marketing emphasized the Columbia relationship, however, the ''Bulletin'' in 1976 stating that Barnard described it as identical to the one between [[Harvard College]] and [[Radcliffe College]] (&quot;who are merged in practically everything but name at this point&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;bb19760201&quot; /&gt;

After Barnard rejected subsequent merger proposals from Columbia and a one-year extension to the 1973 agreement expired, in 1977 the two schools began discussing their future relationship. By 1979 the relationship had so deteriorated that Barnard officials stopped attending meetings. Because of an expected decline in enrollment, in 1980 a Columbia committee recommended that Columbia College begin admitting women without Barnard's cooperation. A 1981 committee found that Columbia was no longer competitive with other Ivy League universities without women, and that admitting women would not affect Barnard's applicant pool. That year Columbia president [[Michael Sovern]] agreed for the two schools to cooperate in admitting women to Columbia, but Barnard faculty's opposition caused president [[Ellen Futter]] to reject the agreement.{{r|spec198308292}}

A decade of negotiations for a Columbia-Barnard merger akin to Harvard and Radcliffe had failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;time19820201&quot; /&gt; In January 1982, the two schools instead announced that Columbia College would begin admitting women in 1983, and Barnard's control over tenure for its faculty would increase;{{r|spec198308292}}&lt;ref name=&quot;farmer20080825&quot; /&gt; previously, a committee on which Columbia faculty outnumbered Barnard's three to two controlled the latter's tenure.{{r|time19820201}} Applications to Columbia rose 56% that year, making admission more selective, and nine Barnard students transferred to Columbia.

It is responsible for its own separate admissions, health, security, guidance and placement services, and has its own alumnae association. Nonetheless, Barnard students participate in the academic, social, athletic and extracurricular life of the broader University community on a reciprocal basis. The affiliation permits the two schools to share some academic resources; for example, only Barnard has an [[urban studies]] department, and only Columbia has a [[computer science]] department. Most Columbia classes are open to Barnard students and vice versa. Barnard students and faculty are represented in the University Senate, and student organizations such as the ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' are open to all students. Barnard students play on Columbia athletics teams, and Barnard uses Columbia email, telephone and network services.&lt;ref name=&quot;stallone20120216&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bccupartnership2&quot; /&gt;

Barnard athletes compete in the [[Ivy League]] ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]]) through the Columbia/Barnard Athletic Consortium, which was established in 1983.

=== Seven Sisters ===
{{Main|Seven Sisters (colleges)}}Established within the Barnard Student Government Association (SGA), The Seven Sisters Governing Board represents Barnard College as part of the Seven Sisters Coalition, which is a group of representatives from student councils of the historic Seven Sisters colleges. The reps on the coordinating board of Seven Sisters Coalition are rotating every year to hold the annual Seven Sisters Conference in a serious but informal setting. The first Seven Sisters Conference was hosted by SGA student representatives at Barnard College in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/sevensistersstudents/volunteer-information/volunteer-dispatch|title=Leadership Conference|last=Seven Sisters Student Coalition|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2013, the conference was hosted by [[Vassar College]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;during the first weekend of November. The major topic focused on inner college collaborations and differences in student government structures among Seven Sisters Colleges. The Seven Sisters Coordinating Board of Barnard brought six Barnard student representatives to attend the Fall Semester conference, which was hosted at Vassar College in the past fall semester. Based on the Coalition Coordinating Board Constitution established in February 2013, Students delegates were initiating projects in the aspects of public relations, alumni outreach and website management to promote the presence and development of the seven sisters culture. Meanwhile, The Barnard delegates engaged in discussions about the various structures of the student governments among the historic seven sisters colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/sevensistersstudents/in-the-community/inaugural-spring-summit|title=Coalition Coordinating Board Constitution|last=Seven Sisters Coalition|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In the spring of 1960, Columbia University president Grayson Kirk complained to the president of Barnard that Barnard students were wearing inappropriate clothing. The garments in question were pants and Bermuda shorts. The administration forced the student council to institute a dress code. Students would be allowed to wear shorts and pants only at Barnard and only if the shorts were no more than two inches above the knee and the pants were not tight. Barnard women crossing the street to enter the Columbia campus wearing shorts or pants were required to cover themselves with a long coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A15F73F5916738DDDA10A94DC405B808AF1D3|title=Ban on Shorts Threatens Classic Barnard Couture|date=April 28, 1960|work=The New York Times|page=1|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Barnard College Blue Book|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=87–88|chapter=Administrative Regulations: Campus Etiquette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article on students who cohabited, identifying one of the persons they interviewed as a student at Barnard College from New Hampshire named &quot;Susan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=An arrangement: living together for convenience, security, sex|last=Klemesrud|first=Judy|date=March 4, 1968|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnard officials searched their records for women from New Hampshire and were able to determine that &quot;Susan&quot; was the pseudonym of a student (Linda LeClair) who was living with her boyfriend, a student at Columbia University. She was called before Barnard's student-faculty administration judicial committee, where she faced the possibility of expulsion. A student protest included a petition signed by 300 other Barnard women, admitting that they too had broken the regulations against cohabitating. The judicial committee reached a compromise and the student was allowed to remain in school, but was denied use of the college cafeteria and barred from all social activities. The student briefly became a focus of intense national attention. She eventually dropped out of Barnard.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/cuhistory/archives/Rosenberg/woman_question.htm |title=The Woman Question |last=Rosenberg |first=Rosalind |date=September 21, 1999 |publisher=Barnard College |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705143127/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/cuhistory/archives/Rosenberg/woman_question.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', April 8, 1968, p. 85 and ''Newsweek'', April 29, 1968, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey19992&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rq8FS3juFzAC|title=Sex in the heartland|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1999|isbn=0-674-00974-6|page=201|author=Bailey, Beth L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
