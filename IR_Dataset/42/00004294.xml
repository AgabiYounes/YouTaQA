The '''British National Party''' ('''BNP''') is a [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[Fascism|fascist]] [[list of political parties in the United Kingdom|political party in the United Kingdom]]. It is headquartered in [[Wigton]], [[Cumbria]], and its current leader is [[Adam Walker (British politician)|Adam Walker]]. A [[minor party]], it has no elected representatives at any level of UK government. Founded in 1982, the party reached its greatest level of success in the 2000s, when it had over fifty seats in local government, one seat on the [[London Assembly]], and two [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]].

Taking its name from that of a [[British National Party (1960)|defunct 1960s far-right party]], the BNP was created by [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and other former members of the fascist [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF). During the 1980s and 1990s, the BNP placed little emphasis on contesting elections, in which it did poorly. Instead, it focused on street marches and rallies, creating the [[Combat 18]] paramilitary—its name a coded reference to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]]—to protect its events from [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] protesters. A growing 'moderniser' faction was frustrated by Tyndall's leadership, and ousted him in 1999. The new leader [[Nick Griffin]] sought to broaden the BNP's electoral base by presenting a more moderate image, targeting concerns about rising immigration rates, and emphasising localised community campaigns. This resulted in increased electoral growth throughout the 2000s, to the extent that it became the most electorally successful far-right party in British history. Concerns regarding financial mismanagement resulted in Griffin being removed from office in 2014. By this point the BNP's membership and vote share had declined dramatically, groups like [[Britain First]] and [[National Action (UK)|National Action]] had splintered off, and the [[English Defence League]] had supplanted it as the UK's foremost far-right group.

Ideologically positioned on the extreme-right or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] by [[political science|political scientists]]. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]. The party is [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]], and it espouses the view that only [[white people]] should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls for an end to non-white migration into the UK and for non-white Britons to be stripped of citizenship and removed from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although since 1999 has advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes [[scientific racism|biological racism]] and the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]], calling for global [[racial segregation|racial separatism]] and condemning [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]]. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] and [[Holocaust denial]], promoting the [[conspiracy theory]] that [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Jews seek to dominate the world]] through both [[communism]] and international [[capitalism]]. Under Griffin, the party's focus switched from anti-semitism towards [[Islamophobia]]. It promotes [[economic protectionism]], [[Euroscepticism]], and a transformation away from [[liberal democracy]], while its social policies oppose [[feminism]], [[LGBT rights]], and [[permissive society|societal permissiveness]].

Operating around a highly centralised structure that gave its chair near total control, the BNP built links with far-right parties across Europe and created various sub-groups, including a record label and trade union. The BNP attracted most support from within [[White British]] working-class communities in northern and eastern England, particularly among middle-aged and elderly men. Polls suggested that most Britons favoured a ban on the party. It faced much opposition from anti-fascists, religious organisations, the mainstream media, and most politicians, and BNP members were banned from various professions.

===John Tyndall's leadership: 1982–1999===

The British National Party (BNP){{refn|The name British National Party had been used in politics by four organisations,{{sfn|Husbands|1983|p=19}} most notably by the [[British National Party (1942)|Mosleyite party]] which became the [[English National Association]] and by [[British National Party (1960s)|a 1960s party]] initiated by [[John Bean]], which became part of the [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]]. Tyndall was a leading member of the 1960s BNP and a founder of the present party.|group=note}} was founded by the extreme-right political activist [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]]. Tyndall had been involved in [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups since the late 1950s before leading the far-right [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] (NF) throughout most of the 1970s. Following an argument with senior party member [[Martin Webster]], he resigned from the NF in 1980.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=21–23|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=24}} In June 1980 Tyndall established a rival, the New National Front (NNF).{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=23}} At the recommendation of [[Ray Hill]]—who was secretly an [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] spy seeking to sow disharmony among Britain's far-right—Tyndall decided to unite an array of extreme-right groups as a single party.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=24–25|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=59}} To this end, Tyndall established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=25}} In March 1982, the CNU held a conference at the [[Charing Cross Hotel]] in London,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=25}} at which 50 far-right activists agreed to the formation of the BNP.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=25}}

The BNP was formally launched on 7 April 1982 at a press conference in [[Victoria, London|Victoria]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=26|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=36}} Led by Tyndall, most of its early members came from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, [[British Movement]], [[British Democratic Party]], and [[Constitutional Movement|Nationalist Party]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=25–26|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=36}} Tyndall remarked that there was &quot;scarcely any difference [between the BNP and NF] in ideology or policy save in the minutest detail&quot;,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} and most of the BNP's leading activists had formerly been senior NF figures.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=36}} Under Tyndall's leadership the party was neo-Nazi in orientation and engaged in nostalgia for [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} It adopted the NF's tactic of holding street marches and rallies, believing that these boosted morale and attracted new recruits.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=43}} Their first march took place in London on [[St. George's Day]] 1982.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=43}} These marches often involved clashes with anti-fascist protesters and resulted in multiple arrests, helping to cement the BNP's association with political violence and older [[fascism|fascist]] groups in the public eye.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=44}} As a result, BNP organisers began to favour indoor rallies, although street marches continued to be held throughout the mid-to-late 1980s.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=44}}

In its early years, the BNP's involvement in elections was &quot;irregular and intermittent&quot;,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=39}} and for its first two decades it faced consistent electoral failure.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=9}} It suffered from low finances and few personnel,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=41}} and its leadership was aware that its electoral viability was weakened by the anti-immigration rhetoric of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=49|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=42}} In the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] the BNP stood 54 candidates, although it only campaigned in five seats.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=9}} Although it was able to air its first [[party political broadcast]], it averaged a vote share of 0.06% in the seats it contested.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=31|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=41–42}}&lt;ref name=&quot;eightthree&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1979.stm|title=1979–1983|series=Under the skin of the BNP|access-date=4 January 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322033430/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/roots/1979.stm|archive-date=22 March 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the [[Representation of the People Act 1985]] raised the electoral [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]] to £500, the BNP adopted a policy of &quot;very limited involvement&quot; in elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=42}} It abstained in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]],{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=41|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=9}} and stood only 13 candidates in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=9}} In [[1993 Millwall by-election|a 1993 local by-election]] the BNP gained one council seat—won by [[Derek Beackon]] in the East London district of [[Millwall]]—after a campaign that played to local whites who were angry at the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in [[social housing]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=263|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2pp=51, 62–65|3a1=Bottom|3a2=Copus|3y=2011|3p=144|4a1=Goodwin|4y=2011|4p=xii}} Following an anti-BNP campaign launched by local religious groups and the [[Anti-Nazi League]], it lost this seat during the [[1994 United Kingdom local elections|1994 local elections]].{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=66|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=xii, 47|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3pp=29–32}} In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], it contested 55 seats and gained an average 1.4% of the vote.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=131|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=9}}&lt;ref name=&quot;copsey73&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Copsey|2004|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=John Tyndall was both [the BNPs] greatest asset and its greatest drawback.

In the early 1990s, a &quot;moderniser&quot; faction emerged within the party, favouring a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=46}} They were impressed by the electoral gains made by a number of extreme-right parties in continental Europe—such as [[Jörg Haider]]'s [[Austrian Freedom Party]] and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Front (France)|National Front]]—which had been achieved by both switching focus from [[biological racism]] to the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups and by replacing anti-democratic platforms with [[populism|populist]] ones.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=70|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=48–50}} 
The modernisers called for community campaigns among the white working-class populations of London's [[East End]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=46–47}} and Northern England.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=51}} While the modernisers gained some concessions from the party's hard-liners,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=51}} Tyndall opposed many of their ideas and sought to stem their growing influence.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=53}} In his view, &quot;we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to the public&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=45}}

===Nick Griffin's leadership: 1999–2014===

[[File:Nick griffin bnp from flickr user britishnationalism.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Nick Griffin at a BNP press conference in Manchester in 2009]]

After the BNP's poor performance at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall's leadership grew.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=53}} The modernisers called the party's first leadership election, and in October 1999 Tyndall was ousted when two-thirds of those voting backed [[Nick Griffin]], who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=75–76, 101|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=55}} Often characterised as a political chameleon,{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=201}} Griffin had once been considered a party hardliner before switching allegiance to the modernisers in the late 1990s. In his youth, he had been involved in the NF as well as [[Third Position]]ist groups like [[Political Soldier]] and the [[International Third Position]].{{sfnm|1a1=Griffin|1y=2011|1p=196|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=66}} Criticising his predecessors for fuelling the image of the BNP as &quot;thugs, losers and troublemakers&quot;,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=71}} Griffin inaugurated a period of change in the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=55–56}}

Influenced by Le Pen's National Front in France, Griffin sought to widen the BNP's appeal to individuals who were concerned about immigration but had not previously voted for the extreme-right.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=123|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=67}} The BNP replaced Tyndall's policy of compulsory deportation of non-whites to a voluntary system whereby non-whites would be given financial incentives to emigrate.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}} It downplayed [[biological racism]] and stressed the cultural incompatibility of different racial groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}} This emphasis on culture allowed it to foreground [[Islamophobia]], and following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 it launched a &quot;Campaign Against Islam&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} It stressed the claim that the BNP was &quot;''not'' a racist party&quot; but an &quot;organised response to anti-white racism&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=103}} At the same time Griffin sought to reassure the party's base that these reforms were based on pragmatism and not a change in principle.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=102|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=68}}

Griffin also sought to shed the BNP's image as a [[single-issue party]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} by embracing a diverse array of social and economic issues.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} Griffin renamed the party's monthly newspaper from ''British Nationalist'' to ''The Voice of Freedom'', and established a new journal, ''Identity''.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=114}} The party developed community-based campaigns,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} through which it targeted local issues,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} particularly in those areas with large numbers of skilled white working-class people who were disaffected with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=73}} For instance, in [[Burnley]] it campaigned for lower speed limits on housing estates and against the closure of a local swimming bath, while in South Birmingham it targeted pensioners' concerns about youth gangs.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=74}} In 2006 the party urged its activists to carry out local activities like cleaning up children's play areas and removing [[graffiti]] while wearing high-vis jackets emblazoned with the party logo.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=74|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=134}}

Griffin believed that [[Peak Oil]] and a growth in Third World migrants arriving in Britain would result in a BNP government coming to power by 2040.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=170}} 
The close of the twentieth century produced more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=9–10}} In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=10}} In July 2000, it came second in the [[Bexley London Borough Council elections#1998–2002|council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley]], its best result since 1993.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=139|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2pp=95–96}} At the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=10}} In the [[2002 United Kingdom local elections|2002 local elections]] the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley,{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=138|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=144|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=11}} where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=133–134}} This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=142|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=11}} In the [[2003 United Kingdom local elections|2003 local elections]] the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1pp=124, 145|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=11|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=118}} Concerned that much of their potential vote was going to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=154}} Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=155}} They invested much in the campaign for the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2004 European Parliament election]], at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=150|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=12–13}} In the [[2004 United Kingdom local elections|2004 local elections]], they secured four more seats, including three in [[Epping, Essex|Epping]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=154}}

For the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], the BNP expanded its number of candidates to 119 and targeted specific regions. Its average vote in the areas it contested rose to 4.3%.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=11}} It gained significantly more support in three seats, achieving 10% in [[Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)|Burnley]], 13% in [[Dewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Dewsbury]], and 17% in [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=11}} In the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]] the party gained 220,000 votes, with 33 additional councillors, having averaged a vote share of 18% in the areas it contested.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=167|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=12}} In Barking and Dagenham, it saw 12 of its 13 candidates elected to the council.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=2}} At the [[2008 London Assembly election]], the BNP gained 130,000 votes, reaching the 5% mark and thus gaining an Assembly seat.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=44|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=12}} At the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European Parliament election]], the party gained almost 1 million votes, with two of its candidates, Nick Griffin and [[Andrew Brons]], being elected as Members of the European Parliament for [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] and [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]] respectively.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=1|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=13|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=152}} That election also saw extreme-right parties winning seats for various other EU member-states.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=13}} This victory marked a major watershed for the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=13}} Amid [[Question Time British National Party controversy|significant public controversy]], Griffin was invited to appear on the [[BBC]] show ''[[Question Time]]'' in October 2009, the first time that the BNP had been invited to share a national television platform with mainstream panellists. Griffin's performance was however widely regarded as poor.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=4|2a1=Copsey|2a2=Macklin|2y=2011|2pp=86–89|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=13|4a1=Trilling|4y=2012|4pp=168–169}}

Despite its success, there was dissent in the party. In 2007 a group of senior members known as the &quot;December rebels&quot; challenged Griffin, calling for internal party democracy and financial transparency, but were expelled.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} In 2008, a group of BNP activists in [[Bradford]] split to form the Democratic Nationalists.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=80}} In November 2008, the BNP membership list was posted to WikiLeaks, after appearing briefly on a weblog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7956824.stm|title='BNP membership' officer sacked|work=BBC News|access-date=23 March 2009|date=21 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326060319/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7956824.stm|archive-date=26 March 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in October 2009, another list of BNP members was leaked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/20/bnp-membership-list-wikileaks|title=BNP membership list leaked|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 October 2009|place=London|first=Robert|last=Booth|date=20 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130044736/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/20/bnp-membership-list-wikileaks|archive-date=30 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddy Butler then led a challenge to Griffin's leadership, alleging financial corruption, but he had insufficient support.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=94}} The rebels who supported him split into two groups: one section remained as the internal Reform Group, the other left the BNP to form the [[British Freedom Party]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=94}}
By 2010, there was discontent among the party's grassroots, a result of the change to its white-only membership policy and rumours of financial corruption among its leadership.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=13–14}} Some defected to the National Front or left to form parties like [[Britain First]], the [[British Freedom Party]], the National People's Party and the [[Britannica Party]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2014|p=901}} [[Anti-fascism|Anti-fascist]] groups like [[Hope not Hate]] had campaigned extensively in Barking to stop the area's locals voting for the BNP.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=14}} At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the BNP had hoped to make a breakthrough by gaining a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], although it failed to achieve this.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=2–3}} It nevertheless gained the fifth largest national vote share, with 1.9% of the vote, representing the most successful electoral performance for an extreme-right party in UK history.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=14|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2014|2p=887}} In the [[2010 United Kingdom local elections|2010 local elections]], it lost all of its councillors in Barking and Dagenham.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=3|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=3}} Nationally, the party's number of councillors dropped from over fifty to 28.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=3}} Griffin described the results as &quot;disastrous&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=3}}

[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|The BNP uses the iconography of the Union flag prominently on its published material.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=42}}]]

Many academic historians and political scientists have described the BNP as a [[far-right]] party,{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1a2=Finlay|1y=2008|1p=707|2a1=Driver|2y=2011|2p=132|3a1=Bottom|3a2=Copus|3y=2011|3p=146|4a1=Copsey|4y=2011|4p=1|5a1=Davey|5y=2011|5p=436|6a1=Messina|6y=2011|6p=165|7a1=Trilling|7y=2012|7p=5}} or as an [[extreme-right]] party.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=1|2a1=Woodbridge|2y=2010|2p=25|3a1=Copsey|3y=2011|3p=1|4a1=Goodwin|4y=2011|4p=xii}} As the political scientist [[Matthew Goodwin]] used it, the term referred to &quot;a particular form of political ideology that is defined by two anti-constitutional and anti-democratic elements: first, right-wing extremists are ''extremist'' because they reject or undermine the values, procedures and institutions of the democratic constitutional state; and second they are ''right-wing'' because they reject the principle of fundamental human equality&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=6}}

Various political scientists and historians have described the BNP as being [[fascism|fascist]] in ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011|1p=7|2a1=Davey|2y=2011|2p=438|3a1=Richardson|3y=2011|3p=39|4a1=Trilling|4y=2012|4p=6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;bnpelection2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Renton|first=David|date=1 March 2005|title='A day to make history'?

The anti-fascist activist [[Gerry Gable]] referred to the BNP as a &quot;Nazi organisation&quot;,{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=262}} while the [[Anti-Nazi League]] published leaflets describing the BNP as the &quot;British Nazi Party&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=61}} Copsey suggested that while the BNP under Tyndall could be described as neo-Nazi, it was not &quot;crudely mimetic&quot; of the original German Nazism.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=98}} Davey characterised the BNP as a &quot;populist ethno-nationalist&quot; party.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=435}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The [BNP's] smart modernized veneer... is superficial; the core of the Party remains ideologically fascist, and this was nowhere more apparent than in the BNP manifesto for the 2010 General Election, which returned to a clutch of traditional fascist themes including the bond of blood, homeland, the decadence of contemporary culture, a nostalgia for folk traditions and heritage, and an emphasis on stricter discipline in education and society. During the election campaign anti-Semitism, racism and neo-Nazi sympathies were identified on candidates' social network sites.|source=— Political theologian Andrew P. Davey, 2011{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=438}}}}

In his writings, Griffin acknowledged that much of his 'modernisation' was an attempt to hide the BNP's core ideology behind more electorally palatable policies.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=39–40}} Like the National Front, the BNP's private discourse differed from its public one,{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|pp=708–709}} with Griffin stating that &quot;Of course we must teach the truth to the hardcore... [but] when it comes to influencing the public, forget about racial differences, genetics, Zionism, historical revisionism and so on... we must at all times present them with an image of moderate reasonableness&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Wood|1a2=Finlay|1y=2008|1p=708|2a1=Davey|2y=2011|2p=439}} The BNP has eschewed the labels &quot;fascist&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot;, claiming that it is neither. In its 1992 electoral manifesto, it insisted that &quot;Fascism was Italian. Nazism was German. We are British. We will do things our own way; we will not copy foreigners&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=76}} In 2009, Griffin that the term &quot;fascism&quot; was simply &quot;a smear that comes from the far left&quot;; he added that the term should be reserved for groups that engaged in &quot;political violence&quot; and desired a state that &quot;should impose its will on people&quot;, claiming that it was the anti-fascist group [[Unite Against Fascism]]—and not the BNP—who were the real fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/8146456.stm|title=Sink a couple of boats|website=BBC News|date=12 July 2009|access-date=10 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327052302/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/8146456.stm|archive-date=27 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, many on Britain's extreme-right sought to avoid the term &quot;British fascism&quot; because of its electorally unpalatable connotations, utilising &quot;British nationalism&quot; in its place.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=76–77}}

After Griffin took control of the party, it made increasing use of [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] themes in order to emphasise its &quot;British&quot; credentials.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} In its published material, the party made appeals to the idea of Britain and Britishness in a manner not dissimilar to mainstream political parties.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=41}} In this material it has also made prominent use of the [[Union flag]] and the colours red, white, and blue.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=42}} Roger Griffin noted that the terms &quot;Britain&quot; and &quot;England&quot; appear &quot;confusingly interchangeable&quot; in BNP literature,{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}} while Copsey has pointed out that the BNP's form of British nationalism is &quot;Anglo-centric&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=163}} The party employed militaristic rhetoric under both Tyndall and Griffin's leadership; under the latter for example its published material spoke of a &quot;war without uniforms&quot; and a &quot;war for our survival as a people&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=165}} Tyndall described the BNP as a revolutionary party,{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=82}} calling it a &quot;guerrilla army operating in occupied territory&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=83}}

===Ethnic nationalism and biological racism===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The British National Party exists to secure a future for the indigenous peoples of these islands in the North Atlantic which have been our homeland for a millennia.|source=— The BNP, 2005{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=707}} }}

The BNP adheres to [[scientific racism|biological racist]] ideas,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=8}} displaying an obsession with the perceived differences of racial groups.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=48}} Both Tyndall and Griffin believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned &quot;British race&quot; which was one branch of a wider [[Nordic race]],{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=88, 163}} a view akin to those of earlier fascists such as Hitler and [[Arnold Leese]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}}

The BNP adheres to an ideology of [[ethnic nationalism]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} It promotes the idea that not all citizens of the United Kingdom belong to the British nation.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Instead, it claims that the nation only belongs to &quot;the English, Scots, Irish and Welsh along with the limited numbers of peoples of European descent, who have arrived centuries or decades ago and who have fully integrated into our society&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} This is a group that Griffin referred to as the &quot;home people&quot; or &quot;the folk&quot;.{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=191}} According to Tyndall, &quot;The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism.&quot;{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=37}} Richard Edmonds in 1993 told ''[[The Guardian]]'''s [[Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)|Duncan Campbell]] that &quot;we [the BNP] are 100% racist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gabriel, John ''Whitewash: Radicalized Politics and the Media'', Routledge, 1998, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP does not regard UK citizens who are not ethnic white Europeans as &quot;British&quot;, and party literature calls on supporters to avoid referring to such individuals as &quot;Black Britons&quot; or &quot;Asian Britons&quot;, instead describing them as &quot;racial foreigners&quot;.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=49}}

[[File:Nick Griffin.jpg|left|thumb|200px|On taking over the party, Nick Griffin dropped its official espousal of the biological superiority of a Nordic race, instead emphasising the need for racial separatism to preserve global &quot;ethno-pluralism&quot;]]

Tyndall believed the white British and the broader Nordic race to be superior to other races,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}} and under his leadership, the BNP promoted [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims in support of [[white supremacy]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=38}} Following Griffin's ascendency to power in the party, it officially repudiated racial supremacism and insisted that no racial group was superior or inferior to another.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=67}} Instead it foregrounded an &quot;[[Ethnopluralism|ethno-pluralist]]&quot; racial separatism, claiming that different racial groups had to be kept separate and distinct for their own preservation, maintaining that global ethno-cultural diversity was something to be protected.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=160|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=67}} This switch in focus owed much to the discourse of the French [[Nouvelle Droite]] movement which had emerged within France's extreme-right during the 1960s.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=160}}
At the same time the BNP switched focus from openly promoting biological racism to stressing what it perceived as the [[cultural racism|cultural incompatibility of racial groups]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} It placed great focus on opposing what it referred to as &quot;[[multiculturalism]]&quot;,{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=62}} characterising this as a form of &quot;cultural genocide&quot;,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=160}} and claiming that it promoted the interests of non-whites at the expense of the white British population.{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=64}} However, internal documents produced and circulated under Griffin's leadership demonstrated that—despite the shift in its public statements—it remained privately committed to biological racist ideas.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=49}}

The party emphasises what it sees as the need to protect the racial purity of the white British.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=8}} It condemns [[miscegenation]] and &quot;race mixing&quot;, claiming that this is a threat to the British race.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=38|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=48}} Tyndall stated that he &quot;felt deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage&quot; but had &quot;no sympathy whatsoever for the parents&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=89–90}} Griffin similarly stated that mixed-race children were &quot;the most tragic victims of enforced multi-racism&quot;, and that the party would not &quot;accept miscegenation as moral or normal ... we never will&quot;.{{sfn|Sutton|Perry|2009|p=91}} In its 1983 election manifesto, the BNP stated that &quot;family size is a private matter&quot; but still called for white Britons who are &quot;of intelligent, healthy and industrious stock&quot; to have large families and thus raise the white British birth-rate.{{sfn|Durham|1995|p=283}} The encouragement of high birth rates among white British families continued under Griffin's leadership.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=85}}

Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP promoted [[eugenics]], calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=90|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=38}} In party literature, it talked of improving the British 'racial stock' by removing &quot;inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1998|1pp=131–132|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=38}} Tyndall argued that medical professionals should be responsible for determining whom to sterilise, while a lowering of welfare benefits would discourage breeding among those he deemed to be genetic inferiors.{{sfn|Durham|1998|pp=131–132}} In his magazine ''Spearhead'', Tyndall also stated that &quot;the gas chamber system&quot; should be used to eliminate &quot;sub-human elements&quot;, &quot;perverts&quot;, and &quot;asocials&quot; from British society.{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}}

===Anti-immigrationism and repatriation===

Opposition to immigration has been central to the BNP's political platform.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=440}} It has engaged in [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] campaigns which emphasise the idea that immigrants and ethnic minorities are both different from, and a threat to, the white British and white Irish populations.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=7, 39}} In its campaign material it presented non-whites both as a source of crime in the UK, and as a socio-economic threat to the white British population by taking jobs, housing, and welfare away from them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} It engaged in [[welfare chauvinism]], calling for white Britons to be prioritised by the UK's welfare state.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} Party literature included such as claims as that the BNP was the only party which could &quot;do anything effective about the swamping of Britain by the Third World&quot; or &quot;lead the native peoples of Britain in our version of the New Crusade that must be organised if Europe is not to sink under the Islamic yoke&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=164}}

Much of its published material made claims about a forthcoming [[race war]] and promoted the [[conspiracy theory]] about [[white genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=39–40}} In a 2009 radio interview, Griffin referred to this as a &quot;bloodless genocide&quot;.{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=64}} It presents the idea that white Britons are engaged in a battle against their own extinction as a racial group.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=158}} It reiterated a sense of urgency about the situation, claiming that both high immigration rates and high birth rates among ethnic minorities were a threat to the white British.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=161–162}} In 2010, it for instance was promoting the idea that at current levels, &quot;indigenous Britons&quot; would be a minority within the UK by 2060.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=157}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The immigrant communities in Britain are... colonies filled with colonists. They are alien islands inside our towns and cities with their own laws and cultures. They will never integrate as they did not come here to integrate, but to re-create their own cultures in our country. The fact is that the only solution to Multi-Culturalism is not some asinine and bogus attempt to impose British cultural values on immigrants, but simply to commence repatriating them.|source=— Lee Barnes, senior BNP leader, 2005{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=720}} }}

The BNP calls for the non-white population of Britain to either be reduced in size or removed from the country altogether.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Under Tyndall's leadership it promoted the compulsory removal of non-whites from the UK, stating that under a BNP government they would be &quot;repatriated&quot; to their countries of origin.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=39}} In the early 1990s it produced stickers with the slogan &quot;Our Final Solution: Repatriation&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=39}} Tyndall understood this to be a two-stage process that would take ten to twenty years, with some non-whites initially leaving willingly and the others then being forcibly deported.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=89}} During the 1990s, party modernisers suggested that the BNP move away from a policy of compulsory repatriation and toward a voluntary system, whereby non-white persons would be offered financial incentives to leave the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=47–48}} This idea, adopted from [[Powellism]], was deemed more electorally palatable.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=47–48}}

When Griffin took control of the party, the policy of voluntary repatriation was officially adopted, with the party suggesting that this could be financed through the use of the UK's pre-existing [[Department for International Development|foreign aid budget]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=136|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=104|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=68}} It stated that any non-whites who refused to leave would be stripped of their British citizenship and categorised as &quot;permanent guests&quot;, while continuing to be offered incentives to emigrate.{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=136}} Griffin's BNP also stressed its support for an immediate halt to non-white immigration into Britain and for the deportation of any migrants illegally in the country.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} Speaking on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'' in 2009, Griffin declared that, unlike Tyndall, he &quot;does not want all-white UK&quot; because &quot;nobody out there wants it or would pay for it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|title=BNP 'does not want all-white UK'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8146585.stm|work=BBC News|date=12 July 2009|access-date=10 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711171456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8146585.stm|archive-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=My experience as a campaigner against the multi-racial idea in Britain and in favour of our country's centuries-old tradition of racial homogeneity has brought home to me beyond any doubt the fact that Jews are to be found at the forefront of opposition to British racial self-preservation.|source=— Tyndall's belief that a Jewish conspiracy was behind multiracial Britain{{sfn|Tyndall|1988|pp=106–107}} }}

Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP was openly [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=38–39}} From [[A. K. Chesterton]], Tyndall had inherited a belief that there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, viewing the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as genuine evidence for this.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=91}} He believed that Jews were responsible for both [[communism]] and international finance capitalism and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=91}} He believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of the Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=89}} In an early edition of ''Spearhead'' published in the 1960s, Tyndall wrote that &quot;if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Billig|1y=1978|1p=128|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=53}} Tyndall added [[Holocaust denial]] to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the [[Holocaust]] was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination.{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=267|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=92|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=39}} Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, ''[[Who are the Mind Benders?]]''{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=53}} Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in ''The Rune'', a magazine produced by the [[Croydon]] BNP. In 1998, these articles resulted in Griffin being convicted of [[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]].{{sfnm|1a1=Griffin|1y=2011|1p=197|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011|2p=26|3a1=Richardson|3y=2011|3p=52|4a1=Trilling|4y=2012|4p=75}}

When Griffin took power, he sought to banish overt anti-Semitic discourse from the party.{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=26}} He informed party members that &quot;we can get away with criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide&quot;.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=85}} In 2006, he complained that the &quot;obsession&quot; that many BNP members had with &quot;the Jews&quot; was &quot;insane and politically disastrous&quot;.{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=25}} In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, Pat Richardson, to stand for it during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a &quot;gimmick&quot;.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=42}} References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party's electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=53}} For instance, the term &quot;[[Zionism|Zionists]]&quot; was often used in party literature as a euphemism for &quot;Jews&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=39|2a1=Richardson|2y=2011|2p=53}} As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments &quot;within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse&quot;.{{sfn|Macklin|2011|p=36}} The BNP's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=52}} This group is likely a reference to the Jews, an old fascist canard.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=52–53}}

Under Griffin, the BNP's website linked to other web pages that explicitly portrayed immigration as part of a Jewish conspiracy,{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=53–54}} while it also sold books that promoted Holocaust denial.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=54–55}} In 2004, secretly filmed footage was captured in which Griffin was seen claiming that &quot;the Jews simply bought the West, in terms of press and so on, for their own political ends&quot;.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=52}} Sectors of the extreme-right were highly critical of Griffin's softening on the subject of the Jews, claiming that he had &quot;sold out&quot; to the '[[Zionist Occupied Government]]'.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=118}} In 2006, John Bean, editor of ''Identity'', included an article in which he reassured BNP members that the party had not &quot;sold out to the Jews&quot; or &quot;embraced Zionism&quot; but that it remained &quot;committed to fighting... subversive Jews&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=94}}

[[File:East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre - geograph.org.uk - 394907.jpg|thumb|left|The BNP have called for the banning of any further mosques being constructed in the UK]]

Copsey noted that despite Griffin's reforms, a &quot;culture of anti-Semitism&quot; still pervaded the BNP.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=162}} In 2004, a London activist told reporters that &quot;most of us hate Jews&quot;,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=162}} while a Scottish BNP group was observed making [[Nazi salute]]s while shouting &quot;Auschwitz&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=162}} The party's [[Newcastle upon Tyne Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne Central]] candidate compared the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] to [[Disneyland]], while their [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]] candidate stated her refusal to buy from &quot;the kikes that run [[Tesco]]&quot;.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|pp=50–51}} In 2009, a BNP councillor from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] resigned from the party, complaining that it still contained Holocaust deniers and Nazi sympathisers.{{sfn|Macklin|Virchow|2011|p=220}}

Griffin informed BNP members that rather than &quot;bang on&quot; about the Jews—which would be deemed extremist and prove electorally unpopular—their party should focus on criticising [[Islam]], an issue that would be more resonant among the British public.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=85}} After Griffin took over, the party increasingly embraced an Islamophobic stance, launching a &quot;Campaign Against Islam&quot; in September 2001.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=68}} In ''Islam: A Threat to Us All'', a leaflet distributed to London households in 2007, the BNP claimed that it would stand up to both Islamic extremism and &quot;the threat that 'mainstream' Islam poses to our British culture&quot;.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=41}} In contrast to the mainstream British view that the actions of militant [[Islamism|Islamists]]—such as those who perpetrated the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]—are not representative of mainstream Islam, the BNP insists that they are.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=710}} In some of its literature it presents the view that every Muslim in Britain is a threat to the country.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=721}} Griffin referred to Islam as an &quot;evil, wicked faith&quot;,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=166}} and elsewhere publicly described it as a &quot;cancer&quot; that needed to be removed from Europe through &quot;chemotherapy&quot;.{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=143}}

The BNP has called for the prohibition of immigration from Muslim countries and for the banning of the [[burqa|burka]], [[halal]] meat, and the building of new [[mosques]] in the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} It also called for the immediate deportation of radical [[Islamism|Islamist]] preachers from the country.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} In 2005 the party claimed that its primary issue of concern was the &quot;growth of fundamentalist-militant Islam in the UK and its ever-increasing threat to Western civilization and our implicit values&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=69}} To broaden its anti-Islamic agenda, Griffin's BNP made overtures to the UK's Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish communities; Griffin's claim that Jews can make &quot;good allies&quot; in the fight against Islam caused controversy within the international far-right.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=41–42}}

===Government===
Tyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, claiming that liberalism was a &quot;doctrine of decay and degeneration&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=83}} Under Tyndall, the party sought to dismantle the UK's liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although was vague about what it sought to replace this system with.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=40}} In his 1988 work ''The Eleventh Hour'', Tyndall wrote of the need for &quot;an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority&quot;.{{sfn|Griffin|2011|p=190}} Tyndall's BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|national rebirth]] in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=84}} It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers, and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=85}} This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament produced a [[vote of no confidence]] in them.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=85}} It stated that rather than having political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=85–86}} During the period of Griffin's leadership, the party downplayed its anti-democratic themes and instead foregrounded [[populism|populist]] ones.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=69–70}} Its campaign material called for the devolution of greater powers to local communities, the reestablishment of [[county councils]], and the introduction of citizens' initiative referendums based on those used in Switzerland.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}}

[[File:RifleshootingatRWB.jpg|thumb|left|Air rifle training at the BNP's 2008 youth camp]]
The BNP has adopted a hard Eurosceptic platform from its foundation.{{sfn|Szczer biak|Taggart|2008|p=102}} Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP had overt anti-Europeanist tendencies.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=107}} Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he maintained the party's opposition to the [[European Economic Community]].{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=108}} Antagonism toward what became the [[European Union]] was retained under Griffin's leadership, which called for the UK to leave the Union.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=136|2a1=Woodbridge|2y=2011|2p=108}} One of [[Vote Leave]]'s biggest donors during the [[Brexit]] referendum was former BNP member Gladys Bramall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waterson|first1=Jim|title=Former BNP Member Has Given £600,000 To Vote Leave|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/vote-leave-donor|access-date=18 December 2016|work=BuzzFeed|date=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115034420/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/vote-leave-donor|archive-date=15 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syal|first1=Rajeev|title=Vote Leave gets big donation from former BNP member on leaked list|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/vote-leave-gets-big-donation-from-gladys-bramall-former-bnp-member-leaked-list|access-date=18 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=21 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221141135/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/21/vote-leave-gets-big-donation-from-gladys-bramall-former-bnp-member-leaked-list|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the party has claimed that its anti-Establishment rhetoric &quot;created the road&quot; to Britain's [[Brexit|vote to leave]] the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Phil|title=How the BNP Created the Road to Brexit|url=https://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/how-bnp-created-road-brexit|access-date=18 December 2016|work=British National Party|date=30 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220213741/https://www.bnp.org.uk/news/national/how-bnp-created-road-brexit#|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyndall suggested replacing the EEC with a trading association among the &quot;White Commonwealth&quot;, namely countries like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} Tyndall held [[imperialism|imperialist]] views and was sympathetic to the re-establishment of the British Empire through the recolonization of parts of Africa.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=116|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=96}} However, officially the BNP had no plans to re-establish the British Empire or secure dominion over non-white nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=144|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=95}} In the 2000s, it called for an immediate military withdrawal from both the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan War]].{{sfn|Trilling|2012|p=131}} It has advocated ending overseas aid to provide economic support within the UK and to finance the voluntary repatriation of legal immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;/&gt;

Under Tyndall, the BNP rejected both [[Welsh nationalism]] and [[Scottish nationalism]], claiming that they were bogus because they caused division among the wider 'British race'.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=88}} Tyndall also led the BNP in support of [[Ulster loyalism]], for instance by holding public demonstrations against the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] party [[Sinn Féin]],{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=207}} and endorsing Ulster loyalist paramilitaries.{{sfn|Gable|1995|p=267}} Under Griffin, the BNP continued to support Ulster's membership of the United Kingdom, calling for the crushing of the [[Irish Republican Army]] and the scrapping of the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]].{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=207}} Griffin later expressed the view that &quot;the only solution that could possibly be acceptable to loyalists and republicans alike&quot; would be the reintegration of the Irish Republic into the United Kingdom, which would be reorganised along [[federalism|federal]] lines.{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=208}} However, while retaining the party's commitment to Ulster loyalism, under Griffin the importance of the issue was downplayed, something that was criticised by Tyndall loyalists.{{sfn|Durham|2012|p=208}}

===Economic policy===

Tyndall described his approach to the economy as &quot;National Economics&quot;,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=94}} expressing the view that &quot;politics must lead, and not be led by, economic forces&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=93}} His approach rejected [[economic liberalism]] because it did not serve &quot;the national interest&quot;, although still saw advantages in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, looking favourably on individual enterprise.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=94–95}} He called on capitalist elements to be combined with [[socialism|socialist]] ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an [[autarky]] which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=95}} This attitude was heavily informed by the [[corporatism|corporatist]] system that had been introduced in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Fascist Italy.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=96}}

A number of senior members, including Griffin and [[John Bean]], had [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] leanings, having been influenced by [[Strasserism]] and [[National Bolshevism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gable|1y=1995|1p=267|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011|2p=27}} Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP promoted [[economic protectionism]] and [[anti-globalisation|opposed globalisation]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2011|p=63}} Its economic policies reflect a vague commitment to distributist economics, ethno-socialism, and [[Autarky|national autarky]].{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=229}} The BNP maintains a policy of [[protectionism]] and [[economic nationalism]], although in comparison with other far-right nationalist parties, the BNP focuses less on [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2002|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has called for British ownership of its own industries and resources and the &quot;subordination of the power of the City to the power of the government&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;/&gt; It has promoted the regeneration of farming in the United Kingdom, with the object of achieving maximum [[self-sufficiency]] in food production.&lt;ref name=&quot;routledge&quot;/&gt;  In 2002, the party criticised corporatism as a &quot;mixture of big capitalism and state control&quot;, saying it favoured a &quot;[[distributism|distributionist]] tradition established by home-grown thinkers&quot; favouring small business.&lt;ref name=&quot;eatw&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Eatwell|2004|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to [[environmentalism]], the BNP refers to itself as the &quot;real green party&quot;, claiming that the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] engages in &quot;watermelon&quot; politics by being green (environmentalist) on the outside but red (leftist) on the inside.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=230}} Influenced by the [[Nouvelle Droite]], it framed its arguments regarding environmentalism in an anti-immigration manner, talking about the need for 'sustainability'.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=230}} It engages in [[climate change denial]], with Griffin claiming that global warming is a hoax orchestrated by those trying to establish the [[New world order (politics)|New World Order]].{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=230}}

===Social issues===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=There is only one political party that Christians can support without betraying the Lord Jesus Christ.

The BNP [[Anti-feminism|is opposed]] to [[feminism]] and has pledged that—if in government—it would introduce financial incentives to encourage women to leave employment and become housewives.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1995|1pp=284–285|2a1=Durham|2y=1998|2pp=150, 152|3a1=Copsey|3y=2008|3p=87|4a1=Macklin|4y=2011b|4p=229}} It would also seek to discourage children being born out of wedlock.{{sfn|Durham|1998|p=160}} It has stated that it would criminalise [[abortion]], except in cases where the child has been conceived as a result of rape, the mother's life is threatened, or the child will be disabled.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1998|1pp=142–143|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2pp=90–91|3a1=Macklin|3y=2011b|3p=229}} There are nevertheless circumstances where it has altered this anti-abortion stance; an article in ''British Nationalist'' stated that a white woman bearing the child of a black man should &quot;abort the pregnancy... for the good of society&quot;.{{sfn|Durham|1998|p=144}} More widely, the party censures inter-racial sex and accuses the British media of encouraging inter-racial relationships.{{sfn|Durham|1998|pp=161–164}}

Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Durham|1y=1998|1p=156|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=90}} Following Griffin's takeover, it moderated its policy on [[homosexuality]].{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=136}} However, it opposed the 2004 [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|introduction]] of [[civil partnership]]s for same-sex couples.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} During his 2009 ''Question Time'' appearance, Griffin described the sight of two men kissing as &quot;really creepy&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=88}} The party has also condemned the availability of [[pornography]]; its 1992 manifesto stated that the BNP would give the &quot;pedlars of this filth... the criminal status that they deserve&quot;.{{sfn|Durham|1998|p=160}} The BNP promoted the reintroduction of [[capital punishment]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=70}} and the sterilisation of some criminals.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=90}} It also called for the reintroduction of [[national service]] in the UK,{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=137}} adding that on completion of this service adults would be permitted to keep their standard issue [[assault rifle]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=159}}

According to the academic Steven Woodbridge, the BNP had a &quot;rather ambivalent attitude toward Christian belief and religious themes in general&quot; during most of its history,{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=25}} but under Griffin's modernisation the party increasingly utilised Christian terminology and themes in its discourse.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=25, 26}} Various members of the party presented themselves as &quot;true Christians&quot;,{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=25}} and defenders of the faith, with key ideologues claiming that the religion has been &quot;betrayed&quot; and &quot;sold out&quot; by mainstream clergy and the British establishment.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=26}} British Christianity, the BNP claimed, was under threat from Islam, [[Marxism]], multiculturalism, and &quot;[[political correctness]]&quot;.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=26}} On analysing the BNP's use of Christianity, Davey argued that the party's emphasis was not on Christian faith itself, but on the inheritance of European Christian culture.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=442}}

The BNP long considered the mainstream media to be one of its major impediments to electoral success.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=92}} Tyndall claimed that the media represents a &quot;state above the state&quot; which was committed to the &quot;left-liberal&quot; goals of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], liberal democracy, and racial integration.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=92}} The party has claimed that the mainstream media has given disproportionate coverage to the achievements of ethnic minority sportsmen and to the victims of anti-black racism while ignoring white victims of racial prejudice and the BNP's activities.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=93}}  Both Tyndall and Griffin have claimed that the mainstream media is controlled by Jews, who use it for their own devices; the latter promoted this idea in his ''Who are the Mind Benders?''{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|pp=92–93}} Griffin has described the BBC as &quot;a thoroughly unpleasant, ultra-leftist establishment&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=89}} The BNP has stated that if it took power, it would end &quot;the dictatorship of the media over free debate&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} It claims that it would introduce a law prohibiting the media from disseminating falsehoods about an individual or organisation for financial or political gain,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=94}} and that it would ban the media from promoting racial integration.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}}
BNP policy pledges to protect [[freedom of speech]],{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=159}} as part of which it would repeal all laws banning racial or religious hate speech.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=159}} It would repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcmanifesto&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf|work=BBC News|title=BNP General Election Manifesto 2005|access-date=13 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807132131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/BNP_uk_manifesto.pdf|archive-date=7 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==

===Finances===

In contrast to the UK's mainstream parties, the BNP received few donations from businesses, wealthy donors, or trade unions.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} Instead it relied on finances produced by its membership.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}} Under Tyndall, the party operated on a shoestring budget with a lack of transparency; in 1992 it collected £5000 and in 1997 it collected £10,000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}} It also tried raising money by selling extreme-right literature, and opened a bookshop in [[Welling]] in 1989, although this was closed in 1996 after being attacked by anti-fascists and proving too costly to run.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011b|1p=129|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=91}} In 1992 the party formed a [[dining club]] of its wealthier supporters, which was renamed the Trafalgar Club in 2000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}} By the 1997 general election it admitted that its expenses had &quot;far out-stripped&quot; its income, and it was appealing for donations to pay off loans it had taken out.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=91}}

Griffin placed greater emphasis on fundraising, and from 2001 through to 2008 the BNP's annual turnover increased almost fivefold.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=91–92}} Membership subscriptions grew from £35,000 to £166,000, while its donations raised from £38,000 to £660,000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=91–92}} However, expenses also rose as the BNP spent more on its electoral campaigns, and the party reported a financial deficit in 2004 and again in 2005.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=92}} Between 2007 and 2009 the BNP accumulated debts of £500,000.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=95}}

[[File:Bnp press conference from flickr user britishnationalism.jpg|thumb|right|A BNP press conference in 2009, featuring Richard Barnbrook and Nick Griffin]]

For most of its history, the BNP had a whites-only membership policy.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=122}} In 2009, the state's [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] stated that this was a violation of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]] and called on the party to amend its constitution accordingly.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=122}} Responding to this, in early 2010 members voted to remove the racial restriction to membership, although it is unlikely that many non-whites joined.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=122}} 
At its creation, the BNP had approximately 1,200 members.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=123}} By the 1983 general election this had grown to approximately 2,500, although by 1987 had slumped to 1000, with no significant further growth until the 21st century.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=123}} After taking control Griffin began publishing the party's membership figures: 2,174 in 2001, 3,487 in 2002, 5,737 in 2003, and 7,916 in 2004. Membership dropped slightly to 6,281 in 2005, but had grown to 9,297 in 2007 and to 10,276 in spring 2010.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=124}} In 2011, it was noted that this meant that the BNP had experienced the most rapid growth since 2001 of any minor party in the UK.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=125}}

A party membership list dating from late 2007 was leaked onto the internet by a disgruntled activist, containing the names and addresses of 12,000 members.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=25|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=124}}&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-2008-11-18&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP membership list leaked online|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|last2=Weaver|first2=Matthew|last3=Cobain|first3=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/18/bnp-membership-list-leak|work=The Guardian|date=18 November 2008|access-date=2 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921145014/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/18/bnp-membership-list-leak|archive-date=21 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included names, addresses and other personal details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9808105a-b6a5-11dd-89dd-0000779fd18c.html|title=Probe into officer on BNP list|date=20 November 2008|work=Financial Times|access-date=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; People on the list included prison officers (barred from BNP membership), teachers, soldiers, civil servants and members of the clergy.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=25}} The leaked list indicated that membership was concentrated in particular areas, namely the East Midlands, Essex, and Pennine Lancashire, but with particular clusters in [[Borough of Charnwood|Charnwood]], [[Borough of Pendle|Pendle]], and [[Amber Valley]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=126}} Many of these areas had long been targeted by extreme-right campaigns, dating back to the NF activity of the 1970s, suggesting that such longstanding activism may have had an effect on levels of BNP membership.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=126–127}} This information also revealed that membership was most likely in urban areas with low rates of educational attainment and large numbers of economically insecure people employed in manufacturing, with further correlations to nearby Muslim communities.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=127–128}} Following an investigation by Welsh police and the [[Information Commissioner's Office (UK)|Information Commissioner's Office]], two people were arrested in December 2008 for breach of the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] concerning the leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/05/bnp-leak-arrests|title=Two held over BNP membership leak|work=The Guardian|date=5 December 2008|first=Angela|last=Balakrishnan|access-date=2 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922145038/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/05/bnp-leak-arrests|archive-date=22 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Single was subsequently found guilty and fined £200. The 'low' fine was criticised as an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot; by a BNP spokesman and a detective sergeant involved said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the outcome.&lt;ref name=&quot;manfined&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8231475.stm|title=Ex-BNP man fined over names leak|access-date=2 April 2013|date=1 September 2009|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaked membership list showed that the party was 17.22% female.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=228}} While women have occupied key positions within the BNP, men dominated at every level of the party.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=28|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=228}} In 2009, over 80% of the party's Advisory Council was male and from 2002 to 2009, three-quarters of its councillors were male.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=128}} The average percentage of female candidates presented at local elections in 2001 was 6%, although this had risen to 16% by 2010.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=128}} Since 2006, the party had made a point of selecting female candidates, with Griffin stating that this was necessary to &quot;soften&quot; the party's image.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|pp=227–228}} Goodwin suggested that membership fell into three camps: the &quot;activist old guard&quot; who had previously been involved in the NF during the 1970s, the &quot;political wanderers&quot; who had defected from other parties to the BNP, and the &quot;new recruits&quot; who had joined post-2001 and who had little or no political interest or experience beforehand.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=131–134}}

Having performed [[qualitative research]] among the BNP by interviewing various members, Goodwin noted that few of those he interviewed &quot;conformed to the popular stereotypes of them being irrational and uninformed crude racists&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=187}} He noted that most strongly identified with the working class and claimed to have either been former Labour voters or from a Labour-voting family.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=128–129}} None of those interviewed claimed a family background in the ethnic nationalist movement.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=130}} Instead, he noted that members claimed that they joined the party as a result of a &quot;profound sense of anxiety over immigration and rising ethno-cultural diversity&quot; in Britain, along with its concomitant impact on &quot;British culture and society&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=142}} He noted that among these members, the perceived cultural threat of immigrants and ethnic minorities was given greater prominence than the perceived economic threat that they posed to white Britons.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=142}} He noted that in his interviews with them, members often framed Islam in particular as a threat to British values and society, expressing the fear that British Muslims wanted to Islamicise the country and eventually impose ''[[sharia]]'' law on its population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=143–144}}

===Voter base===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The BNP does not have mass appeal, but the evidence... suggests it is forging ties with 'angry white men': middle-aged and elderly working-class men who have low levels of education, are deeply pessimistic about their economic prospects and live in more deprived urban areas close to large Muslim communities. Foremost, these citizens are sending a message about their profound concern over issues they care deeply about, but which they feel are not being adequately addressed by the main parties.|source=— Political scientist Matthew Goodwin, 2011{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=17}} }}

Goodwin described the BNP's voters as being &quot;socially distinct and concerned about a specific set of issues&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=15}} Under Griffin's leadership, the party targeted areas with high proportions of skilled white working-class voters, particularly those who were disenchanted with the Labour government.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=73}} It has attempted to appeal to disaffected Labour voters with slogans such as &quot;We are the Labour Party your Grandfather Voted For&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1p=2|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=142}} The BNP had little success in gaining support from women, the middle classes, and the more educated.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=180}}

Goodwin noted a &quot;strong male bias&quot; in the party's support base, with statistical polling revealing that between 2002 and 2006, seven out of ten BNP voters were male.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=101}} That same research also indicated that BNP voters were disproportionately middle-aged and elderly, with three quarters being aged over 35, and only 11% aged between 18 and 24.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=101}} This contrasted to the NF's support base during the 1970s, when 40% of its voters were aged between 18 and 24.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=101}} Goodwin suggested two possibilities for the BNP's failure to appeal to younger voters: one was the 'life cycle effect', that older people have obtained more during their life and thus have more to lose, feeling both more threatened by change and more socially conservative in their views.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=102}} The other explanation was the 'generational effect', with younger Britons who have grown up since the onset of mass immigration having had greater social exposure to ethnic minorities and thus being more tolerant toward them. Conversely, many older voters came of age during the 1970s, under the impact of the anti-immigrant rhetoric promoted by Powellism, Thatcherism, and the NF, and thus have less tolerant attitudes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=102, 104}}

Most BNP voters had no formal qualifications and the party's support was centred largely in areas with low educational attainment.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} According to the 2002–06 data, two-thirds of BNP voters had either no formal qualifications or had left education after their [[O-levels]]/[[GCSE]]s.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Only one in ten BNP voters possessed an [[A-level]],{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} and an even smaller percentage had a university degree.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Most of the BNP's voting base were from the financially insecure lower classes.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Research conducted from 2002 to 2006 indicated that seven out of ten BNP voters were either skilled or unskilled workers or unemployed.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} A 2009 poll found that six out of ten BNP voters fitted this profile.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=104}} Goodwin suggested that it was the skilled working classes rather than their unskilled or unemployed neighbours who were the main support base behind the BNP, because they owned some assets and thus felt that they had more to lose as a result of the economic threat posed by immigrants and ethnic minorities.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=104–105}}

Research indicated that BNP voters also held opinions that were distinct from the average British citizen. They were far more pessimistic about their economic prospects than average, with seven out of ten BNP voters expecting their economic prospects to decline in future, contrasted with four out of ten who held this view in the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=105}} In the 2002–06 period, 59% of BNP voters considered immigration to be the most important issue facing the UK, compared with only 16% of the wider population who agreed.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1pp=108, 100|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=142}} By 2009, 87% of BNP voters identified immigration and asylum as the most important issue, to 49% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=110}} BNP voters were also more likely to identify law and order, the EU, and Islamic extremism as the most important issues facing the UK than other voters, and less likely than average to rate the economy, NHS, pensions, and housing market as the most important.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=108, 110}}

[[File:Nick Griffin, talking to voters.jpg|thumb|left|BNP members campaigning in the London Borough of Havering in 2010]]

BNP voters were also more likely than average to believe both that white Britons face unfair discrimination, and that Muslims, non-whites, and homosexuals had unfair advantages in British society.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=107}} 78% of BNP voters endorsed the belief that the Labour Party prioritised immigrants and ethnic minorities over white British people, to 44% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=107}} When asked questions about immigration and Muslims, BNP voters were found to be far more hostile to them than the average Briton, and also more willing than average to support outright racially discriminatory policies toward them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=112}} Copsey believed that &quot;popular racism&quot;—namely against asylum seekers and Muslims—generated the BNP's &quot;largest reservoir of support&quot;,{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=146}} and that in many Northern English towns the main factors behind BNP support were white resentment toward Asian communities, anger at Asian-on-white crime, and the perception that Asians received disproportionately high levels of public funding.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=146–147}}

Research also indicated that BNP voters were more mistrustful of the establishment than average citizens. In 2002–06, 92% of BNP voters described themselves as being dissatisfied with the government, to 62% of the wider population.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=113–114}} Over 80% of BNP voters were found to distrust their local Member of Parliament, council officials, and civil servants, and were also more likely than average to think that politicians were personally corrupt.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=114}} There was also a tendency for BNP voters to read tabloids like the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Daily Express]]'', and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', all of which promote anti-immigration sentiment. Whether these voters gained such sentiment as a result of reading these tabloids or they read these tabloids because it endorsed their pre-existing views is unclear.{{sfnm|1a1=Goodwin|1y=2011|1pp=107–108|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=144}}

The early stronghold of the BNP was in London, where it established enclaves of support in the boroughs of Enfield, Hackney, Lewisham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets, with smaller units in Bexley, Camden, Greenwich, Hillingdon, Lambeth, and Redbridge.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=82}} By the late 1990s, the party was increasingly retreating from its original East End heartland, finding that its electoral support had declined in the area.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=83}} Griffin expressed the view that it was too dangerous for BNP activists to campaign in the East End, suggesting that they would likely be attacked by opponents.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=83}} Instead the party shifted its focus to parts of [[Outer London]], in particular the boroughs of Barking, Bexley, Dagenham, Greenwich, and Havering.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=84}} After Griffin took power, the party focused on building support in the North of England, taking advantage of the anxieties generated by the ethnic riots that took place [[2001 Bradford riots|in Bradford]], Oldham, and Burnley in 2001.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=84}} In the period between 2002 and 2006, over 40% of the BNP's voters were in Northern England.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=105}}

The decline of the BNP as an electoral force around 2014 helped to open the way for the growth of another right-wing party, UKIP.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=274}} In a study Goodwin produced with Robert Ford, the two political scientists noted that UKIP's support base mirrored the BNP's in that it had the same &quot;very clear social profile&quot;: the &quot;old, male, working class, white and less educated&quot;.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=159}} One area where the two differed, they noted, was in the fact that BNP support had been highest among the middle-aged before tailing off among the over 55s, whereas UKIP retained strong support with those over 55. Ford and Goodwin suggested that this might be because more over 55s had &quot;direct or indirect experiences&quot; of the Second World War, in which Britain defeated the fascist powers, resulting in them being less inclined to support fascist parties than their younger counterparts.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=158}} Despite these commonalities, UKIP proved far more successful at mobilising these social groups than did the BNP.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|pp=175–176}} This was likely in part because UKIP had a &quot;reputational shield&quot;; it emerged from within the Eurosceptic tradition of British politics rather than from the far-right and thus, while often ridiculed by the mainstream, was regarded as a legitimate democratic actor in a way that the BNP was not.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|pp=273–274}}

==Organisation and structure==

On its formation, the BNP avoided the National Front's committee-rule system of collective leadership in the hope of evading the infighting and factionalism that had damaged the NF.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=7}} Instead it was founded around what it called the &quot;leadership principle&quot;, with a central chairman having complete control over the party, which was then arranged in a highly hierarchical structure.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1p=30|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=77}} The BNP lacked any internal democracy, with the grassroots membership having no formal powers.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=77}} On taking power, Griffin retained the leadership principle inherited from Tyndall.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=78}} He nevertheless established an Advisory Council which would meet several times a year; the members were to be selected by Griffin himself and would serve as his advisors.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=108|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=79}}

The party's branches and local groups were referred to as &quot;units&quot; within the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} These were designed to recruit followers, raise funds, and campaign during elections.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} Under Tyndall, the party operated with a skeleton organisation.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=77}} It had no full-time staff and for most of the 1980s lacked a telephone number.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=78}} Instead it relied on a handful of geographically scattered, unpaid regional organisers.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}} Its early activists were recruited from within the extreme-right movement, and thus lacked the experience and skills in electoral campaigning.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=89}} When Griffin took control, he introduced a variety of internal departments to help manage the party's activities: the administration and enquiries department, department for group development, legal affairs department, security department, and communications department.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=79}} Griffin tried to build a more professional party machine by educating and training BNP members, providing them with incentives, establishing a steady income stream, and overcoming factionalism and dissent.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=88}} He launched an &quot;annual college&quot; for activists in 2001 and formed an education and training department in 2007.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} In 2008 and 2010 he oversaw the establishment of &quot;summer schools&quot; for high-ranking officials.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} The party also began employing full-time members of staff, having three in 2001 and 13 in 2007.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=93}}

To incentivise members to remain committed to the party, Griffin followed the example of the Swedish [[National Democrats (Sweden)|National Democrats]] by implementing a new &quot;voting membership&quot; scheme in 2007.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=171|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=90}} This meant that those who had been BNP members for two years could become a &quot;voting member&quot;, at which they would go on a year's probation. During this year they were required to attend educational and training seminars, to engage in a certain amount of activism, and to donate a specified amount of money to the party.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}} Once completed, they were allowed to vote on certain matters at general members' meetings and annual conferences, to participate in policy debates, and to be eligible for intermediate and senior positions. This policy ensured that those who reached the higher echelons of the BNP were fully trained in the party's ideology and electoral strategy.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=90}}

Griffin hoped to build a wider [[social movement]] around the BNP by establishing affiliated networks and organisations.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=85}} In many cases, these were presented to the public in a way that concealed any direct connection to the BNP.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=40}} Most of these affiliated groups were poorly funded and had few members.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}} The party established its own [[record label]], Great White Records, a radio station, and a [[trade union]] known as [[Solidarity – The Union for British Workers]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}} It formed a group for young people known as the Young BNP, although in 2010 renamed this group as the BNP Crusaders, &quot;to pay homage to our ancestors from the Middle Ages who saved Christian Europe from the onslaught of Islam&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}} It established a Land and People group to recruit support in rural areas, a Family Circle to recruit women and families, and both a Veterans Group and an Association of British ex-Servicemen for former military servicemen.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1pp=40–41|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=87}} A group called Families Against Immigrant Racism was established to counter perceived racism against white Britons,{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=137|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=122|3a1=Goodwin|3y=2011|3p=87}} while an Ethnic Liaison Committee was created to build links with anti-Muslim [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Sikhism|Sikh]] groups active in Britain.{{sfnm|1a1=Sykes|1y=2005|1p=137|2a1=Copsey|2y=2008|2p=135|3a1=Woodbridge|3y=2010|3p=41|4a1=Goodwin|4y=2011|4p=87|5a1=Trilling|5y=2012|5p=116}} Another group was the [[American Friends of the British National Party]] (AFBNP), set up by [[Mark Cotterill]] in 1999 to gain support from sympathisers in the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=109|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=87–88}} In 2001 it had 100 members, and by 2008 had 107.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=87–88}}

A group called Islands of the North Atlantic (IONA) was established to promote the BNP's view of British culture and identity.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=40}} The British Students Association was founded to promote the party's views among university students in 2000.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=40}}
Albion Life Insurance was set up in September 2006 as an insurance brokerage company established on behalf of the BNP to raise funds for its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-151726902.html|title=BNP sets up life firm, ''Highbeam''|publisher=HighBeam Research|access-date=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610220620/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-151726902.html|archive-date=10 June 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm ceased to operate in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=185|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205192653/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/index.php?link=template&amp;story=185|archive-date=5 December 2006|title=A finger in too many pies|date=November 2006|work=Searchlight|publisher=Wayback Machine|access-date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the BNP launched the [[Christian Council of Britain]] (CCB), a group designed to rival the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] and oppose the growing &quot;Islamification&quot; of inner city areas.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=41}} The CCB was established and run by BNP member [[Robert West (politician)|Robert West]], who claimed to have been ordained by the [[Apostolic Church (denomination)|Apostolic Church]], a claim that the church denies.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodbridge|1y=2010|1pp=42–43|2a1=Davey|2y=2011|2p=445}} West is a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and espouses a theology of nations which is influenced by Calvinist theologians like [[Abraham Kuyper]], holding that God wishes every race and nation to remain separate until [[end time]].{{sfn|Davey|2011|pp=445–446}}

Griffin's BNP also established an annual Red, White and Blue festival, which was based on the 'Blue Blanc Rouge' organised by France's National Front.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=109|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2pp=87, 88|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=97}} The festival brought party activists together and aimed to promote a more [[family friendly]] image for the group, although it also provided a venue for [[white power skinhead]] bands like Stigger, Nemesis and Warlord.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=87, 88}} Around 1,000 BNP members attended the party's 2001 festival.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=87}}

Under Griffin's leadership, the BNP zealously embraced the use of [[alternative media]] to promote itself in a way different from the negative portrayal that featured in the mainstream media.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} On its website—which had been established in 1995{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}}—it created an internet television channel, 'BNPtv'.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} It has created blogs that cover different themes without being explicitly political in order to promote the party's message.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}} The BNP established an online marketing platform, Excalibur, through which to sell its merchandise.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=440}} In 2003, the BNP claimed that it had the most viewed website of a political party in Britain,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}} and by 2011 was claiming to have the most viewed such website in Europe.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=96}} In September 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported that [[Hitwise]], the online competitive intelligence service, said that the BNP website had more hits than any other website of a British political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP website is the most popular in politics|last=Hope|first=Christopher|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1562960/BNP-website-is-the-most-popular-in-politics.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=13 September 2007|access-date=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820194101/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1562960/BNP-website-is-the-most-popular-in-politics.html|archive-date=20 August 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliations in the wider extreme-right===

Under Griffin, the BNP forged stronger links with various extreme-right parties elsewhere in Europe, among them France's National Front, Germany's [[National Democratic Party of Germany|National Democratic Party]] (NPD), Sweden's National Democrats, and Hungary's [[Jobbik]].{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=88}} Griffin unsuccessfully urged the NPD to move away from neo-Nazism and embark on the same 'modernisation' project that he had taken the BNP.{{sfn|Macklin|Virchow|2011|p=208}} [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] of the French [[Front National]] was the guest of honour at an &quot;Anglo-French Patriotic Dinner&quot; held by the BNP in April 2004.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=150–151}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3654941.stm|title=Le Pen UK visit sparks protests|work=BBC News|date=25 April 2004|access-date=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221003750/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3654941.stm|archive-date=21 February 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Griffin met leaders of the Hungarian far right party [[Jobbik]] to discuss co-operation between the two parties and spoke at a Jobbik party rally in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP's European ally Krisztina Morvai axed from London conference after protests|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/15/krisztina-morvai-london-conference-ban|newspaper=The Observer|date=15 November 2009|last=Doward|first=Jamie|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510164627/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/15/krisztina-morvai-london-conference-ban|archive-date=10 May 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, [[Simon Darby]], deputy chairman of the BNP, was welcomed with fascist salutes by members of the Italian nationalist [[Forza Nuova]] during a trip to Milan.

[[Image:English Defence League protest in Newcastle.jpg|thumb|left|The English Defence League (demonstration pictured) was established by activists with BNP links, although the BNP has officially proscribed the group, accusing it of being manipulated by &quot;Zionists&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011b|1p=138|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=233}}]]

Britain's extreme-right has long faced internal and public divisions.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=104}} Disgruntled BNP members left the party to found or join a wide range of rivals, among them the [[British Freedom Party]], [[White Nationalist Party]], [[Nationalist Alliance]], [[Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood]], [[British People's Party (2005)|British People's Party]], [[England First Party]], [[Britain First]], [[Democratic Nationalists]], and the [[New Nationalist Party]].{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=104}} Various BNP members were involved in the nascent [[English Defence League]] (EDL)—with EDL leader [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] having been a former BNP activist—although Griffin proscribed the organisation and condemned it as having been manipulated by &quot;Zionists&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2011b|1p=138|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=233|3a1=Trilling|3y=2012|3p=164}} The political scientist Chris Allen noted that the EDL shared much of the BNP's ideology, but that its &quot;strategies and actions&quot; were very different, with the EDL favouring street marches over electoral politics.{{sfn|Allen|2014|p=534}} By 2014, both the BNP and EDL were in decline, and Britain First—founded by former BNP members James Dowson and Paul Golding—had risen to prominence. It combined the electoral tactics of the BNP with the street marches of the EDL.{{sfn|Allen|2014|p=355}}

The [[Steadfast Trust]] was established as a charity in 2004 with the stated aims of reducing poverty among those of [[Anglo-Saxon]] descent and supporting English culture.

==Electoral performance==
{{Main|British National Party election results}}
The BNP has contested seats in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Research from Robert Ford and Matthew Goodwin shows that BNP support is concentrated among older and less educated working-class men living in the declining industrial towns of the North and Midlands regions, in contrast to previous significant far-right parties like the National Front, which drew support from a younger demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Robert|last2=Goodwin|first2=Matthew J.|year=2010|title=Angry White Men: Individual and Contextual Predictors of Support for the British National Party|journal=Political Studies|volume=58|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.2009.00829.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General elections===

{{Main|British National Party election results#Local elections|l1=British National Party election results (local elections)}}
The BNP's first electoral success came in 1993, when [[Derek Beackon]] was returned as a councillor in [[Millwall]], London. He lost his seat in elections the following year. The next BNP success in local elections was not until the [[2002 United Kingdom local elections|2002 local elections]], when three BNP candidates [[2002 Burnley Borough Council election|gained seats]] on the [[Burnley (borough)|Burnley]] council.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05064.pdf|title=Electoral performance of the British National Party in the UK|date=15 May 2009|publisher=Parliament|access-date=20 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122025348/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsg-05064.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP's first councillor for six years was John Haycock, elected as a parish councillor for [[Bromyard and Winslow]] in [[Herefordshire]] in 2000. Haycock failed to attend any council meetings for six months and was later disqualified from office.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=116–117}}

The party had 55 councillors for a time in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk&quot;/&gt; After the [[2013 United Kingdom local elections|2013 local county council elections]], the BNP was left with a total of two [[borough council]]lors in [[Local government in England|England]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Urquhart|first=Conal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/04/bnp-members-breed-elections|title=BNP calls on members to breed more after elections disaster|work=The Guardian|date=4 May 2013|access-date=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518200907/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/04/bnp-members-breed-elections|archive-date=18 May 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the BNP had yet to make &quot;a major breakthrough&quot; on local councils.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=159}}
The BNP's councillors usually had &quot;an extremely limited impact on local politics&quot; because they were isolated as individuals or small groups on the council.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=235}} Councillors from the main parties often disliked their BNP colleagues and deemed having to work alongside them as an affront to dignity and decency.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=152}}
Questions were often raised as to whether BNP councillors could adequately represent the interests of all of their local constituents.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=153}} On being elected, Beackon for instance stated that he refused to serve his Asian constituents in Millwall.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=154}} There were also allegations made that BNP councillors had particularly low attendance at council meetings, although research indicated that this was not the case, with the BNP's attendance record being largely average.{{sfn|Bottom|Copus|2011|p=148}}

There is evidence to suggest that racially and religiously motivated crime increased in those areas where BNP councillors had been elected.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=198|2a1=Macklin|2y=2011b|2p=235}} For instance, after the 1993 election of Beackon, there was a spike in racist attacks in the borough of Tower Hamlets.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|pp=26–27}} BNP members were directly responsible for some of this; the party's national organiser [[Richard Edmonds]] was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his part in an attack on a black man and his white girlfriend.{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|pp=26–27}}

==Association with violence==
The leaders and senior officers of the BNP have criminal convictions for inciting racial hatred.{{sfn|Wood|Finlay|2008|p=708}}
John Hagan claims that the BNP has conducted [[Right-wing politics and violence|right-wing extremist violence]] to gain &quot;institutionalized power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;haganwilliam&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heitmeyer|2003|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the BNP, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] in a 1997 report, have asserted that the party recruits from skinhead groups and that it promotes racist violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Human Rights Watch|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Nick Griffin has defended the threat of violence to further the party's aims. After the BNP won its first council seat in 1993, he wrote that the BNP should not be a &quot;postmodernist rightist party&quot; but &quot;a strong, disciplined organisation with the ability to back up its slogan 'Defend Rights for Whites' with well-directed boots and fists. When the crunch comes, power is the product of force and will, not of rational debate&quot;. In 1997 he said: &quot;It is more important to control the streets of a city than its council chambers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardng&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/sep/01/features.magazine37|title=Flying the flag|last=Anthony|first=Andrew|date=1 September 2002|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021044330/http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2002/sep/01/features.magazine37|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Goodwin described the BNP as being &quot;the most successful party in the history of the extreme right in Britain&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} That same year, John E. Richardson noted that it had achieved &quot;a level of electoral success that is unparalleled in the history of British fascism&quot;.{{sfn|Richardson|2011|p=41}} The historian Alan Sykes stated that &quot;in electoral terms&quot;, the BNP achieved &quot;more in the first three years of the twenty-first century&quot; than the British far right &quot;as a whole achieved in the previous seventy&quot;.{{sfn|Sykes|2005|p=151}} However, Copsey noted that the party's belief that one day the conditions would be right for it to win a general election belonged to the &quot;Never-Never Land of British politics&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=2}} Copsey also noted that the BNP's electoral successes had been modest in comparison to those achieved by extreme-right groups elsewhere in Western Europe such as France's National Front, Italy's National Alliance, and Belgium's [[Vlaams Blok]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=191}}

The BNP's growth met a hostile reaction,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} and in 2011 the political scientists Copsey and Macklin described it as &quot;Britain's most disliked party&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=95}} It was widely reviled as racist and even following Griffin's &quot;modernisation&quot; project it was still heavily tainted by its associations with neo-Nazism.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} For many years it remained closely associated with the National Front in the British public imagination.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|p=28}}
The BNP remained unable to gain a broad appeal or widespread credibility.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=117}} In a 2004 poll, seven out of ten voters said that they would never consider voting for the BNP.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=117}} A 2009 poll found that two-thirds would &quot;under no circumstances&quot; consider voting BNP, while only 4% of respondents would &quot;definitely consider&quot; voting for them.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=117}}

The Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]] stated that the BNP were a &quot;stain&quot; on British democracy, adding that &quot;this is not a political movement, this is a bunch of thugs dressed up as a political party&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1y=2008|1p=151|2a1=Goodwin|2y=2011|2p=xiii}} His successor [[David Cameron]] described it as a &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; organisation which &quot;thrives on hatred&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} The Labour prime minister, Tony Blair, called it a &quot;nasty, extreme organisation&quot;,{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} while the Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] termed it a &quot;party of thugs and fascists&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=1}}  In 2004, the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] declared that supporting the BNP was incompatible with Christianity,{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=448}} comparing it to &quot;spitting in the face of God&quot;.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|p=xiii}} Christian groups throughout Britain have maintained that the BNP's hostility toward cultural and ethnic diversity in the country was at odds with mainstream Christianity's emphasis on inclusiveness, tolerance, and interfaith dialogue.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2010|pp=46–47}} [[Winston Churchill]]'s family has criticised the BNP's use of his image and quotations, labelling it &quot;offensive and disgusting&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNP's Churchill use 'disgusting'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8068717.stm|work=BBC News|date=26 May 2009|access-date=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529121911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8068717.stm|archive-date=29 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer [[Vera Lynn]] condemned the party for selling her CD on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dame Vera Lynn takes on BNP over White Cliffs of Dover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4687730/Dame-Vera-Lynn-takes-on-BNP-over-White-Cliffs-of-Dover.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 February 2009|access-date=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101090127/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/4687730/Dame-Vera-Lynn-takes-on-BNP-over-White-Cliffs-of-Dover.html|archive-date=1 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Royal British Legion]] asked Griffin—at first privately and then publicly—to not wear their poppy symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal British Legion tell Nick Griffin to stop wearing poppy badge|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/13/royal-british-legion-nick-griffin|work=The Guardian|date=13 June 2009|access-date=1 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906182015/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/13/royal-british-legion-nick-griffin|archive-date=6 September 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals whose membership of the party was made public sometimes faced ostracism and the loss of their job: examples include a school headmaster who had to resign, a caretaker who was sacked after attending a BNP rally, and a police officer dismissed from his position.{{sfn|Goodwin|2011|pp=138–139}} After BNP membership lists were leaked on the Internet, a number of police forces investigated officers whose names appeared on the lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/19/police-bnp-far-right-list|title=Police scour BNP membership to find officers breaching ban|work=The Guardian|first=Ian|last=Cobain|date=19 November 2008|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105094713/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/19/police-bnp-far-right-list|archive-date=5 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream media and academia===

[[File:Anti BNP protestors and police outside BBC Television Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters outside the BBC Television Centre, protesting against Griffin's invite to appear on ''Question Time'']]

Attitudes toward the BNP in both mainstream broadcast media and print journalism have been overwhelmingly negative,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|pp=84–85}} and no mainstream newspaper has endorsed the party.{{sfn|Davey|2011|p=441}} This hostile coverage has even been found in right-wing tabloids like the ''Daily Mail'', ''Daily Express'' and ''The Sun'' which otherwise share the BNP's hostile attitude toward issues like immigration.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|pp=84–85}} In 2003, the ''Daily Mail'' described the BNP as &quot;poisonous bigots&quot;, while in 2004 ''The Sun'' printed the headline of &quot;BNP: Bloody Nasty People&quot;.{{sfnm|1a1=Copsey|1a2=Macklin|1y=2011|1p=85|2a1=Trilling|2y=2012|2p=123}} Senior BNP figures nevertheless believed that these tabloids' hostile coverage of immigration and Islam helped to legitimise and normalise the party and its views among much of the British public,{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=85}} a view echoed by some academic observers.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=99}} When, in 2004, anti-racist activists picketed outside the ''Daily Mail'' office in central London to protest against its negative coverage of asylum seekers, BNP members organised a counter-picket at which they displayed the placard &quot;Vote BNP, Read the ''Daily Mail''&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=98}}

The BNP initially faced a '[[No Platform|no platform for fascists]]' policy from the broadcast media, although this eroded as Griffin was invited on to a number of television programmes amid the party's growing electoral success.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=83}} When the BBC invited him to appear on ''Question Time'' in 2009 it was criticised by several trade unions, sections of the media, and several Labour politicians, all of whom believed that the BNP should not be given a public platform.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=87}} Anti-fascist protesters assembled outside of the television studio to protest Griffin's inclusion.{{sfn|Copsey|Macklin|2011|p=88}}

The first academic attention to be directed at the BNP appeared after it gained a councillor in the 1993 local elections.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} Nevertheless, throughout the 1990s it remained the subject of little academic research.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} Academic interest increased following its victories at local elections from 2002 onward.{{sfn|Copsey|2011|p=6}} The first detailed monograph study to be devoted to the party was Nigel Copsey's ''Contemporary British Fascism'', first published in 2004.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=4}} In September 2008, an academic symposium on the BNP was held at [[Teesside University]].{{sfn|Macklin|2011b|p=227}}

===The wider extreme-right and anti-fascists===

Opposition to the BNP also came from the organised anti-fascist movement. By the mid-1990s, the BNP's attempts to stage public events in Scotland, the North West and the Midlands were largely thwarted by the militant disruption of the [[Anti-Fascist Action]] (AFA) group.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|p=128}} The BNP's modernisation and move away from street demonstrations and toward electoral campaigning caused problems for the AFA, who proved unable to successfully change their tactics; on those occasions when AFA activists tried to forcibly disrupt BNP activities, they were prevented and arrested by [[riot police]].{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=129–131}}

[[File:London MMB 09 University College.jpg|thumb|left|Activists belonging to the far-left [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] protesting against the BNP at [[University College London]] in 2009]]

More liberal sections of the anti-fascist movement sought to counter the BNP through community-based initiatives. ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'' encouraged trade unions to establish localised campaigns that would ensure that ethnic minority and other anti-BNP locals voted. It suggested that such campaigns should avoid associating with the mainstream parties from which BNP voters felt disenfranchised and that they should not be afraid of calling out Islamic fundamentalists and extremists active in the area.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=131–133}} The [[Unite Against Fascism]] group also sought to maximise anti-BNP turnout at elections, calling on the electorate to vote for &quot;anyone but fascists&quot;.{{sfn|Copsey|2011b|pp=134–135}} Evidence suggests that such anti-fascist activities did little to erode the far-right vote; this was in part because anti-fascist groups had encouraged the stereotype that BNP candidates were violent skinheads, something which conflicted with the more normal, friendly image that BNP activists cultivated when canvassing.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=140, 141}}

The BNP often received a hostile response from other sections of the British extreme-right.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=103}} Some extreme-right-wingers, such as the British Freedom Party, expressed frustration at the party's inability to moderate itself further on the issue of race, while those such as [[Colin Jordan]] and the NF accused the BNP—particularly under Griffin's leadership—of being too moderate.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|pp=103–104}} This latter view was articulated by an extreme-right [[groupuscule]], the International Third Position, when it claimed that the BNP &quot;has been openly courting the Jewish vote and pumping out material which confirms what most us knew years ago: the BNP has become a multi-racist, Zionist, queer-tolerant anti-Muslim pressure group&quot;.{{sfn|Woodbridge|2011|p=118}}

In ''[[ASLEF v. United Kingdom]]'', the [[European Court of Human Rights]] overturned an employment appeal tribunal ruling that awarded BNP member and train driver [[Jay Lee]] damages for expulsion from a trade union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-79604|title=Case of Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers &amp; Firemen (ASLEF) v. the United Kingdom|date=27 February 2007|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|access-date=4 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724001538/http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-79604|archive-date=24 July 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Redfearn v United Kingdom]], the court ruled that members of racist organisations could lawfully be dismissed on health and safety grounds if there was a danger of violence occurring in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emplaw.co.uk/lawguide?startpage=2005irlr744.htm|title=Disclaw Publishing – Employment Law, unfair dismissal, redundancy pay|publisher=Emplaw.co.uk|access-date=4 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607111139/http://www.emplaw.co.uk/lawguide?startpage=2005irlr744.htm|archive-date=7 June 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] made a majority ruling (4 to 3) that in Redfearn's case against the UK government, his rights under Article 11 (free association) had been infringed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/nov/06/bus-driver-bnp-wins-rights-case|title=Bus driver sacked for BNP membership wins case in Strasbourg|date=6 November 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107040223/https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/nov/06/bus-driver-bnp-wins-rights-case|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not those under Article 10 (free expression) or Article 14 (discrimination).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-114240|title=CASE OF REDFEARN v.
