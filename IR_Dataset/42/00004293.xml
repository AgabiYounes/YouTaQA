The '''Baltimore Ravens''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]]. The Ravens compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC North|North division]]. The team plays its home games at [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]] and is headquartered in [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Owings Mills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravens Contact Us|url=https://www.baltimoreravens.com/contact-us/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BaltimoreRavens.com|access-date=November 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was established in 1996, after [[Art Modell]], who was then the owner of the [[Cleveland Browns]], announced plans to [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|relocate]] the franchise from [[Cleveland]] to Baltimore in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jaguars – NFL Relocations and the LA Stadium Plan|url=http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2010-jan-the-jaguars-nfl-relocations-and-the-la-stadium-plan|work=[[Metro Jacksonville]]|date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' history and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would take control in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would then form an [[expansion team]].

The Ravens have been one of the more successful franchises since their inception, having qualified for the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]] 12 times since 2000, with two Super Bowl championship titles ([[Super Bowl XXXV]] and [[Super Bowl XLVII]]), two [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]] titles (2000 and 2012), 15 playoff victories, four AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011 and 2012), six AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2018, and 2019), and are currently the only team in the NFL to hold a perfect record in multiple Super Bowl appearances. The Ravens organization was led by general manager [[Ozzie Newsome]] from 1996 until his retirement following the 2018 season, and has had three head coaches: [[Ted Marchibroda]], [[Brian Billick]], and since 2008, [[John Harbaugh]]. Starting with a record-breaking defensive performance in their [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|2000 season]], the Ravens have established a reputation for strong defensive play throughout team history, featuring [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] players like middle linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] and safety [[Ed Reed]] as well as [[Pro Bowl]] players like defensive end [[Terrell Suggs]] and defensive tackle [[Haloti Ngata]]. The team is owned by [[Steve Bisciotti]] and valued at $2.59 billion, making the Ravens the 29th-most valuable sports franchise in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badenhausen|first=Kurt|title=The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams 2019|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/07/22/the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-2019/#2d1757f4283d|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=July 22, 2019|access-date=November 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Baltimore Ravens}}

===Team name===
The name &quot;Ravens&quot; was inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem ''[[The Raven]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NamingBaltimoresTeam&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise nicknames|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/news/franchise-nicknames/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ProFootballHOF.com|date=January 1, 2005|access-date=February 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chosen in a fan contest that drew 33,288 voters, the allusion honors Poe, who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore and is buried there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltimore Ravens Team History|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/teams/baltimore-ravens/team-history/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ProFootballHOF.com|access-date=February 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' reported at the time, fans also &quot;liked the tie-in with the other birds in town, [[Baltimore Orioles|the Orioles]], and found it easy to visualize a tough, menacing black bird.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ravens never out of focus: Probable NFL name consistent favorite in polls, group research|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-03-29/sports/1996089150_1_ravens-nfl-team-phone-in-poll|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Before the football team, there was the Baltimore Ravens wheelchair basketball team — the original Baltimore Ravens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pollak |first1=Lisa |title=THE OTHER RAVENS They lacked money, prestige -- heck, even the right equipment. But they were extraordinary athletes with extraordinary determination.

The name &quot;Ravens&quot; was inspired by Bob Ardinger, a member of the Ravens wheelchair basketball team. In the 1990's, the naming rights were later sold to the football team when they came to the city and the wheelchair basketball team became known as the [http://marylandravens.org/about.html Maryland Ravens, Inc].

===Background===
After the [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|controversial relocation]] of the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Colts]] to Indianapolis, several attempts were made to bring an NFL team back to Baltimore.  In 1993, ahead of the 1995 league expansion, the city was considered a favorite, behind only [[St. Louis]], to be granted one of two new franchises.&lt;ref name=LitskyNYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Litsky|first1=Frank|title=PRO FOOTBALL; N.F.L. Expansion Surprise: Jacksonville Jaguars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/01/sports/pro-football-nfl-expansion-surprise-jacksonville-jaguars.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=December 13, 2014|date=December 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  League officials and team owners feared litigation due to conflicts between rival bidding groups if St. Louis was awarded a franchise, and in October [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] was the first city chosen.  Several weeks later, Baltimore's bid for a franchise—dubbed the [[Baltimore Bombers (proposed NFL team)|Baltimore Bombers]], in honor of the locally produced [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] [[bomber]]—had three ownership groups in place&lt;ref name=LitskyNYT/&gt; and a state financial package which included a proposed $200 million, rent-free stadium and permission to charge up to $80 million in personal seat license fees.&lt;ref name=Babington&gt;{{cite news|title=Modell Announces Browns' Move to Baltimore|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/1995/95nfl4.htm|work=Washington Post|accessdate=July 18, 2013|author=Charles Babington|author2=Ken Denlinger|date=November 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite web|last=Burke|first=Mike|title=A bitter pill still lodged in the throat of Baltimore|url=http://times-news.com/archive/x1540384068|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130718033254/http://times-news.com/archive/x1540384068|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 18, 2013|work=Cumberland Times-News|accessdate=July 18, 2013|date=January 12, 1997|quote=... despite its misgivings about the whole thing, Baltimore then went out and sought the Cleveland Browns...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baltimore, however, was unexpectedly passed over in favor of [[Jacksonville, Florida]], despite Jacksonville's minor TV market status and that the city had withdrawn from contention in the summer, only to return with then-Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]]'s urging.&lt;ref name=LitskyNYT/&gt;  Although league officials denied that any city had been favored, it was reported that Tagliabue and his longtime friend [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] had lobbied against Baltimore due to its proximity to Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name=LitskyNYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waldron|first=Thomas|title=Redskins back city on Browns, Jack Kent Cooke drops opposition to move to Baltimore|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-02-07/news/1996038073_1_stadium-glendening-redskins|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=July 18, 2013|date=December 7, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Tagliabue had used the initial committee voting system to prevent the entire league ownership from voting on Baltimore's bid.&lt;ref name=Stellino1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stellino|first1=Vito|title=In museum of gall, Tagliabue's expansion remark is masterpiece|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-05/sports/1993339142_1_tagliabue-baltimore-oakland|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=December 13, 2014|date=December 5, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to public outrage and the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' describing Tagliabue as having an &quot;Anybody But Baltimore&quot; policy.&lt;ref name=Stellino1/&gt;  Maryland governor [[William Donald Schaefer]] said afterward that Tagliabue had led him on, praising Baltimore and the proposed owners while working behind-the-scenes to oppose Baltimore's bid.&lt;ref name=Stellino1/&gt;

By May 1994, [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]] had gathered a new group of investors, including author [[Tom Clancy]], to bid on teams whose owners had expressed interest in relocating.&lt;ref name=Olesker&gt;{{cite news|last=Olesker|first=Michael|title=Angelos wants a football team, nobody laughs|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-05-10/news/1994130001_1_peter-angelos-football-in-baltimore-orioles|accessdate=July 18, 2013|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=May 10, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Angelos found a potential partner in [[Georgia Frontiere]], who was open to moving the [[Los Angeles Rams]] to Baltimore.

Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having &quot;misgivings,&quot;&lt;ref name=Burke/&gt; turned to the possibility of obtaining the [[Cleveland Browns]], whose owner [[Art Modell]] was financially struggling and at odds with the city of Cleveland over needed improvements to the team's stadium.

===Return of football in Baltimore===
{{main|Cleveland Browns relocation controversy}}

Enticed by Baltimore's available funds for a first-class stadium and a promised yearly operating subsidy of $25 million, Modell announced on November 6, 1995 his intention to relocate the team from Cleveland to Baltimore the following year.  The resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|controversy]] ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on February 8, 1996. Tagliabue promised the city of Cleveland that an NFL team would be located in Cleveland, either through relocation or expansion, &quot;no later than 1999&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-02-14/sports/sp-35749_1_seattle-seahawks | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Mike | last=Downey | title=Nice Seeing You, Seahawks | date=February 14, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the agreement stipulated that the Browns' name, colors, uniform design and franchise records would remain in Cleveland. The franchise history includes Browns club records and connections with [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] players. Modell's Baltimore team, while retaining all current player contracts, would, for purposes of team history, appear as an [[expansion team]], a new franchise.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Jon. [http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-modell020996,1,1050941.story &quot;Deal clears NFL path to Baltimore&quot;], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', February 9, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all players, staff or front office would make the move to Baltimore, however.
[[File:1980-modell-browns.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Art Modell]] moved the Browns to Baltimore and remained the owner of the Ravens through 2003.]]
After relocation, Modell hired [[Ted Marchibroda]] as the head coach for his new team in Baltimore. Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] during the 1970s and the [[Indianapolis Colts]] during the early 1990s. [[Ozzie Newsome]], the Browns' tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to vice-president/general manager.

The home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], previously home to the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]], the [[Baltimore Orioles]], and the [[Canadian Football League]]’s [[Baltimore Stallions]]. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium, now known as [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]], next to [[Camden Yards]] in 1998.

===The early years and Ted Marchibroda era (1996–1998)===

In the [[1996 NFL Draft]], the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle [[Jonathan Ogden]] at No. 4 overall and linebacker [[Ray Lewis]] at No. 26 overall. Both Ogden and Lewis went on to play for the Ravens for their entire professional careers and were both inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

[[File:Jonathan Ogden.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jonathan Ogden]] at the [[2006 Pro Bowl]]. Ogden played offensive tackle for the Ravens from 1996 through 2007 and was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013.]]

The 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the [[Oakland Raiders]], but finished the season 4–12 despite receiver [[Michael Jackson (wide receiver)|Michael Jackson]] leading the league with 14 touchdown catches.  The [[1997 Baltimore Ravens season|1997 Ravens]] started 3–1. [[Peter Boulware]], a rookie defender from [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6–9–1. On October 26, the team made its first trip to [[Landover, Maryland]] to play their new [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|regional rivals]], the [[Washington Redskins]]. The Ravens won the game 20–17.  On December 14, 1997, the Ravens played the final professional sporting event at Baltimore’s historic [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], winning 21–19 over the [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee Oilers]].

[[1998 Baltimore Ravens season|1998]] marked the opening of a new stadium for the Ravens, currently known as [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]], but originally named “[[PSINet]] Stadium” after the now defunct internet service provider which purchased the original naming rights.  Quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] left for the [[New York Jets]] before the season, and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt [[Jim Harbaugh]], and later [[Eric Zeier]]. Cornerback [[Rod Woodson]] joined the team after a successful stint with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and [[Priest Holmes]] started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards.  The Ravens finished 1998 with a 6–10 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens won 38–31.

===Brian Billick era (1999–2007)===

[[File:Baltimore Ravens B.png|right|thumb|Baltimore's text logo]]

Three consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach. [[Brian Billick]] took over as head coach in [[1999 Baltimore Ravens season season|1999]]. Billick had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting [[Minnesota Vikings]] the season before. Quarterback [[Tony Banks (quarterback)|Tony Banks]] came to Baltimore from the [[St. Louis Rams]] and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 pass rating. He was joined by receiver [[Qadry Ismail]], who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4–7 but managed to finish with an 8–8 record.

Due to continual financial hardships for the organization, the NFL took an unusual move and directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to [[Steve Bisciotti]]. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004 the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.

====2000: Super Bowl XXXV champions====
{{main|2000 Baltimore Ravens season}}
Banks shared playing time in the 2000 regular season with [[Trent Dilfer]]. Both players put up decent numbers (and a 1,364-yard rushing season by rookie [[Jamal Lewis]] helped too) but the defense became the team's hallmark and bailed a struggling offense out in many instances through the season. [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] was named Defensive Player of the Year. Two of his defensive teammates, [[Sam Adams (football player)|Sam Adams]] and [[Rod Woodson]], made the [[Pro Bowl]]. Baltimore's season started strong with a 5–1 record. But the team struggled through mid-season, at one point going five games without scoring an offensive touchdown. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12–4 and making the [[2000–01 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time.

During the 2000 season, the Ravens dominating defense broke two notable NFL records. They held opposing teams to 165 total points, surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears mark of 198 points for a 16-game season as well as surpassing the 1986 Chicago Bears mark of 187 points for a 16-game season, which at that time was the current NFL record these things along with outstanding play by the defense places the 2000 Ravens in the discussion as one of the Greatest if not the Greatest NFL defense of All Time along with the 1985 Chicago Bears, 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the 2015 Denver Broncos defenses.

Since the divisional rival [[2000 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] had a record of 13–3, the Ravens had to play in the [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild card]] round. They dominated the [[2000 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 21–3 in their first game. In the divisional playoff, they went on the road to Tennessee. With the score tied 10–10 in the fourth quarter, an [[Al Del Greco]] [[field goal (football)|field goal]] attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by Anthony Mitchell, and a [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]] interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore's favor. The 24–10 win put the Ravens in the [[AFC Championship]] against the [[2000 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. The game was rarely in doubt. [[Shannon Sharpe]]'s 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback [[Rich Gannon]] were crucial as the Ravens won easily, 16–3.

Baltimore then went to [[Tampa]] for [[Super Bowl XXXV]] against the [[New York Giants]]. The Ravens’ defense carried them to a win. They recorded four sacks and forced five turnovers, one of which was a [[Kerry Collins]] interception returned for a touchdown by [[Duane Starks]]. The Giants' only score was a [[Ron Dixon (American football)|Ron Dixon]] kickoff return for a touchdown; however, the Ravens immediately countered with a touchdown return on the ensuing kickoff by [[Jermaine Lewis (American football, born 1974)|Jermaine Lewis]]. The Ravens became champions with a 34–7 win.

====2001-07====

In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the Ravens attempted to defend their title with [[Elvis Grbac]] as their new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to [[Jamal Lewis]] on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3–3 start, the Ravens defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10–6. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20–3 win over the [[Miami Dolphins]], in which the team forced three turnovers and out-gained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151. In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens' season, as they lost 27–10.

Baltimore ran into [[salary cap]] problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impact players. In the NFL Draft, the team selected [[Ed Reed]] with the 24th overall pick. Reed would go on to become one of the best safeties in NFL history, making nine Pro Bowls until leaving the Ravens for the Houston Texans in 2013. Despite low expectations, the Ravens stayed somewhat competitive in 2002 until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a post-season berth and a 7–9 finish. 

[[File:Brian Billick &amp; Coach Zauner.jpg|thumb|240px|Coach [[Gary Zauner]] (front) and [[Brian Billick]] with the Baltimore Ravens in 2003.]]
In [[2003 Baltimore Ravens season|2003]], the Ravens drafted their new quarterback, [[Kyle Boller]], but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by [[Anthony Wright (quarterback)|Anthony Wright]]. Jamal Lewis ran for 2,066 yards (including a then-NFL record 295 yards in one game against the [[2003 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] on September 14). With a 10&amp;ndash;6 record, Baltimore won their first [[AFC North]] division title. Their first playoff game, at home against the [[2003 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]], went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 54 yards total rushing. The Titans won 20–17 on a late field goal, and Baltimore's season ended early.

Ray Lewis was also named Defensive Player of the year for the second time in his career.

In April 2003, [[Art Modell]] sold 49% of the team to [[Steve Bisciotti]], a local businessman who had made his fortune in the temporary staffing field. After the season, Art Modell sold his remaining 51% ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise owner.

The Ravens did not make the playoffs in [[2004 Baltimore Ravens season|2004]] and finished the season with a record of 9–7 with Boller spending the season at QB. They did get good play from veteran corner [[Deion Sanders]] and third year safety [[Ed Reed]], who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They were also the only team to defeat the 15–1 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the regular season.
The next offseason, the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing [[Derrick Mason]] from the Titans and drafting Oklahoma wide receiver [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. However, the Ravens ended their season 6–10.

[[File:DerrickMason.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Derrick Mason]] played mainly as the Ravens No. 1 receiver from 2005 through 2010.]]
The 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6–10 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4–0, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback [[Steve McNair]].

In [[2006 Baltimore Ravens season|2006]], The Ravens lost two straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Billick to drop their offensive coordinator [[Jim Fassel]] in their week seven bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in week 13. Still ranked second overall to first-place [[San Diego Chargers]], the Ravens continued on. They defeated the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and held the defending Super Bowl champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to only one touchdown at [[Heinz Field]], allowing the Ravens to clinch the [[AFC North]].

The Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13–3 record. Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the No. 2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season's end. The Ravens were slated to face the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of &quot;Judgment Day&quot; with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). Both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&amp;T Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super Bowl champion Colts won 15–6, ending Baltimore's season.

[[File:Willis McGahee at Andrews AFB 070821-F-0000J-001 crop.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Willis McGahee]] played four seasons as a running back for the Ravens.]]
The Ravens hoped to improve upon their 13–3 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team. The Ravens finished the [[2007 Baltimore Ravens season|2007 season]] in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5–11 record. A humiliating 22–16 overtime loss to the previously winless [[Miami Dolphins]] on December 16 ultimately led to Billick's dismissal after the end of the regular season. He was replaced by [[John Harbaugh]], the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the older brother of former Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh (1998).

===John Harbaugh/Joe Flacco era (2008–2018)===

{{main|2008 Baltimore Ravens season}}
[[File:7 Boller 5 Flacco.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Joe Flacco]] (right) and [[Kyle Boller]] during 2008 Training Camp.]]
With rookies at head coach ([[John Harbaugh]]) and quarterback ([[Joe Flacco]]), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with lots of uncertainty. Baltimore smartly recovered in 2008, winning eleven games and achieving a wild card spot in the postseason. On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an [[Ed Reed]] touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27–9 at [[Dolphin Stadium]] on January 4, 2009 in a wild-card game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290104015&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines &quot;Pennington throws four interceptions in loss,&quot; ''The Associated Press'', Sunday, January 4, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Six days later, they advanced to the [[AFC Championship Game]] by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13–10 at [[LP Field]] on a [[Matt Stover]] field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290110010&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines] &quot;Stover's FG with 53 seconds left boots Ravens into AFC Championship Game&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ravens fell one victory short of [[Super Bowl XLIII]] by losing to the Steelers 23–14 at [[Heinz Field]] on January 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290118023 &quot;Polamalu's INT return secures Steelers' Super Bowl berth,&quot; ''The Associated Press'', Sunday, January 18, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009–11====
{{main|2009 Baltimore Ravens season}}
[[File:Ray-Lewis-2008-Steelers-regseason-game.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ray Lewis]] during a 2008 regular season game.]]
In [[2009 NFL season|2009]], the Ravens won their first three matches, then lost the next three, including a close match in [[2009 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]]. The rest of the season was an uneven string of wins and losses, which included a home victory over Pittsburgh in overtime followed by a Monday Night loss in [[2009 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]]. That game was notable for the number of penalties committed, costing a total of 310 yards, and almost tying with the record set by [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] and [[1976 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Afterwards, the Ravens easily crushed the [[2009 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] and [[2009 Chicago Bears season|Bears]], giving up less than ten points in both games. The next match was against the [[2009 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], where Baltimore lost a close one before beating the [[2009 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] to end the season. With a record of 9–7, the team finished second in the division and gained another wild card. Moving into the playoffs, they overwhelmed the [[2009 New England Patriots season|Patriots]]; nevertheless they did not reach the AFC Championship because they were routed 20–3 by the [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] in the Divisional Round a week later.

Baltimore managed to beat the Jets 10–9 on the 2010 opener, but then lost a poorly-played game against Cincinnati the following week. The Ravens rebounded against the other two division teams, beating Cleveland 24–17 in Week 3 and then . The Ravens scored a fine win (31–17) at home against Denver in Week 5. The Ravens finished the season 12–4, second in the division due to a tiebreaker with Pittsburgh, and earning a wild card spot. Baltimore headed to Kansas City and defeated the Chiefs 30–7, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought game.

[[File:Terrell Suggs 2011 stadium practice.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Terrell Suggs]] during practice in 2011.]]
The Ravens hosted their arch-enemy in Week 1 of the 2011 season. On a hot, humid day in M&amp;T Bank Stadium, crowd noise and multiple Steelers mistakes allowed Baltimore to crush them with three touchdowns 35–7. The frustrated Pittsburgh players also committed several costly penalties. Thus, the Ravens had gained their first ever victory over the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger playing and avenged themselves of repeated regular and postseason losses in the series.

But in Week 2, the Ravens collapsed in Tennessee and lost 26–13. They rebounded by routing the Rams in Week 3 and then overpowering the Jets 34–17 in Week 4.
Week 5, the Ravens had a bye week, following a game against the Texans. But in Week 7, Baltimore had a stunning MNF upset loss in Jacksonville as they were held to one touchdown in a 12–7 loss. Their final scoring drive failed as Joe Flacco threw an interception in the closing seconds of the game.

[[File:Jarret Johnson.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Jarret Johnson]] spent nine seasons with the Ravens from 2003-2011.]]
After beating the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17 of the regular season, the Ravens advanced to the playoffs as the Number 2 seed in the AFC with a record of 12-4.  They gained the distinction of AFC North Champions over Pittsburgh (12-4) due to a tie breaker.

Ravens' Lee Evans was stripped of a 14-yard touchdown pass by the Patriots Sterling Moore with 22 seconds left and Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff pushed a 32-yard field goal attempt wide left on fourth down as the Patriots held on to beat the Ravens 23-20 during the AFC championship game and advance to Super Bowl XLVI.

====2012: Ray Lewis' final season and 2nd Super Bowl====
{{main|2012 Baltimore Ravens season}}
[[File:Jacoby Jones Touchdown Super Bowl XLVII.jpg|thumb|Jacoby Jones dives for the end zone during the second quarter of Super Bowl XLVII.]]
[[File:Lombardi Trophy following Super Bowl XLVII.jpg|thumb|Lombardi trophy presentation following Super Bowl XLVII.]]
The Ravens' attempt to convert Joe Flacco into a pocket passer remained a work in progress as the 2012 season began. Terrell Suggs suffered a tendon injury during an off-season basketball game and was unable to play for at least several weeks. In the opener on September 10, Baltimore routed Cincinnati 44-13. After this easy win, the team headed to Philadelphia, but lost 24-23.

Returning home for a primetime rematch of the AFC Championship, another bizarre game ensued. New England picked apart the Baltimore defense (which was considerably weakened without Terrell Suggs and some other players lost over the off-season) for the first half. Trouble began early in the game when a streaker ran out onto the field and had to be tackled by security, and accelerated when, at 2:18 in the 4th quarter, the referees made a holding call on RG [[Marshal Yanda]]. Enraged fans repeatedly chanted an obscenity at this penalty. The Ravens finally drove downfield and on the last play of the game, [[Justin Tucker]] kicked a 27-yard field goal to win the game 31-30, capping off a second intense and controversially-officiated game in a row for the Ravens.

The Ravens would win the AFC North with a 10-6 record, but finished 4th in the AFC playoff seeding, and thus had to play a wild-card game. After defeating the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 24-9 at home (the final home game of Ray Lewis), the Ravens traveled to Denver to play against the top seeded Broncos. In a very back-and-forth contest, the Ravens pulled out a 38-35 [[Mile High Miracle|victory]] in two overtimes. They then won their 2nd AFC championship by coming back from a 13-7 halftime deficit to defeat the Patriots once again, 28-13.

The Ravens played the [[Super Bowl XLVII]] against the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. Baltimore built a 28–6 lead early in the third quarter before a partial [[power outage]] in the Superdome suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/ravens-beat-49ers-in-super-bowl-after-lights-go-out.html?_r=0|title= Power Fails and 49ers Surge, but Ravens Win|date=February 4, 2013|work= New York Times|accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/04/baltimore-ravens-win-super-bowl-xlvii|title= Ravens survive 49ers comeback and power failure to win Super Bowl|date=February 4, 2013|work= Guardian UK|accessdate=February 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After play resumed, San Francisco scored 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead, 28–23, and continued to chip away in the fourth quarter. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers advanced to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the [[two-minute warning]] but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory. Baltimore quarterback [[Joe Flacco]], who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP.

====2013-18====
Coming off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis. The Ravens started out 3-2, and started the 2-0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30-9 in Week 3. However, the Ravens lost their next 3 games, losing to the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in last-minute field goals and were shut out in an attempt to tie the game against the Cleveland Browns 24-18.

After winning and losing their next game, the Ravens came out 4-6, but managed winning their next four games in dominating the Jets 19-3, a Steelers win 22-20 during Thanksgiving, a booming ending in Baltimore against the Vikings 29-26, and an 18-16 win at Detroit, including Justin Tucker's 61-yard game-winning field goal. The Ravens were 8-6, with the 6th seed, but after losing their next two games, and the San Diego Chargers winning their next two to clinch the 6th seed, the Ravens finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 

On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former [[Houston Texans]] head coach [[Gary Kubiak]] to be their new offensive coordinator after [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] accepted the new available head coaching job with the [[Detroit Lions]]. On February 15, 2014, star running back Ray Rice and his fiancée Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at [[Revel Atlantic City|Revel Casino]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Celebrity news website [[TMZ]] posted a video of Rice dragging Palmer's body out of an elevator after apparently knocking her out. For the incident, Rice was initially suspended for the first two games of the [[2014 NFL season]] on July 25, 2014, which led to widespread criticism of the NFL.

In Week 1, on September 7, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], 23-16. The next day, on September 8, 2014, [[TMZ]] released additional footage from an elevator camera showing Rice punching Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL, although a judge later vacated this indefinite suspension. In Week 12, the Ravens traveled down for an interconference battle with the [[New Orleans Saints]], which the Ravens won. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Flacco's worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, falling to the Texans 25-13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10-3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points, winning 20-10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons.

In the wild card round, the Ravens won 30-17 against their divisional rivals, the [[2014 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], at [[Heinz Field]]. In the next game in the Divisional round, the Ravens faced the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Despite a strong offensive effort and having a 14-point lead twice in the game, the Ravens were defeated by the Patriots 35-31, ending their season.

The [[2015 Baltimore Ravens season|2015 season]] marked 20 seasons of the franchise's existence competing in the NFL, which the franchise recognized with a special badge being worn on their uniforms during the 2015 NFL season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/04/23/ravens-unveil-special-20th-anniv-logo-for-2015-season/ |title=Ravens Unveil Special 20th Anniv. Logo For 2015 Season « CBS Baltimore |publisher=Baltimore.cbslocal.com |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ravens  lost key players such as Joe Flacco, [[Justin Forsett]], Terrell Suggs, Steve Smith Sr., and Eugene Monroe to season-ending injuries.  Injuries and their inability to win close games early in the season led to the first losing season in the Harbaugh-Flacco. The [[2016 Baltimore Ravens season|2016 Ravens]] finishied 8–8, but failed to qualify the playoffs for the second straight year. They were eliminated from playoff contention after their Week 16 loss to their division rivals, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]]. This was the first time the Ravens missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons since [[2004 Baltimore Ravens season|2004]]–[[2005 Baltimore Ravens season|2005]], as well as the first in the Harbaugh/Flacco era.

The Ravens improved upon their 8-8 record in 2016 by one win, finishing the season 9-7 and missing the playoffs for the third year in a row. This marked the first time the Ravens failed to make the playoffs in three straight seasons since the team's first three years of existence (1996-1998). The Ravens suffered a heartbreaking loss at home to the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in the final game of the season that prevented them from earning a playoff berth.

===Lamar Jackson era (2018–present)===
The Ravens drafted QB [[Lamar Jackson]] with the 32nd pick in the 2018 draft. After the team started the season with a 4-5 record, Jackson took over as the starting QB in Week 11 when [[Joe Flacco]] was sidelined with a hip injury. The team won six of its next seven games, finishing the 2018 season with a 10-6 record and winning the AFC North, giving them their first playoff appearance since 2014 and their first division title since 2012. The Ravens lost to the [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|Los Angees Chargers]] in the Wild Card round with Jackson at quarterback, making him the youngest QB in NFL history to start a playoff game.  At the conclusion of the season, [[Ozzie Newsome]] stepped down as the team's general manager. He was replaced by longtime assistant [[Eric DeCosta]].

On March 13, 2019 the Ravens traded Flacco to the [[Denver Broncos]] in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the [[2019 NFL Draft]]. That season, Jackson led the Ravens to a franchise-best 14–2 record, including a 12-game winning streak to finish the regular season.  On December 22, they clinched home field advantage for the first time in franchise history following a win over the [[Cleveland Browns]]. On December 8, Jackson became only the second player in NFL history to rush for over 1,000 yards from the quarterback position. Four days later, Jackson broke [[Michael Vick]]'s single-season quarterback rushing record of 1,037 yards. Thirteen Ravens were selected to the 2019 [[Pro Bowl]], matching the all-time NFL record.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/ravens-tie-nfl-record-with-12-pro-bowlers&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ravens finished the 2019 regular season with 3,296 rushing yards, the most rushing yards by any team in NFL history during a season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Despite lacking star power, Ravens beat Steelers 28-10 |url=http://www.espn.com/espn/wire/_/section/nfl/id/28392694 |website=espn.com |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=30 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they became the first team in NFL history to average at least 200 passing yards and 200 rushing yards per game in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schiller |first1=Joe |title=Late for Work 12/30: Ravens Finish Regular Season in Style vs. Steelers |url=https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/late-for-work-12-30-ravens-finish-regular-season-in-style-vs-steelers |website=baltimoreravens.com |publisher=Baltimore Ravens |accessdate=30 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite earning the number-one seed in the playoffs, the Ravens were eliminated by the sixth-seeded Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, 28-12.

[[File:Roethlisberger being sacked.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] sacked by [[Bart Scott]] and [[Jarret Johnson]]]]
===Pittsburgh Steelers===
By far the team's biggest rival is the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-5-hour drive along [[Interstate 70]]. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play twice a year in the [[AFC North]], and have met four times in the playoffs. Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to under 4 points.
The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the [[National Football League|NFL]] today. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sports.cbslocal.com/2017/05/05/top-nfl-rivalries-of-all-time/|title=Top NFL Rivalries of All Time|date=2017-05-05|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other AFC North rivals===

The Ravens also have divisional rivalries with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. The rivalry with the Browns has been very one-sided; Baltimore holds an advantage of 31–11 against Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/baltimore-ravens/opponents&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry with Cincinnati has been closer, with the Ravens slightly holding the edge in the all-time series 25–23 as of the end of the 2019 NFL season.

===New England Patriots===
The Ravens first met the [[New England Patriots]] in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27–24 loss in the Patriots' [[2007 New England Patriots season|quest for perfection]]. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Patriots beat the Ravens 27–21 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] and Ravens linebacker [[Terrell Suggs]]. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Brady, Terrell Suggs Trash Talk After Game|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/18/tom-brady-terrell-suggs-trash-talk_n_766980.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the Patriots lead the overall series, 10–4, the teams have split four postseason meetings, 2–2.  The Ravens won the [[2009–10_NFL_playoffs#AFC:_Baltimore_Ravens_33,_New_England_Patriots_14|2009 Wild Card Round]], 33–14, and the [[2012–13_NFL_playoffs#AFC_Championship_Game:_Baltimore_Ravens_28,_New_England_Patriots_13|2012 AFC Championship game]], 28–13. The Patriots won the [[2011–12_NFL_playoffs#AFC_Championship_Game:_New_England_Patriots_23,_Baltimore_Ravens_20|2011 AFC Championship Game]] 23–20 and the [[2014–15_NFL_playoffs#AFC:_New_England_Patriots_35,_Baltimore_Ravens_31|2014 Divisional Round]], 35–31.

==Logo controversy==

The team's first helmet logo, used from [[1996 NFL season|1996]] through the [[1999 Pro Bowl]], featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter ''B'' framed by the word ''Ravens'' overhead and a [[cross bottony]] underneath. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed a jury verdict that the logo [[Copyright infringement|infringed]] on a [[copyright]] retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, but that he was entitled to only three dollars in damages from the NFL.

Bouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat's work. Bouchat's fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=4th&amp;navby=case&amp;no=991617P&amp;exact=1|title=FindLaw's United States Fourth Circuit case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bouchat v. Balt. Ravens Football Club, 346 F.3d 514, 519 (4th Cir. 2003), cert. denied 541 U.S. 1042 (2004) (&quot;The damages trial was conducted over a period of six days, from July 17 to 24, 2002. On July 23, 2002, at the close of the evidence, the jury was asked to decide whether the Defendants had proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues were attributable entirely to factors other than the Defendants' infringement of Bouchat's copyright. If the jury found that they were not, then it was charged to decide the percentage of the Non-Excluded Merchandise Revenues attributable to factors other than the infringement. After a full day of deliberations, the jury answered the first question in the affirmative, thereby denying Bouchat any monetary recovery.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven's head in profile over other designs. [[Art Modell]] announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter ''B'' to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo, introduced in 1999, featured a raven's head in profile with the letter superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore's history of [[heraldry]]. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the [[flag of Maryland]] and the [[flag of Baltimore]]) are interlocked with stylized letters ''B'' and ''R''.

==Uniforms==
The design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team's inaugural season in 1996. Art Modell admitted to ESPN's Roy Firestone that the Ravens' colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] 1995 dream season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidenu.com/2013/09/24/the-strange-story-of-the-modell-bowl/ |title=The Strange Story of &quot;The Modell Bowl&quot; |work=insidenu.com |date=February 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222175841/http://www.insidenu.com/2013/09/24/the-strange-story-of-the-modell-bowl/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helmets are black with purple &quot;talon&quot; stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games.

In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season.

In the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener that has a 1:00 kickoff. In recent seasons, the practice has come when the home game is played in week one. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.

In November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the [[Cleveland Browns]], entitled &quot;Pitch Black&quot; night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.

The Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the [[Washington Redskins]], the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the &quot;blackout&quot; look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/Ravens/blog/2010/06/back_in_black_1.html |title=Back in black |work=Ravens Insider |date=June 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30–24 victory over the New Orleans Saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boards.baltimoreRavens.com/topic/22806-Ravens-alternate-black-jersey-dates-for-2010-announced/|title=Ravens Alternate Black Jerseys for 2010 Announced |work=BaltimoreRavens.com |date=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the Ravens have worn their black jerseys at least twice each season. From 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, they wore the all blacks once and the black on white once. In 2014 and 2016, they wore all black both times they wore alternate uniforms. In 2017, they wore all black twice and black on white once (although the league is supposed to limit teams to wearing alternate jerseys a maximum of two times a season).

On December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during [[NBC]]'s ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' telecast.  The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13–10. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20–14. They wore this combination a third time against the [[Houston Texans]] on January 15, 2012 in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20–13. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the [[2012–13 NFL playoffs|AFC Wild Card playoff]] and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24–9.

From their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007.

On December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downing|first=Garrett|title=Ravens Wearing Gold Pants, Purple Jerseys Sunday|url=https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/ravens-wearing-gold-pants-purple-jerseys-sunday-16536671|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BaltimoreRavens.com|date=December 20, 2015|access-date=May 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on [[social media]] by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers' pants, and mustard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=What was up with those gold-tinged Ravens pants?|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000607181/article/what-was-up-with-those-goldtinged-ravens-pants|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=December 22, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edholm|first=Eric|title=Did Ravens rob rival Steelers' closets for this week's pants?|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/did-ravens-rob-rival-steelers--closets-for-this-week-s-pants-183902863.html|work=Yahoo!

During the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]], the NFL announced a jersey promotion called [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] in which teams would wear uniforms typically of one color head-to-toe during select prime-time games. The promotion was used three times that season; all the games that featured them were on [[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]] and had both teams wear them in each. The [[2016 NFL season|following season]], the league released uniforms for all 32 teams and announced they would be worn during all Thursday Night games that year, as well as on [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas]]. The Ravens had one Thursday Night game in [[2016 Baltimore Ravens season|2016]]; they wore their all-purple Color Rush uniforms and won 28–7 over the division rival [[2016 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downing|first=Garrett|title=Ravens To Go With All-Purple Uniforms For Color Rush Game|url=https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/ravens-to-go-with-all-purple-uniforms-for-color-rush-game-17676095|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BaltimoreRavens.com|date=September 13, 2016|access-date=November 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one other Thursday Night game the following season, in which they again wore the jerseys and won 40–0 over the [[2017 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. In their Christmas 2016 game against the [[2016 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]], the Ravens wore their regular all-white uniforms while their rivals wore their Color Rush uniforms.

On September 13, 2018, the Ravens debuted a new combination in a road game against the [[2018 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]], wearing white jerseys with purple pants. The purple pants are similar to the ones used for Color Rush except that it has side stripes of black and white; the Color Rush purple pants have gold and white stripes. Then on October 21 against the [[2018 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]], the Ravens paired their new purple pants with their regular purple uniforms. For the regular season finale against the [[2018 Cleveland Browns season|Browns]] on December 30, the Ravens wore their black uniforms with purple pants.

==Marching band==
{{main|Baltimore's Marching Ravens}}
The team marching band is called [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]]. They began as the Colts' marching band and have operated continuously from September 7, 1947 to the present. They helped campaign for football to return to Baltimore after the Colts moved. Because they stayed in Baltimore after the Colts left, the band is nicknamed &quot;the band that would not die&quot; and were the subject of [[The Band that Wouldn't Die|an episode]] of ESPN's ''[[30 for 30]]''. The [[Washington Redskins]] are the only other NFL team that currently has a marching band.

==First round draft picks==
{{main|List of Baltimore Ravens first-round draft picks}}
The Baltimore Ravens had their first draft in 1996, where they selected offensive lineman from UCLA and current [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|NFL Hall of Famer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parcells, Carter finally make Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/02/nfl-hall-of-fame-announcement/1886453/|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 2, 2013|first1=Jim|last1=Corbett|date=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 11-time Pro-Bowler [[Jonathan Ogden]]. Along with their pick in the next year's draft, this was the highest first-round draft pick that the Ravens have had. They also selected [[Ray Lewis]] with the 26th pick. In both 1996 and 2000, the Ravens had two first-round draft picks. However, in 2004 they had none. In their history, the Ravens have drafted 4 offensive linemen, 3 linebackers, 2 wide receivers, 2 cornerbacks, 2 quarterbacks, a running back, tight end, safety, and defensive tackle. The Ravens have 56 combined Pro-Bowl appearances from their first-round draft picks.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The Ravens' [[Flagship (radio)|flagship radio stations]] are [[Hearst Television|Hearst]]-owned [[WIYY]] (98 Rock) and [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]] 1090 AM, with [[Gerry Sandusky]] ([[WBAL-TV]] Sports Anchor since 1988) as the play-by-play announcer and analysts [[Dennis Pitta]] (Baltimore Ravens TE 2010–2016) and [[Jarret Johnson]] (Baltimore Ravens LB 2003–2011).

The team's flagship station is WIYY/WBAL sister station [[WBAL-TV]], which broadcasts pre-season games and team programming throughout the season. The programming is syndicated to [[WJLA-TV]] in Washington, [[WGAL]] in the [[Harrisburg]]&amp;ndash;[[Lebanon]]&amp;ndash;[[York]]&amp;ndash;[[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] market, and until 2017, was carried through the remainder of the team's region by [[CSN Mid-Atlantic]]. In January 2017, the Ravens announced that it had cut ties with CSN Mid-Atlantic, as the network was cutting back on its day-to-day coverage of other teams in the region in order to focus more extensively on the [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Washington Wizards|Wizards]]—whose games are broadcast by CSN Mid-Atlantic, and whose owner holds a stake in the network. The team announced that it would seek a new partner; until 2010, these rights were held by [[Mid-Atlantic Sports Network|MASN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast SportsNet will no longer partner with Ravens|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-ravens-comcast-sportsnet-20170119-story.html|website=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravens regular season games are typically broadcast by [[WJZ-TV]] as part of CBS's [[NFL on CBS|rights to the AFC]], but games may occasionally be broadcast on WBAL (''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' and simulcasts of games on cable) or [[WBFF-TV]] (also ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'').
