The '''North American B-25 Mitchell''' is a [[medium bomber]] that was introduced in 1941 and named in honor of Major General [[Billy Mitchell|William &quot;Billy&quot; Mitchell]], a pioneer of U.S. military aviation.&lt;ref&gt;United Press, “Bomber Named For Mitchell,” The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Friday 23 January 1942, Volume 48, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Used by many [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces, the B-25 served in every theater of [[World War II]], and after the war ended, many remained in service, operating across four decades. Produced in numerous variants, nearly 10,000 B-25s were built.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Air Force Factsheets: North American B-25B Mitchell&quot; /&gt; These included a few limited models such as the F-10 [[reconnaissance aircraft]], the AT-24 crew trainers, and the [[United States Marine Corps]]' PBJ-1 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|patrol bomber]].

==Design and development==

The Air Corps issued a specification for a medium bomber in March 1939 that was capable of carrying a payload of {{convert|2400|lb|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1200|miles|abbr=on}} at {{convert|300|mph|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Baugher, Joe. [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_bombers/b25_2.html &quot;North American B-25 Mitchell.&quot;] ''American Military Aircraft: US Bomber Aircraft'', 6 March 2000. Retrieved: 24 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; North American Aviation used its [[North American NA-40|NA-40B]] design to develop the NA-62, which competed for the medium bomber contract. No YB-25 was available for prototype service tests. In September 1939, the Air Corps ordered the NA-62 into production as the B-25, along with the other new Air Corps medium bomber, the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] &quot;off the drawing board&quot;.

[[File:Alfred T. Palmer - Assembling the North American B-25 Mitchell at Kansas City, Kansas (USA).jpg|thumb|North American B-25 Mitchell production in Kansas City in 1942|alt=Interior of huge aircraft factory where rows of bombers are being assembled]]

Early into B-25 production, NAA incorporated a significant redesign to the wing dihedral. The first nine aircraft had a constant-[[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], meaning the wing had a consistent, upward angle from the fuselage to the wingtip. This design caused stability problems. &quot;Flattening&quot; the outer wing panels by giving them a slight anhedral angle just outboard of the engine nacelles nullified the problem, and gave the B-25 its [[gull wing]] configuration.&lt;ref name=&quot;chor aero p74&quot;&gt;Chorlton ''Aeroplane'' May 2013, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Less noticeable changes during this period included an increase in the size of the tail fins and a decrease in their inward tilt at their tops.

NAA continued design and development in 1940 and 1941. Both the B-25A and B-25B series entered USAAF service. The B-25B was operational in 1942. Combat requirements led to further developments. Before the year was over, NAA was producing the B-25C and B-25D series at different plants. Also in 1942, the manufacturer began design work on the cannon-armed B-25G series. The NA-100 of 1943 and 1944 was an interim armament development at the Kansas City complex known as the B-25D2. Similar armament upgrades by U.S-based commercial modification centers involved about half of the B-25G series. Further development led to the B-25H, B-25J, and B-25J2. The gunship design concept dates to late 1942 and NAA sent a field technical representative to the SWPA. The factory-produced B-25G entered production during the NA-96 order followed by the redesigned B-25H gunship. The B-25J reverted to the bomber role, but it, too, could be outfitted as a strafer.

NAA manufactured the greatest number of aircraft in World War II, the first time a company had produced trainers, bombers, and fighters simultaneously (the AT-6/SNJ Texan/Harvard, B-25 Mitchell, and the P-51 Mustang).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It produced B-25s at both its Inglewood main plant and an additional 6,608 aircraft at its [[Kansas City, Kansas]], plant at [[Fairfax Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Parker 2013, pp. 77–79, 83, 88, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated70&quot;&gt;Borth 1945, pp. 70, 92, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman 2012, pp. 11, 88, 115, 140–143, 263, 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the USAF placed a contract for the TB-25L trainer in 1952. This was a modification program by Hayes of [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Its primary role was [[reciprocating engine]] pilot training.{{cn|date=January 2019}}

A development of the B-25 was the [[North American XB-28 Dragon|North American XB-28]], designed as a high-altitude bomber. Two prototypes were built with the second prototype, the XB-28A, evaluated as a photo-reconnaissance platform, but the aircraft did not enter production.&lt;ref&gt;Norton 2012, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia-Pacific ===
The majority of B-25s in American service were used in [[Pacific War|the war against Japan in Asia and the Pacific]]. The Mitchell fought from the Northern Pacific to the South Pacific and the Far East. These areas included the campaigns in the [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Papua New Guinea]], the Solomon Islands, [[New Britain]], China, Burma and the [[island hopping campaign]] in the Central Pacific. The aircraft's potential as a ground-[[attack aircraft]] emerged during the Pacific war. The jungle environment reduced the usefulness of medium-level bombing, and made low-level attack the best tactic. Using similar [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea#Allied_tactics|mast height level tactics]] and [[skip bombing]], the B-25 proved itself to be a capable anti-shipping weapon and sank many enemy sea vessels of various types. An ever-increasing number of forward firing guns made the B-25 a formidable strafing aircraft for island warfare. The strafer versions were the B-25C1/D1, the B-25J1 and with the NAA strafer nose, the J2 subseries.

In Burma, the B-25 was often used to attack Japanese communication links, especially bridges in central Burma. It also helped supply the  [[Battle of Imphal|besieged troops at Imphal]] in 1944. The China Air Task Force, the Chinese American Composite Wing, the First Air Commando Group, the 341st Bomb Group, and eventually, the relocated 12th Bomb Group, all operated the B-25 in the [[China Burma India Theater]]. Many of these missions involved battle-field isolation, interdiction, and close air support.

Later in the war, as the USAAF acquired bases in other parts of the Pacific, the Mitchell could strike targets in [[Indochina]], [[Formosa]], and [[Kyushu]], increasing the usefulness of the B-25. It was also used in some of the shortest raids of the Pacific War, striking from [[Saipan]] against [[Guam]] and [[Tinian]]. The 41st Bomb Group used it against Japanese-occupied islands that had been bypassed by the main campaign, such as happened in the [[Marshall Islands]].

=== Middle East and Italy ===
The first B-25s arrived in Egypt and were carrying out independent operations by October 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Pace, 2002 p23&lt;/ref&gt; Operations there against Axis airfields and motorized vehicle columns supported the ground actions of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Thereafter, the aircraft took part in the rest of the [[North Africa campaign|campaign in North Africa]], the [[invasion of Sicily]], and the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|advance up Italy]]. In the Strait of Messina to the Aegean Sea, the B-25 conducted sea sweeps as part of the coastal air forces. In Italy, the B-25 was used in the [[ground attack]] role, concentrating on attacks against road and rail links in Italy, Austria, and the Balkans. The B-25 had a longer range than the [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] and [[Douglas A-26 Invader]], allowing it to reach further into occupied Europe. The five bombardment groups – 20 squadrons – of the Ninth and Twelfth Air Forces that used the B-25 in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] were the only U.S. units to employ the B-25 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Pace 2002, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The RAF received nearly 900 Mitchells, using them to replace [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Bostons]], [[Lockheed Ventura]]s, and [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers. The Mitchell entered active RAF service on 22 January 1943. At first, it was used to bomb targets in occupied Europe. After the [[invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] invasion, the RAF and France used Mitchells in support of the Allies in Europe. Several squadrons moved to forward airbases on the continent. The USAAF did not use the B-25 in combat in the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European theater of operations]].

=== USAAF ===
[[File:Army B-25 (Doolittle Raid).jpg|thumb|A B-25 Mitchell taking off from USS ''Hornet'' for the Doolittle Raid]]

The B-25B first gained fame as the bomber used in the 18 April 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]], in which 16 B-25Bs led by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Jimmy Doolittle]] attacked mainland Japan, four months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The mission gave a much-needed lift in spirits to the Americans, and alarmed the Japanese, who had believed their home islands to be inviolable by enemy forces. Although the amount of actual damage done was relatively minor, it forced the Japanese to divert troops for home defense for the remainder of the war.

The raiders took off from the carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} and successfully bombed Tokyo and four other Japanese cities without loss. Fifteen of the bombers subsequently crash-landed en route to recovery fields in eastern China. These losses were the result of the task force being spotted by a Japanese vessel, forcing the bombers to take off {{convert|170|mi|km|abbr=on}} early, fuel exhaustion, stormy nighttime conditions with zero visibility, and lack of electronic homing aids at the recovery bases. Only one B-25 bomber landed intact, in [[Siberia]], where its five-man crew was interned and the aircraft confiscated. Of the 80 aircrew, 69 survived their historic mission and eventually made it back to American lines.

Following a number of additional modifications, including the addition of [[Plexiglas]] dome for navigational sightings to replace the overhead window for the navigator and heavier nose armament, [[De-ice|de-icing]] and anti-icing equipment, the B-25C entered USAAF operations. Through block 20, the B-25C and B-25D differed only in location of manufacture: C series at [[Inglewood, California]], and D series at [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. After block 20, some NA-96s began the transition to the G series, while some NA-87s acquired interim modifications eventually produced as the B-25D2 and ordered as the NA-100. NAA built a total of 3,915 B-25Cs and Ds during World War II.

Although the B-25 was originally designed to bomb from medium altitudes in level flight, it was used frequently in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific theatre]] in treetop-level [[strafing]] and missions with parachute-retarded fragmentation bombs against Japanese airfields in [[New Guinea]] and the Philippines. These heavily armed Mitchells were field-modified at [[Townsville]], Australia, under the direction of Major [[Paul I. &quot;Pappy&quot; Gunn]] and North American technical representative Jack Fox. These &quot;commerce destroyers&quot; were also used on strafing and [[skip bombing]] missions against Japanese shipping trying to resupply their armies.

Under the leadership of [[Lieutenant General]] [[George C. Kenney]], Mitchells of the Far East Air Forces and its existing components, the [[Fifth Air Force|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Air Force]]s, devastated Japanese targets in the Southwest Pacific Theater during 1944 to 1945. The USAAF played a significant role in pushing the Japanese back to their home islands. The type operated with great effect in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Central Pacific]], [[Battle of the Aleutian Islands|Alaska]], [[North African campaign|North Africa]], [[Battle of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean]], and [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|China-Burma-India]] theaters.

The USAAF Antisubmarine Command made great use of the B-25 in 1942 and 1943. Some of the earliest B-25 bomb groups also flew the Mitchell on coastal patrols after the Pearl Harbor attack, prior to the AAFAC organization. Many of the two dozen or so antisubmarine squadrons flew the B-25C, D, and G series in the American Theater antisubmarine campaign, often in the distinctive, white sea-search camouflage.

===== Use as a gunship =====

&lt;!-- Gunship links here --&gt;
[[File:North American B-25 Mitchell.JPG|thumb|A view of a B-25G shows the midship location of dorsal turret.]]
In antishipping operations, the USAAF had urgent need for hard-hitting aircraft, and North American responded with the B-25G. In this series, the transparent nose and bombardier/navigator position was changed for a shorter, hatched nose with two fixed .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns and a manually loaded [[75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) M4 cannon]],&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;Merriam, Ray, ed. [https://books.google.com/books?id=R7GjzzNMpu4C&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;pg=PA8 &quot;U. S. Warplanes of World War II.&quot;] ''World War II Journal, No. 15,'' 1 July 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest weapons fitted to an aircraft, similar to the British [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|57&amp;nbsp;mm gun]]-armed [[De_Havilland_Mosquito#Strike_(&quot;fighter-bomber&quot;)_variants|Mosquito Mk. XVIII]] and the autoloading German 75&amp;nbsp;mm long-barrel ''Bordkanone BK 7,5'' heavy-calibre ordnance fitted to both the [[Henschel_Hs_129#Hs_129_B-3|Henschel Hs 129B-3]] and [[Junkers_Ju_88#Ju_88P|Junkers Ju 88P-1]]. The B-25G's shorter nose placed the cannon breech behind the pilot, where it could be manually loaded and serviced by the navigator; his crew station was moved to a position just behind the pilot. The navigator signalled the pilot when the gun was ready and the pilot fired the weapon using a button on his control wheel.

The Royal Air Force, U.S. Navy, and Soviet VVS each conducted trials with this series, but none adopted it. The G series comprised one prototype, five preproduction C conversions, 58 C series modifications, and 400 production aircraft for a total of 464 B-25Gs. In its final version, the G-12, an interim armament modification, eliminated the lower Bendix turret and added a starboard dual gun pack, waist guns, and a canopy for the tail gunner to improve the view when firing the single tail gun. In April 1945, the air depots in Hawaii refurbished about two dozen of these and included the eight-gun nose and rocket launchers in the upgrade.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The B-25H series continued the development of the gunship concept. NAA Inglewood produced 1000. The H had even more firepower. Most replaced the M4 gun with the lighter [[75 mm gun (US)#T13E1 / M5|T13E1]],&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt; designed specifically for the aircraft, but 20-odd H-1 block aircraft completed by the [[Republic Aviation]] modification center at Evansville had the M4 and two-machine-gun nose armament. The 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) gun fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2,362|ft/s|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Due to its low rate of fire (about four rounds could be fired in a single [[strafing]] run), relative ineffectiveness against ground targets, and the substantial recoil, the 75&amp;nbsp;mm gun was sometimes removed from both G and H models and replaced with two additional .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns as a field modification.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzey 1999, pp. 51, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the new FEAF, these were redesignated the G1 and H1 series, respectively.

[[File:B-25H.jpg|thumb|A restored B-25H &quot;Barbie III&quot; showing 75&amp;nbsp;mm M5 gun and four 0.50 Brownings with belt feeds]]

The H series normally came from the factory mounting four fixed, forward-firing .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose; four in a pair of under-cockpit [[wikt:conformal|conformal]] flank-mount gun pod packages (two guns per side); two more in the manned dorsal turret, relocated forward to a position just behind the cockpit (which became standard for the J-model); one each in a pair of new waist positions, introduced simultaneously with the forward-relocated dorsal turret; and lastly, a pair of guns in a new tail-gunner's position. Company promotional material bragged that the B-25H could &quot;bring to bear 10 machine guns coming and four going, in addition to the 75&amp;nbsp;mm cannon, eight [[unguided rocket|rockets]], and 3,000&amp;nbsp;lb (1,360&amp;nbsp;kg) of bombs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yenne 1989, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The H had a modified cockpit with single flight controls operated by pilot. The co-pilot's station and controls were deleted, and instead had a smaller seat used by the navigator/cannoneer, The radio operator crew position was aft the bomb bay with access to the waist guns.&lt;ref&gt;Kinzey 1999, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Factory production totals were 405 B-25Gs and 1,000 B-25Hs, with 248 of the latter being used by the Navy as PBJ-1Hs.&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt; Elimination of the co-pilot saved weight, moving the dorsal turret forward counterbalanced in part the waist guns and the manned rear turret.&lt;ref&gt;Baugher, Joe.

===== Return to medium bomber =====
Following the two-gunship series, NAA again produced the medium bomber configuration with the B-25J series. It optimized the mix of the interim NA-100 and the H series, having both the bombardier's station and fixed guns of the D and the forward turret and refined armament of the H series. NAA also produced a strafer nose first shipped to air depots as kits, then introduced on the production line in alternating blocks with the bombardier nose. The solid-metal &quot;strafer&quot; nose housed eight centerline Browning M2 .50 calibre machine guns. The remainder of the armament was as in the H-5. NAA also supplied kits to mount eight underwing 5 &quot;high velocity airborne rockets&quot; (HVAR) just outside the propeller arcs. These were mounted on zero-length launch rails, four to a wing.
[[File:Restored B-25J Take-off Time at an air show.JPG|thumb|The restored B-25J Mitchell ''Take-Off Time'' at the [[Mid-Atlantic Air Museum]] for World War II Weekend 2015 in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]]]
The final, and the most built, series of the Mitchell, the '''B-25J''', looked less like earlier series apart from the well-glazed bombardier's nose of nearly identical appearance to the earliest B-25 subtypes.&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt; Instead, the J followed the overall configuration of the H series from the cockpit aft. It had the forward dorsal turret and other armament and airframe advancements. All J models included four .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) light-barrel Browning AN/M2 guns in a pair of &quot;fuselage packages&quot;, conformal [[gun pod]]s each flanking the lower cockpit, each pod containing two [[Browning M2]]s. By 1945, however, combat squadrons removed these. The J series restored the co-pilot's seat and dual flight controls. The factory made available kits to the Air Depot system to create the strafer-nose B-25J-2. This configuration carried a total of 18 .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) light-barrel AN/M2 Browning M2 machine guns: eight in the nose, four in the flank-mount conformal gun pod packages, two in the dorsal turret, one each in the pair of waist positions, and a pair in the tail – with 14 of the guns either aimed directly forward, or aimed to fire directly forward for strafing missions. Some aircraft had eight [[5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket|5 inch (130&amp;nbsp;mm) high-velocity aircraft rockets]].&lt;ref name=Merriam /&gt; NAA introduced the J-2 into production in alternating blocks at the J-22. Total J series production was 4,318.

==== Flight characteristics ====
The B-25 was a safe and forgiving aircraft to fly.&lt;ref&gt;Tallman 1973, pp. 216, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; With one engine out, 60° banking turns into the dead engine were possible, and control could be easily maintained down to 145&amp;nbsp;mph (230&amp;nbsp;km/h). The pilot had to remember to maintain engine-out directional control at low speeds after takeoff with rudder; if this maneuver were attempted with ailerons, the aircraft could snap out of control. The tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. The only significant complaint about the B-25 was the extremely high noise level produced by its engines; as a result, many pilots eventually suffered from varying degrees of [[hearing loss]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dbvxho&quot;&gt;Higham 1975, 8; Higham 1978, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The high noise level was due to design and space restrictions in the engine cowlings, which resulted in the exhaust &quot;stacks&quot; protruding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing. This arrangement directed exhaust and noise directly at the pilot and crew compartments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==== Durability ====
[[File:B-25 bomber is assembled.jpg|alt= B-25 Engine Assembly|thumb|The B-25 engine cowling assembly]]

The Mitchell was an exceptionally sturdy aircraft that could withstand tremendous punishment. One B-25C of the [[321st Bombardment Group|321st Bomb Group]] was nicknamed &quot;Patches&quot; because its crew chief painted all the aircraft's [[flak]] hole patches with the bright yellow [[zinc chromate]] [[Primer (paint)|primer]]. By the end of the war, this aircraft had completed over 300 missions, had been belly-landed six times, and had over 400 patched holes. The airframe of &quot;Patches&quot; was so distorted from battle damage that straight-and-level flight required 8° of left [[aileron]] trim and 6° of right rudder, causing the aircraft to &quot;crab&quot; sideways across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaf.com/pastplanes/b-25.htm &quot;A Brief history of the B-25.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303172949/http://www.usaf.com/pastplanes/b-25.htm |date=3 March 2015 }} USAF.com. Accessed: 25 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Postwar (USAF) use ===
In 1947, legislation created an independent [[United States Air Force]] and by that time, the B-25 inventory numbered only a few hundred. Some B-25s continued in service into the 1950s in a variety of training, reconnaissance, and support roles. The principal use during this period was undergraduate training of multiengine aircraft pilots slated for reciprocating engine or turboprop cargo, aerial refueling, or reconnaissance aircraft. Others were assigned to units of the [[Air National Guard]] in training roles in support of [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion]] and [[Lockheed F-94 Starfire]] operations. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In its USAF tenure, many B-25s received the so-called &quot;Hayes modification&quot; and as a result, surviving B-25s often have exhaust systems with a semicollector ring that splits emissions into two different systems. The upper seven cylinders are collected by a ring, while the other cylinders remain directed to individual ports.

TB-25J-25-NC Mitchell, ''44-30854'', the last B-25 in the USAF inventory, assigned at [[March AFB]], California, as of March 1960,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Doolittle Park Will Have AF B-25 Bomber&quot;. ''Playground News'' (Fort Walton Beach, Florida), Volume 15, Number 7, 10 March 1960, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; was flown to [[Eglin AFB]], Florida, from [[Naval Air Station Albany#Turner Air Force Base (1947-66)|Turner Air Force Base]], Georgia, on 21 May 1960, the last flight by a USAF B-25, and presented by Brigadier General A. J. Russell, Commander of [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]]'s [[822d Air Division]] at Turner AFB, to the Air Proving Ground Center Commander, Brigadier General Robert H. Warren, who in turn presented the bomber to [[Valparaiso, Florida]], Mayor Randall Roberts on behalf of the Niceville-Valparaiso Chamber of Commerce.

=== U.S. Navy and USMC ===

[[File:PBJ-1D Mitchell in flight near NAS Patuxent River in February 1944.jpg|thumb|left|PBJ-1D]]
The U.S. Navy designation for the Mitchell was the PBJ-1 and apart from increased use of radar, it was configured like its Army Air Forces counterparts. Under the pre-1962 USN/USMC/USCG aircraft designation system, PBJ-1 stood for Patrol (P) Bomber (B) built by North American Aviation (J), first variant (-1) under the [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system|existing American naval aircraft designation system of the era]]. The PBJ had its origin in an inter-service agreement of mid-1942 between the Navy and the USAAF exchanging the Boeing Renton plant for the Kansas plant for [[B-29 Superfortress]] production. The [[Boeing XPBB Sea Ranger]] flying boat, competing for B-29 engines, was cancelled in exchange for part of the Kansas City Mitchell production. Other terms included the interservice transfer of 50 B-25Cs and 152 B-25Ds to the Navy. The bombers carried Navy [[bureau number]]s (BuNos), beginning with BuNo 34998. The first PBJ-1 arrived in February 1943, and nearly all reached Marine Corps squadrons, beginning with Marine Bombing Squadron 413 (VMB-413). Following the AAFAC format, the Marine Mitchells had search [[radar]] in a retractable radome replacing the remotely operated ventral turret. Later D and J series had nose-mounted APS-3 radar; and later still, J and H series mounted radar in the starboard wingtip. The large quantities of B-25H and J series became known as PBJ-1H and PBJ-1J, respectively. These aircraft often operated along with earlier PBJ series in Marine squadrons.

The PBJs were operated almost exclusively by the Marine Corps as land-based bombers. To operate them, the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] established a number of Marine bomber squadrons (VMB), beginning with VMB-413, in March 1943 at [[MCAS Cherry Point]], North Carolina. Eight VMB squadrons were flying PBJs by the end of 1943, forming the initial Marine medium bombardment group. Four more squadrons were in the process of formation in late 1945, but had not yet deployed by the time the war ended.

Operational use of the Marine Corps PBJ-1s began in March 1944. The Marine PBJs operated from the Philippines, Saipan, [[Iwo Jima]], and [[Okinawa]] during the last few months of the Pacific war. Their primary mission was the long-range [[interdiction]] of enemy shipping trying to run the blockade, which was strangling Japan. The weapon of choice during these missions was usually the five-inch HVAR rocket, eight of which could be carried. Some VMB-612 intruder PBJ-1D and J series planes flew without top turrets to save weight and increase range on night patrols, especially towards the end of the war when air superiority existed.

During the war, the Navy tested the cannon-armed G series and conducted carrier trials with an H equipped with arresting gear. After World War II, some PBJs stationed at the Navy's then-rocket laboratory site in [[Inyokern, California]], site of the present-day [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]], tested various air-to-ground rockets and arrangements. One  arrangement was a twin-barrel nose arrangement that could fire 10 spin-stabilized five-inch rockets in one salvo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O-ADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Smash Hits.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', March 1947, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal Air Force ===
The [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was an early customer for the B-25 via [[Lend-Lease]]. The first Mitchells were given the service name Mitchell I by the RAF and were delivered in August 1941, to No. 111 Operational Training Unit based in [[the Bahamas]]. These bombers were used exclusively for training and familiarization and never achieved operational status. The B-25Cs and Ds were designated Mitchell II. Altogether, 167 B-25Cs and 371 B-25Ds were delivered to the RAF. The RAF tested the cannon-armed G series but did not adopt the series nor the follow-on H series.

By the end of 1942, the RAF had taken delivery of a total of 93 Mitchells, marks I and II. Some served with squadrons of [[No. 2 Group RAF]], the RAF's tactical medium-bomber force. The first RAF operation with the Mitchell II took place on 22 January 1943, when six aircraft from [[No. 180 Squadron RAF]] attacked oil installations at [[Ghent]]. After the invasion of Europe (by which point 2 Group was part of [[Second Tactical Air Force]]), all four Mitchell squadrons moved to bases in France and Belgium (Melsbroek) to support Allied ground forces. The British Mitchell squadrons were joined by [[No. 342 Squadron RAF|No. 342 (Lorraine) Squadron]] of the [[French Air Force]] in April 1945.

As part of its move from Bomber Command, [[No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron|No 305 (Polish) Squadron]] flew Mitchell IIs from September to December 1943 before converting to the [[de Havilland Mosquito]]. In addition to No. 2 Group, the B-25 was used by various second-line RAF units in the UK and abroad. In the Far East, No. 3 PRU, which consisted of [[No. 681 Squadron RAF|Nos. 681]] and 684 Squadrons, flew the Mitchell (primarily Mk IIs) on photographic reconnaissance sorties.

The RAF was allocated 316 B-25Js, which entered service as Mitchell IIIs. Deliveries took place between August 1944 and August 1945. However, only about 240 of these bombers actually reached Britain, with some being diverted to No. 111 [[Operational training unit|OTU]] in the Bahamas, some crashing during delivery, and some being retained in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Royal Canadian Air Force ===
The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) used the B-25 Mitchell for training during the war. Postwar use had continued operations with most of 162 Mitchells received. The first B-25s had originally been diverted to Canada from RAF orders. These included one Mitchell I, 42 Mitchell IIs, and 19 Mitchell IIIs. No 13 (P) Squadron was formed unofficially at [[Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport|RCAF Rockcliffe]] in May 1944 and used Mitchell IIs on high-altitude aerial photography sorties. No. 5 Operational Training Unit at Boundary Bay, British Columbia and Abbotsford, British Columbia, operated the B-25D Mitchell in the training role together with B-24 Liberators for Heavy Conversion as part of the BCATP. The RCAF retained the Mitchell until October 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Skaarup 2009, pp. 333–334.&lt;/ref&gt;

No 418 (Auxiliary) Squadron received its first Mitchell IIs in January 1947. It was followed by No 406 (auxiliary), which flew Mitchell IIs and IIIs from April 1947 to June 1958. No 418 operated a mix of IIs and IIIs until March 1958. No 12 Squadron of Air Transport Command also flew Mitchell IIIs along with other types from September 1956 to November 1960. In 1951, the RCAF received an additional 75 B-25Js from USAF stocks to make up for attrition and to equip various second-line units.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R.W.R.

=== Royal Australian Air Force ===
The Australians received Mitchells by the spring of 1944. The joint Australian-Dutch [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF]] had more than enough Mitchells for one squadron, so the surplus went to re-equip the RAAF's [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Squadron]], replacing their [[Bristol Beaufort|Beauforts]].

=== Dutch Air Force ===
[[File:18 Sqn (AWM P02769-001).jpg|thumb|B-25 Mitchells assigned to [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF]] in 1943]]
During World War II, the Mitchell served in fairly large numbers with the Air Force of the Dutch government-in-exile. They participated in combat in the East Indies, as well as on the European front. On 30 June 1941, the Netherlands Purchasing Commission, acting on behalf of the Dutch government-in-exile in London, signed a contract with North American Aviation for 162 B-25C aircraft. The bombers were to be delivered to the [[Netherlands East Indies]] to help deter any Japanese aggression into the region.

In February 1942, the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] agreed to ferry 20 Dutch B-25s from Florida to Australia travelling via Africa and India, and an additional 10 via the South Pacific route from California. During March, five of the bombers on the Dutch order had reached [[Bangalore]], India, and 12 had reached Archerfield in Australia. The B-25s in Australia would be used as the nucleus of a new squadron, designated No. 18. This squadron was staffed jointly by Australian and Dutch aircrews plus a smattering of aircrews from other nations, and operated under Royal Australian Air Force command for the remainder of the war.

The B-25s of No. 18 Squadron were painted with the Dutch national insignia (at this time a rectangular Netherlands flag) and carried NEIAF serials. Discounting the ten &quot;temporary&quot; B-25s delivered to 18 Squadron in early 1942, a total of 150 Mitchells were taken on strength by the NEIAF, 19 in 1942, 16 in 1943, 87 in 1944, and 28 in 1945. They flew bombing raids against Japanese targets in the East Indies. In 1944, the more capable B-25J Mitchells replaced most of the earlier C and D models.

In June 1940, [[No. 320 Squadron RAF]] had been formed from personnel formerly serving with the [[Netherlands Naval Aviation Service|Royal Dutch Naval Air Service]], who had escaped to England after the German occupation of the Netherlands. Equipped with various British aircraft, No. 320 Squadron flew antisubmarine patrols, convoy escort missions, and performed air-sea rescue duties. They acquired the Mitchell II in September 1943, performing operations over Europe against gun emplacements, railway yards, bridges, troops, and other tactical targets. They moved to Belgium in October 1944, and transitioned to the Mitchell III in 1945. No. 320 Squadron was disbanded in August 1945. Following the war, B-25s were used by Dutch forces during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].

=== Soviet Air Force ===
The U.S. supplied 862 B-25s (B, D, G, and J types) to the Soviet Union under [[Lend-Lease]] during World War II via the Alaska–Siberia [[ALSIB]] ferry route.

Other damaged aircraft arrived or crashed in the Far East of Russia, and one Doolittle Raid aircraft landed there short of fuel after attacking Japan. The lone airworthy aircraft to reach the Soviet Union was lost in a hangar fire in the early 1950s while undergoing routine maintenance. In general, the B-25 was operated as a ground-support and tactical daylight bomber (as similar Douglas A-20 Havocs were used). It saw action in fights from Stalingrad (with B/D models) to the German surrender during May 1945 (with G/J types).

The B-25s that remained in Soviet Air Force service after the war were assigned the [[NATO reporting name]] &quot;Bank&quot;.

=== China ===
Well over 100 B-25Cs and Ds were supplied to the Nationalist Chinese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In addition, a total of 131 B-25Js were supplied to China under Lend-Lease.

The four squadrons of the 1st BG (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th) of the 1st Medium Bomber Group were formed during the war. They formerly operated Russian-built [[Tupolev SB]] bombers, then transferred to the B-25. The 1st BG was under the command of Chinese-American Composite Wing while operating B-25s. Following the end of the war in the Pacific, these four bombardment squadrons were established to fight against the Communist insurgency that was rapidly spreading throughout the country. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Chinese Mitchells fought alongside de Havilland Mosquitos.

In December 1948, the Nationalists were forced to retreat to the island of Taiwan, taking many of their Mitchells with them. However, some B-25s were left behind and were pressed into service with the air force of the new People's Republic of China.

=== Brazilian Air Force ===
[[File:B-25J Mitchell - s-n 44-30069 - at Museu Aerospacial in Campos dos Afonsos Air Force Base - Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|right|B-25J Mitchell  ''44-30069'' at ''Museu Aerospacial'' in ''Campos dos Afonsos Air Force Base'', Rio de Janeiro]]

During the war, the [[Brazilian Air Force|Força Aérea Brasileira]] received a few B-25s under Lend-Lease. Brazil declared war against the Axis powers in August 1942 and participated in the war against the U-boats in the southern Atlantic. The last Brazilian B-25 was finally declared surplus in 1970.

=== Free French ===
The Royal Air Force issued at least 21 Mitchell IIIs to No 342 Squadron, which was made up primarily of Free French aircrews. Following the liberation of France, this squadron transferred to the newly formed [[French Air Force]] (''Armée de l'Air'') as GB I/20 Lorraine. The aircraft continued in operation after the war, with some being converted into fast VIP transports. They were struck off charge in June 1947.

=== Biafra ===
In October 1967, during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], [[Biafra]] bought two Mitchells. After a few bombings in November, they were put out of action in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jowett|first=Philip|title=Modern African Wars (5): The Nigerian-Biafran War 1967-70|year=2016|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1472816092|page=18|ref={{harvid|Jowett|2016}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;B-25C
:An improved version of the B-25B, its powerplants were upgraded from [[Wright R-2600]]-9 radials to R-2600-13s; de-icing and anti-icing equipment were added; the navigator received a sighting blister; and nose armament was increased to two .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns, one fixed and one flexible. The B-25C model was the first mass-produced B-25 version; it was also used in the United Kingdom (as the Mitchell Mk II), in Canada, China, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union (number made: 1,625).
;ZB-25C
;B-25D
:Through block 20, the series was near identical to the B-25C. The series designation differed in that the B-25D was made in Kansas City, Kansas, whereas the B-25C was made in Inglewood, California. Later blocks with interim armament upgrades, the D2s, first flew on 3 January 1942 (number made: 2,290).

[[File:North American F-10 Mitchell.jpg|thumb|right|An F-10 reconnaissance aircraft]]

;F-10
:The F-10 designation distinguished 45 B-25Ds modified for photographic reconnaissance. All armament, armor, and bombing equipment were stripped. Three K.17 cameras were installed, one pointing down and two more mounted at oblique angles within blisters on each side of the nose. Optionally, a second downward-pointing camera could also be installed in the aft fuselage. Although designed for combat operations, these aircraft were mainly used for ground mapping.
;B-25D weather reconnaissance variant
:In 1944, four B-25Ds were converted for weather reconnaissance. One later user was the [[53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]], originally called the Army Hurricane Reconnaissance Unit, now called the &quot;Hurricane Hunters&quot;. Weather reconnaissance first started in 1943 with the [[1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]], with flights on the North Atlantic ferry routes.&lt;ref&gt;Robison, Tom.

;ZB-25D
;XB-25E
:A single B-25C was modified to test de-icing and anti-icing equipment that circulated exhaust from the engines in chambers in the leading and trailing edges and empennage. The aircraft was tested for almost two years, beginning in 1942; while the system proved extremely effective, no production models were built that used it before the end of World War II. Many surviving [[warbird]]-flown B-25 aircraft today use the de-icing system from the XB-25E (number made: 1, converted).
;ZXB-25E
;XB-25F-A
:A modified B-25C, it used insulated electrical coils mounted inside the wing and empennage leading edges to test the effectiveness as a de-icing system. The hot air de-icing system tested on the XB-25E was determined to be the more practical of the two (number made: 1, converted).
;XB-25G
:This modified B-25C had the transparent nose replaced to create a short-nosed gunship carrying two fixed .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns and a 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in) M4 cannon, then the largest weapon ever carried on an American bomber (number made: 1, converted).
;B-25G
:The B-25G followed the success of the prototype XB-25G and production was a continuation of the NA96. The production model featured increased armor and a greater fuel supply than the XB-25G. One B-25G was passed to the British, who gave it the name Mitchell II that had been used for the B-25C. The USSR also tested the G (number made: 463; five converted Cs, 58 modified Cs, 400 production).

[[File:B-25 At Centennial.jpg|thumb|A B-25H ''Barbie III'' taxiing at [[Centennial Airport]], Colorado]]

;B-25H
:An improved version of the B-25G, this version relocated the manned dorsal turret to a more forward location on the fuselage just aft of the flight deck. It also featured two additional fixed .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose and in the H-5 onward, four in fuselage-mounted pods. The T13E1 light weight cannon replaced the heavy M4 cannon 75&amp;nbsp;mm (2.95&amp;nbsp;in). Single controls were installed from the factory with navigator in the right seat (number made: 1000; two airworthy {{As of|2015|lc=yes}}).
;B-25J-NC
: Follow-on production at Kansas City, the B-25J could be called a cross between the B-25D and the B-25H. It had a transparent nose, but many of the delivered aircraft were modified to have a strafer nose (J2). Most of its 14–18 machine guns were forward-facing for strafing missions, including the two guns of the forward-located dorsal turret. The RAF received 316 aircraft, which were known as the Mitchell III. The J series was the last factory series production of the B-25 (number made: 4,318).
