The '''Bay of Quinte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɪ|n|t|i}}) is a long, narrow bay shaped like the letter &quot;Z&quot; on the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]] in the province of [[Ontario]], Canada. It is just west of the head of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] that drains the [[Great Lakes]] into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It is located about {{convert|200|km}} east of [[Toronto]] and {{convert|350|km}} west of [[Montreal]].

The name &quot;Quinte&quot; is derived from &quot;''Kenté''&quot;, which was the name of an early French Catholic [[Mission (station)|mission]] located on the north shore of what is now [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/ontario/lake_ontario/cul_page3.htm Great Canadian Lakes, Lake Ontario - Saving Souls in Kente] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309040642/http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/ontario/lake_ontario/cul_page3.htm |date=March 9, 2009 }} Retrieved: 2010-04-15&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, in the [[Mohawk language]], the community is called '''&quot;Kenhtè:ke&quot;''', which means &quot;the place of the bay&quot;.  The [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]] name is ''Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ'', &quot;land of two logs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cayugalanguage.ca&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

The Bay, as it is known locally, provides some of the best trophy [[walleye]] angling in North America as well as most sport fish common to the great lakes. The bay is subject to [[algal bloom]]s in late summer.  [[Zebra mussel]]s as well as the other invasive species found in the [[Great Lakes]] are present.

The Quinte area played a vital role in bootlegging during [[Prohibition in the United States]], with large volumes of liquor being produced in the area, and shipped via boat on the bay to Lake Ontario finally arriving in [[New York (state)|New York State]] where it was distributed. Illegal sales of liquor accounted for many fortunes in and around [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]].

Tourism in the area is significant, especially in the summer months due to the Bay of Quinte and its fishing, local golf courses, provincial parks, and wineries.

==Geography==
[[File:BayofQuinteMap-1108.JPG|thumb|left|240px|Map of the Bay of Quinte Area (City of Belleville is shaded green)]]
The northern side of the bay is defined by Ontario's mainland, while the southern side follows the shore of the Prince Edward County headland. Beginning in the east with the outlet to [[Lake Ontario]], the bay runs west-southwest for {{convert|25|km}} to [[Picton, Ontario|Picton]] (although this section is also called Adolphus Reach), where it turns north-northwest for another {{convert|20|km}} as far as [[Deseronto, Ontario|Deseronto]]. From there it turns south-southwest again for another {{convert|40|km}}, running past [[Big Island (Bay of Quinte)|Big Island]] on the south and [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] on the north. The width of the bay rarely exceeds {{convert|2|km|spell=in}}. The bay ends at [[Trenton, Ontario|Trenton]] ([[Quinte West, Ontario|Quinte West]]) and the [[Trent River (Ontario)|Trent River]], both also on the north side. The [[Murray Canal]] has been cut through the &quot;Carrying Place&quot;, the few kilometres separating the end of the bay and Lake Ontario on the west side. The Trent River is part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], a canal connecting Lake Ontario to [[Lake Simcoe]] and then [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]].

There are several sub-bays off the Bay of Quinte, including Hay Bay, Big Bay, and Muscote Bay.
