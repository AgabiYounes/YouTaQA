'''Belle and Sebastian''' are a Scottish band formed in [[Glasgow]] in 1994.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1994–1998)===
Belle and Sebastian were formed in Glasgow, Scotland in 1994 by [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]] and [[Stuart David]], both of whom had enrolled at [[Stow College]]'s Beatbox programme for unemployed musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;a2x&quot;/&gt; Together, with music professor [[Alan Rankine]] (formerly of [[The Associates (band)|The Associates]]), they recorded some demos, which were picked up by the college's Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label, [[Electric Honey (label)|Electric Honey]]. As the band had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, Belle and Sebastian were allowed to record a full-length album, which was recorded mostly live over three days, entitled ''[[Tigermilk]]''. Murdoch once described the band as a &quot;product of botched capitalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;a2x&quot;/&gt; The band took their name from a short story Murdoch had written inspired by [[Belle and Sebastian (1965 TV series)|the television adaptation of]] the French novel ''[[Belle et Sébastien]]'' about a six-year-old boy and his dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;grd&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rock Formations&quot; &gt;{{Citation |last=Wilson |first=Dave |title=Rock Formations: Categorical Answers to How Band Names Were Formed |publisher=Cidermill Books |year=2005 |page=105 |isbn=0-9748483-5-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tigermilk'' was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed in [[Gramophone record|vinyl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grd&quot;/&gt; As of 2007, these original copies were valued up to £400.&lt;ref name=&quot;rse&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Pareles |first=John |title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=[[Fireside Publishing]] |year=2001 |page=[https://archive.org/details/rollingstoneency00holl/page/66 66] |isbn=0-7432-0120-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rollingstoneency00holl/page/66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiel |first=George |title=Tigermilk |url=http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |work=Eclectic Honey |accessdate=4 November 2007 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AShiel+intitle%3ATigermilk&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616110535/http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |archivedate = 16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Belle and Sebastian 2nd Melbourne show! |url=http://www.pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&amp;Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |work=PBS 106.7FM |accessdate=4 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916203738/http://pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&amp;Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show%21++ |archivedate=16 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm reception the album received inspired Murdoch and David to turn the band into a full-time project, recruiting [[Stevie Jackson]] (guitar and vocals), [[Isobel Campbell]] (cello/vocals), [[Chris Geddes]] (keys) and [[Richard Colburn]] (drums) to fill out the group.

After the success of the debut album, Belle and Sebastian were signed to [[Jeepster Records]] in August 1996 and ''[[If You're Feeling Sinister]]'', their second album, was released on 18 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; The album was named by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005 |url=https://www.spin.com/2005/06/100-greatest-albums-1985-2005/ |work=Spin |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804123605/https://www.spin.com/2005/06/100-greatest-albums-1985-2005/ |archivedate=4 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered the band's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;notebook&quot;/&gt; Just before the recording of ''Sinister'', [[Sarah Martin (musician)|Sarah Martin]] (violin/vocals) joined the band. Following this a series of EPs were released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hornby |first=Nick |title=Lazy Line Painter Jane |url=http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html |work=Salon |date=14 November 1997 |accessdate=5 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071210214633/http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html| archivedate= 10 December 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was ''[[Dog on Wheels]]'', which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and [[Mick Cooke]], who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at No.&amp;nbsp;59 in the UK singles chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Lazy Line Painter Jane]]'' EP followed in July. The track was recorded in the church where Murdoch lived&lt;ref name=&quot;lim&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Lim |first=Dennis |title=Winter of Their Youth |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-09-15/music/winter-of-their-youth/ |work=The Village Voice |date=15 September 1998 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features vocals from [[Monica Queen]]. The EP narrowly missed out on the UK top 40, peaking at No.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; The last of the 1997 EPs was October's ''[[3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light]]''. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and reached No.&amp;nbsp;32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

In 1999 the band was awarded with Best Newcomer (for their third album) at the [[BRIT Awards]], upsetting better-known acts such as [[Steps (band)|Steps]] and [[5ive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Robbie rules over Brits |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/brit_awards/280847.stm |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 1999 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the [[Bowlie Weekender]]. ''[[Tigermilk]]'' was also given a full release by [[Jeepster Records|Jeepster]] before the band started work on their next LP. The result was ''[[Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant]]'', which became the band's first top 10 album in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; A stand-alone single, &quot;[[Legal Man]]&quot;, reached No.&amp;nbsp;15 and gave them their first appearance on [[Top of the Pops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Urban |first=Andy |title=Side Project Becomes Full-Length Let Down |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/237 |work=Dusted Magazine |date=18 June 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the band's popularity and recognition was growing worldwide, their music began appearing in films and on television. The 2000 film ''[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]'' mentions the band and features a clip from the song &quot;[[Seymour Stein]]&quot; from ''The Boy with the Arab Strap''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zacharek |first=Stephanie |title=High Fidelity |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2000/03/31/high_fidelity/print.html |work=Salon |date=31 March 2000 |accessdate=5 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612101724/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/review/2000/03/31/high_fidelity/print.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the title track from ''Arab Strap'' was played over the end credits of the UK television series ''[[Teachers (UK TV series)|Teachers]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Virtue |first=Graeme |title=Jingle Book Belles |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031221/ai_n12585237 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210184147/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031221/ai_n12585237 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 December 2007 |work=Sunday Herald |date=21 December 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lyric &quot;Colour my life with the chaos of trouble&quot; from the song was quoted by one of the characters in the 2009 film ''[[(500) Days of Summer]]''.
