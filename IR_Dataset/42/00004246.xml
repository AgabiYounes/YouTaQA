The most popular commercial genre in Bollywood since the 1970s has been the [[masala film]], which freely mixes different genres including [[Action film|action]], [[Comedy film|comedy]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[Drama film|drama]] and [[melodrama]] along with [[Music of Bollywood|musical numbers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganti2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelmes, Jill.

Alongside commercial masala films, a distinctive genre of [[art film]]s known as [[parallel cinema]] has also existed, presenting realistic content and avoidance of musical numbers. In more recent years, the distinction between commercial masala and parallel cinema has been gradually blurring, with an increasing number of mainstream films adopting the conventions which were once strictly associated with parallel cinema.

According to [[OxfordDictionaries.com]], the word &quot;Bollywood&quot; originated during the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bollywood|publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|date=10 March 2019|accessdate=10 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Indian cinema overtook Hollywood in film production.

According to Madhava Prasad, author of ''Surviving Bollywood'', the term &quot;Bollywood&quot; was preceded by &quot;Tollywood&quot;, which then referred to the [[cinema of West Bengal]]. The Bengali film industry, based in [[Tollygunge]], [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], was referred to as &quot;Tollywood&quot; in a 1932 ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' article.&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0921374007088054|first=Bhaskar|last=Sarkar|title=The Melodramas of Globalization|journal=Cultural Dynamics|year=2008|volume=20|pages=31–51 [34]|quote=Madhava Prasad traces the origin of the term to a 1932 article in the ''[[American Cinematographer]]'' by Wilford E. Deming, an American engineer who apparently helped produce the first Indian sound picture. At this point, the Calcutta suburb of Tollygunge was the main center of film production in India. Deming refers to the area as Tollywood, since it already boasted two studios with 'several more projected' (Prasad, 2003) 'Tolly', rhyming with 'Holly', got hinged to 'wood' in the Anglophone Indian imagination, and came to denote the Calcutta studios and, by extension, the local film industry. Prasad surmises: 'Once Tollywood was made possible by the fortuitous availability of a half-rhyme, it was easy to clone new Hollywood babies by simply replacing the first letter' (Prasad, 2003).|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history (1890s–1940s)===
In 1897, a film presentation by Professor Stevenson featured a stage show at [[Calcutta]]'s Star Theatre. With Stevenson's encouragement and camera, [[Hiralal Sen]], an Indian photographer, made a film of scenes from that show, ''The Flower of Persia'' (1898).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hiralal2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = McKernan |first = Luke|date = 31 December 1996|url = http://www.victorian-cinema.net/sen.htm|title = Hiralal Sen (copyright British Film Institute)|accessdate =1 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wrestlers'' (1899) by [[H.

[[Dadasaheb Phalke]]'s silent ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913) is the first feature film made in India. By the 1930s, the industry was producing over 200 films per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gulzar |author2=Nihalani, Govind |author3=Chatterji, Saibal |title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica (India) Pvt Ltd.|isbn=978-81-7991-066-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian sound film, [[Ardeshir Irani]]'s ''[[Alam Ara]]'' (1931), was commercially successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060326/spectrum/main1.htm |title=Talking Images, 75 Years of Cinema |work=The Tribune |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a great demand for talkies and musicals, Bollywood and the other regional film industries quickly switched to sound films.

The 1930s and 1940s were tumultuous times; India was buffeted by the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], the [[Indian independence movement]], and the violence of the [[Partition of India|Partition]]. Although most Bollywood films were unabashedly [[escapism|escapist]], a number of filmmakers tackled tough social issues or used the struggle for Indian independence as a backdrop for their films.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica2&quot;/&gt; Irani made the first [[Hindi]] colour film, ''[[Kisan Kanya]]'', in 1937. The following year, he made a colour version of ''[[Mother India (book)|Mother India]]''. However, colour did not become a popular feature until the late 1950s. At this time, lavish romantic musicals and melodramas were cinematic staples.

Before the 1947 partition of India, which divided the country into the [[Republic of India]] and [[Pakistan]], the Bombay film industry (now called Bollywood) was closely linked to the [[Lahore]] film industry (now the [[Lollywood]] industry of [[Pakistani cinema]]); both produced films in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of northern and central India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghosh|first1=Partha S.|title=Migrants, Refugees and the Stateless in South Asia|date=2016|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|isbn=9789351508557|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X242DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another centre of Hindustani film production was the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] in [[Calcutta]], [[Bengal Presidency]] (now Kolkata, [[West Bengal]]), which produced Hindustani films and local [[Bengali language]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bose |first1=Mihir |title=From Midnight to Glorious Morning?: India Since Independence |date=2017 |publisher=[[Haus Publishing]] |isbn=9781910376706 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j9ssDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raju |first1=Zakir Hossain |title=Bangladesh Cinema and National Identity: In Search of the Modern? |date=2014 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781317601814 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXDfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many actors, filmmakers and musicians from the Lahore industry migrated to the Bombay industry during the 1940s, including actors [[K. L. Saigal]], [[Prithviraj Kapoor]], [[Dilip Kumar]] and [[Dev Anand]]; playback singers [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Noorjahan]], and [[Shamshad Begum]]. Around the same time, filmmakers and actors from the Calcutta film industry began migrating to Bombay; as a result, Bombay became the center of Hindustani film production in the Republic of India after partition. During this time period, actors such as [[V. Shantaram|Shantaram]], [[Paidi Jairaj]], and [[Motilal Rajvansh|Motilal]] have made their mark.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;/&gt; For decades after partition, the Bombay industry was dominated by actors, filmmakers and musicians from [[Bengal]], [[Punjab]] (particularly the present-day [[Pakistani Punjab]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–2010)|North-West Frontier Province]] (present-day [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-20440607|title=Bollywood's Shah Rukh Khan, Dilip Kumar and the Peshawar club|work=BBC News|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=22 June 2019|first=M.

The three most popular male Indian actors of the 1950s and 1960s were [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Raj Kapoor]], and [[Dev Anand]], each with a unique acting style. Kapoor adopted [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[The Tramp|tramp]]; Anand modeled himself on suave Hollywood stars like [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Cary Grant]], and Kumar pioneered a form of [[method acting]] which predated Hollywood method actors such as [[Marlon Brando]]. Kumar, who was described as &quot;the ultimate method actor&quot; by [[Satyajit Ray]], inspired future generations of Indian actors.

Both genres (masala and violent-crime films) are represented by the blockbuster ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan.

Hindi cinema experienced another period of stagnation during the late 1980s with a box-office decline due to increasing violence, a decline in musical quality, and a rise in video piracy. Middle-class family audiences began abandoning the cinema{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}. The turning point came with ''[[Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak]]'' (1988), directed by [[Mansoor Khan]], written and produced by his father [[Nasir Hussain]] and starring his cousin, [[Aamir Khan]], and [[Juhi Chawla]]. Its blend of youthfulness, family entertainment, [[emotional intelligence]] and strong melodies lured audiences back to the big screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chintamani&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Chintamani|first=Gautam|title=Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak: The Film That Revived Hindi Cinema|date=2016|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=9789352640980|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Qayamat_Se_Qayamat_Tak_The_Film_That_Rev.html?id=BZYOvgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ray|first=Kunal|title=Romancing the 1980s|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/Romancing-the-1980s/article16898867.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 December 2016|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It formed a new template for Bollywood musical romance films which defined 1990s Hindi cinema.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray&quot; /&gt;

Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake identify six major influences which have shaped Indian popular cinema:&lt;ref name=Gokulsing&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=Gokulsing|first=K.

* The branching structures of ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]], like the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''. Indian popular films often have plots which branch off into sub-plots.
* Ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], with its stylised nature and emphasis on spectacle in which [[Classical Indian music|music]], [[Classical Indian dance|dance]] and gesture combine &quot;to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience.&quot; Matthew Jones of [[De Montfort University]] also identifies the Sanskrit concept of ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'', or &quot;the emotions felt by the audience as a result of the actor’s presentation&quot;, as crucial to Bollywood films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bollywood, Rasa and Indian Cinema: Misconceptions, Meanings and Millionaire|author=Matthew Jones|journal=Visual Anthropology|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 2010|pages=33–43|doi=10.1080/08949460903368895|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Traditional [[theater of India|folk theater]], which became popular around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theater. Its regional traditions include the [[Jatra (theatre)|Jatra]] of [[Bengal]], the [[Ramlila]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]], and the [[Terukkuttu]] of [[Tamil Nadu]].
* [[Parsi theatre]], which &quot;blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of [[melodrama]]. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft.&quot;
* [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], where musicals were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s.
* Western musical television (particularly [[MTV]]), which has had an increasing influence since the 1990s. Its pace, camera angles, dance sequences and music may be seen in 2000s Indian films. An early example of this approach was [[Mani Ratnam]]'s ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' (1995).

Sharmistha Gooptu identifies [[Indo-Persian culture|Indo-Persian]]-[[Islamic culture]] as a major influence. During the early 20th century, [[Urdu]] was the [[lingua franca]] of popular cultural performance across northern India and established in popular [[performance art]] traditions such as [[nautch]] dancing, [[Urdu poetry]], and Parsi theater. Urdu and related [[Hindi dialects]] were the most widely understood across northern India, and Hindustani became the standard language of early Indian talkies. Films based on &quot;[[Persianate]] adventure-romances&quot; led to a popular genre of &quot;''[[Arabian Nights]]'' cinema&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gooptu|first=Sharmistha|title=Bengali Cinema: 'An Other Nation'|date=2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781136912177|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcUtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Bollywood==

Perhaps Bollywood's greatest influence has been on India's national identity, where (with the rest of Indian cinema) it has become part of the &quot;Indian story&quot;.&lt;ref name=desai2013&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-22335309|title= How Bollywood mirrors Indian realities|last1= Desai|first1= Lord Meghnad|date= 4 May 2013 |publisher= BBC|accessdate=15 January 2014|work= BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, Bollywood is often associated with India's national identity. According to economist and Bollywood biographer [[Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai|Meghnad Desai]], &quot;Cinema actually has been the most vibrant medium for telling [[India]] its own story, the story of its struggle for independence, its constant struggle to achieve national integration and to emerge as a global presence&quot;.&lt;ref name=desai2013 /&gt;

Scholar Brigitte Schulze has written that Indian films, most notably [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957), played a key role in shaping the [[Republic of India]]'s national identity in the early years after [[Indian independence movement|independence]] from the [[British Raj]]; the film conveyed a sense of [[Indian nationalism]] to urban and rural citizens alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulze |first1=Brigitte |title=The Cinematic 'Discovery of India': Mehboob's Re-Invention of the Nation in Mother India |journal=[[Social Scientist]] |date=September 2002 |volume=30 |issue=9/10 |pages=72 |doi=10.2307/3517959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood has long influenced Indian society and culture as the biggest entertainment industry; many of the country's musical, dancing, wedding and fashion trends are Bollywood-inspired.

During the 2000s, Bollywood began influencing [[musical film]]s in the Western world and was instrumental role in reviving the American musical film. [[Baz Luhrmann]] said that his musical film, ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), was inspired by Bollywood musicals;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aa030902a.htm|title=Baz Luhrmann Talks Awards and 'Moulin Rouge'}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film incorporated a Bollywood-style dance scene with a song from the film ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]''.

Indian film composer [[A. R. Rahman]] wrote the music for [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'', and a musical version of ''[[Hum Aapke Hain Koun]]'' was staged in London's West End. The Bollywood [[sports film]] ''[[Lagaan]]'' (2001) was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and two other Bollywood films (2002's ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]'' and 2006's ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'') were nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]].

[[File:Achhut Kanya.jpg|thumb|alt=A man and woman smile at each other in an old film|Melodrama and romance are common ingredients in Bollywood films, such as ''[[Achhut Kannya|Achhut Kanya]]'' (1936).]]

Bollywood films are primarily musicals, and are expected to have catchy song-and-dance numbers woven into the script. A film's success often depends on the quality of such musical numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Kalita, S. Mitra (2005). ''Suburban Sahibs: Three Immigrant Families And Their Passage from India to America''. [[Rutgers University Press]], p. 134. {{ISBN|0-8135-3318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film's music is often released before the film itself, increasing its audience.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Indian audiences expect value for money, and a good film is generally referred to as ''[[paisa]] vasool'', (literally &quot;money's worth&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gangadhar, V.|title=Moving with the times|date=13 April 2007|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/04/13/stories/2007041300860100.htm|accessdate=9 December 2009|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs, dances, love triangles, comedy and dare-devil thrills are combined in a three-hour show (with an intermission). These are called ''[[masala film]]s'', after the Hindi word for a spice mixture. Like ''masalas'', they are a mixture of action, comedy and romance; most have heroes who can fight off villains single-handedly. Bollywood plots have tended to be [[melodramatic]], frequently using formulaic ingredients such as star-crossed lovers, angry parents, love triangles, family ties, sacrifice, political corruption, kidnapping, villains, [[Hooker with a heart of gold|kind-hearted courtesans]], long-lost relatives and siblings, reversals of fortune and [[serendipity]].

[[Parallel cinema]] films, in and outside Bollywood, tended to be less popular at the box office. A large Indian diaspora in English-speaking countries and increased [[Western culture|Western]] influence in India have nudged Bollywood films closer to Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gupta, Suman |author2=Omoniyi, Tope |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nr2724-bOfMC&amp;pg=PA202 |year=2001|title=The Cultures of Economic Migration: International Perspectives|page=202|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-0-7546-7070-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to film critic Lata Khubchandani, &quot;Our earliest films ... had liberal doses of sex and kissing scenes in them. Strangely, it was after Independence the censor board came into being and so did all the strictures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ia.rediff.com/movies/1999/jun/21hem.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613111621/http://ia.rediff.com/movies/1999/jun/21hem.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2018-06-13 |title=Memories of another day |publisher=mid-day.com |first=Lata |last=Khubchandani }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bollywood plots feature Westernised urbanites dating and dancing in clubs rather than pre-arranged marriages, traditional Indian culture continues to exist outside the industry and is an element of resistance by some to Western influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;/&gt; Bollywood plays a major role, however, in [[fashion in India|Indian fashion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;/&gt; Studies have indicated that some people, unaware that changing fashion in Bollywood films is often influenced by globalisation, consider the clothes worn by Bollywood actors as authentically Indian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Migration&quot;/&gt;

Bollywood employs people from throughout India. It attracts thousands of aspiring actors and actresses hoping for a break in the industry. Models and beauty contestants, television actors, stage actors and ordinary people come to Mumbai with the hope of becoming a star. As in Hollywood, very few succeed. Since many Bollywood films are shot abroad, many foreign extras are employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where East meets West|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070630/saturday/main1.htm|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=9 August 2008|author=A. Chatterji, Shoma|work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few non-Indian actors are able to make a mark in Bollywood, although many have tried. There have been exceptions, however, and the hit film ''[[Rang De Basanti]]'' starred the English [[Alice Patten]]. ''[[Kisna]]'', ''[[Lagaan]]'', and ''[[The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey]]'' also featured foreign actors, and Australian-born actress [[Emma Brown Garett]] has starred in a few Indian films.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Bollywood can be insular, and relatives of film-industry figures have an edge in obtaining coveted roles in films or being part of a film crew. However, industry connections are no guarantee of a long career: competition is fierce, and film-industry scions will falter if they do not succeed at the box office. Stars such as [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Rajesh Khanna]], [[Rishi Kapoor]], [[Anil Kapoor]], [[Sunny Deol]], [[Sridevi]], [[Madhuri Dixit]] and [[Shah Rukh Khan]] lacked show-business connections.

==Dialogues and lyrics==
{{See also|Bombay Hindi|Tapori (word)}}
Film scripts (known as dialogues in [[Indian English]]) and their song lyrics are often written by different people. Scripts are usually written in an unadorned Hindustani, which would be understood by the largest possible audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gulzar |author2=Nihalani, Govind |author3=Chatterji, Saibal |title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica (India) Pvt Ltd.|isbn=978-81-7991-066-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC|pages=10–18, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood films tend to use a [[colloquial]] register of Hindustani, mutually intelligible by Hindi- and Urdu-speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;scienceandmediamuseum&quot;/&gt; Most of the classic scriptwriters of what is known as Hindi cinema, including [[Salim-Javed]], [[Gulzar]], [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]], [[Inder Raj Anand]], [[Rahi Masoom Raza]] and [[Wajahat Mirza]], primarily wrote in Urdu. Salim-Javed wrote in [[Urdu script]], which was then transcribed by an assistant into [[Devanagari]] script so Hindi readers could read the Urdu dialogues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akhtar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aḵẖtar|first1=Jāvīd|authorlink1=Javed Akhtar|last2=Kabir|first2=Nasreen Munni|title=Talking Films: Conversations on Hindi Cinema with Javed Akhtar|date=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195664621|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JILAQAAMAAJ|quote=JA: I write dialogue in Urdu, but the action and descriptions are in English.

Not only me, I think most of the writers working in this so-called Hindi cinema write in Urdu: [[Gulzar]], or [[Rajinder Singh Bedi]] or [[Inder Raj Anand]] or [[Rahi Masoom Raza]] or [[Wajahat Mirza|Vahajat Mirza]], who wrote dialogue for films like ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' and ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' and ''[[Mother India]]''. So most dialogue-writers and most song-writers are from the Urdu discipline, even today.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, the Urdu writers and screenwriters [[Krishan Chander]] and [[Ismat Chughtai]] said that &quot;more than seventy-five per cent of films are made in Urdu&quot; but were categorised as Hindi films by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;film-world&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Film World|journal=Film World|year=1974|volume=10|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHlTAAAAYAAJ|quote=I feel that the Government should eradicate the age-old evil of certifying Urdu films as Hindi ones. It is a known fact that Urdu has been willingly accepted and used by the film industry. Two eminent Urdu writers [[Krishan Chander]] and [[Ismat Chughtai]] have said that &quot;more than seventy-five per cent of films are made in Urdu.&quot; It is a pity that although Urdu is freely used in films, the producers in general mention the language of the film as &quot;Hindi&quot; in the application forms supplied by the Censor Board. It is a gross misrepresentation and unjust to the people who love Urdu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urdu poetry]] has strongly influenced [[Bollywood songs]], whose lyrics also draw from the [[ghazal]] tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dwyer&quot;/&gt;

Some films have used [[Hindi dialects|regional dialects]] to evoke a village setting, or archaic Urdu in [[Medieval India|medieval]] [[historical films]]. In her book, ''The Cinematic ImagiNation'', Jyotika Virdi wrote about the presence of Urdu in Hindi films: &quot;Urdu is often used in film titles, screenplay, lyrics, the language of love, war, and martyrdom.&quot; Virdi notes that although Urdu was widely used in classic Hindi cinema decades after partition because it was widely taught in pre-[[Partition of India|partition]] India, its use has declined in modern Hindi cinema: &quot;The extent of Urdu used in commercial Hindi cinema has not been stable ... the decline of Urdu is mirrored in Hindi films ... It is true that many Urdu words have survived and have become part of Hindi cinema's popular vocabulary. But that is as far as it goes ... For the most part, popular Hindi cinema has forsaken the florid Urdu that was part of its extravagance and retained a 'residual' Urdu&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Virdi, Jyotika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8PKObcYMDIC&amp;pg=PA19|title=The cinematic imagiNation (sic): Indian popular films as social history|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780813531915}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Urdu continues to be used in Bollywood films for dialogues and (particularly) songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Soulful Urdu Words Used In Bollywood That You May Be Unaware Of|url=http://www.news18.com/news/lifestyle/soulful-urdu-words-used-in-bollywood-that-you-may-be-unaware-of-1482243.html|work=[[CNN-News18]]|agency=[[CNN International]]|date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary mainstream films also use English; according to the article &quot;Bollywood Audiences Editorial&quot;, &quot;English has begun to challenge the ideological work done by Urdu.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Jigna, Dudrah, Rajinder, Rai, Amit, &quot;Bollywood Audiences Editorial&quot;, ''South Asian Popular Culture'' (October 2005), Vol. 3, Issue 2, pp. 79–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Some film scripts are first written in [[Latin script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Us Salam, Ziya|title=Assault of the mixed doubles|date=12 August 2007|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/08/12/stories/2007081250070400.htm|accessdate=9 December 2009|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters may shift from one language to the other to evoke a particular atmosphere (for example, English in a business setting and Hindi in an informal one). The blend of Hindi, Urdu and English sometimes heard in modern Bollywood films, known as [[Hinglish]], has become increasingly common.&lt;ref name=&quot;scienceandmediamuseum&quot;/&gt;

Cinematic language (in dialogues or lyrics) is often melodramatic, invoking God, family, mother, duty, and self-sacrifice. Song lyrics are often about love. Bollywood song lyrics (especially in older films) frequently use the poetic vocabulary of court Urdu, with a number of [[Persian language|Persian]] loanwords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganti2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Tejaswini Ganti|title=Bollywood: a guidebook to popular Hindi cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GTEa93azj9EC|accessdate=25 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28854-5|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source for love lyrics in films such as ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]]'' and ''[[Lagaan]]'' is the long [[Hindu]] tradition of poetry about the loves of [[Krishna]], [[Radha]], and the [[gopi]]s.

Music directors often prefer working with certain lyricists, and the lyricist and composer may be seen as a team. This phenomenon has been compared to the pairs of American composers and songwriters who created classic Broadway musicals.

==Sound==

Sound in early Bollywood films was usually not recorded on location ([[sync sound]]).

==Song and dance==

Bollywood film music is called ''[[filmi]]'' (from the Hindi &quot;of films&quot;). Bollywood songs were introduced with Ardeshir Irani's ''Alam Ara'' (1931) song, &quot;De De Khuda Ke Naam pay pyaare&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganesh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bollywood Melodies: A History|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=lmrSLuBwbKkC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=2|first=Ganesh|last=Anantharaman|isbn=9780143063407|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Books India|accessdate=13 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood songs are generally pre-recorded by professional playback singers, with the actors then [[lip sync]]ing the words to the song on-screen (often while dancing). Although most actors are good dancers, few are also singers; a notable exception was [[Kishore Kumar]], who starred in several major films during the 1950s while having a rewarding career as a playback singer. [[Kundan Lal Saigal|K. L. Saigal]], Suraiyya, and [[Noor Jehan]] were known as singers and actors, and some actors in the last thirty years have sung one or more songs themselves.

Songs can make and break a film, determining whether it will be a flop or a hit: &quot;Few films without successful musical tracks, and even fewer without any songs and dances, succeed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/17513050903428117|title=&quot;I Need an Indian Touch&quot;: Glocalization and Bollywood Films|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|volume=3|pages=1–19|year=2010|last1=Rao|first1=Shakuntala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization has changed Bollywood music, with lyrics an increasing mix of Hindi and English. Global trends such as salsa, pop and hip hop have influenced the music heard in Bollywood films.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Playback singers are featured in the opening credits, and have [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] who will see an otherwise-lackluster film to hear their favourites. Notable Bollywood singers are [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Geeta Dutt]], [[Shamshad Begum]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Sadhana Sargam]] , [[Alka Yagnik]] and [[Shreya Goshal]] (female), and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Manna Dey]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Kumar Sanu]], [[Udit Narayan]] and [[Sonu Nigam]] (male). Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi have been considered the finest singers of Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar (who has recorded thousands of songs for Indian films in her six-decade career). Composers of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. [[Remix]]ing of film songs with modern rhythms is common, and producers may release remixed versions of some of their films' songs with the films' soundtrack albums.

Dancing in Bollywood films, especially older films, is modeled on Indian dance: classical dance, dances of north-Indian courtesans ([[tawaif]]) or [[folk dance]]s. In modern films, Indian dance blends with Western dance styles as seen on MTV or in Broadway musicals; Western pop and classical-dance numbers are commonly seen side-by-side in the same film. The hero (or heroine) often performs with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films contain unrealistically-quick shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in natural surroundings or architecturally-grand settings.

Songs typically comment on the action taking place in the film. A song may be worked into the plot, so a character has a reason to sing. It may externalise a character's thoughts, or presage an event in the film (such as two characters falling in love). The songs are often referred to as a &quot;dream sequence&quot;, with things happening which would not normally happen in the real world. Song and dance scenes were often filmed in [[Kashmir]] but, due to political unrest in Kashmir since the end of the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2935951.stm BBC News: Kashmir beckons Bollywood] (10 April 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; they have been shot in western Europe (particularly [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/Htmls/Ausstellungen/Archiv/2002/Bollywood/E_Bollywood.html Bollywood – The Indian Cinema and Switzerland (2002)]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118005321/http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/Htmls/Ausstellungen/Archiv/2002/Bollywood/E_Bollywood.html |date=18 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/14/stories/2008021459770700.htm The Hindu: Bollywood boosts Austria's tourism potential].

Contemporary Bollywood dancers include [[Madhuri Dixit]], [[Hrithik Roshan]], [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]], [[Sridevi]], [[Meenakshi Seshadri]], [[Malaika Arora Khan]], [[Shahid Kapoor]], [[Katrina Kaif]] and [[Tiger Shroff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Top 10 Best Dancers in Bollywood |url = https://mashtos.com/bollywood-dancers/|website = Mashtos|accessdate = 2019-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older dancers include [[Helen (actress)|Helen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Helen: Bollywood's Queen of Dance|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ben-mirza/helen-bollywoods-queen-of_b_2213570.html|website = The Huffington Post UK|accessdate = 2015-12-05|language = en-GB|date = 2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known for her cabaret numbers), [[Madhubala]], [[Vyjanthimala]], [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]], [[Hema Malini]], [[Mumtaz (actress)|Mumtaz]], [[Cuckoo Moray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Tragic ending of Cuckoo Moore – Helen remembers Cuckoo|url = http://cineplot.com/the-tragic-ending-of-cuckoo-moore-helen-remembers-cuckoo/|website = cineplot.com|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parveen Babi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Happy Birthday Parveen Babi|url = http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/happy-birthday-parveen-babi/|website = The Indian Express|date = 2014-04-04|accessdate = 2015-12-05|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165452/http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/happy-birthday-parveen-babi/|archive-date = 8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waheeda Rehman|, Waheeda Rahman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = World Dance Day: Top 6 dancing queens of Bollywood!|url = http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/celebrity/world-dance-day-top-6-dancing-queens-of-bollywood_1586532.html|website = Zee News|accessdate = 2015-12-05|date = 2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meena Kumari]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 'Her Story' {{!}} Vinod Mehta {{!}} Aug 01,2013|url = http://www.outlookindia.com/article/her-story/287253|website = www.outlookindia.com|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shammi Kapoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Shammi Kapoor|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8705192/Shammi-Kapoor.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-05|date = 2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bollywood producers have been releasing a film's soundtrack (as tapes or CDs) before the film's release, hoping that the music will attract audiences; a soundtrack is often more popular than its film. Some producers also release music videos, usually (but not always) with a song from the film.

==Finances==
Bollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to {{INR}}1 billion (about US$20&amp;nbsp;million). The science-fiction film ''[[Ra.One]]'' was made on a budget of {{INR}}1.35 billion (about $27 million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Times of India |author2=movie report |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-06/special-report/30366066_1_ke-liye-shah-rukh-khan-big-stars|accessdate=12 December 2011|work=The Times of India|title=It took me 20 years to be an overnight success: Shah Rukh Khan|date=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Set (drama)|Sets]], costumes, special effects and [[cinematography]] were less than world-class, with some notable exceptions, until the mid-to-late 1990s. As Western films and television are more widely distributed in India, there is increased pressure for Bollywood films to reach the same production levels (particularly in action and special effects). Recent Bollywood films, like ''[[Krrish]]'' (2006), have employed international technicians such as Hong Kong-based action choreographer [[Tony Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The increasing accessibility of professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, have seen an increase in action and science-fiction films.

Since overseas scenes are attractive at the box office, Mumbai film crews are filming in Australia, Canada, [[New Zealand]], the United Kingdom, the United States, [[Europe]] and elsewhere. Indian producers have also obtained funding for big-budget films shot in India, such as ''[[Lagaan]]'' and ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]''.

Funding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large [[Movie studio|studios]]. Although Indian banks and financial institutions had been forbidden from lending to film studios, the ban has been lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/mar/31sush.htm |title=I &amp; B Ministry will help film industry |publisher=Rediff |date=31 March 2001 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finances are not regulated; some funding comes from illegitimate sources such as the Mumbai underworld, which is known to influence several prominent film personalities. Mumbai organised-crime hitmen shot [[Rakesh Roshan]], a film director and father of star [[Hrithik Roshan]], in January 2000. In 2001, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] seized all prints of ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'' after the film was found to be funded by members of the Mumbai underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Singh, Vijay|title=Bharat Shah sentenced, but won't have to spend time in prison|date=1 October 2003|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/oct/01shah.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem facing Bollywood is widespread [[copyright infringement]] of its films. Often, bootleg [[DVD#DVD Video|DVD]] copies of movies are available before they are released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is an established small-scale industry in parts of south and [[southeast Asia]]. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. In addition to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst portions of the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. Bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Pakistani government has banned their sale, distribution and telecast. Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by small cable-TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores, run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK, regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance; consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to industry losses.

Satellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now, fewer do. Most Bollywood producers make money, however, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue (including the sale of ancillary rights). There are increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly being noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films. In 2002, Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had a total revenue (including theatre tickets, DVDs and television) of $1.3 billion; Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets, and had a total revenue of $51 billion.

==Advertising==
A number of Indian artists hand-painted movie billboards and posters. [[M. F. Husain]] painted film posters early in his career; human labour was found to be cheaper than printing and distributing publicity material.&lt;ref name=&quot;paint&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ahmedabad-times/a-different-canvas/articleshow/1027777.cms|title=A different canvas|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=21 February 2005|accessdate=21 November 2008|author=Ramanan, Manju}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the large, ubiquitous billboards in India's major cities are now created with computer-printed vinyl.

Releasing film music, or music videos, before a film's release may be considered a form of advertising. A popular tune is believed to help attract audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Skelton, Tracey |author2=Allen, Tim |title=Culture and Global Change|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-13917-5|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood publicists use the Internet as a venue for advertising. Most bigger-budget films have a websites on which audiences can view trailers, stills and information on the story, cast, and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-01-31/news-interviews/27264956_1_small-budget-movies-producers-and-distributors-film|title=Bollywood wakes up to the power of Web|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=31 January 2003|accessdate=21 November 2008|author=Ferrao, Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollywood is also used to advertise other products.

=={{anchor|International shoots}}International filming==
Bollywood's increasing use of international settings such as Switzerland, London, Paris, New York, Mexico, Brazil and Singapore does not necessarily represent the people and cultures of those locales. Contrary to these spaces and geographies being filmed as they are, they are actually Indianised by adding Bollywood actors and Hindi speaking extras to them. While immersing in Bollywood films, viewers get to see their local experiences duplicated in different locations around the world.

According to Shakuntala Rao, &quot;Media representation can depict India's shifting relation with the world economy, but must retain its 'Indianness' in moments of dynamic hybridity&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; &quot;Indianness&quot; (cultural identity) poses a problem with Bollywood's popularity among varied diaspora audiences, but gives its domestic audience a sense of uniqueness from other immigrant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1080/10304312.2013.766309|title=Imagining global India: Bollywood's transnational appeal|journal=Continuum|volume=27|issue=2|pages=254–266|year=2013|last1=O'Neill|first1=Patricia}}

==Awards==
The [[Filmfare Awards]] are some of the most prominent awards given to Hindi films in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1367349,prtpage-1.cms |title=Filmfare Awards gets new sponsor |work=The Times of India |accessdate=12 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220033512/http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1367349%2Cprtpage-1.cms |archivedate=20 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian screen magazine ''[[Filmfare]]'' began the awards in 1954 (recognising the best films of 1953), and they were originally known as the Clare Awards after the magazine's editor. Modeled on the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]' poll-based merit format, individuals may vote in separate categories. A dual voting system was developed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnnworld.com/filmfare.php |title=Diaspora News &amp; Network Ltd |publisher=Dnnworld.com |date=4 March 2005 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Film Awards]] were also introduced in 1954. The Indian government has sponsored the awards, given by its [[Directorate of Film Festivals]] (DFF), since 1973. The DFF screens Bollywood films, films from the other regional movie industries, and independent/art films. The awards are made at an annual ceremony presided over by the president of India. Unlike the Filmfare Awards, which are chosen by the public and a committee of experts, the National Film Awards are decided by a government panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bollywoodsoundtracks.com/html/filmfareawards.htm Filmfare Awards Complete Winners List – BollywoodSoundtracks.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703214358/http://www.bollywoodsoundtracks.com/html/filmfareawards.htm |date=3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other awards ceremonies for Hindi films in India are the [[Screen Awards]] (begun in 1995) and the [[Stardust Awards]], which began in 2003. The [[International Indian Film Academy Awards]] (begun in 2000) and the [[Zee Cine Awards]], begun in 1998, are held abroad in a different country each year.

====Southeast Asia====
Bollywood films are popular in [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. The three Khans are very popular in the [[Malay world]], including [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]]. The films are also fairly popular in [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yogendra Singh|title=Bollywood in Southeast Asia|publisher=[[Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies]]|date=19 November 2008|url=http://www.ipcs.org/article_details.php?articleNo=2734|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India has [[Indosphere|cultural ties]] with Indonesia, and Bollywood films were introduced to the country at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945. The &quot;angry young man&quot; films of [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Salim-Javed]] were popular during the 1970s and 1980s before Bollywood's popularity began gradually declining in the 1980s and 1990s. It experienced an Indonesian revival with the release of Shah Rukh Khan's ''[[Kuch Kuch Hota Hai]]'' (1998) in 2001, which was a bigger box-office success in the country than ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997). Bollywood has had a strong presence in Indonesia since then, particularly Shah Rukh Khan films such as ''[[Mohabbatein]]'' (2000), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001), ''[[Kal Ho Naa Ho]]'', ''[[Chalte Chalte (2003 film)|Chalte Chalte]]'' and ''[[Koi...&amp;nbsp;Mil Gaya]]'' (all 2003), and ''[[Veer-Zaara]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tambunan|first=Shuri Mariasih Gietty|title=Bollywood in Indonesia: The Kuch Kuch Hota Hai effect|url=http://southasia.oneworld.net/features/bollywood-in-indonesia-the-kuch-kuch-hota-hai-effect|journal=Owsa|date=23 December 2012|access-date=30 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130204242/http://southasia.oneworld.net/features/bollywood-in-indonesia-the-kuch-kuch-hota-hai-effect|archive-date=30 January 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====East Asia====
Some Bollywood films have been widely appreciated in [[China]], [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]. Several Hindi films have been commercially successful in Japan, including [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aan]]'' (1952, starring [[Dilip Kumar]]) and [[Aziz Mirza]]'s ''[[Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman]]'' (1992, starring [[Shah Rukh Khan]]).

When ''3 Idiots'' was released in China, China was the [[Aamir Khan|world's]] 15th-largest film market (partly due to its widespread pirate [[DVD]] distribution at the time). The pirate market introduced the film to Chinese audiences, however, and it became a [[cult hit]]. According to the [[Douban]] film-review site, ''3 Idiots'' is China's 12th-most-popular film of all time; only one domestic Chinese film (''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'') ranks higher, and [[Aamir Khan]] acquired a large Chinese fan base as a result.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes-china&quot;/&gt; After ''3 Idiots'', several of Khan's other films (including 2007's ''[[Taare Zameen Par]]'' and 2008's ''[[Ghajini (2008 film)|Ghajini]]'') also developed cult followings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Aamir Khan on what it takes to crack China's box office|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/india-bollywood-aamir-khan-dangal-interv/qa-aamir-khan-on-what-it-takes-to-crack-chinas-box-office-idUSKBN18R0RQ|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to diplomat Ashok Sharma, who served in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]],
{{quote|The popularity of Bollywood in the CIS dates back to the Soviet days when the films from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and other Western cinema centers were banned in the Soviet Union. As there was no means of other cheap entertainment, the films from Bollywood provided the Soviets a cheap source of entertainment as they were supposed to be non-controversial and non-political. In addition, the Soviet Union was recovering from the onslaught of the Second World War. The films from India, which were also recovering from the disaster of partition and the struggle for freedom from colonial rule, were found to be a good source of providing hope with entertainment to the struggling masses. The aspirations and needs of the people of both countries matched to a great extent. These films were dubbed in Russian and shown in theatres throughout the Soviet Union. The films from Bollywood also strengthened family values, which was a big factor for their popularity with the government authorities in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles/Indian-films.asp |title=Promoting Bollywood Abroad Will Help to Promote India |last=Ashreena |first=Tanya |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003948/http://www.chillibreeze.com/articles/Indian-films.asp |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the collapse of the Soviet film-distribution system, Hollywood filled the void in the Russian film market and Bollywood's market share shrank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanskar Shrivastava&quot;/&gt; A 2007 [[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] report noted a renewed interest in Bollywood by young Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/11895 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626020120/http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/11895 |title=RussiaToday Features: Bollywood challenges Hollywood in Russia|archivedate=26 June 2008|date=3 August 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]] has a large following. He was introduced to Polish audiences with the 2005 release of ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and his other films, including ''[[Dil Se..]]'' (1998), ''[[Main Hoon Na]]'' (2004) and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006), became hits in the country.

==={{anchor|Sub-Saharan Africa and Horn of Africa}}Africa===
Hindi films were originally distributed to some parts of Africa by Lebanese businessmen, and ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957) continued to be screened in [[Nigeria]] decades after its release. Indian movies have influenced [[Hausa people|Hausa]] clothing, songs have been covered by Hausa singers, and stories have influenced Nigerian novelists. Stickers of Indian films and stars decorate taxis and buses in Nigeria's [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]], and posters of Indian films hang on the walls of tailoring shops and mechanics' garages. Unlike Europe and North America, where Indian films cater to the expatriate marke, Bollywood films became popular in West Africa despite the lack of a significant Indian audience. One possible explanation is cultural similarity: the wearing of turbans, animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, and traditional wedding celebrations. Within Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show &quot;respect&quot; toward women; Hollywood movies were seen as having &quot;no shame&quot;. In Indian movies, women are modestly dressed; men and women rarely kiss and there is no [[nudity]], so the films are said to &quot;have culture&quot; which Hollywood lacks. The latter &quot;don't base themselves on the problems of the people&quot;; Indian films are based on socialist values and the reality of developing countries emerging from years of colonialism. Indian movies permitted a new youth culture without &quot;becoming Western.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;samar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Larkin |first=Brian |url=http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=21 |title=Bollywood Comes To Nigeria |publisher=Samarmagazine.org |date=31 August 2002 |accessdate=12 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731164710/http://www.samarmagazine.org/archive/article.php?id=21 |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Indian film shot in Mauritius was ''[[Souten]]'', starring [[Rajesh Khanna]], in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.silverdollarproduction.com/film-shooting.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220145113/http://www.silverdollarproduction.com/film-shooting.html |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], film imports from India were watched by [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rajinder&quot;/&gt; Several Bollywood figures have travelled to Africa for films and off-camera projects. ''[[Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav]]'' (2005) was filmed in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Balchand, K.|title=Lalu Prasad, at home|date=26 September 2004|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/09/26/stories/2004092600682000.htm|accessdate=9 December 2009|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dil Jo Bhi Kahey...]]'' (2005) was also filmed almost entirely in [[Mauritius]], which has a large ethnic-Indian population.

Bollywood, however, seems to be diminishing in popularity in Africa. New Bollywood films are more sexually explicit and violent. Nigerian viewers observed that older films (from the 1950s and 1960s) had more culture and were less Westernised.&lt;ref name=&quot;samar&quot;/&gt; The old days of India avidly &quot;advocating decolonization ... and India's policy was wholly influenced by his missionary zeal to end racial domination and discrimination in the African territories&quot; were replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/2007/06/13/bollywood_in_africa/ |title=Bollywood in Africa – Is it getting too Western? – How the World Works |work=Salon |date=13 June 2007 |accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Nollywood]] ([[West Africa]]'s film industry) has also contributed to the declining popularity of Bollywood films, as sexualised Indian films became more like American films.

==Plagiarism==
Pressured by rushed production schedules and small budgets, some Bollywood writers and musicians have been known to [[plagiarism|plagiarise]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Ideas, plot lines, tunes or riffs have been copied from other Indian film industries or foreign films (including Hollywood and other [[Asian cinema|Asian films]]) without acknowledging the source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Plagiarism-issue-jolts-Bollywood/articleshow/46715385.cms |title=Plagiarism issue jolts Bollywood. |last=Shedde |first=Meenakshi |date=18 May 2003 |work=The Times of India |access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1990s, plagiarism occurred with impunity. [[Copyright]] enforcement was lax in India, and few actors or directors saw an official contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayres&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ayres, Alyssa |author2=Oldenburg, Philip |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gi7w-vTfELsC&amp;pg=PA174|title=India briefing: takeoff at last|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2005|page=174|isbn=978-0-7656-1593-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindi film industry was not widely known to non-Indian audiences (except in the Soviet states), who would be unaware that their material had been copied.

A commonly-reported justification for plagiarism in Bollywood is that cautious producers want to remake popular Hollywood films in an Indian context. Although screenwriters generally produce original scripts, many are rejected due to uncertainty about whether a film will be successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times plagiarism&quot; /&gt; Poorly-paid screenwriters have also been criticised for a lack of creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2003/08/03/stories/2003080300090400.htm|title=Cloning Hollywood|date=3 August 2003|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=14 April 2009|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some filmmakers see plagiarism in Bollywood as an integral part of globalisation, with which Western (particularly American) culture is embedding itself into Indian culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;/&gt; [[Vikram Bhatt]], director of ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'' (a remake of ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'') and ''[[Kasoor]]'' (a remake of ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]''), has spoken about the influence of American culture and Bollywood's desire to produce box-office hits based along the same lines: &quot;Financially, I would be more secure knowing that a particular piece of work has already done well at the box office. Copying is endemic everywhere in India. Our TV shows are adaptations of American programmes. We want their films, their cars, their planes, their [[Diet Coke]]s and also their attitude. The American way of life is creeping into our culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;/&gt; According to [[Mahesh Bhatt]], &quot;If you hide the source, you're a genius. There's no such thing as originality in the creative sphere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cloning&quot;/&gt;

Hindi film songs are present in Hindi cinema right from the first sound film ''[[Alam Ara]]'' (1931) by [[Ardeshir Irani]] which featured seven songs. This was closely followed by ''Shirheen Farhad'' (1931) by [[Jamshedji Framji Madan]], also by Madan, which had as many as 42 song sequences strung together in the manner of an opera, and later by ''Indra Sabha'' which had as many as 69 song sequences. However, the practice subsided and subsequent films usually featured between six and ten songs in each production.

Right from the advent of Indian cinema in 1931, musicals with song numbers have been a regular feature in Indian cinema. In 1934 Hindi film songs began to be recorded on gramophones and later, played on radio channels, giving rise to a new form of mass entertainment in India which was responsive to popular demand. Within the first few years itself, Hindi cinema had produced a variety of films which easily categorised into genres such as &quot;historicals&quot;, &quot;mythologicals&quot;, &quot;devotional, &quot;fantasy&quot; etc. but each having songs embedded in them such that it is incorrect to classify them as &quot;musicals&quot;.

The Hindi song was such an integral features of Hindi mainstream cinema, besides other characteristics, that post-independence alternative cinema, of which the [[Satyajit Ray filmography|films]] of [[Satyajit Ray]] are an example, discarded the song and dance motif in its effort to stand apart from mainstream cinema.

The Hindi film song now began to make its presence felt as a predominating characteristic in the culture of the nation and began to assume roles beyond the limited purview of cinema. In multi-cultural India, as per film historian Partha Chatterjee, &quot;the Hindi film song cut through all the language barriers in India, to engage in lively communication with the nation where more than twenty languages are spoken and ... scores of dialects exist&quot;. Bollywood music has drawn its inspiration from numerous traditional sources such as ''[[Ramleela]]'', ''[[nautanki]]'', ''[[tamasha]]'' and [[Parsi theatre]], as well as from the West, Pakistan, and other Indic musical subcultures.

For over five decades, these songs formed the staple of popular music in South Asia and along with Hindi films, was an important cultural export to most countries around Asia and wherever the Indian diaspora had spread. The spread was galvanised by the advent of cheap plastic tape cassettes which were produced in the millions till the industry crashed in 2000. Even today Hindi film songs are available on radio, on television, as live music by performers, and on media, both old and new such as cassette tapes, compact disks and DVDs and are easily available, both legally and illegally, on the internet.

The Pakistani [[Qawwali]] musician [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] had a big impact on Bollywood music, inspiring numerous Indian musicians working in Bollywood, especially during the 1990s. However, there were many instances of Indian music directors plagiarising Khan's music to produce hit [[filmi]] songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nusrat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011230173145/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 December 2001|title=The stilled voice |author=Amit Baruah, R.

He should at least respect my religious songs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff-khan&quot;/&gt;

Bollywood soundtracks also plagiarised [[Guinea]]n singer [[Mory Kanté]], particularly his 1987 album ''Akwaba Beach''. His song, &quot;Tama&quot;, inspired two [[Bollywood songs]]: [[Bappi Lahiri]]'s &quot;Tamma Tamma&quot; in ''[[Thanedaar]]'' (1990) and &quot;Jumma Chumma&quot; in [[Laxmikant-Pyarelal]]'s soundtrack for ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'' (1991).
