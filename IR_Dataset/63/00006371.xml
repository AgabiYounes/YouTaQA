'''Centaurus''' {{IPAc-en|s|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|ɔːr|ə|s}} is a bright constellation in the [[southern sky]]. One of the [[88 modern constellations by area|largest constellations]], Centaurus was included among the 48 [[constellation]]s listed by the 2nd-century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In [[Greek mythology]], Centaurus represents a [[centaur]]; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the [[zodiac]]: [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]). Notable stars include [[Alpha Centauri]], the nearest star system to the [[Solar System]], its neighbour in the sky [[Beta Centauri]], and [[V766 Centauri]], one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains [[Omega Centauri]], the brightest [[globular cluster]] as visible from Earth and the largest identified in the Milky Way, possibly a remnant of a dwarf galaxy.
==Notable features==

===Stars===
Centaurus contains several very bright stars. Its alpha and beta stars are used as &quot;pointer stars&quot; to help observers find the constellation [[Crux]]. Centaurus has 281 stars above magnitude 6.5, meaning that they are visible to the unaided eye, the most of any constellation. [[Alpha Centauri]], the closest star system to the Sun, has a high [[proper motion]]; it will be a mere half-degree from [[Beta Centauri]] in approximately 4000 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}
 
[[Alpha Centauri]] is a [[triple star system]], a binary around which orbits [[Proxima Centauri]], currently the nearest star to the Sun. Traditionally called Rigil Kentaurus or Toliman, meaning &quot;foot of the centaur&quot;, the system has an overall magnitude of −0.28 and is 4.4 [[light-year]]s from Earth. The primary and secondary are both yellow-hued stars; the first is of magnitude −0.01 and the second: 1.35. Proxima, the tertiary star, is a [[red dwarf]] of magnitude 11.0; it appears almost 2 degrees away from the close pairing of Alpha and has a period of approximately one million years. Also a [[flare star]], Proxima has minutes-long outbursts where it brightens by over a magnitude. The Alpha couple revolve in 80-year periodicity and will next appear closest as seen from Earth's telescopes in 2037 and 2038, together as they appear to the naked eye they present the [[list of brightest stars|third-brightest &quot;star&quot;]] in the night sky.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}
 
One other [[apparent magnitude|first magnitude]] star [[Beta Centauri]] is in the constellation in a position beyond Proxima and toward the narrow axis of [[Crux]], thus with Alpha forming a far-south limb of the constellation. Also called Hadar and Agena, it is a double star; the primary is a blue-hued giant star of magnitude 0.6, 525 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 4.0 and has a modest separation, appearing only under intense magnification due to its distance.
 
The next bright object is [[Gamma Centauri]], for this reason intuitively named Gamma, another [[binary star]] which appears to the naked eye at magnitude 2.2. The primary and secondary are both blue-white hued stars of magnitude 2.9; their period is 84 years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}
 
Centaurus also has many dimmer double stars and binary stars. [[3 Centauri]] is a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 4.5 and a secondary of magnitude 6.0. The primary is 344 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}
 
Centaurus is home to many [[variable stars]]. [[R Centauri]] is a [[Mira variable]] star with a minimum magnitude of 11.8 and a maximum magnitude of 5.3; it is about 1,250 light-years from Earth and has a period of 18 months.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}} [[V810 Centauri]] is a [[semiregular variable]].
 
[[BPM 37093]] is a [[white dwarf]] star whose [[carbon]] atoms are thought to have formed a crystalline structure. Since [[diamond]] also consists of carbon arranged in a crystalline lattice (though of a different configuration), scientists have nicknamed this star &quot;Lucy&quot; after the Beatles song &quot;''[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.asp?newsID=993|title=Discovery of largest known diamond|date=February 15, 2004|work=AZoM|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[PDS 70]], ('''V1032 Centauri''') a low mass T Tauri star is found in the constellation Centauras. In July 2018 astronomers captured the first conclusive image of a [[protoplanetary disk]] containing a nascent [[exoplanet]], named [[PDS 70b]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EA-20180702&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=First confirmed image of newborn planet caught with ESO's VLT – Spectrum reveals cloudy atmosphere |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/e-fci062918.php |date=2 July 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO-20180629&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Müller, a.|display-authors=et al |title=Orbital and atmospheric characterization of the planet within the gap of the PDS 70 transition disk |url=http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1821/eso1821b.pdf |work=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO-20180630&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Keppler, M.|display-authors=et al |title=Discovery of a planetary-mass companion within the gap of the transition disk around PDS 70 |url=http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1821/eso1821a.pdf |work=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Deep-sky objects===
[[Omega Centauri|ω Centauri]] (NGC 5139), despite being listed as the constellation's &quot;omega&quot; star, is in fact a naked-eye [[globular cluster]], 17,000 light-years away with a diameter of 150 light-years. It is the largest and brightest globular cluster in the [[Milky Way]]; at ten times the size of the next-largest cluster,&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; it has a magnitude of 3.7. It is also the most [[luminosity|luminous]] globular cluster in the Milky Way, at over one million [[solar luminosity|solar luminosities]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}  Omega Centauri is classified as a Shapley class VIII cluster, which means that its center is loosely concentrated. It is also the only globular cluster to be designated with a [[Bayer letter]]; the globular cluster [[47 Tucanae]] is the only one designated with a [[Flamsteed number]].{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=161}} It contains several million stars, most of which are [[yellow dwarf]] stars, but also possesses [[red giant]]s and [[B-type star|blue-white]] stars; the stars have an average age of 12 billion years. This has prompted suspicion that Omega Centauri was the [[Galactic Center|core]] of a [[dwarf galaxy]] that had been [[galactic merger|absorbed]] by the Milky Way. Omega Centauri was determined to be nonstellar in 1677 by the English astronomer [[Edmond Halley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; though it was visible as a star to the ancients. Its status as a globular cluster was determined by [[James Dunlop]] in 1827.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=163}} To the unaided eye, Omega Centauri appears fuzzy and is obviously non-circular; it is approximately half a degree in diameter, the same size as the full Moon.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}

Centaurus is also home to open clusters. [[NGC 3766]] is an open cluster 6,300 light-years from Earth that is visible to the unaided eye. It contains approximately 100 stars, the brightest of which are 7th magnitude. [[NGC 5460]] is another naked-eye open cluster, 2,300 light-years from Earth, that has an overall magnitude of 6 and contains approximately 40 stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}

There is one bright [[planetary nebula]] in Centaurus, [[NGC 3918]], also known as the Blue Planetary. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and a central star of magnitude 11.0; it is 2600 light-years from Earth. The Blue Planetary was discovered by [[John Herschel]] and named for its color's similarity to [[Uranus]], though the nebula is apparently three times larger than the planet.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}}

Centaurus is rich in galaxies as well. [[NGC 4622]] is a face-on [[spiral galaxy]] located 200 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0146). Its [[spiral arms]] wind in both directions, which makes it nearly impossible for astronomers to determine the rotation of the galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a [[galaxy merger|collision]] with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt; [[NGC 5253]], a peculiar [[irregular galaxy]], is located near the border with Hydra and [[Messier 83|M83]], with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1–2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxy's high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=40}} NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away. It is visible with any amateur telescope, as well as [[binoculars]] under good conditions; it has been described as &quot;shaped like a candle flame&quot;, being long and thin (16' by 3'). In the eyepiece of a large telescope, its southeastern dust lane becomes visible. Another galaxy is [[NGC 5102]], found by star-hopping from [[Iota Centauri]]. In the eyepiece, it appears as an elliptical object 9 arcminutes by 2.5 arcminutes tilted on a southwest-northeast axis.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}}

One of the closest [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] to Earth is the [[Centaurus A]] galaxy, NGC 5128, at 11 million light-years away (redshift 0.00183). It has a [[supermassive black hole]] at its core, which expels massive jets of matter that emit [[radio wave]]s due to [[synchrotron radiation]]. Astronomers posit that its dust lanes, not common in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]], are due to a previous [[galaxy merger|merger]] with another galaxy,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110–113}} probably a [[spiral galaxy]]. NGC 5128 appears in the [[optical spectrum]] as a fairly large elliptical galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]]. Its overall magnitude is 7.0 and it has been seen under perfect conditions with the naked eye, making it one of the most distant objects visible to the unaided observer. In equatorial and southern latitudes, it is easily found by [[star hopping]] from Omega Centauri. In small telescopes, the dust lane is not visible; it begins to appear with about 4 inches of aperture under good conditions. In large amateur instruments, above about 12 inches in aperture, the dust lane's west-northwest to east-southeast direction is easily discerned. Another dim dust lane on the east side of the 12-arcminute-by-15-arcminute galaxy is also visible.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=40}}  [[ESO 270-17]], also called the Fourcade-Figueroa Object, is a low-surface brightness object believed to be the remnants of a galaxy; it does not have a core and is very difficult to observe with an amateur telescope. It measures 7 arcminutes by 1 arcminute.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2013|p=41}} It likely originated as a spiral galaxy and underwent a catastrophic gravitational interaction with Centaurus A around 500 million years ago, stopping its rotation and destroying its structure.{{sfn|Steinicke|2007|p=182}}

[[NGC 4650A]] is a [[polar-ring galaxy]] 136 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.01). It has a central core made of older stars that resembles an [[elliptical galaxy]], and an outer ring of young stars that orbits around the core. The plane of the outer ring is distorted, which suggests that NGC 4650A is the result of a [[galaxy collision]] about a billion years ago. This galaxy has also been cited in studies of [[dark matter]], because the stars in the outer ring orbit too quickly for their collective mass. This suggests that the galaxy is surrounded by a [[dark matter halo]], which provides the necessary mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |date = 2006 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the closest [[galaxy cluster]]s to Earth is the [[Centaurus Cluster]] at {{circa}} 160 million light-years away, having [[redshift]] 0.0114. It has a cooler, denser central region of gas and a hotter, more diffuse outer region. The [[intracluster medium]] in the Centaurus Cluster has a high concentration of metals (elements heavier than helium) due to a large number of [[supernova]]e. This cluster also possesses a plume of gas whose origin is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kentauren, 1602 - Skoklosters slott - 102438.tif|left|thumb|Centaurus, 1602]]
While Centaurus now has a high southern latitude, at the dawn of civilization it was an equatorial constellation. [[Precession (astronomy)|Precession]] has been slowly shifting it southward for millennia, and it is now close to its maximal southern [[declination]]. In a little over 7000 years it will be at maximum visibility for those in the northern hemisphere, visible at times in the year up to quite a high northern latitude.
[[File:44-Centaurus-Constellation.PNG|thumb|Centaurus as depicted on The [[Abu al-Fath Manuchihr Khan|Manuchihr]] Globe made in [[Mashhad]] 1632-33 AD (Adilnor Collection, Sweden)]]
The figure of Centaurus can be traced back to a Babylonian constellation known as the Bison-man (MUL.GUD.ALIM). This being was depicted in two major forms: firstly, as a 4-legged bison with a human head, and secondly, as a being with a man's head and torso attached to the rear legs and tail of a bull or bison. It has been closely associated with the Sun god Utu-Shamash from very early times.&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Star-lore'' by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, 2008, page 57ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks depicted the constellation as a [[centaur]] and gave it its current name. It was mentioned by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] in the 4th century BC and [[Aratus]] in the 3rd century BC. In the 2nd century AD, [[Claudius Ptolemy]] catalogued 37 stars in Centaurus, including Alpha Centauri. Large as it is now, in earlier times it was even larger, as the constellation [[Lupus (constellation)|Lupus]] was treated as an [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] within Centaurus, portrayed in illustrations as an unspecified animal either in the centaur's grasp or impaled on its spear.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Richard Hinckley|title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|date=1963|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-21079-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/starnamestheirlo00alle/page/279 279]|url=https://archive.org/details/starnamestheirlo00alle/page/279}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crux|Southern Cross]], which is now regarded as a separate constellation, was treated by the ancients as a mere asterism formed of the stars composing the centaur's legs. Additionally, what is now the minor constellation [[Circinus (constellation)|Circinus]] was treated as undefined stars under the centaur's front hooves.

According to the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (''Fasti'' v.379), the constellation honors the centaur [[Chiron]], who was tutor to many of the earlier Greek heroes including [[Heracles]] (Hercules), [[Theseus]], and [[Jason]], the leader of the Argonauts. It is not to be confused with the more warlike centaur represented by the zodiacal constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. The legend associated with Chiron says that he was accidentally poisoned with an arrow shot by Hercules, and was subsequently placed in the heavens.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=110-113}}

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Centaurus are found in three areas: the [[Azure Dragon|Azure Dragon of the East]] (東方青龍, ''Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng''), the [[Vermilion Bird (Chinese constellation)|Vermillion Bird of the South]] (南方朱雀, ''Nán Fāng Zhū Què''), and the [[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Southern Asterisms]] (近南極星區, ''Jìnnánjíxīngōu''). Not all of the stars of Centaurus can be seen from China, and the unseen stars were classified among the Southern Asterisms by [[Xu Guangqi]], based on his study of western star charts. However, most of the brightest stars of Centaurus, including [[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]], [[Theta Centauri|θ Centauri]] (or Menkent&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU-LSN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Epsilon Centauri|ε Centauri]] and [[Eta Centauri|η Centauri]], can be seen in the Chinese sky.

Some [[Polynesian people]]s considered the stars of Centaurus to be a constellation as well. On [[Pukapuka]], Centaurus had two names: ''Na Mata-o-te-tokolua'' and ''Na Lua-mata-o-Wua-ma-Velo''. In [[Tonga]], the constellation was called by four names: ''O-nga-tangata'', ''Tautanga-ufi'', ''Mamangi-Halahu'', and ''Mau-kuo-mau''. Alpha and Beta Centauri were not named specifically by the people of Pukapuka or Tonga, but they were named by the people of [[Hawaii]] and the [[Tuamotus]]. In Hawaii, the name for Alpha Centauri was either ''Melemele'' or ''Ka Maile-hope'' and the name for Beta Centauri was either ''Polapola'' or ''Ka Maile-mua''. In the Tuamotu islands, Alpha was called ''Na Kuhi'' and Beta was called ''Tere''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=281}}

The Pointer ([[Alpha Centauri|α Centauri]] and [[Beta Centauri|β Centauri]]) is one of the asterisms used by [[Bugis]] sailors for navigation, called ''bintoéng balué'', meaning &quot;the widowed-before-marriage&quot;. It is also called ''bintoéng sallatang'' meaning &quot;southern star&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;kelley11&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kelley, David H. |author2=Milone, Eugene F. |author3=Aveni, A.F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|publisher=Springer|location=New York, New York|year=2011|page=344|isbn=978-1-4419-7623-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&amp;pg=PA307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Namesakes ==
Two [[United States Navy]] ships, {{USS|Centaurus|AKA-17}} and {{USS|Centaurus|AK-264}}, were named after Centaurus, the constellation.

[[The Centaurus]] is also a name of a [[Mega Mall]] and commercial / residential complex in [[Islamabad, Pakistan]]. Construction started in 2005 and the three 41-storey towers, the tallest structures today in Islamabad, were completed by late 2012. The shopping mall was officially opened on February 17, 2013. The Centaurus originally included a [[Hotel rating#More than five stars|7 star hotel]], construction of which is yet to begin.
