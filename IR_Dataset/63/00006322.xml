The '''Carolina parakeet''' (''Conuropsis carolinensis'') or '''Carolina conure''' is an [[extinct species]] of small green [[neotropical parrot]] with a bright yellow head, reddish orange face and pale beak native to the [[eastern United States|eastern]], [[midwest]] and [[Great Plains|plains states]] of the United States. It was the only indigenous [[parrot]] within its range, as well as one of only two parrots native to the United States (the other being the [[thick-billed parrot]]). It was found from southern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Wisconsin]] to [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], from the [[Atlantic seaboard]] to as far west as eastern [[Colorado]].

The earliest reference to these parrots was in 1583 in [[Florida]] reported by Sir [[George Peckham (merchant)|George Peckham]] in ''A True Report of the Late Discoveries of the Newfound Lands'' of expeditions conducted by English explorer [[Sir Humphrey Gilbert]] who notes that explorers in North America &quot;doe testifie that they have found in those countryes;&amp;nbsp;... parrots.&quot; They were first scientifically described in English naturalist [[Mark Catesby]]'s two volume ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands'' published in [[London]] in 1731 and 1743.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis ludovicianus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''C. c. ludovicianus'' by [[John James Audubon]]]] 
''Carolinensis'' is a species of the [[genus]] ''Conuropsis'', one of numerous genera of [[New World]] [[Neotropical]] parrots in family [[Psittacidae]] of [[true parrot]]s.

The specific name ''Psittacus carolinensis'' was assigned by Swedish zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae]] published in 1758. The species was given its own genus ''Conuropsis'' by Italian zoologist and ornithologist [[Tommaso Salvadori]] in 1891 in his ''Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum'', volume&amp;nbsp;20. The name is derived from the Greek-ified ''conure'' (&quot;parrot of the genus ''[[Conurus]]''&quot; an obsolete name of genus ''Aratinga'') + ''-opsis'' (&quot;likeness of&quot;) and Latinized ''Carolina'' (from [[Carolana]], an English colonial province{{#tag:ref|a reference to the 17th&amp;nbsp;century English province of [[Carolana]], called ''Florida'' by the Spaniards and ''La&amp;nbsp;Louisiane'' by the French, a grant from King Charles&amp;nbsp;I which included the territory extending from the Atlantic Ocean to New Mexico, between the 30th and 36th&amp;nbsp;parallels of latitude, which encompasses on the Atlantic seaboard the modern states of North and South Carolina |group=Note}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coxe |first=Daniel |date=1722 |title=A description of the English province of Carolana |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_35450 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) + ''-ensis'' (of or &quot;from a place&quot;), therefore a bird &quot;like a conure from Carolina&quot;.

There are two recognized subspecies. The [[Louisiana]] subspecies of the Carolina parakeet, ''C. c. ludovicianus'',{{#tag:ref|''ludovicianus'', Latinized &quot;of Louisiana&quot;, a reference to the [[Louisiana Territory]] of the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century, which does not include the modern state of Louisiana.|group=Note}} was slightly different in color than the [[nominate subspecies]], being more bluish-green and generally of a somewhat subdued coloration, and became extinct in much the same way, but at a somewhat earlier date (early 1910s). The [[Appalachian Mountains]] separated these birds from the eastern ''C.&amp;nbsp;c.&amp;nbsp;carolinensis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BurgioCarlson2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burgio |first1=Kevin R. |last2=Carlson |first2=Colin J. |last3=Tingley |first3=Morgan W. |title=Lazarus ecology: Recovering the distribution and migratory patterns of the extinct Carolina parakeet |journal=Ecology and Evolution |volume=7 |issue=14 |year=2017 |pages=5467–5475 |issn=2045-7758 |doi=10.1002/ece3.3135 |pmid=28770082 |pmc=5528215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
According to a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] recovered from museum specimens, their closest living relatives include some of the South American ''[[Aratinga]]'' parakeets: The [[Nanday parakeet]], the [[sun parakeet]], and the [[golden-capped parakeet]]. The authors note the bright yellow and orange plumage and blue wing feathers found in ''Conuropsis carolinensis'' are traits shared by another species, the [[jandaya parakeet]] (''A.&amp;nbsp;jandaya''), that was not sampled in the study but is generally thought to be closely related.{{#tag:ref| Sun parakeet, golden-capped parakeet and jenday parakeet together with sulphur-breasted parakeet are collectively referred to as the ''[[Sun parakeet#Taxonomy|Aratinga solstitialis complex]]''; they are so closely related that they are considered by some authorities to be subspecies of A.&amp;nbsp;solstitialis.|group=Note}} Carolinensis is in a sister clade to that of [[Spix's macaw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Conuropsis DNA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirchman |first1=Jeremy J. |last2=Schirtzinger |first2=Erin E. |last3=Wright |first3=Timothy F. |date=2012 |title=Phylogenetic relationships of the extinct Carolina Parakeet (''Conuropsis carolinensis'') inferred from DNA sequence data |doi=10.1525/auk.2012.11259 |journal=The Auk |volume=129 |issue=2 |pages=197–204 |url=http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/twright/publications/Kirchmanetal2012Auk_PROOFS.pdf |accessdate=22 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919173555/http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/twright/publications/Kirchmanetal2012Auk_PROOFS.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennu |first=Devorah |date=19 September 2012 |title=Extinct Carolina parakeet gives glimpse into evolution of American parrots |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2012/sep/19/1?CMP=twt_gu |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carolina parakeet colonized North America about 5.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. This was well before North America and South America were joined together by the formation of the [[Panama]] [[land bridge]] about 3.5&amp;nbsp;[[million years ago|mya]]. Since the Carolina parakeets' more distant relations are geographically closer to its own historic range while its closest relatives are more geographically distant to it, these data are consistent with the generally accepted hypothesis that Central and [[North America]] were colonized at different times by distinct lineages of parrots – parrots that originally invaded South America from [[Antarctica]] some time after the breakup of [[Gondwana]], where Neotropical [[parrot#Taxonomy|parrots originated]] approximately 50&amp;nbsp;mya.

A fossil parrot, designated ''Conuropsis fratercula'', was described based on a single [[humerus]] from the [[Miocene]] Sheep Creek Formation (possibly late [[Hemingfordian]], c.&amp;nbsp;16&amp;nbsp;mya, possibly later) of [[Snake River (Nebraska)|Snake River]], Nebraska.&lt;ref name=Wetmore&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wetmore |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Wetmore |date=1926 |title=Descriptions of additional fossil birds from the Miocene of Nebraska |journal=[[American Museum Novitates]] |volume=211 |pages=1–5 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/3188/1/N0211.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a smaller bird, three-quarters the size of the Carolina parakeet. &quot;The present ''species'' is of peculiar interest as it represents the first known parrot-like bird to be described as a fossil from North America.&quot; (Wetmore 1926;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wetmore&quot;/&gt; italics added) However, it is not altogether certain that this species is correctly assigned to ''Conuropsis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Storrs L. |authorlink=Storrs L.

The Carolina parakeet was a small green parrot very similar in size and coloration to the extant [[jenday conure|jenday]] and [[sun conure|sun conures]]. The majority of the plumage was green with lighter green underparts, a bright yellow head and orange forehead and face extending to behind the eyes and upper cheeks (lores). The shoulders were yellow, continuing down the outer edge of the wings. The primary feathers were mostly green, but with yellow edges on the outer primaries. Thighs were green towards the top and yellow towards the feet. Male and female adults were identical in plumage, however males were slightly larger than females ([[sexually dimorphic]]). The legs and feet were light brown. They share the [[zygodactyl]] feet of the parrot family. The skin around the eyes was white and the beak was pale flesh colored. These birds weigh about 3.5&amp;nbsp;oz.,{{#tag:ref|There is notable conflict over the weight of this bird, with most references reporting 280&amp;nbsp;g (about 10&amp;nbsp;oz), but that would make the bird an improbable 2.5 times as heavy as the similar size closely related Nenday parakeet whose weight is given as {{convert|100|-|140|g|oz|abbr=on}}|group=Note}} are 13&amp;nbsp;in. long, and have wingspans of 21{{ndash}}23&amp;nbsp;in.

Young Carolina parakeets differed slightly in coloration from adults. The face and entire body was green, with paler underparts. They lacked yellow or orange plumage on the face, wings, and thighs. Hatchlings were covered in mouse-gray down, until about 39–40 days when green wings and tails appear. Fledglings had full adult plumage at around 1 year of age. (&quot;Nature Serve, Conuropsis carolinensis&quot;, 2005; Fuller, 2001; Mauler, 2001; Rising, 2004; Snyder and Russell, 2002)

These birds were fairly long lived, at least in captivity - a pair was kept at the [[Cincinnati Zoo]] for over 35 years.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Conuropsis carolinensis.jpg|thumb|left|Photo of a live pet specimen, 1906]] 
The Carolina parakeet had the northern-most range of any known parrot. It was found from southern New England and New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico. It has also had a wide distribution west of the Mississippi River, as far west as eastern Colorado. Its range was described by early explorers thus: the 43rd parallel as the northern limit, the 26th as the most southern, the 73rd and 106th meridians as the eastern and western boundaries respectively, the range included all or portions of at least 28 states.{{#tag:ref|Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, N. Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, S. Carolina, S. Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, W. Virginia, Wisconsin|group=Note}} Its habitats were old-growth wetland forests along rivers and in swamps especially in the Mississippi-Missouri drainage basin with large hollow trees including [[Taxodium|cypress]] and [[Platanus occidentalis|sycamore]] to use as roosting and nesting sites.

Only very rough estimates of the birds' former prevalence can be made: with an estimated range of 20,000 to 2.5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and population density of 0.5 to 2.0 parrots per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, population estimates range from tens of thousands to a few million birds (though the densest populations occurred in Florida covering 170,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so there may have been hundreds of thousands of the birds in that state alone).

The species may have appeared as a very rare [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] in places as far north as [[Southern Ontario]]. A few bones, including a [[pygostyle]] found at the Calvert Site in Southern Ontario, came from the Carolina parakeet. The possibility remains open that this specimen was taken to Southern Ontario for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godfrey |first=W. Earl |date=1986 |title=The Birds of Canada |edition=revised |publisher=[[National Museum of Natural History]] |isbn=0-660-10758-9 |page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior and diet==
[[File:Live captive Carolina parakeet.jpg|thumb|upright|Live captive bird photographed by [[Robert Wilson Shufeldt]] around 1900]] 
The bird lived in huge, noisy flocks of as many as 200–300 birds. It built its nest in a hollow tree, laying two to five (most accounts say two) {{convert|1.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} round white eggs.

It mostly ate the seeds of forest trees and shrubs including those of cypress, [[Celtis|hackberry]], beech, sycamore, elm, pine, maple, oak, and other plants such as [[thistle]]s and sandspurs (''[[Cenchrus]]'' species). It also ate [[fruit]]s, including apples, grapes and figs (often from orchards by the time of its decline).&lt;ref name=Griggs/&gt; It was especially noted for its predilection for cockleburs (''[[Xanthium strumarium]]''),&lt;ref name = &quot;Phillips&quot;/&gt; a plant which contains a toxic [[glucoside]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Vet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cocklebur (''Xanthium strumarium'' L.) |publisher=University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana: Veterinary Medicine Library |url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/vex/toxic/cklburs/cklburs.htm |accessdate=8 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908005840/http://www.library.illinois.edu/vex/toxic/cklburs/cklburs.htm |archive-date=8 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was considered to be an agricultural pest of grain crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/carolina-parakeet-removal-of-a-menace/|title=Carolina Parakeet: Removal of a &quot;Menace&quot;|date=2008-04-15|newspaper=All About Birds|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extinction==

The last captive Carolina parakeet, Incas, died at the Cincinnati Zoo on February 21, 1918, in the same cage as [[Martha (passenger pigeon)|Martha]], the last [[passenger pigeon]], who died in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johnjames.audubon.org/last-carolina-parakeet|title=The last Carolina Parakeet|date=22 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no scientific studies or surveys of this bird by American naturalists; most information about it is from anecdotal accounts and museum specimens. Therefore, details of its prevalence and decline are unverified or speculative.

There are extensive accounts of the pre-colonial and early colonial prevalence of this bird. The existence of flocks of gregarious, very colorful and raucous parrots could hardly have gone unnoted by European explorers, as parrots were virtually unknown in seafaring European nations in the 16th and 17th centuries. Later accounts in the latter half of the 19th century onward noted the birds' sparseness and absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Albert |date=July 1912 |title=Early Records of the Carolina Paroquet |doi=10.2307/4071042 |journal=The Auk |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=343–363|jstor=4071042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birds' range collapsed from east to west with settlement and clearing of the eastern and southern deciduous forests. [[John J. Audubon]] commented as early as 1832 on the decline of the birds. The bird was rarely reported outside Florida after 1860. The last reported sighting east of the Mississippi River (except Florida) was in 1878 in Kentucky. By the turn of the century it was restricted to the swamps of central Florida. The last known wild specimen was killed in [[Okeechobee County, Florida]], in 1904, and the last captive bird died at the Cincinnati Zoo on February 21, 1918. This was the male specimen, called &quot;Incas&quot;, who died within a year of his mate, &quot;Lady Jane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Noel |date=June 2004 |title=The Carolina Parakeet: Glimpses of a Vanished Bird |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional reports of the bird were made in Okeechobee County, Florida, until the late 1920s, but these are not supported by specimens. It was not until 1939, however, that the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] declared that the Carolina parakeet had become extinct. The [[IUCN]] has listed the species as extinct since 1920.
 
In 1937, three parakeets resembling this species were sighted and filmed in the [[Okefenokee Swamp]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. However, the American Ornithologists' Union analyzed the film and concluded that they had probably filmed feral parakeets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cokinos |first=Christopher |date=2009|title=Hope Is the Thing with Feathers: A Personal Chronicle of Vanished Birds |publisher=Penguin |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 1938, a flock of parakeets was apparently sighted by a group of experienced ornithologists in the swamps of the [[Santee River]] basin in [[South Carolina]]. However, this sighting was doubted by most other ornithologists. The birds were never seen again after this sighting, and shortly after a portion of the area was destroyed to make way for power lines, making the species' continued existence unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lost Wild America: The Story of Our Extinct and Vanishing Wildlife|last=McClung|first=Robert M.|publisher=Linnet Books|year=1994|isbn=978-0208023599|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780208023599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for extinction===

The evidence is indicative that humans had at least a contributory role in the extinction of the Carolina parakeet, through a variety of means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://johnjames.audubon.org/last-carolina-parakeet | title=The last Carolina Parakeet| date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief was [[deforestation]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. Hunting played a significant role, both for decorative use of their colorful feathers, for example, adornment of women's hats, and for reduction of crop predation.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; This was partially offset by the recognition of their value in controlling invasive cockleburs. Minor roles were played by capture for the pet trade and, as noted in ''[[Pacific Standard]]'', &quot;One biologist has argued&quot;, by the introduction for crop pollination of [[European honeybee]]s that competed for nest sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psmag.com/environment/remembering-the-carolina-parakeet|title=Happy Global Last Resort Day|last=Cokinos|first=Christopher|date=February 21, 2018|website=[[Pacific Standard]]|access-date=January 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A factor that exacerbated their decline to extinction was the flocking behavior that led them to return to the vicinity of dead and dying birds (e.g., birds downed by hunting), enabling wholesale slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://johnjames.audubon.org/last-carolina-parakeet | title=The last Carolina Parakeet| date=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final extinction of the species in the early years of the 20th century is somewhat of a mystery, as it happened so rapidly. Vigorous flocks with many juveniles and reproducing pairs were noted as late as 1896, and the birds were long-lived in captivity, but they had virtually disappeared by 1904. Sufficient nest sites remained intact, so deforestation was not the final cause. American ornithologist Noel F. Snyder&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt; speculates that the most likely cause seems to be that the birds succumbed to poultry disease, although no recent or historical records exist of New World parrot populations being afflicted by domestic poultry diseases. The modern poultry scourge [[Newcastle disease]] was not detected until 1926 in Indonesia, and only a subacute form of it was reported in the United States in 1938.
