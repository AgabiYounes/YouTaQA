'''Cayuga Lake''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ʌ|ˈ|juː|ɡ|ə}})&amp;#160; is the longest of central [[New York (state)|New York]]'s glacial [[Finger Lakes]], and is the second largest in surface area (marginally smaller than [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]) and second largest in volume.  It is just under {{convert|40|mi}} long.  Its average width is 1.7 miles (2.7&amp;nbsp;km), and it is {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=mid|wide|abbr=on}} at its widest point near Aurora.  It is approximately {{convert|435|ft|m|adj=mid|deep|abbr=on}} at its deepest point.

The lake is named after the native [[Cayuga people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baca|first=Keith A.|title=Native American Place Names in Mississippi|url=https://epdf.pub/native-american-place-names-in-mississippi.html|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-483-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The city of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], site of [[Ithaca College]] and [[Cornell University]], is located at the southern end of Cayuga Lake.

Villages and settlements along the east shore of Cayuga Lake include [[Lansing, New York|Myers]], [[King Ferry, New York|King Ferry]], [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora]], [[Ledyard, New York|Levanna]], [[Union Springs, New York|Union Springs]], and [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]].  Settlements along the west shore of the lake include [[Ovid (town), New York|Sheldrake]], [[Romulus, New York|Poplar Beach]], and [[Canoga, New York|Canoga]].

The lake has two small islands. One is near Union Springs; Frontenac Island( North East).  This island is not inhabited. The other island, Canoga Island (North West) is located near the town of Canoga.  This island has several camps and is inhabited during the summer months. The only other island in any of the Finger Lakes is [[Squaw Island (Canandaigua Lake)|Squaw Island]] in [[Canandaigua Lake]].

===Geographical characteristics===
Cayuga Lake is located at {{Coord|42|41|00|N|76|41|46|W|region:US_type:waterbody}}; {{convert|116.4|m}} above sea level. Its depth, steep east and west sides with shallow north and south ends is typical of the Finger Lakes, as they were carved by [[glacier]]s during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]].

The water level is regulated by the Mud Lock at the north end of the lake. It is connected to [[Lake Ontario]] by the [[Erie Canal]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] by the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]]. The lake is drawn down as winter approaches, to minimize ice damage and to maximize its capacity to store heavy spring runoff.

The north end is dominated by shallow [[mudflats]].  An important stopover for [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, the mudflats and marsh are the location of the [[Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge]]. The southern end is also shallow and often freezes during the winter.

===Human impact===
[[File:CayugaLake.jpg|thumb|Winter view of the head of Cayuga Lake]]

Cayuga Lake is very popular among recreational boaters. The [[Allan H. Treman State Marine Park]], a large state marina and boat launch, is located at the southern end of the lake in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].  There are two yacht clubs on the western shore: [[Ithaca Yacht Club]] a few miles north of Ithaca, and Red Jacket Yacht Club just south of Canoga. There are several other marinas and boat launches scattered along the lake shore.

Cayuga Lake is the source of drinking water for several communities, including Lansing near the southern end of the lake along the east side, which draws water through the [[Bolton Point, New York|Bolton Point]] Municipal Water system. There are also several [[Deep lake water cooling|lake source cooling]] systems that are in operation on the lake, whereby cooler water is pumped from the depths of the lake, warmed, and circulated in a closed system back to the surface. One of these systems, which is operated by Cornell University and began operation in 2000, was controversial during the planning and building states for potential negative environmental impact.  All the environmental impact reports and scientific studies have shown that the Cornell lake source cooling system has not yet had and will not likely have any measurably significant environmental impact. Furthermore, Cornell's system pumps significantly less warm water back into the lake than others further north which have been operating for decades, including the coal-fired power plant on the eastern shore.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[File:AES Cayuga.jpg|thumb|AES Cayuga, on the eastern shore of the lake]]
The AES Cayuga electrical generating station operates in the Town of Lansing, on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. This coal-fired plant uses Cayuga Lake as a cooling source.  In the late 1960s, citizens successfully opposed the construction of an 830-MW nuclear power plant on the shore of Cayuga Lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ107899&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ107899  &quot;The Role of Experts in a Nuclear Siting Controversy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MD4cPQAmF7oC&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=Cayuga+Lake+nuclear+power&amp;source=web&amp;ots=f9NO88vkjr&amp;sig=DsaBb6otYOvd6rj5zl2N6ZEVhXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result#PPA262,M1 Chain Reaction] pp. 262–264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990).

[[Rod Serling]] named his production company Cayuga Productions during the years of his TV series, ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''.  Serling and his family had a summer home at Cayuga Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rodserling.com/FAQ.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601182300/http://www.rodserling.com/FAQ.htm |archive-date=2009-06-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fishing==
The fish population is managed and substantial sport fishing is practiced, with anglers targeting [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[lake trout]] and [[smallmouth bass]]. Fish species present in the lake include [[lake trout]], [[landlocked salmon]], [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]], [[alewife (fish)|alewife]], [[atlantic salmon]], [[black crappie]], [[bluegill]], [[American pickerel|pickerel]], [[largemouth bass]], [[northern pike]], [[pumpkinseed sunfish]], [[rock bass]], and [[yellow perch]]. There are state owned hard surface ramps in [[Mudlock Canal Park]], [[Long Point State Park - Finger Lakes|Long Point State Park]], [[Cayuga Lake State Park]], [[Dean's Cove State Marine Park]], [[Taughannock Falls State Park]], and [[Allen H. Treman Marine Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sportsman's Connection (Firm)|title=Western Adirondacks New York fishing map guide: includes lakes &amp; streams for the following counties: Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chemung, Cortland, Erie, Livingston, Madison, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Ontario, Orleans, Oswego, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Tioga, Tompkins, Wayne, Wyoming, and Yates.|date=2011-01-01|oclc=986498446 |publisher=Sportsman's Connection|language=English|isbn=978-1-885010-63-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributaries==
Inflow is represented by [[Cayuga Inlet]], [[Fall Creek (New York)|Fall Creek]], [[Taughannock Creek]], and [[Salmon Creek (Cayuga Lake)|Salmon Creek]], while it outflows into [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] and other tributaries.

==Folklore==
[[File:Cornell West Campus from McGraw Tower.jpg|thumb|[[Cornell West Campus]] and Cayuga Lake as seen from [[McGraw Tower]].]]

The lake is the subject of local folklore. Cornell's [[alma mater]] makes reference to its position &quot;[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]&quot;, while that of Ithaca College references &quot;[[Ithaca College#Ithaca Forever|Cayuga's shore]]&quot;.

A tradition at [[Wells College]] in Aurora holds that if the lake completely freezes over, classes are canceled (though for only one day).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = The Student Life Office| title = Wells College Student Traditions| work = Wells College (Official Site)| publisher = Wells College| year = 2007| url = http://www.wells.edu/slife/sttrads.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-16| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080125222921/http://www.wells.edu/slife/sttrads.htm| archivedate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wells College records, this most recently happened in 1979 and 2015.  However, other sources suggest that the only time the entire lake froze over solid end to end in the 20th century was in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1912/02/19/archives/cornell-skaters-drown-ice-breaks-under-students-on-cayuga-lake.html New York Times February 19, 1912 CORNELL SKATERS DROWN page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ingraham, &quot;Does Cayuga Lake Freeze Over?&quot;, February 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cayuga Lake, like nearby [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], is also the site of a phenomenon known as the [[Guns of the Seneca]], mysterious cannon-like booms heard in the surrounding area. Many of these booms may be attributable to [[Bird scarer#Propane gas gun|bird-scarers]], automated cannon-like devices used by farmers to scare birds away from the many vineyards, orchards and crops. There is however no proof of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cayugafisher.net/pages/fishinfo/lake_drums.php|title=What Are The Lake Drums?|website=cayugafisher.net|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newyorktraveler.net/seneca-lake-home-of-the-lake-farts/|title=Seneca Lake, Home of the Lake Farts : New York Traveler.net|website=newyorktraveler.net|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
