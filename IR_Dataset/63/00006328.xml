[[File:Etymological Relationships Tree.png|thumb|Diagram showing relationships between etymologically-related words]]

In [[linguistics]], '''cognates''' are [[word]]s that have a common [[etymology|etymological]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Crystal |editor-first=David |editorlink=David Crystal |date=2011 |title=A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics |edition=6th |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZPQVuSgDAkC&amp;pg=PT104 |chapter=cognate |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |page=104 |isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5 |oclc=899159900 |access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognates are often inherited from a [[proto-language|shared parent language]], but they may also involve [[loanword|borrowings]] from some other language. For example, the [[English language|English]] words ''[[wikt:dish#English|dish]]'' and ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' and the [[German language|German]] word ''[[wikt:Tisch#German|Tisch]]'' (&quot;table&quot;) are cognates because they all come from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:discus#Latin|discus]]'', which relates to their flat surfaces. Cognates may have [[language change|evolved]] similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar sounds or letters in the words, in some cases appearing to be dissimilar. Some words sound similar, but do not come from the same root; these are called [[false cognate]]s, while some are truly cognate but differ in meaning; these are called [[false friend]]s.

The word ''cognate'' derives from the Latin noun ''[[:wikt:cognatus|cognatus]]'', which means &quot;blood relative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognate &quot;cognate&quot;], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed.: &quot;Latin ''cognātus'': ''co-'', co- + ''gnātus'', born, past participle of ''nāscī'', to be born.&quot; Other definitions of the English word include &quot;[r]elated by blood; having a common ancestor&quot; and &quot;[r]elated or analogous in nature, character, or function&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Cognates do not need to have the same meaning, which [[semantic drift|may have changed]] as the languages developed separately. For example [[English language|English]] ''[[wikt:starve#English|starve]]'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''[[wikt:sterven#Dutch|sterven]]'' or [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:sterben|sterben]]'' (&quot;to die&quot;) all derive from the same [[Proto-Germanic]] root, ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/sterbaną|*sterbaną]]'' (&quot;die&quot;). ''Discus'' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δίσκος'' (from the verb ''δικεῖν'' &quot;to throw&quot;). A later and separate English reflex of ''discus'', probably through [[medieval Latin]] ''desca'', is ''[[wikt:desk#English|desk]]'' (see [[OED]] s.v. ''desk'').

Cognates also do not need to have similar forms: English ''[[wikt:father|father]]'', [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:père#French|père]]'', and Armenian [[wikt:հայր|հայր]] (''hayr'') all descend directly from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ph₂tḗr''. An extreme case is Armenian [[wikt:երկու|երկու]] (''erku'') and English ''[[wikt:two|two]]'', which descend from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*dwóh₁'' (note that the sound change ''*dw'' &gt; ''erk'' in Armenian is regular).

==Across languages==
Examples of cognates in [[Indo-European languages]] are the words ''night'' ([[English language|English]]), ''nicht'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''Nacht'' ([[German language|German]]), ''nacht'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), ''nag'' ([[Afrikaans]]), ''Naach'' ([[Colognian dialect|Colognian]]), ''natt'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''nat'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''nátt'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''nótt'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''noc'' ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]]), ночь, ''noch'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]), ноќ, ''noć'' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]), нощ, ''nosht'' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), ''nishi'' ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''ніч'', ''nich'' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), ''ноч'', ''noch''/''noč'' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]), ''noč'' ([[Slovene language|Slovene]]), ''noć'' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]]), ''nakts'' ([[Latvian language|Latvian]]), ''naktis'' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), νύξ, ''nyx'' ([[Ancient Greek]], ''νύχτα'' / ''nychta'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''nakt-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''natë'' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]), ''nos'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]]), ''noz'' ([[Breton language|Breton]]), ''nox/nocte'' ([[Latin]]), ''nuit'' ([[French language|French]]), ''noche'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''nueche'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]]), ''noite'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''notte'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''nit'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''nuèch'' / ''nuèit'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]) and ''noapte'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]]), all meaning &quot;night&quot; and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/nókʷts|*nókʷts]]}} &quot;night&quot;.

Another Indo-European example is ''star'' ([[English language|English]]), ''starn'' ([[Scots language|Scots]]), ''Stern'' ([[German language|German]]), ''ster'' (Dutch and [[Afrikaans]]), ''Schtähn'' ([[Colognian dialect|Colognian]]), ''stjärna'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), ''stjerne'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]]), ''stjarna'' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]), ''stjørna'' ([[Faroese language|Faroese]]), ''stairno'' ([[Gothic language|Gothic]]), ''str-'' ([[Sanskrit]]), ''tara'' ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]), ''tera'' ([[Sylheti language|Sylheti]]), ''tora'' ([[Assamese language|Assamese]]), ''setāre'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]), ''stoorei'' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]), ''estêre'' or ''stêrk'' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]), ''astgh'' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]), ''ἀστήρ (astēr)'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] or ''ἀστέρι''/''ἄστρο'', ''asteri''/''astro'' in [[Modern Greek]]), ''astrum'' / ''stellă'' ([[Latin]]), ''astre'' / ''étoile'' ([[French language|French]]), ''astro'' / ''stella'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]), ''stea'' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), ''estel'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''astru'' / ''isteddu'' ([[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]), ''estela'' ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]), ''estrella'' and ''astro'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), ''estrella'' ([[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]]), ''estrela'' and ''astro'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]), ''seren'' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]), ''steren'' ([[Cornish language|Cornish]]) and ''[[:wikt:sterenn#Breton|sterenn]]'' ([[Breton language|Breton]]), from the Proto-Indo-European {{PIE|[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/h₂stḗr|*h₂stḗr]]}} &quot;star&quot;.

The [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|سلام}} ''salām'', the [[Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|שלום}} ''shalom'', the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] ''shlama'' and the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''selam'' (&quot;peace&quot;) are also cognates, derived from the [[Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/šalām-|*šalām-]] &quot;peace&quot;.

Cognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word ''[[wikt:milk#English|milk]]'' is clearly a cognate of German ''[[wikt:Milch#German|Milch]]'', Dutch ''[[wikt:melk#Dutch|melk]]'', Russian ''[[wikt:молоко#Russian|молоко (moloko)]]'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Slovene_language|Slovenian]] ''mleko'', and Montenegrin, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]],  ''[[wikt:mlijeko#Serbo-Croatian|mlijeko]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Compare also Greek [[wikt:ἀμέλγω#Ancient Greek|ἀμέλγω]] ''amelgō'' &quot;to milk&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, French ''[[wikt:lait#French|lait]]'', Catalan ''llet'', Italian ''latte'', Romanian ''[[wikt:lapte#Romanian|lapte]]'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[wikt:leche#Spanish|leche]]'' and ''[[wikt:leite#Portuguese|leite]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]]) (all meaning &quot;milk&quot;) are less-obvious cognates of [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλακτος#Ancient Greek|γάλακτος]]}}'' ''gálaktos'' (genitive singular of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γάλα#Ancient Greek|γάλα]]}} ''gála'', &quot;milk&quot;), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin ''[[wikt:lac#Latin|lac]]'' &quot;milk&quot; as well as the English word ''[[wikt:lactic#English|lactic]]'' and other terms borrowed from Latin.

Some cognates are semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word {{Hebrew|חוצפה}} ''[[chutzpah]]'' means &quot;impudence&quot;, its [[Classical Arabic]] cognate {{lang|ar|حصافة}} ''ḥaṣāfah'' means &quot;sound judgment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Hans|authorlink=Hans Wehr |editor= J. Milton Cowan| title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |origyear=1979 |year=1994 |publisher=Spoken Language Services, Inc. |location=[[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], [[Illinois]] |isbn=0-87950-003-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is English ''empathy'' &quot;understanding of thoughts&quot; and Greek ''εμπάθεια'' &quot;malice&quot;.

==Within the same language==
Cognates within a single language, or ''[[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]]'', may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different.  For example, English ''ward'' and ''guard'' (&lt;PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/wer-|*wer-]]'', &quot;to perceive, watch out for&quot;) are cognates, as are ''shirt'' (garment on top) and ''skirt'' (garment on bottom) (&lt;PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/sker-|*sker-]]'', &quot;to cut&quot;). In some cases, including this one, one cognate (&quot;skirt&quot;) has an ultimate source in another language related to English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= skirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=skirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=early 14c., &quot;lower part of a woman's dress,&quot; from Old Norse ''skyrta'' &quot;shirt, a kind of kirtle&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but the other one (&quot;shirt&quot;) is native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Harper |first= Douglas  |date= |title= shirt (n.).|url=  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shirt |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |location= |access-date=2017-06-16 | archiveurl=  | archivedate= | quote=Old English ''scyrte'' &quot;skirt, tunic,&quot; from Proto-Germanic *''skurtjon'' &quot;a short garment&quot;  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That happened with many loanwords, such as ''skirt'' in this example, which was borrowed from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] during the [[Danelaw]].

Sometimes both doublets come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word ''chief'' (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the [[Middle French]] ''chef'' (&quot;head&quot;), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word ''chef'' (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, but by then, the consonant had changed to a &quot;sh&quot; sound in French. Such word sets can also be called [[etymological twins]], and they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words ''wain'' (native), ''waggon/wagon'' (Dutch), and ''vehicle'' (Latin) in English.

A word may also [[loanword|enter another language]], develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; that is called [[reborrowing]]. For example, the Greek word ''κίνημα'' (''kinima'', &quot;movement&quot;) became French ''cinéma'' (compare American English ''movie'') and then later returned to Greece as ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', &quot;the art of film&quot;, &quot;movie theater&quot;). In Greek, ''κίνημα'' (''kinima'', &quot;movement&quot;) and ''σινεμά'' (''sinema'', &quot;filmmaking, cinema&quot;) are now doublets.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, ''σινεμά'' stands beside a Greek [[neologism]] based on the original form of the same root, ''κινηματογράφος'' (''kinimatoγráfos''), with the same two meanings as ''cinéma''/''σινεμά''. (The film or movie itself is the unrelated ''ταινία'' (''tainia'').)&lt;/ref&gt;

A less obvious English-language doublet pair is ''[[wikt:grammar|grammar]]'' and ''[[wikt:glamour|glamour]]''.

==False cognates==
{{main|False cognates}}
False cognates are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb ''habēre'' and German ''haben'', both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because the words evolved from different roots, in this case, different [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example [[Grimm's law]]). German ''haben'', like English ''have'', comes from PIE ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/kh₂pyé-|*kh₂pyé-]]'' 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is ''capere'', 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin ''habēre'', on the other hand, is from PIE ''*gʰabʰ'', 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English ''give'' and German ''geben''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, English ''much'' and Spanish ''mucho'' look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: ''much'' from Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/mikilaz|*mikilaz]]'' &lt; PIE ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/meg-|*meǵ-]]'' and ''mucho'' from Latin ''multum'' &lt; PIE ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/mel-|*mel-]]''. Instead, its real cognate is Spanish ''maño''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ringe|first1=Don|title=A quick introduction to language change|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|website=Univ. of Pennsylvania: Linguistics 001 (Fall 2011)|accessdate=15 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620051440/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/3-22.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-20|location=¶ 29|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
