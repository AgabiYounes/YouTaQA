'''Camp David''' is the country retreat for the [[president of the United States]]. It is located in the wooded hills of [[Catoctin Mountain Park]] near [[Thurmont, Maryland]], and [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]], about 62 miles (100&amp;nbsp;km) north-northwest of [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nps.gov/pwr/customcf/apps/maps/showmap.cfm?alphacode=cato&amp;parkname=Catoctin%20Mountain%20Park Park Map Viewer]&quot;.

[[Catoctin Mountain Park]], Retrieved on February 4, 2011. &quot;10. Where is Camp David? The Presidential Retreat is within the park however, it is not open to the public and its location is not shown on our park maps for both security and privacy. If you're interested in historical information, visit our Presidential Retreat webpage.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is officially known as the '''Naval Support Facility Thurmont''', because it is technically a military installation, the staffing is primarily provided by the [[Seabees]], [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC), and the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]].  Naval construction battalions are tasked with base construction and send detachments as needed.

Originally known as Hi-Catoctin, Camp David was built as a camp for federal government agents and their families by the [[Works Progress Administration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2008/winter/camp-david.html|title=Camp David|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction started in 1935 and was completed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =12 WPA Projects that Still Exist | publisher =[[How Stuff Works]] | url =http://people.howstuffworks.com/12-wpa-projects-that-still-exist.htm | access-date =March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D.

Camp David received its present name from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in honor of his father, and [[David Eisenhower|grandson]], both named David.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenhower |first=David |author2=Julie Nixon Eisenhower |title=Going Home to Glory: A Memoir of Life with Dwight David Eisenhower, 1961–1969 |url=https://archive.org/details/goinghometoglory00davi_0 |url-access=registration |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |year=2010 |page=[https://archive.org/details/goinghometoglory00davi_0/page/31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catoctin Mountain Park does not indicate the location of Camp David on park maps due to privacy and security concerns, although it can be seen through the use of publicly accessible satellite images.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nomap&quot;/&gt;

On July 2, 2011, an [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] intercepted a small two-seat passenger plane flying near Camp David, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] was in the residence. The civilian aircraft, which was out of radio communication, was intercepted approximately {{convert|10|km|mi|order=flip|sigfig=1}} from the presidential retreat. The F-15 escorted the aircraft out of the area, and it landed in nearby [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], without incident. The civilian plane's occupants were flying between two Maryland towns and were released without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/norad-intercepts-aircraft-near-camp-david-where-president-obama-staying-with-family/2011/07/02/AGZWpQvH_story.html |title=NORAD intercepts aircraft near Camp David, where President Obama staying with family |access-date=July 2, 2012 |date= July 2, 2011 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
