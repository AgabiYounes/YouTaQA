'''Canis Major'''  is a [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern celestial hemisphere]]. In the second century, it was included in [[Ptolemy]]'s 48 constellations, and is counted among the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;greater dog&quot; in contrast to [[Canis Minor]], the &quot;lesser dog&quot;; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] the hunter through the sky. The [[Milky Way]] passes through Canis Major and several [[open cluster]]s lie within its borders, most notably [[Messier 41|M41]].

Canis Major contains [[Sirius]], the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, known as the &quot;dog star&quot;. It is bright because of its proximity to the [[Solar System]]. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high [[luminosity]]. At magnitude 1.5, [[Epsilon Canis Majoris]] (Adhara) is the second-brightest star of the [[constellation]] and the brightest source of [[extreme ultraviolet]] radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]] (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]] (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] (Aludra) at 2.4 and [[Omicron1 Canis Majoris|Omicron&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary [[Zeta Canis Majoris|Zeta]] (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant [[VY Canis Majoris]] is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest stars known]], while the [[neutron star]] [[RX J0720.4-3125]] has a radius of a mere 5&amp;nbsp;km.

=== In western astronomy ===
In ancient [[Mesopotamia]], Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the [[Babylon]]ians, was seen as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the southern stars of Canis Major and a part of [[Puppis]] were viewed as a bow, named BAN in the ''[[Babylonian star catalogues#Three Stars Each|Three Stars Each]]'' tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled ''[[MUL.APIN]]'', the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior [[Ninurta]], and the bow with [[Ishtar]], daughter of [[Enlil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rogers1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=John H. | last=Rogers | year=1998 | title=Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

[[File:Sirius 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Sirius (star)|Sirius A]], the brightest star in the night sky, lies in Canis Major.]]
In Greek Mythology, Canis Major represented the dog [[Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps]], a gift from [[Zeus]] to [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]; or sometimes the hound of [[Procris]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana's]] nymph; or the one given by [[Eos|Aurora]] to [[Cephalus]], so famed for its speed that Zeus elevated it to the sky.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} It was also considered to represent one of Orion's hunting dogs,{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} pursuing [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] the [[Hare]] or helping Orion fight [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] the Bull; and is referred to in this way by [[Aratus|Aratos]], [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] refer only to one dog, but by [[ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Canis Minor]] appears as Orion's second dog. Alternative names include Canis Sequens and Canis Alter.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} Canis Syrius was the name used in the 1521 ''[[Alfonsine tables]]''.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}}

The Roman myth refers to Canis Major as ''Custos Europae'', the dog guarding Europa but failing to prevent her abduction by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in the form of a bull, and as ''[[Cerberus|Janitor Lethaeus]]'', &quot;the watchdog&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=118}} In medieval Arab astronomy, the constellation became ''al-Kalb al-Akbar'', &quot;the Greater Dog&quot;, transcribed as ''Alcheleb Alachbar'' by 17th century writer [[Edmund Chilmead]]. Islamic scholar [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] referred to Orion as  ''Kalb al-Jabbār'', &quot;the Dog of the Giant&quot;.{{sfn|Allen|1963|p=117}} Among the [[Merazig]] of [[Tunisia]], shepherds note six constellations that mark the passage of the dry, hot season. One of them, called ''[[Merzem]]'', includes the stars of Canis Major and Canis Minor and is the herald of two weeks of hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A Review of African Ethno-Astronomy: With Particular Reference to Saharan Livestock-Keepers |last = Oxby |first = Claire |journal = [[La Ricerca Folklorica]] |date = October 1999 |pages = 57–58 | jstor = 1479768 |issue = 40|doi = 10.2307/1479768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In non-western astronomy ===

In [[Chinese astronomy]], the modern constellation of [[Canis Major (Chinese astronomy)|Canis Major]] is located in the [[Vermilion Bird]] ({{lang-zh |c=南方朱雀 |p=Nán Fāng Zhū Què |labels=no }}), where the stars were classified in several separate [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]s of stars. The Military Market ({{lang-zh |p=Jūnshì |c=軍市 |labels=no }}) was a circular pattern of stars containing [[Nu3 Canis Majoris|Nu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Beta Canis Majoris|Beta]], [[Xi1 Canis Majoris|Xi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Xi2 Canis Majoris|Xi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and some stars from Lepus.{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=428}} The Wild Cockerel ({{lang-zh |p=Yějī |c=野雞 |labels=no }}) was at the centre of the Military Market, although it is uncertain which stars depicted what. Schlegel reported that the stars [[Omicron Canis Majoris|Omicron]] and [[Pi Canis Majoris]] might have been them,{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=430}} while Beta or [[Nu2 Canis Majoris|Nu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] have also been proposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpathcma&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canismajor.htm |work=Star Tales |title=Canis Major – the Greater Dog |last1=Ridpath |first1=Ian |accessdate= 1 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirius]] was ''{{lang|zh-Latn|Tiānláng}}'' ({{lang|zh|天狼}}), the Celestial Wolf,{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=431}} denoting invasion and plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpathcma&quot;/&gt; Southeast of the Wolf was the asterism ''{{lang|zh-Latn|Húshǐ}}'' ({{lang|zh|弧矢}}), the celestial Bow and Arrow, which was interpreted as containing [[Delta Canis Majoris|Delta]], [[Epsilon Canis Majoris|Epsilon]], [[Eta Canis Majoris|Eta]] and [[Kappa Canis Majoris]] and [[Delta Velorum]]. Alternatively, the arrow was depicted by [[Omicron2 Canis Majoris|Omicron&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and Eta and aiming at Sirius (the Wolf), while the bow comprised Kappa, Epsilon, [[Sigma Canis Majoris|Sigma]], Delta and 164 Canis Majoris, and [[Pi Puppis|Pi]] and [[Omicron Puppis]].{{sfn|Schlegel|1967|p=434}}&lt;!-- cites previous two sentences --&gt;

Both the [[Māori people]] and the people of the [[Tuamotus]] recognized the figure of Canis Major as a distinct entity, though it was sometimes absorbed into other constellations. ''{{lang|mi|Te Huinga-o-Rehua}}'', also called ''{{lang|mi|Te Putahi-nui-o-Rehua}}'' and ''{{lang|mi|Te Kahui-Takurua}}'', (&quot;The Assembly of {{lang|mi|Rehua}}&quot; or &quot;The Assembly of Sirius&quot;) was a Māori constellation that included both Canis Minor and Canis Major, along with some surrounding stars.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=212}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=215}} Related was ''{{lang|mi|Taumata-o-Rehua}}'', also called ''{{lang|mi|Pukawanui}}'', the Mirror of {{lang|mi|Rehua}}, formed from an undefined group of stars in Canis Major.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=258}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=247}} They called Sirius ''{{lang|mi|Rehua}}'' and ''{{lang|mi|Takarua}}'', corresponding to two of the names for the constellation, though ''{{lang|mi|Rehua}}'' was a name applied to other stars in various Māori groups and other Polynesian cosmologies.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=249}}{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=254}} The Tuamotu people called Canis Major ''{{lang|pmt|Muihanga-hetika-o-Takurua}}'', &quot;the abiding assemblage of {{lang|mi|Takarua}}&quot;.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=236}}

The Tharumba people of the [[Shoalhaven River]] saw three stars of Canis Major as ''{{lang|dhu|Wunbula}}'' (Bat) and his two wives ''{{lang|dhu|Murrumbool}}'' (Mrs Brown Snake) and ''{{lang|dhu|Moodtha}}'' (Mrs Black Snake); bored of following their husband around, the women try to bury him while he is hunting a wombat down its hole.

Canis Major is a prominent constellation because of its many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky, as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=98–99}} Furthermore, two other stars are thought to have previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at −3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago. Another, [[NR Canis Majoris]], will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.&lt;ref name=&quot;tomkin98&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomkin|first=Jocelyn|date=April 1998|title=Once and Future Celestial Kings|journal=Sky and Telescope|volume=95|issue=4|pages=59–63|bibcode=1998S&amp;T....95d..59T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German cartographer [[Johann Bayer]] used the Greek letters [[Alpha]] through [[Omicron]] to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, including three adjacent stars as Nu and two further pairs as Xi and Omicron,{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} while subsequent observers designated further stars in the southern parts of the constellation that were hard to discern from Central Europe.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=71}} Bayer's countryman [[Johann Elert Bode]] later added Sigma, Tau and Omega;{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}} the French astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] added lettered stars a to k (though none are in use today).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=74}}  [[John Flamsteed]] numbered 31 stars, with 3 Canis Majoris being placed by Lacaille into Columba as [[Delta Columbae]] (Flamsteed had not recognised Columba as a distinct constellation).{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=368}} He also labelled two stars—his [[10 Canis Majoris|10]] and [[Kappa Canis Majoris|13 Canis Majoris]]—as Kappa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Kappa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, but subsequent cartographers such as [[Francis Baily]] and [[John Bevis]] dropped the fainter former star, leaving Kappa&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as the sole Kappa.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=73}} Flamsteed's listing of Nu&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Nu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Nu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Xi&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Xi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Omicron&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Omicron&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have all remained in use.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=73–74}}

Sirius is the [[List of brightest stars|brightest star in the night sky]] at [[apparent magnitude]] −1.46 and one of the [[List of nearest stars|closest stars to Earth]] at a distance of 8.6 [[light-year]]s. Its name comes from the Greek word for &quot;scorching&quot; or &quot;searing&quot;. Sirius is also a [[binary star]]; its companion [[Sirius B]] is a [[white dwarf]] with a magnitude of 8.4–10,000 times fainter than Sirius A to observers on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Holberg | first=J.B. | title=Sirius: Brightest Diamond in the Night Sky | year=2007 | publisher=Praxis Publishing | location=Chichester, United Kingdom | isbn=978-0-387-48941-4 | page=[https://archive.org/details/siriusbrightestd0000holb/page/214 214] | url=https://archive.org/details/siriusbrightestd0000holb/page/214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[orbit]] each other every 50 years.

In 2003, an overdensity of stars in the region was announced to be the [[Canis Major Overdensity|Canis Major Dwarf]], the closest [[satellite galaxy]] to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact a variation in the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way.

* Canis Major is featured in a few episodes of ''[[Martha Speaks (TV series)|Martha Speaks]]''. In the episode ''Dogs in Space'', it is incorrectly referred to as &quot;Martha Supremo&quot;, however, in the episode ''Eyes on the Skies'' (featuring [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]), it is correctly referred to by its name and Sirius is mentioned (only referred to as the Dog Star), exciting Martha.
