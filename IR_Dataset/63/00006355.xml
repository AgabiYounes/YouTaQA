'''Chloroplasts''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɔːr|ə|ˌ|p|l|æ|s|t|s|,_|-|p|l|ɑː|s|t|s}}{{refn|{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Daniel | name-list-format = vanc |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary | veditors = Roach P, Hartmann J, Setter J |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=3-12-539683-2 }}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Chloroplast}}}} are [[organelle]]s that conduct [[photosynthesis]], where the photosynthetic pigment [[chlorophyll]] captures the [[energy]] from [[sunlight]], converts it, and stores it in the energy-storage molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] while freeing [[oxygen]] from water in [[plant cell|plant]] and [[Algae|algal]] cells. They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from [[carbon dioxide]] in a process known as the [[Calvin cycle]]. Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions, including [[fatty acid synthesis]], much [[amino acid]] synthesis, and the [[immune response]] in plants. The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from one, in unicellular algae, up to 100 in plants like ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and [[wheat]].

A chloroplast is a type of organelle known as a [[plastid]], characterized by [[Chloroplast membrane|its two membranes]] and a high concentration of [[chlorophyll]]. Other plastid types, such as the [[leucoplast]] and the [[chromoplast]], contain little chlorophyll and do not carry out photosynthesis.

Chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells, and occasionally [[#Division|pinch in two]] to reproduce. Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity. Chloroplasts, like [[mitochondria]], contain their own [[DNA]], which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic [[cyanobacterium]] that was [[symbiogenesis|engulfed]] by an early [[eukaryotic]] cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Basic Biology | title= Bacteria | date= 18 March 2016 | url=https://basicbiology.net/micro/microorganisms/bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.

With one exception (the [[amoeboid]] ''[[Paulinella]] chromatophora''), all chloroplasts can probably be traced back to a single [[endosymbiotic event]], when a cyanobacterium was engulfed by the eukaryote. Despite this, chloroplasts can be found in an extremely wide set of organisms, some not even directly related to each other—a consequence of many [[secondary endosymbiotic events|secondary]] and even [[tertiary endosymbiotic events]].

The word ''chloroplast'' is derived from the Greek words ''chloros'' (χλωρός), which means green, and ''plastes'' (πλάστης), which means &quot;the one who forms&quot;.&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=chloroplast|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chloroplast&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
The first definitive description of a chloroplast (''Chlorophyllkörnen'', &quot;grain of chlorophyll&quot;) was given by [[Hugo von Mohl]] in 1837 as discrete bodies within the green plant cell.&lt;ref&gt;von Mohl, H. (1835/1837). [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/928#page/3/mode/1up Ueber die Vermehrung der Pflanzen-Zellen durch Teilung]. Dissert. Tubingen 1835. ''Flora'' 1837, .&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883, [[A. F. W. Schimper]] would name these bodies as &quot;chloroplastids&quot; (''Chloroplastiden'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Schimper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Schimper AF |title=Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper|trans-title=About the development of the chlorophyll grains and stains|language=German|journal=Bot.

== Lineages and evolution ==

Chloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell. They are considered to have evolved from [[endosymbiotic]] [[cyanobacteria]]. [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are thought to have come from a similar endosymbiosis event, where an [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[prokaryote]] was engulfed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece&quot; /&gt; This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] in 1905&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mereschkowsky C|title= Über Natur und Ursprung der Chromatophoren im Pflanzenreiche |trans-title=About the nature and origin of chromatophores in the vegetable kingdom |language=German|journal= Biol Centralbl|year=1905|volume=25|pages=593–604 |url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_51353_bernaturundursprungderchromato1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]] observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schimper&quot; /&gt; Chloroplasts are only found in [[plant]]s, [[algae]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberts|first=Bruce| name-list-format = vanc |title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8153-4072-9|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26819/|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[amoeboid]] ''[[Paulinella]] chromatophora''.

They are a diverse [[phylum]] of [[bacteria]] capable of carrying out [[photosynthesis]], and are [[gram-negative]], meaning that they have two cell membranes.

[[Cryptomonad|Cryptophytes]], or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the [[chlorarachniophytes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-historyofplastids&quot; /&gt; Cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes, the outermost of which is continuous with the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]].

Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a [[pyrenoid]] and [[thylakoid]]s in stacks of two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes&quot; /&gt;

Their chloroplasts do not have [[phycobilisomes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes&quot; /&gt; but they do have [[phycobilin pigments]] which they keep in their thylakoid space, rather than anchored on the outside of their thylakoid membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-historyofplastids&quot; /&gt;

===== Apicomplexans, chromerids, and dinophytes=====

The alveolates are a major clade of unicellular eukaryotes of both autotrophic and heterotrophic members. The most notable shared characteristic is the presence of cortical (outer-region) alveoli (sacs). These are flattened vesicles (sacs) packed into a continuous layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically forming a flexible pellicle (thin skin). In dinoflagellates they often form armor plates. Many members contain a red-algal derived plastid. One notable characteristic of this diverse group is the frequent loss of photosynthesis. However, a majority of these heterotrophs continue to process a non-photosynthetic plastid.&lt;ref name=&quot;transitions in dinoflagellate&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janouškovec J, Gavelis GS, Burki F, Dinh D, Bachvaroff TR, Gornik SG, Bright KJ, Imanian B, Strom SL, Delwiche CF, Waller RF, Fensome RA, Leander BS, Rohwer FL, Saldarriaga JF | display-authors = 6 | title = Major transitions in dinoflagellate evolution unveiled by phylotranscriptomics | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages = E171–E180 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28028238 | pmc = 5240707 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1614842114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cryptophyte-derived dinophyte chloroplast ====

Members of the genus ''[[Dinophysis]]'' have a [[phycobilin]]-containing&lt;ref name=&quot;MBE—Fucoxanthin-chloroplasts&quot; /&gt; chloroplast taken from a [[cryptomonad|cryptophyte]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-historyofplastids&quot; /&gt; However, the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast seems to have been taken, and the chloroplast has been stripped of its [[nucleomorph]] and outermost two membranes, leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast. Cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to maintain themselves, and ''Dinophysis'' species grown in [[cell culture]] alone cannot survive, so it is possible (but not confirmed) that the ''Dinophysis'' chloroplast is a [[kleptoplast]]—if so, ''Dinophysis'' chloroplasts wear out and ''Dinophysis'' species must continually engulf cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts to replace the old ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB—Dinoflagellates&quot; /&gt;

As the D-loop moves through the circular DNA, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a Cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA&quot;/&gt; Transcription starts at specific points of origin. Multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA. As replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. The new cpDNA structures separate, creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.

In addition to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of [[deamination]] seen in cpDNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnan&quot;/&gt; Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes [[hypoxanthine]]. Hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC (thus, an A → G base change).&lt;ref name=Biocyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Effect of chemical mutagens on nucleotide sequence|url=http://www.biocyclopedia.com/index/genetics/mutations_molecular_level_mechanism/effect_of_chemical_mutagens_on_nucleotide_sequence.php|website=Biocyclopedia|access-date=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Adenine Deaminates to Guanine.png|thumb|left|400px|Over time, base changes in the DNA sequence can arise from deamination mutations. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine, which can pair with cytosine. During replication, the cytosine will pair with guanine, causing an A --&gt; G base change.]]

===Deamination===
In cpDNA, there are several A → G deamination gradients. DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded. When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A → G deamination. Therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time).&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnan&quot;/&gt; This mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination. It further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA&quot;/&gt;

===Alternative model of replication===
One of competing model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in [[homologous recombination]] and replication structures similar to the linear and circular DNA structures of  [[bacteriophage T4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4580243&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein H, Bernstein C | title = Circular and branched circular concatenates as possible intermediates in bacteriophage T4 DNA replication | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 355–61 | date = July 1973 | pmid = 4580243 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(73)90443-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been established that some plants have linear cpDNA, such as maize, and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA&quot;/&gt; When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA&quot;/&gt; If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles, then a D-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Linear chloroplast DNA&quot;/&gt; At the same time, homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A --&gt; G gradients seen in plastomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishnan&quot;/&gt; Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA, the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.

=== Gene content and protein synthesis ===

The chloroplast genome most commonly includes around 100 genes&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastOrigin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McFadden GI | title = Chloroplast origin and integration | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–3 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11154294 | pmc = 1539323 | doi = 10.1104/pp.125.1.50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-RatesofctDNAevolution&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clegg MT, Gaut BS, Learn GH, Morton BR | title = Rates and patterns of chloroplast DNA evolution | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 15 | pages = 6795–801 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 8041699 | pmc = 44285 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6795 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6795C }}&lt;/ref&gt; that code for a variety of things, mostly to do with the [[protein synthesis|protein pipeline]] and [[photosynthesis]]. As in [[prokaryotes]], genes in chloroplast DNA are organized into [[operons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastOrigin&quot; /&gt; Unlike [[prokaryotic]] DNA molecules, chloroplast DNA molecules contain [[introns]] (plant [[mitochondrial DNA]]s do too, but not human mtDNAs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular biology of the cell—The Genetic Systems of Mitochondria and Plastids&quot; /&gt;

Among land plants, the contents of the chloroplast genome are fairly similar.&lt;ref name=AmericanJournalofBotany /&gt;

==== Chloroplast genome reduction and gene transfer ====

Over time, many parts of the chloroplast genome were transferred to the [[nuclear genome]] of the host,&lt;ref name=BioscienceExplained /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-RatesofctDNAevolution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang CY, Ayliffe MA, Timmis JN | title = Direct measurement of the transfer rate of chloroplast DNA into the nucleus | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6927 | pages = 72–6 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12594458 | doi = 10.1038/nature01435 | bibcode = 2003Natur.422...72H }}&lt;/ref&gt; a process called ''[[endosymbiotic gene transfer]]''. As a result, the chloroplast genome is heavily [[genome reduction|reduced]] compared to that of free-living cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts may contain 60–100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often have more than 1500 genes in their genome.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin W, Rujan T, Richly E, Hansen A, Cornelsen S, Lins T, Leister D, Stoebe B, Hasegawa M, Penny D | display-authors = 6 | title = Evolutionary analysis of Arabidopsis, cyanobacterial, and chloroplast genomes reveals plastid phylogeny and thousands of cyanobacterial genes in the nucleus | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 19 | pages = 12246–51 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12218172 | pmc = 129430 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.182432999 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9912246M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, a plastid without a genome was found, demonstrating chloroplasts can lose their genome during endosymbiotic the gene transfer process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith DR, Lee RW | title = A plastid without a genome: evidence from the nonphotosynthetic green algal genus Polytomella | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 164 | issue = 4 | pages = 1812–9 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24563281 | pmc = 3982744 | doi = 10.1104/pp.113.233718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the [[Chloroplast#Secondary and tertiary endosymbiosis|lost chloroplasts]] in many CASH lineages. Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence. For example, while [[diatoms]] (a [[heterokontophyte]]) now have a [[red algal derived chloroplast]], the presence of many [[green algal]] genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor had a [[green algal derived chloroplast]] at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science—Prasinophytes in chromalveolates&quot; /&gt;

In land plants, some 11–14% of the DNA in their nuclei can be traced back to the chloroplast,&lt;ref name=&quot;MolecularBiologyEvol-EndosymbioticGeneTransfer&quot; /&gt; up to 18% in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', corresponding to about 4,500 protein-coding genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Biology—Algal genomics&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archibald JM | title = Algal genomics: exploring the imprint of endosymbiosis | journal = Current Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 24 | pages = R1033-5 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17174910 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a few recent transfers of genes from the chloroplast DNA to the nuclear genome in land plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-RatesofctDNAevolution&quot; /&gt;

Of the approximately 3000 proteins found in chloroplasts, some 95% of them are encoded by nuclear genes. Many of the chloroplast's protein complexes consist of subunits from both the chloroplast genome and the host's nuclear genome. As a result, [[protein synthesis]] must be coordinated between the chloroplast and the nucleus. The chloroplast is mostly under nuclear control, though chloroplasts can also give out signals regulating [[gene expression]] in the nucleus, called ''[[retrograde signaling (cell biology)|retrograde signaling]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science-ChloroplastSignals-NuclearGeneExpression&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koussevitzky S, Nott A, Mockler TC, Hong F, Sachetto-Martins G, Surpin M, Lim J, Mittler R, Chory J | display-authors = 6 | title = Signals from chloroplasts converge to regulate nuclear gene expression | journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = 5825 | pages = 715–9 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17395793 | doi = 10.1126/science | url = https://eprints.utas.edu.au/2614/1/Science2007.pdf | bibcode = 2007Sci...316..715K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protein synthesis ====
{{See also|transcription (genetics)|Translation (biology)|label 1=Transcription|label 2=translation}}
Protein synthesis within chloroplasts relies on two [[RNA polymerase]]s. One is coded by the chloroplast DNA, the other is of [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] origin. The two RNA polymerases may recognize and bind to different kinds of [[promoter (genetics)|promoters]] within the chloroplast genome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science-ChloroplastRNAPolymerases&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hedtke B, Börner T, Weihe A | title = Mitochondrial and chloroplast phage-type RNA polymerases in Arabidopsis | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5327 | pages = 809–11 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9242608 | doi = 10.1126/science.277.5327.809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ribosome]]s in chloroplasts are similar to bacterial ribosomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASM-ChloroplastRibosomesandProteinSynthesis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris EH, Boynton JE, Gillham NW | title = Chloroplast ribosomes and protein synthesis | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 4 | pages = 700–54 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7854253 | pmc = 372988 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.58.4.700-754.1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protein targeting and import ===
{{See also|Translation (biology)|label 1=Translation}}
Because so many chloroplast genes have been moved to the nucleus, many [[protein]]s that would originally have been [[Translation (biology)|translated]] in the chloroplast are now synthesized in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. These proteins must be directed back to the chloroplast, and imported through at least two chloroplast membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature—Protein import&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soll J, Schleiff E | title = Protein import into chloroplasts | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 198–208 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14991000 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1333 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became [[exaptations]], taking on new functions like participating in [[cell division]], [[protein routing]], and even [[disease resistance]]. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the [[mitochondrial genome]]—most became nonfunctional [[pseudogenes]], though a few [[tRNA]] genes still work in the [[mitochondrion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis&quot; /&gt; Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the [[secretory pathway]]&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS—Cyanobacterial genes in Arabidopsis&quot; /&gt; though many [[#Secondary_and_tertiary_endosymbiosis|secondary plastids]] are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's [[cell membrane]], and therefore [[topologically]] outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the [[cytosol]], you have to cross the [[cell membrane]], just like if you were headed for the [[extracellular space]]. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSTB—Endosymbiosis of plastids&quot; /&gt;

Because the cell acquiring a chloroplast [[Chloroplast#Primary endosymbiosis|already]] had [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (and [[peroxisomes]], and a [[cell membrane]] for secretion), the new chloroplast host had to develop a unique [[protein targeting system]] to avoid having chloroplast proteins being sent to the wrong [[organelle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature—Protein import&quot; /&gt;

In most, but not all cases, nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are [[Translation (biology)|translated]] with a ''[[cleavable transit peptide]]'' that's added to the N-terminus of the protein precursor. Sometimes the transit sequence is found on the C-terminus of the protein,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—C-terminal transit sequences&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lung SC, Chuong SD | title = A transit peptide-like sorting signal at the C terminus directs the Bienertia sinuspersici preprotein receptor Toc159 to the chloroplast outer membrane | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 1560–78 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22517318 | pmc = 3398564 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.112.096248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or within the functional part of the protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature—Protein import&quot; /&gt;

There are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast membranes. The fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic [[cyanobacteria]]. This is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host's [[cell membrane]] infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral [[cyanobacterium]]—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the cyanobacterium's original double membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-historyofplastids&quot; /&gt;

The chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] double membrane. This is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run [[proton pumps]] and carry out [[oxidative phosphorylation]] across to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy. The only chloroplast structure that can considered [[analogy (biology)|analogous]] to it is the internal thylakoid system. Even so, in terms of &quot;in-out&quot;, the direction of chloroplast [[hydronium|H{{sup|+}}]] ion flow is in the opposite direction compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA, Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB |title=Biology | edition = 8th | year=2009 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson) | pages=196–197 | isbn = 978-0-8053-6844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in terms of function, the inner chloroplast membrane, which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials, has no counterpart in the mitochondrion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt;

The outer chloroplast membrane is a semi-porous membrane that small molecules and [[ions]] can easily diffuse across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike H, Yoshio M, Kashino Y, Satoh K | title = Polypeptide composition of envelopes of spinach chloroplasts: two major proteins occupy 90% of outer envelope membranes | journal = Plant &amp; Cell Physiology | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 526–32 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9664716 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not permeable to larger [[protein]]s, so chloroplast [[polypeptides]] being synthesized in the cell [[cytoplasm]] must be transported across the outer chloroplast membrane by the [[TOC complex]], or ''[[translocon|'''t'''ranslocon]] on the '''o'''uter '''c'''hloroplast'' membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature—Protein import&quot; /&gt;

The chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm, forming a [[stromule]], or [[stroma (fluid)|'''strom'''a]]-containing tub'''ule'''. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other [[plastids]] like [[chromoplasts]] and [[amyloplasts]] in petals and roots, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Köhler2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Köhler RH, Hanson MR | title = Plastid tubules of higher plants are tissue-specific and developmentally regulated | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 113 ( Pt 1) | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 81–9 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10591627 | url = http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10591627 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160920012721/http://jcs.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10591627 | archive-date = 20 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gray JC, Sullivan JA, Hibberd JM, Hansen MR |title=Stromules: mobile protrusions and interconnections between plastids |journal=Plant Biology |volume=3 |issue=3|pages=223–33 |year=2001 |doi=10.1055/s-2001-15204}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may exist to increase the chloroplast's [[surface area to volume ratio|surface area]] for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched and tangled with the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant Physiology—Stromule branching&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schattat M, Barton K, Baudisch B, Klösgen RB, Mathur J | title = Plastid stromule branching coincides with contiguous endoplasmic reticulum dynamics | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 1667–77 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21273446 | pmc = 3091094 | doi = 10.1104/pp.110.170480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or [[dividing chloroplasts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—No plastid networks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schattat MH, Griffiths S, Mathur N, Barton K, Wozny MR, Dunn N, Greenwood JS, Mathur J | display-authors = 6 | title = Differential coloring reveals that plastids do not form networks for exchanging macromolecules | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 1465–77 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22474180 | pmc = 3398557 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.111.095398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a growing body of evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunkard JO, Runkel AM, Zambryski PC | title = Chloroplasts extend stromules independently and in response to internal redox signals | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 32 | pages = 10044–9 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26150490 | pmc = 4538653 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1511570112 | bibcode = 2015PNAS..11210044B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermembrane space and peptidoglycan wall ===
[[File:Glaucocystis sp.jpg|thumb|Instead of an intermembrane space, [[glaucophyte algae]] have a [[peptidoglycan wall]] between their inner and outer chloroplast membranes.]]

Usually, a thin intermembrane space about 10–20 [[nanometers]] thick exists between the outer and inner chloroplast membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy | name-list-format = vanc |title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-31611-1|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glaucophyte algal]] chloroplasts have a [[peptidoglycan]] layer between the chloroplast membranes. It corresponds to the [[peptidoglycan cell wall]] of their [[cyanobacterial]] ancestors, which is located between their two cell membranes. These chloroplasts are called ''muroplasts'' (from Latin ''&quot;mura&quot;'', meaning &quot;wall&quot;). Other chloroplasts have lost the cyanobacterial wall, leaving an intermembrane space between the two chloroplast envelope membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt;

=== Inner chloroplast membrane ===

{{Main|Chloroplast membrane}}

The inner chloroplast membrane borders the stroma and regulates passage of materials in and out of the chloroplast. After passing through the [[TOC complex]] in the outer chloroplast membrane, [[polypeptides]] must pass through the [[TIC complex]] ''([[translocon|'''t'''ranslocon]] on the '''i'''nner '''c'''hloroplast membrane)'' which is located in the inner chloroplast membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nature—Protein import&quot; /&gt;

In addition to regulating the passage of materials, the inner chloroplast membrane is where [[fatty acid]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[carotenoid]]s are synthesized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt;

==== Peripheral reticulum ====
Some chloroplasts contain a structure called the [[chloroplast peripheral reticulum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt; It is often found in the chloroplasts of [[C4 plant|{{C4}} plants]], though it has also been found in some {{C3}} [[angiosperms]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt; and even some [[gymnosperm]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewPhytologist-GymnospermPeripheralReticulum&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whatley|first=Jean M | name-list-format = vanc |title=The occurrence of a peripheral reticulum in plastids of the gymnosperm Welwitschia mirabilis|journal=New Phytologist|date=5 July 1994|volume=74|issue=2|pages=215–220|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1975.tb02608.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the [[inner chloroplast membrane]] that extends into the internal [[stroma (fluid)|stromal]] fluid of the chloroplast. Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast's [[surface area to volume ratio|surface area]] for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell [[cytoplasm]]. The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as [[transport vesicles]] to shuttle stuff between the [[thylakoid]]s and intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=StructureandFunctionofPlastids /&gt;

=== Stroma ===
{{Main|Stroma (fluid)|l1=Stroma}}

The [[protein]]-rich,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt; [[alkaline]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot; /&gt; [[aqueous]] fluid within the inner chloroplast membrane and outside of the thylakoid space is called the stroma,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt; which corresponds to the [[cytosol]] of the original [[cyanobacterium]]. [[Nucleoid]]s of [[chloroplast DNA]], chloroplast [[ribosome]]s, the thylakoid system with [[plastoglobuli]], [[starch]] granules, and many [[protein]]s can be found floating around in it. The [[Calvin cycle]], which fixes [[CO2|CO{{sub|2}}]] into [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|G3P]] takes place in the stroma.

==== Chloroplast ribosomes ====
{{plain image|File:Chloroplast and bacterial ribosome comparison.png|'''Chloroplast ribosomes''' Comparison of a chloroplast ribosome (green) and a bacterial ribosome (yellow). Important features common to both ribosomes and chloroplast-unique features are labeled.|300px|right|bottom|triangle|#cec51b}}
Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes, which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins. Chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of [[Eukaryotic Ribosome (80S)|cytoplasmic ribosomes]] (around 17 [[Nanometre|nm]] vs 25 [[Nanometre|nm]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt; They take [[mRNAs]] transcribed from the [[chloroplast DNA]] and [[translation (biology)|translate]] them into protein. While similar to [[bacterial ribosomes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece&quot; /&gt; chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria, so chloroplast ribosomes include some chloroplast-unique features.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLoS—Chloroplast ribosomes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manuell AL, Quispe J, Mayfield SP | title = Structure of the chloroplast ribosome: novel domains for translation regulation | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = e209 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17683199 | pmc = 1939882 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plastoglobuli ====

Plastoglobuli ('''singular''' ''plastoglobulus'', sometimes spelled ''plastoglobule(s)''), are spherical bubbles of [[lipid]]s and [[protein]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt; about 45–60 nanometers across.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt; They are surrounded by a [[lipid monolayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt; Plastoglobuli are found in all chloroplasts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt; but become more common when the chloroplast is under [[oxidative stress]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Austin JR, Frost E, Vidi PA, Kessler F, Staehelin LA | title = Plastoglobules are lipoprotein subcompartments of the chloroplast that are permanently coupled to thylakoid membranes and contain biosynthetic enzymes | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 1693–703 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16731586 | pmc = 1488921 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.105.039859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or when it ages and transitions into a [[gerontoplast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise—Plastid diversity&quot; /&gt; Plastoglobuli also exhibit a greater size variation under these conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt; They are also common in [[etioplasts]], but decrease in number as the etioplasts mature into chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt;

Plastoglubuli contain both structural proteins and enzymes involved in [[lipid synthesis]] and [[metabolism]]. They contain many types of [[lipid]]s including [[plastoquinone]], [[vitamin E]], [[carotenoid]]s and [[chlorophylls]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt;

Plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]], but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a [[thylakoid]] or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid, a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt; In normal green chloroplasts, the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly, attached directly to their parent thylakoid. In old or stressed chloroplasts, plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains, still always anchored to a thylakoid.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt;

Plastoglobuli form when a bubble appears between the layers of the [[lipid bilayer]] of the thylakoid membrane, or bud from existing plastoglubuli—though they never detach and float off into the stroma.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt; Practically all plastoglobuli form on or near the highly curved edges of the [[thylakoid]] disks or sheets. They are also more common on stromal thylakoids than on [[granum|granal]] ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Plastoglobuli&quot; /&gt;

==== Starch granules ====
[[Starch granules]] are very common in chloroplasts, typically taking up 15% of the organelle's volume,&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant Physiology—Starch granules in Arabidopsis&quot; /&gt; though in some other plastids like [[amyloplasts]], they can be big enough to distort the shape of the organelle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt; Starch granules are simply accumulations of starch in the stroma, and are not bounded by a membrane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt;

Starch granules appear and grow throughout the day, as the chloroplast synthesizes [[sugars]], and are consumed at night to fuel [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] and continue sugar export into the [[phloem]],&lt;ref name=&quot;FPB—Starch breakdown&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeeman SC, Delatte T, Messerli G, Umhang M, Stettler M, Mettler T, Streb S, Reinhold H, Kötting O |doi=10.1071/FP06313 |title=Starch breakdown: Recent discoveries suggest distinct pathways and novel mechanisms |year=2007  |journal=Functional Plant Biology |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=465–73|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/93f1adaa820802f4dccaec3e5fab2346dfe60740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though in mature chloroplasts, it is rare for a starch granule to be completely consumed or for a new granule to accumulate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant Physiology—Starch granules in Arabidopsis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crumpton-Taylor M, Grandison S, Png KM, Bushby AJ, Smith AM | title = Control of starch granule numbers in Arabidopsis chloroplasts | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 158 | issue = 2 | pages = 905–16 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22135430 | pmc = 3271777 | doi = 10.1104/pp.111.186957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch granules vary in composition and location across different chloroplast lineages. In [[red algae]], starch granules are found in the [[cytoplasm]] rather than in the chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria—Starch&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Rochaix JD |title=The molecular biology of chloroplasts and mitochondria in Chlamydomonas|year=1998|publisher=Kluwer Acad.

{{plain image|File:Rubisco.png|'''RuBisCO''', shown here in a [[space-filling model]], is the main enzyme responsible for [[carbon fixation]] in chloroplasts.|300px|right|top|triangle|#aaa}}
{{Main|RuBisCO}}
The chloroplast stroma contains many proteins, though the most common and important is [[RuBisCO]], which is probably also the most abundant protein on the planet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot; /&gt; [[RuBisCO]] is the enzyme that fixes [[CO2|CO{{sub|2}}]] into sugar molecules.

=== Thylakoid system ===
[[File:Chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 85000x.png|thumb|right|[[Transmission electron microscope]] image of some thylakoids arranged in grana stacks and lamellæ. Plastoglobuli (dark blobs) are also present.]]

{{Main|Thylakoid}}

Suspended within the chloroplast stroma is the [[thylakoid]] system, a highly dynamic collection of membranous sacks called [[thylakoid]]s where [[chlorophyll]] is found and the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]] happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology8th-Campbell&amp;Reece-186-187&quot; /&gt;
In most [[vascular plant]] chloroplasts, the thylakoids are arranged in stacks called grana,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system&quot; /&gt; though in certain [[C4 plant|{{C4}} plant]] chloroplasts&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantCellBiology-C4&quot; /&gt; and some [[algal]] chloroplasts, the thylakoids are free floating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Springer—The Chloroplast—Chloroplast shapes&quot; /&gt;

==== Granal structure ====
Using a [[light microscope]], it is just barely possible to see tiny green granules—which were named [[Thylakoid|grana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt; With [[electron microscopy]], it became possible to see the thylakoid system in more detail, revealing it to consist of stacks of flat [[thylakoid]]s which made up the grana, and long interconnecting stromal thylakoids which linked different grana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt;
In the [[transmission electron microscope]], thylakoid membranes appear as alternating light-and-dark bands, 8.5 nanometers thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt;

For a long time, the three-dimensional structure of the thylakoid system has been unknown or disputed. One model has the granum as a stack of thylakoids linked by [[Helix|helical]] stromal thylakoids; the other has the granum as a single folded thylakoid connected in a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; way to other grana by stromal thylakoids. While the thylakoid system is still commonly depicted according to the folded thylakoid model,&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology8th-Campbell&amp;Reece-186-187&quot; /&gt; it was determined in 2011 that the stacked and helical thylakoids model is correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant Physiology—Granal structure&quot; /&gt;

In the helical thylakoid model, grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids,&lt;ref name=&quot;Introduction to Plant Cell Development—Chloroplast structure 46&quot; /&gt; though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mustárdy L, Buttle K, Steinbach G, Garab G | title = The three-dimensional network of the thylakoid membranes in plants: quasihelical model of the granum-stroma assembly | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 2552–7 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18952780 | pmc = 2590735 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.108.059147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrapped around the grana are [[helicoid]] stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or [[lamellar]] thylakoids.

The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant Physiology—Granal structure&quot; /&gt; While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system&quot; /&gt;

Thylakoids (sometimes spelled ''thylakoïds''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Infanger S, Bischof S, Hiltbrunner A, Agne B, Baginsky S, Kessler F | title = The chloroplast import receptor Toc90 partially restores the accumulation of Toc159 client proteins in the Arabidopsis thaliana ppi2 mutant | journal = Molecular Plant | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 252–63 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21220583 | doi = 10.1093/mp/ssq071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are small interconnected sacks which contain the membranes that the [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis take place on. The word ''thylakoid'' comes from the Greek word ''thylakos'' which means &quot;sack&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=thylakoid|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thylakoid|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are important [[protein complexes]] which carry out the [[light reactions]] of [[photosynthesis]]. [[Photosystem II]] and [[photosystem I]] contain [[light-harvesting complexes]] with [[chlorophyll]] and [[carotenoid]]s that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump [[hydrogen ions]] into the thylakoid space, decreasing the [[pH]] and turning it acidic. [[ATP synthase]] is a large protein complex that harnesses the [[concentration gradient]] of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot; /&gt;

There are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]]. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are [[helicoid]] sheets that spiral around grana.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system&quot; /&gt; The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat [[photosystem II]] protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and [[surface area]] for light capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system&quot; /&gt;

In contrast, [[photosystem I]] and [[ATP synthase]] are large protein complexes which jut out into the stroma. They can't fit in the appressed granal membranes, and so are found in the stromal thylakoid membrane—the edges of the granal thylakoid disks and the stromal thylakoids. These large protein complexes may act as spacers between the sheets of stromal thylakoids.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Plant Cell—Thylakoid system&quot; /&gt;

The number of thylakoids and the total thylakoid area of a chloroplast is influenced by light exposure. Shaded chloroplasts contain larger and more [[Thylakoid|grana]] with more thylakoid membrane area than chloroplasts exposed to bright light, which have smaller and fewer grana and less thylakoid area. Thylakoid extent can change within minutes of light exposure or removal.&lt;ref name=StructureandFunctionofPlastids /&gt;

==== Pigments and chloroplast colors ====

Inside the photosystems embedded in chloroplast thylakoid membranes are various [[photosynthetic pigment]]s, which absorb and transfer [[light energy]]. The types of pigments found are different in various groups of chloroplasts, and are responsible for a wide variety of chloroplast colorations.

=== Specialized chloroplasts in {{C4}} plants ===
{{Plain image|File:C4 photosynthesis is less complicated.svg|Many [[C4 plant|{{C4}} plants]] have their [[Mesophyll tissue|mesophyll cells]] and [[bundle sheath cells]] arranged radially around their [[leaf veins]]. The two types of cells contain different types of chloroplasts specialized for a particular part of [[photosynthesis]].|500px|right|bottom|triangle|#00cd4c}}

{{See also|Photosynthesis|C4 carbon fixation|label 2={{C4}} photosynthesis}}

To fix [[carbon dioxide]] into sugar molecules in the process of [[photosynthesis]], chloroplasts use an enzyme called [[RuBisCO]]. RuBisCO has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]], so at high oxygen concentrations, RuBisCO starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors. This has the end result of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] energy being wasted and {{CO2}} being released, all with no sugar being produced. This is a big problem, since O{{sub|2}} is produced by the initial [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis, causing issues down the line in the [[Calvin cycle]] which uses RuBisCO.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece-200-201&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA, Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB |title=Biology | edition = 8th | year=2009 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson) | pages=200–201 | isbn = 978-0-8053-6844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C4 plants|{{C4}} plants]] evolved a way to solve this—by spatially separating the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions, which store light energy in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]], are done in the [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells of a {{C4}} leaf. The Calvin cycle, which uses the stored energy to make sugar using RuBisCO, is done in the [[bundle sheath cells]], a layer of cells surrounding a [[vein (botany)|vein]] in a [[leaf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece-200-201&quot; /&gt;

As a result, chloroplasts in {{C4}} mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions, so they lack [[RuBisCO]], and have normal [[Thylakoid|grana]] and [[thylakoid]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantCellBiology-C4&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Brian E S | last1 = Gunning | first2 = Martin W | last2 = Steer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Plant cell biology : structure and function|year=1996|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0-86720-504-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/plantcellbiology00gunn_0/page/n137 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/plantcellbiology00gunn_0| url-access = registration }}&lt;/ref&gt; which they use to make ATP and NADPH, as well as oxygen. They store {{CO2}} in a four-carbon compound, which is why the process is called [[C4 carbon fixation|''{{C4}} photosynthesis'']]. The four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts, where it drops off {{CO2}} and returns to the mesophyll.

=== Distribution in a plant ===
Not all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts. All green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the [[chlorophyll]] in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology8th-Campbell&amp;Reece-186-187&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA, Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB |title=Biology | edition = 8th | year=2009 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson) | pages=186–187 | isbn = 978-0-8053-6844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[plant cells]] which contain chloroplasts are usually [[parenchyma]] cells, though chloroplasts can also be found in [[collenchyma]] tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first= Keith | name-list-format = vanc |title=Handbook of plant science|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, West Sussex, England|isbn=978-0-470-05723-0|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucilIjrex5cC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a [[chlorenchyma]] cell. A typical [[chlorenchyma]] cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.

In some plants such as [[cacti]], chloroplasts are found in the [[Plant stem|stems]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Campbell NA, Reece JB, Urry LA, Cain ML, Wasserman, Minorsky PV, Jackson RB |title=Biology | edition = 8th | year=2009 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings (Pearson) | page = 742 | isbn = 978-0-8053-6844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though in most plants, chloroplasts are concentrated in the [[leaves]]. One square [[millimeter]] of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology8th-Campbell&amp;Reece-186-187&quot; /&gt; Within a leaf, chloroplasts are mainly found in the [[Mesophyll cell|mesophyll]] layers of a [[leaf]], and the [[guard cells]] of [[stomata]]. [[Palisade mesophyll]] cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell, while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell, as well as much less [[chlorophyll]]. Chloroplasts can also be found in the [[bundle sheath]] cells of a leaf, especially in [[C4 plants|C{{sub|4}} plants]], which carry out the [[Calvin cycle]] in their bundle sheath cells. They are often absent from the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of a leaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Lawson T. and J. I. L. Morison. Essay 10.1 Guard Cell Photosynthesis.

==== Chloroplast movement ====

{{plain image|File:Chloroplast movement.svg|When chloroplasts are exposed to direct sunlight, they stack along the [[wikt:anticlinal|anticlinal cell walls]] to minimize exposure. In the dark they spread out in sheets along the [[wikt:periclinal|periclinal walls]] to maximize light absorption.|460px|right|bottom|triangle|#3fbceb}}

{{See also|Cytoplasmic streaming}}
The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's [[cell wall]] or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from [[photooxidative damage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastMovement&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 540263|year = 1979|last1 = Wells|first1 = C.|title = The mitogenic activity of lipopolysaccharide for spleen cells from germfree, conventional, and gnotobiotic rats|journal = Canadian Journal of Microbiology|volume = 25|issue = 9|pages = 1087–93|last2 = Balish|first2 = E.|doi = 10.1139/m79-166}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;
Chloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulus-response systems that can be found in plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantCellPhysiology-MicrofilamentAnchors&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029334 |title=Microfilaments Anchor Chloroplasts along the Outer Periclinal Wall in Vallisneria Epidermal Cells through Cooperation of PFR and Photosynthesis |year=1998 | vauthors = Dong XJ, Nagai R, Takagi S |journal=Plant and Cell Physiology |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=1299–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovement&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takagi S | title = Actin-based photo-orientation movement of chloroplasts in plant cells | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 206 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 1963–9 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12756277 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.00215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In higher plants, chloroplast movement is run by [[phototropins]], blue light [[Photoreceptor protein|photoreceptors]] also responsible for plant [[phototropism]]. In some algae, [[mosses]], [[fern]]s, and [[flowering plants]], chloroplast movement is influenced by red light in addition to blue light,&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastMovement&quot; /&gt; though very long red wavelengths inhibit movement rather than speeding it up. Blue light generally causes chloroplasts to seek shelter, while red light draws them out to maximize light absorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;JEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovement&quot; /&gt;

Studies of ''[[Vallisneria gigantea]]'', an aquatic [[flowering plant]], have shown that chloroplasts can get moving within five minutes of light exposure, though they don't initially show any net directionality. They may move along [[microfilament]] tracks, and the fact that the microfilament mesh changes shape to form a honeycomb structure surrounding the chloroplasts after they have moved suggests that microfilaments may help to anchor chloroplasts in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantCellPhysiology-MicrofilamentAnchors&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JEB-ActinBasedChloroplastMovement&quot; /&gt;

=== Guard cell chloroplasts ===
{{expand section|determined functions, controversial functions, characteristics and population|date=August 2013}}

Unlike most epidermal cells, the [[guard cells]] of plant [[stomata]] contain relatively well-developed chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; However, exactly what they do is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Zeiger E, Talbott LD, Frechilla S, Srivastava A, Zhu J | title = The guard cell chloroplast: A perspective for the twenty-first century | doi = 10.1046/j.0028-646X.2001.NPH328.doc.x | journal = New Phytologist | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–424 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plant innate immunity ===

[[Plants]] lack specialized [[immune cells]]—all plant cells participate in the plant [[plant innate immunity|immune response]]. Chloroplasts, along with the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], [[cell membrane]], and [[endoplasmic reticulum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MPMI-AllHandsonDeck&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Padmanabhan MS, Dinesh-Kumar SP | title = All hands on deck—the role of chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nucleus in driving plant innate immunity | journal = Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 1368–80 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20923348 | doi = 10.1094/MPMI-05-10-0113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are key players in [[pathogen]] defense. Due to its role in a plant cell's immune response, pathogens frequently target the chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPMI-AllHandsonDeck&quot; /&gt;

Plants have two main immune responses—the [[hypersensitive response]], in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo [[programmed cell death]], and [[systemic acquired resistance]], where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen's presence.
Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system, producing [[reactive oxygen species]]. High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the [[hypersensitive response]]. The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell. Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate [[systemic acquired resistance]], triggering defense-molecule production in the rest of the plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPMI-AllHandsonDeck&quot; /&gt;

In some plants, chloroplasts are known to move closer to the infection site and the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] during an infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPMI-AllHandsonDeck&quot; /&gt;

Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like [[salicylic acid]], [[jasmonic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[reactive oxygen species]] which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate [[retrograde signaling (cell biology)|retrograde signaling]]—signals from the chloroplast that regulate [[gene expression]] in the nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;MPMI-AllHandsonDeck&quot; /&gt;

In addition to defense signaling, chloroplasts, with the help of the [[peroxisome]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;katsir&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Katsir L, Chung HS, Koo AJ, Howe GA | title = Jasmonate signaling: a conserved mechanism of hormone sensing | journal = Current Opinion in Plant Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 428–35 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18583180 | pmc = 2560989 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbi.2008.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; help synthesize an important defense molecule, [[jasmonate]].

=== Photosynthesis ===
{{Main|Photosynthesis}}

One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in [[photosynthesis]], the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy, to subsequently produce food in the form of [[sugars]]. [[Water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are used in photosynthesis, and sugar and [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is made, using [[light energy]]. Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the [[light reactions]], where water is split to produce oxygen, and the [[dark reactions]], or [[Calvin cycle]], which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. The two phases are linked by the energy carriers [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Neil A. |first2=Brad |last2=Williamson |first3=Robin J. |last3=Heyden | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |pages= |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Light reactions ====
{{Plain image|File:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|The [[light reactions]] of photosynthesis take place across the [[thylakoid]] membranes.&lt;!-- [[Photosystem&amp;nbsp;II]] is usually found in the appressed thylakoid membranes between stacked granal thylakoids, while [[photosystem&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[ATP synthase]] is found in portions of the thylakoid membrane in contact with the stroma.--&gt;|450px|right|top|triangle|#ccc}}
{{Main|Light reactions}}
The light reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. They take [[light energy]] and store it in [[NADPH]], a form of NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to fuel the [[dark reactions]].

===== Energy carriers =====
{{Main|Adenosine triphosphate|NADPH}}
ATP is the phosphorylated version of [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP), which stores energy in a cell and powers most cellular activities. ATP is the energized form, while ADP is the (partially) depleted form. NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is an electron carrier which ferries high energy electrons. In the light reactions, it gets [[redox reaction|reduced]], meaning it picks up electrons, becoming [[NADPH]].

===== Photophosphorylation =====
{{Main|Photophosphorylation}}

Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the [[potential energy]] stored in an [[Hydron (chemistry)|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two [[photosystems]] capture light energy to energize [[electrons]] taken from [[water]], and release them down an [[electron transport chain]]. The [[Plastoquinone|molecules]] between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a [[concentration gradient]], with more hydrogen ions (up to a thousand times as many)&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot; /&gt; inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then [[diffuse]] back down their concentration gradient, flowing back out into the stroma through [[ATP synthase]]. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to [[phosphorylate]] [[adenosine diphosphate]] into [[adenosine triphosphate]], or ATP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jagendorf AT, Uribe E | title = ATP formation caused by acid-base transition of spinach chloroplasts | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 170–7 | date = January 1966 | pmid = 5220864 | pmc = 285771 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.55.1.170 | bibcode = 1966PNAS...55..170J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position to be used in the dark reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry—Proton gradient&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Jeremy M | last1 = Berg | first2 = John L | last2 = Tymoczko | first3 = Lubert | last3 = Stryer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biochemistry|year=2002|publisher=W.

===== NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction =====
{{See also|Redox reaction}}

[[Electrons]] are often removed from the [[electron transport chains]] to charge [[NADP+|NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] with electrons, [[reduction reaction|reducing]] it to [[NADPH]]. Like ATP synthase, [[ferredoxin—NADP+ reductase|ferredoxin-NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reductase]], the enzyme that reduces NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, releases the NADPH it makes into the stroma, right where it is needed for the dark reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry—Proton gradient&quot; /&gt;

Because NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction removes electrons from the electron transport chains, they must be replaced—the job of [[photosystem II]], which splits [[water]] molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to obtain the electrons from its [[hydrogen atoms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology 8th—Campbell &amp; Reece—196–197&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology—Concepts and Connections|year=2009|publisher=Pearson|pages=108–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Cyclic photophosphorylation =====
{{Main|Cyclic photophosphorylation}}
While [[photosystem II]] [[photolyzes]] water to obtain and energize new electrons, [[photosystem I]] simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain. Normally, the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, though sometimes they can flow back down more H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP. This is termed [[cyclic photophosphorylation]] because the electrons are recycled. Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in [[C4 plants|{{C4}} plants]], which need more [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] than [[NADPH]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece-200-201&quot; /&gt;

==== Dark reactions ====
{{Plain image|File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|'''The Calvin cycle''' ''(Interactive diagram)'' The [[Calvin cycle]] incorporates carbon dioxide into sugar molecules.|435px|right|top|triangle|#ccc|image override=}}
{{Calvin cycle}}

{{Main|Dark reactions}}
The [[Calvin cycle]], also known as the [[dark reactions]], is a series of biochemical reactions that fixes [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] into [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|G3P]] sugar molecules and uses the energy and electrons from the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] made in the light reactions. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece-200-201&quot; /&gt;

While named ''&quot;the dark reactions&quot;'', in most plants, they take place in the light, since the dark reactions are dependent on the products of the light reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology8th-Campbell&amp;Reece-186-187&quot; /&gt;

===== Carbon fixation and G3P synthesis =====

The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] to fix CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into five-carbon [[Ribulose bisphosphate]] (RuBP) molecules. The result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called [[3-phosphoglyceric acid]], or 3-PGA.
The [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3-PGA into [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]], or G3P sugar molecules. Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP, but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle—the end product of the dark reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biology-Campbell&amp;Reece-200-201&quot; /&gt;

===== Sugars and starches =====

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate can double up to form larger sugar molecules like [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. These molecules are processed, and from them, the still larger [[sucrose]], a [[disaccharide]] commonly known as table sugar, is made, though this process takes place outside of the chloroplast, in the [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry—Calvin cycle&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Jeremy M | last1 = Berg | first2 = John L | last2 = Tymoczko | first3 = Lubert | last3 = Stryer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biochemistry|year=2002|publisher=W. H. Freeman|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0-7167-3051-0|pages=Section 20.1|edition=5. ed., 4. print.|url=https://archive.org/details/biochemistrychap00jere| url-access = registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Plain image|File:Saccharose2.svg|Sucrose is made up of a [[glucose]] monomer (left), and a [[fructose]] monomer (right).|width=200px|align=left|caption position=top|triangle=triangle|triangle color=#aaa}}

Alternatively, glucose [[monomers]] in the chloroplast can be linked together to make [[starch]], which accumulates into the [[chloroplast starch granule|starch grains]] found in the chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biochemistry—Calvin cycle&quot; /&gt;
Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, these starch grains may grow very large, distorting the grana and thylakoids. The starch granules displace the thylakoids, but leave them intact.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation&quot; /&gt;
Waterlogged [[root]]s can also cause [[starch]] buildup in the chloroplasts, possibly due to less [[sucrose]] being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the [[plant cell]]). This depletes a plant's [[free phosphate]] supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wample RL, Davis RW | title = Effect of Flooding on Starch Accumulation in Chloroplasts of Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 195–8 | date = September 1983 | pmid = 16663176 | pmc = 1066435 | doi = 10.1104/pp.73.1.195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While linked to low photosynthesis rates, the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Carmi A, Shomer I |year=1979|title=Starch Accumulation and Photosynthetic Activity in Primary Leaves of Bean (''Phaseolus vulgaris'' L.)|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=44|issue=4|pages=479–484|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085756 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-FloodingandStarchAccumulation&quot; /&gt;

===== Photorespiration =====

[[Photorespiration]] can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high. RuBisCO cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well, so it can accidentally add O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; instead of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[RuBP]]. This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen, releases CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and produces no sugar. It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis&quot; /&gt; Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast, increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis. These mechanisms are called [[carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism]]s, or CCMs. These include [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]], [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CampbellBiology-Photosynthesis&quot; /&gt; and [[pyrenoid]]s. Chloroplasts in {{C4}} plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct [[Chloroplast#Specialized chloroplasts in C4 plants|chloroplast dimorphism]].

=== pH ===
Because of the [[Hydron (chemistry)|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] gradient across the thylakoid membrane, the interior of the thylakoid is [[acidic]], with a [[pH]] around 4,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biochemistry.|year=2002|publisher=W H Freeman|pages=Section 19.4|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22519/| vauthors = Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L |edition=5th |access-date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the stroma is slightly basic, with a pH of around 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-ChloroplastpH&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauser M, Eichelmann H, Oja V, Heber U, Laisk A | title = Stimulation by Light of Rapid pH Regulation in the Chloroplast Stroma in Vivo as Indicated by CO2 Solubilization in Leaves | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 1059–1066 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 12228527 | pmc = 157457 | doi = 10.1104/pp.108.3.1059 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The optimal stroma pH for the Calvin cycle is 8.1, with the reaction nearly stopping when the pH falls below 7.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Werdan 1975&quot; /&gt;

[[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in water can form [[carbonic acid]], which can disturb the pH of isolated chloroplasts, interfering with photosynthesis, even though CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|used]] in photosynthesis.

The biosynthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA primarily requires two enzymes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase creates malonyl-CoA, used in both the first step and the extension steps of synthesis. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a large complex of enzymes and cofactors including acyl carrier protein (ACP) which holds the acyl chain as it is synthesized. The initiation of synthesis begins with the condensation of malonyl-ACP with acetyl-CoA to produce ketobutyryl-ACP. 2 reductions involving the use of [[NADPH]] and one dehydration creates butyryl-ACP. Extension of the fatty acid comes from repeated cycles of malonyl-ACP condensation, reduction, and dehydration.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMBoP&quot; /&gt;

Chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a '''plastid''', though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. There are many other types of plastids, which carry out various functions. All chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the [[zygote]],&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy | name-list-format = vanc |title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-31611-1|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt; or fertilized egg. Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant's [[apical meristem]]s. Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in [[root tip meristems]]&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantCellBiology-Plastids&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Brian E S | last1 = Gunning | first2 = Martin W | last2 = Steer | name-list-format = vanc |title=Plant cell biology : structure and function|year=1996|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=0-86720-504-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/plantcellbiology00gunn_0/page/n135 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/plantcellbiology00gunn_0| url-access = registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;—instead, the formation of starch-storing [[amyloplasts]] is more common.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56&quot; /&gt;

In [[shoots]], proplastids from [[shoot apical meristems]] can gradually develop into chloroplasts in [[photosynthetic]] leaf tissues as the leaf matures, if exposed to the required light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis&quot; /&gt; This process involves invaginations of the inner plastid membrane, forming sheets of membrane that project into the internal [[Stroma (fluid)|stroma]]. These membrane sheets then fold to form [[thylakoid]]s and [[Thylakoid|grana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy| name-list-format = vanc |title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-31611-1|pages=54–55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[angiosperm]] shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation, proplastids may develop into an [[etioplast]] stage before becoming chloroplasts. An etioplast is a plastid that lacks [[chlorophyll]], and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma, called a [[prolamellar body]]. While etioplasts lack chlorophyll, they have a yellow chlorophyll [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] stocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis&quot; /&gt; Within a few minutes of light exposure, the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids, and chlorophyll starts to be produced. This process, where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast, takes several hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54&quot; /&gt; [[Gymnosperms]] do not require light to form chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54&quot; /&gt;

Light, however, does not guarantee that a proplastid will develop into a chloroplast. Whether a proplastid develops into a chloroplast some other kind of plastid is mostly controlled by the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular biology of the cell—chloroplasts and photosynthesis&quot; /&gt; and is largely influenced by the kind of cell it resides in.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56&quot; /&gt;

{{plain image|Plastids conversions-en.svg|Many plastid interconversions are possible.|350px|right|bottom|triangle|#bbb}}

=== Plastid interconversion ===
Plastid differentiation is not permanent, in fact many interconversions are possible. Chloroplasts may be converted to [[chromoplast]]s, which are [[pigment]]-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in [[flowers]] and ripe [[fruit]]. Starch storing [[amyloplast]]s can also be converted to chromoplasts, and it is possible for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts. Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts, like what happens when a [[carrot]] or a [[potato]] is illuminated. If a plant is injured, or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a [[meristematic]] state, chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids. Chloroplast, amyloplast, chromoplast, proplast, etc., are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-56&quot; /&gt;

=== Division ===
{{expand section|functions, Z-ring dynamic assembly, regulators such as Giant Chloroplast 1 &lt;!--- Sorry, just had to mention it.---&gt;|date=February 2013}}

Most chloroplasts in a photosynthetic cell do not develop directly from proplastids or etioplasts. In fact, a typical [[shoot meristematic]] plant cell contains only 7–20 [[proplastids]]. These proplastids differentiate into chloroplasts, which divide to create the 30–70 chloroplasts found in a mature photosynthetic plant cell. If the cell [[Mitosis|divides]], chloroplast division provides the additional chloroplasts to partition between the two daughter cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidDivision-57&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Jeremy| name-list-format = vanc |title=An introduction to plant cell development|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-31611-1|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r808AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In single-celled [[algae]], chloroplast division is the only way new chloroplasts are formed. There is no proplastid differentiation—when an algal cell divides, its chloroplast divides along with it, and each [[daughter cell]] receives a mature chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54&quot; /&gt;

Almost all chloroplasts in a cell divide, rather than a small group of rapidly dividing chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=RSPBChloroplastDivision&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1976.0047 |title=Chloroplast Replication and Chloroplast DNA Synthesis in Spinach Leaves |year=1976 | vauthors = Possingham JV, Rose RJ |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=193 |issue=1112 |pages=295–305 |bibcode=1976RSPSB.193..295P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloroplasts have no definite [[S-phase]]—their DNA replication is not synchronized or limited to that of their host cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;JCS-ChloroplastDNAReplication&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cannon GC, Heinhorst S |title=DNA replication in chloroplasts |journal=Journal of Cell Science |date=1 January 1993 |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/104/1/1 |citeseerx=10.1.1.1026.3732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of what we know about chloroplast division comes from studying organisms like ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and the red alga ''[[Cyanidioschyzon merolæ]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

{{plain image with caption|Chloroplast division.svg|Most chloroplasts in plant cells, and all chloroplasts in [[algae]] arise from chloroplast division.&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroductiontoPlantCellDevelopment-PlastidInterconversion-54&quot; /&gt; ''Picture references,&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;''|800px|center|bottom|triangle|#00cd4c}}

The division process starts when the proteins [[FtsZ1]] and [[FtsZ2]] assemble into filaments, and with the help of a protein [[ARC6]], form a structure called a Z-ring within the chloroplast's stroma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glynn JM, Miyagishima SY, Yoder DW, Osteryoung KW, Vitha S | title = Chloroplast division | journal = Traffic | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 451–61 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17451550 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2007.00545.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miyagishima SY, Nishida K, Mori T, Matsuzaki M, Higashiyama T, Kuroiwa H, Kuroiwa T | title = A plant-specific dynamin-related protein forms a ring at the chloroplast division site | journal = The Plant Cell | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 655–65 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12615939 | pmc = 150020 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.009373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Min system]] manages the placement of the Z-ring, ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly. The protein [[MinD]] prevents FtsZ from linking up and forming filaments. Another protein [[ARC3]] may also be involved, but it is not very well understood. These proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast, preventing Z-ring formation there, but near the center of the chloroplast, [[MinE]] inhibits them, allowing the Z-ring to form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

Next, the two [[plastid-dividing rings]], or PD rings form. The inner plastid-dividing ring is located in the inner side of the chloroplast's inner membrane, and is formed first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; The outer plastid-dividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane. It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across,&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; arranged in rows 6.4 nanometers apart, and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast. This is when chloroplast constriction begins.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a few species like ''[[Cyanidioschyzon merolæ]]'', chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast's intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

Late into the constriction phase, [[dynamin]] proteins assemble around the outer plastid-dividing ring,&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; helping provide force to squeeze the chloroplast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, the Z-ring and the inner plastid-dividing ring break down.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; During this stage, the many chloroplast DNA plasmids floating around in the stroma are partitioned and distributed to the two forming daughter chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-EffectofLightonChloroplastDivision&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hashimoto H, Possingham JV | title = Effect of light on the chloroplast division cycle and DNA synthesis in cultured leaf discs of spinach | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 1178–83 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 16666681 | pmc = 1055993 | doi = 10.1104/pp.89.4.1178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the dynamins migrate under the outer plastid dividing ring, into direct contact with the chloroplast's outer membrane,&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; to cleave the chloroplast in two daughter chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

A remnant of the outer plastid dividing ring remains floating between the two daughter chloroplasts, and a remnant of the dynamin ring remains attached to one of the daughter chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

Of the five or six rings involved in chloroplast division, only the outer plastid-dividing ring is present for the entire constriction and division phase—while the Z-ring forms first, constriction does not begin until the outer plastid-dividing ring forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePlantCell-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

==== Regulation ====
In species of [[algae]] that contain a single chloroplast, regulation of chloroplast division is extremely important to ensure that each daughter cell receives a chloroplast—chloroplasts can't be made from scratch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Molecular biology of the cell—The Genetic Systems of Mitochondria and Plastids&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Alberts |first=Bruce | name-list-format = vanc |title=Molecular biology of the cell|year=2002|publisher=Garland|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8153-4072-9|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26924/|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt; In organisms like plants, whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts, coordination is looser and less important. It is likely that chloroplast and cell division are somewhat synchronized, though the mechanisms for it are mostly unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traffic-ChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

Light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division. Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under [[Chlorophyll#Spectrophotometry|poor quality green light]], but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division. Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts. Exposure to white light can stimulate these chloroplasts to divide and reduce the population of dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSPBChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PlantPhysiology-EffectofLightonChloroplastDivision&quot; /&gt;

=== Chloroplast inheritance ===
Like [[Mitochondrion#Replication and inheritance|mitochondria]], chloroplasts are usually inherited from a single parent. Biparental chloroplast inheritance—where plastid genes are inherited from both parent plants—occurs in very low levels in some flowering plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-ChloroplastInheritance&quot; /&gt;

Many mechanisms prevent biparental chloroplast DNA inheritance, including selective destruction of chloroplasts or their genes within the [[gamete]] or [[zygote]], and chloroplasts from one parent being excluded from the embryo. Parental chloroplasts can be sorted so that only one type is present in each offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-ChloroplastInheritance&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Birky CW | title = Uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes: mechanisms and evolution | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 25 | pages = 11331–8 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8524780 | pmc = 40394 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.25.11331 | bibcode = 1995PNAS...9211331B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gymnosperms]], such as [[pine trees]], mostly pass on chloroplasts paternally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell W, Morgante M, McDevitt R, Vendramin GG, Rafalski JA | title = Polymorphic simple sequence repeat regions in chloroplast genomes: applications to the population genetics of pines | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 92 | issue = 17 | pages = 7759–63 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7644491 | pmc = 41225 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.92.17.7759 | quote = In the pines, the chloroplast genome is transmitted through pollen | bibcode = 1995PNAS...92.7759P }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[flowering plants]] often inherit chloroplasts maternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stegemann S, Hartmann S, Ruf S, Bock R | title = High-frequency gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the nucleus | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 15 | pages = 8828–33 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12817081 | pmc = 166398 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1430924100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8828S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruf2007 /&gt; Flowering plants were once thought to only inherit chloroplasts maternally. However, there are now many documented cases of [[angiosperms]] inheriting chloroplasts paternally.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-ChloroplastInheritance&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen AK, Escobar LK, Gilbert LE, Jansen RK | title = Paternal, maternal, and biparental inheritance of the chloroplast genome in Passiflora (Passifloraceae): implications for phylogenetic studies | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–6 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 21642206 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.94.1.42 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/content/94/1/42.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angiosperms]], which pass on chloroplasts maternally, have many ways to prevent paternal inheritance. Most of them produce [[sperm cells]] that do not contain any plastids. There are many other documented mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance in these flowering plants, such as different rates of chloroplast replication within the embryo.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-ChloroplastInheritance&quot; /&gt;

Among angiosperms, paternal chloroplast inheritance is observed more often in [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] than in offspring from parents of the same species. This suggests that incompatible hybrid genes might interfere with the mechanisms that prevent paternal inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJB-ChloroplastInheritance&quot; /&gt;

==== Transplastomic plants ====
Recently, chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of [[genetically modified crops]]. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, [[transgene]]s in these plastids cannot be disseminated by [[pollen]]. This makes [[plastid transformation]] a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This [[biological containment]] strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the [[Co-existence of genetically modified and conventional crops and derived food and feed|coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture]]. While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.&lt;ref name=ruf2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruf S, Karcher D, Bock R | title = Determining the transgene containment level provided by chloroplast transformation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 17 | pages = 6998–7002 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17420459 | pmc = 1849964 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700008104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.6998R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
