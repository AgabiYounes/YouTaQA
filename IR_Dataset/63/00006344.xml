A '''capsid''' is the protein shell of a [[virus]]. It consists of several [[oligomer]]ic structural subunits made of [[protein]] called [[protomer]]s. The observable 3-dimensional morphological subunits, which may or may not correspond to individual proteins, are called [[capsomere]]s.  The capsid encloses the [[genetic material]] of the virus.

Capsids are broadly classified according to their structure.  The majority of viruses have capsids with either [[Helix|helical]] or [[icosahedral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Lidmar J, Mirny L, Nelson DR |title= Virus shapes and buckling transitions in spherical shells |journal= [[Phys.

Some viruses, such as [[bacteriophage]]s, have developed more complicated structures due to constraints of elasticity and electrostatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vernizzi G, Sknepnek R, Olvera de la Cruz M |title=Platonic and Archimedean geometries in multicomponent elastic membranes |journal= [[Proc.

For example, the [[foot-and-mouth disease]] virus capsid has faces consisting of three proteins named VP1–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web-books.com/MoBio/Free/Ch1E1.htm|title=Virus Structure (web-books.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some viruses are ''enveloped'', meaning that the capsid is coated with a lipid membrane known as the ''[[viral envelope]]''.  The envelope is acquired by the capsid from an intracellular membrane in the virus' host; examples include the inner nuclear membrane, the [[Golgi apparatus|golgi]] membrane, and the cell's outer [[cell membrane|membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|url=https://archive.org/details/molecularbiology00albe|url-access=registration|edition=4th|page=[https://archive.org/details/molecularbiology00albe/page/280 280]|year=1994|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Bray|first2=Dennis|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Watson|first6=James D.|authorlink6=James D. Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the virus has infected a cell and begins replicating itself, new capsid subunits are synthesized using the [[protein biosynthesis]] mechanism of the cell. In some viruses, including those with helical capsids and especially those with RNA genomes, the capsid proteins co-assemble with their genomes. In other viruses, especially more complex viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes, the capsid proteins assemble into empty precursor [[procapsid]]s that includes a specialized portal structure at one vertex. Through this portal, viral [[DNA]] is translocated into the capsid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16051846&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Involvement of the Portal at an Early Step in Herpes Simplex Virus Capsid Assembly|vauthors=Newcomb WW, Homa FL, Brown JC|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=79|issue=16|date=August 2005|pmid=16051846|pages=10540–6|doi=10.1128/JVI.79.16.10540-10546.2005|pmc=1182615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural analyses of major capsid protein (MCP) architectures have been used to categorise viruses into lineages. For example, the bacteriophage PRD1, the algal virus [[Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus]] (PBCV-1), [[mimivirus]] and the mammalian [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] have been placed in the same lineage, whereas tailed, double-stranded DNA bacteriophages ([[Caudovirales]]) and herpesvirus belong to a second lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krupovic|first1=M|last2=Bamford|first2=DH|title=Virus evolution: how far does the double beta-barrel viral lineage extend?|journal=Nat Rev Microbiol|date=2008|volume=6|issue=12|pages=941–8|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2033|pmid=19008892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khayat et al. classified Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) and Laurinmäki et al. classified bacteriophage Bam35  – Proc.

===Icosahedral===

[[File:Virus capsid T number.tif|thumb|right|Virus capsid T-numbers]]
The icosahedral structure is extremely common among viruses. The icosahedron consists of 20 triangular faces delimited by 12 fivefold vertexes and consists of 60 asymmetric units. Thus, an icosahedral virus is made of 60N protein subunits. The number and arrangement of [[capsomere]]s in an icosahedral capsid can be classified using the &quot;quasi-equivalence principle&quot; proposed by [[Donald Caspar]] and [[Aaron Klug]].&lt;ref name=Caspar1962&gt;{{cite journal |year=1962 |title=Physical Principles in the Construction of Regular Viruses |journal=Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. |volume=27 |pages=1–24 |pmid=14019094 |author1=Caspar, D. L. D.  |author2=Klug, A. |doi=10.1101/sqb.1962.027.001.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Goldberg polyhedra]], an icosahedral structure can be regarded as being constructed from pentamers and hexamers. The structures can be indexed by two integers ''h'' and ''k'', with &lt;math&gt;h \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;; the structure can be thought of as taking ''h'' steps from the edge of a pentamer, turning 60 degrees counterclockwise, then taking ''k'' steps to get to the next pentamer. The triangulation number ''T'' for the capsid is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt; T = h^2 + h \cdot k + k^2 &lt;/math&gt;
In this scheme, icosahedral capsids contain 12 pentamers plus 10(''T''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) hexamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://viperdb.scripps.edu/virus.php |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |title=T-number index |journal=VIPERdb |volume=37 |issue=Database issue |pages=D436–D442 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn840|pmid=18981051 |pmc=2686430 |year=2009 |last1=Carrillo-Tripp |first1=M. |last2=Shepherd |first2=C.

S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson, J. E. and Speir, J.A. 2009 115–123&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Johnson, J. E.  |author2=Speir, J.A. |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |pages=115–123 |isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''T''-number is representative of the size and complexity of the capsids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mannige RV, ((Brooks CL III)) | year = 2010 | title = Periodic Table of Virus Capsids: Implications for Natural Selection and Design | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 3| page = e9423 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009423 | pmid=20209096 | pmc=2831995| bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.9423M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geometric examples for many values of ''h'', ''k'', and ''T'' can be found at [[List of geodesic polyhedra and Goldberg polyhedra]].

Many exceptions to this rule exist: For example, the [[polyomaviruses]] and [[papillomaviruses]] have pentamers instead of hexamers in hexavalent positions on a quasi-T=7 lattice. Members of the double-stranded RNA virus lineage, including [[reovirus]], [[rotavirus]] and bacteriophage φ6 have capsids built of 120 copies of capsid protein, corresponding to a &quot;T=2&quot; capsid, or arguably a T=1 capsid with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Similarly, many small viruses have a pseudo-T=3 (or P=3) capsid, which is organized according to a T=3 lattice, but with distinct polypeptides occupying the three quasi-equivalent positions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Virusworld | url=http://www.virology.wisc.edu/virusworld/tri_number.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T-numbers can be represented in different ways, for example ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 can only be represented as an [[icosahedron]] or a [[dodecahedron]] and, depending on the type of quasi-symmetry, ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 can be presented as a [[truncated dodecahedron]], an [[icosidodecahedron]], or a [[truncated icosahedron]] and their respective duals a [[triakis icosahedron]], a [[rhombic triacontahedron]], or a [[pentakis dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J.

===Prolate===

An elongated icosahedron is a common shape for the heads of bacteriophages. Such a structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end. The cylinder is composed of 10 elongated triangular faces. The Q number (or T&lt;sub&gt;mid&lt;/sub&gt;), which can be any positive integer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Luque |author2=D.

===Helical===
[[File:Helical capsid with RNA.png|thumb|left|3D model of a helical capsid structure of a virus]]

Many rod-shaped and filamentous plant viruses have capsids with [[Symmetry (geometry)#Helical symmetry|helical symmetry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamada S, Matsuzawa T, Yamada K, Yoshioka S, Ono S, Hishinuma T |title=Modified inversion recovery method for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging |journal=Sci Rep Res Inst Tohoku Univ Med |volume=33 |issue=1–4 |pages=9–15 |date=December 1986 |pmid=3629216 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The helical structure can be described as a set of ''n'' 1-D molecular helices related by an ''n''-fold axial symmetry.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated84&quot;/&gt; The helical transformation are classified into two categories: one-dimensional and two-dimensional helical systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated84&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aldrich RA |title=Children in cities—Seattle's KidsPlace program |journal=Acta Paediatr Jpn |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=84–90 |date=February 1987 |pmid=3144854 |doi= 10.1111/j.1442-200x.1987.tb00013.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating an entire helical structure relies on a set of translational and rotational matrices which are coded in the protein data bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated84&quot;/&gt; Helical symmetry is given by the formula ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''μ''&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;''ρ'', where ''μ'' is the number of structural units per turn of the helix, ''ρ'' is the axial rise per unit and ''P'' is the pitch of the helix.

==Functions==
The functions of the capsid are to:
* protect the genome, 
* deliver the genome, and 
* interact with the host.  
The virus must assemble a stable, protective protein shell to protect the genome from lethal chemical and physical agents.  These include forms of [[natural radiation]], extremes of [[pH]] or temperature and proteolytic and nucleolytic [[enzyme]]s.  For non-enveloped viruses, the capsid itself may be involved in interaction with receptors on the host cell, leading to penetration of the host cell membrane and internalization of the capsid. Delivery of the genome occurs by subsequent uncoating or disassembly of the capsid and release of the genome into the cytoplasm, or by ejection of the genome through a specialized portal structure directly into the host cell nucleus.

==Origin and evolution==
It has been suggested that many viral capsid proteins have evolved on multiple occasions from functionally diverse cellular proteins.&lt;ref name=Krupovic2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krupovic|first1=M|last2=Koonin|first2=EV|title=Multiple origins of viral capsid proteins from cellular ancestors.|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=2017|volume=114|issue=12|pages=E2401–E2410|doi=10.1073/pnas.1621061114|pmid=28265094|pmc=5373398}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recruitment of cellular proteins appears to have occurred at different stages of evolution, so that some cellular proteins were captured and refunctionalized prior to the divergence of cellular organisms into the three contemporary domains of life, whereas others were hijacked relatively recently. As a result, some capsid proteins are widespread in viruses infecting distantly related organisms (e.g., capsid proteins with the [[jelly-roll fold]]), whereas others are restricted to a particular group of viruses (e.g., capsid proteins of alphaviruses).&lt;ref name=Krupovic2017 /&gt;
