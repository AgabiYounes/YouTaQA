A '''church building''' or '''church house''', often simply called a '''church''', is a building used for [[Christianity|Christian]] religious activities, particularly for [[Christian worship]] services. The term is often used by [[Christians]] to refer to the physical buildings where they worship, but it is sometimes used (by analogy) to refer to buildings of other [[religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Use of the term [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362167/Manichaeism &quot;The Manichaean Church&quot;], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional [[Christian architecture]], a church interior is often structured in the shape of a [[Christian cross]]. When viewed from [[plan view]] the vertical beam of the cross is represented by the center [[aisle]] and seating while the horizontal beam and junction of the cross is formed by the [[Church_architecture#Characteristics_of_the_early_Christian_church_building|bema]] and [[altar]].

Towers or domes are often added with the intention of directing the eye of the viewer towards the [[heaven]]s and inspiring a range of thoughts and emotions in visitors and worshippers. Modern church buildings have a variety of [[architectural style]]s and layouts; many buildings that were designed for other purposes have now been converted for church use, and, conversely, many original church buildings have been put to other uses.

The earliest identified Christian church building was a [[house church]] founded between 233 and 256. From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of building of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedrals]] and smaller [[parish church]]es were erected across [[Western Europe]]. A [[cathedral]] is a church building, usually [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Protestant]] (including [[Anglican]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], or [[Oriental Orthodox]], housing a [[cathedra]], the formal name for the [[episcopal see|seat]] or [[throne]] of a presiding [[bishop]].

==Etymology==
In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κυριακόν|κυριακόν]]}}) means &quot;belonging, or pertaining, to a ''[[Kyrios]]''&quot; (&quot;Lord&quot;), and the usage was adopted by [[early Christians]] of the Eastern Mediterranean with regard to anything pertaining to the Lord [[Jesus Christ]]: hence &quot;''Kyriakós oíkos''&quot; ({{lang|grc|Kυριακός οίκος}}) (&quot;house of the Lord&quot;, church), &quot;''Kyriakē''&quot; ({{lang|grc|Κυριακή}}) (&quot;[the day] of the Lord&quot;, i.e. [[Sunday]]), or &quot;''Kyriakē proseukhē''&quot; ({{lang-el|Κυριακή προσευχή}}) (the &quot;[[Lord's Prayer]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;OEtymDChurch&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Church |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=church |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cyrican.jpg|thumb|''Cyrican'' is an Old English word for churches and church property]]
In standard Greek usage, the older word &quot;ecclesia&quot; ({{lang-el|ἐκκλησία}}, ''ekklesía'', literally &quot;assembly&quot;, &quot;congregation&quot;, or the place where such a gathering occurs) was retained to signify both a specific edifice of Christian worship (a &quot;[[wikt:church|'''c'''hurch&quot;]]), and the overall community of the faithful ([[wikt:Church|the &quot;'''C'''hurch&quot;]]). This usage was also retained in [[Latin]] and the languages derived from Latin (e.g. French ''église'', Italian ''chiesa'', Spanish ''iglesia'', Portuguese ''igreja'', etc.), as well as in the [[Celtic languages]] (Welsh ''eglwys'', Irish ''eaglais'', Breton ''iliz'', etc.) and in Turkish (''kilise'').&lt;ref name=&quot;OEtymDChurch&quot; /&gt;

In the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and some [[Slavic languages]], the word ''kyriak-ós/-ē/-ón'' was adopted instead and derivatives formed thereof. In [[Old English]] the sequence of derivation started as &quot;cirice&quot;, then [[Middle English]] &quot;churche&quot;, and eventually &quot;church&quot; in its current pronunciation. German ''Kirche'', Scots ''kirk'', Russian {{lang|ru|церковь}} (''tserkov''), etc., are all similarly derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aggressivechristianity.net/articles/ecclesia.htm|title=THE CORRECT MEANING OF &quot;CHURCH&quot; AND &quot;ECCLESIA&quot;|website=www.aggressivechristianity.net|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Antiquity===
According to the [[New Testament]], the earliest Christians did not build church buildings. Instead, they gathered in homes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:5 Acts 17:5], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+20%3A20&amp;version=NIV 20:20], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians+16%3A19&amp;version=NIV 1 Corinthians 16:19]) or in Jewish worship places like the [[Second Temple]] or [[synagogue]]s ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A46&amp;version=NIV Acts 2:46], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+19%3A8&amp;version=NIV 19:8]). The earliest archeologically identified Christian church is a [[house church]] (''domus ecclesiae''), the [[Dura-Europos church]], founded between 233 and 256.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Graydon F. |title=Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=2003 |pp=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the first purpose-built halls for Christian worship (''aula ecclesiae'') began to be constructed. Although many of these were destroyed early in the next century during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]], even larger and more elaborate church buildings began to appear during the reign of the Emperor [[Constantine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hartog |editor1-first=Paul |date= |title=The Contemporary Church and the Early Church: Case Studies in Ressourcement |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hlqUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70&amp;dq=early+church+buildings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipkrWVip3VAhUMD8AKHdfuD5AQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=early%20church%20buildings&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Pickwick Publications |page= |isbn= 978-1606088999 }} (Chapter 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval times===
[[File:Frauenkirche München abends.jpg|thumb|The [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in [[Munich]] is a largely [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], medieval church.]]
From the 11th through the 14th centuries, a wave of [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|cathedral-building]] and construction of smaller parish churches occurred across [[Western Europe]]. Besides serving as a place of worship, the cathedral or parish church was frequently employed as a general gathering-place by the communities in which they were located, hosting such events as [[guild]] meetings, [[banquet]]s, [[mystery plays]], and [[fair]]s. Church grounds and buildings were also used for the threshing and storage of grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |title=Cathedrals and the Church |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Romanesque architecture ====
Between 1000 and 1200 the [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] style became popular across [[Europe]]. While the term ''&quot;Romanesque&quot;'' refers to the tradition of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]], the trend in fact appeared throughout Western and Central Europe. The romanesque style is defined by large and bulky edifices that are typically made up of simple, compact, sparsely decorated geometric structures. Frequent features of the Romanesque church include [[Arch|circular arches]], round or [[octagon]]al towers and [[Capital (architecture)|cushion capitals]] on pillars. In the early romanesque era, [[coffer]]ing on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, [[Groin vault|groined vault]] gained popularity. Interiors widened and the motifs of [[sculpture]]s took on more epic traits and themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=g3HgsgEACAAJ&amp;dq=romanesque+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN5bDd2-PVAhVIrRQKHfNkBHUQ6AEIPjAD|title=Romanesque: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting|last=Toman|first=Rolf|date=2015-04-30|publisher=h.f.ullmann|isbn=9783848008407|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic architecture ====
[[File:Santuario de Las Lajas, Ipiales, Colombia, 2015-07-21, DD 21-23 HDR.jpg|thumb|[[Las Lajas Sanctuary]] in southern Colombia.]]

The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style emerged around 1140 in [[Île-de-France]] and subsequently spread throughout Europe. Gothic churches lost the compact qualities of the romanesque era and decorations often contained [[symbol]]ic and [[Allegory|allegorical]] features. The first [[pointed arch]]es, [[rib vault]]s and [[buttress]]es began to appear, all possessing geometric properties that reduced the need for large, rigid walls to ensure structural stability. This also permitted the size of windows to increase, producing brighter and lighter interiors. [[Nave]] ceilings became higher and pillars and steeples grew taller. Many architects used these developments to push the limits of structural possibility, an inclination which resulted in the collapse of several towers possessing designs that had unwittingly exceeded the boundaries of soundness. In [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Spain]], it became popular to build [[hall church]]es, a style in which every [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] would be built to the same height.

Gothic cathedrals were lavishly designed, as in the romanesque era, and many share romanesque traits. However, several also exhibit unprecedented degrees of detail and complexity in decoration. The [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Reims Cathedral|Notre-Dame de Reims]] in France, as well as the [[San Francesco d'Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco d’Assisi]] in [[Palermo]], and the [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[Wool church|Wool Church]] in [[England]] demonstrate the elaborate stylings characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.

Some of the most well-known gothic churches remained unfinished for centuries, after the gothic style fell out of popularity. The construction of the  [[Cologne Cathedral]], which was begun in 1248, halted in 1473, and not resumed until 1842 is one such example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=LBZ6781vvOwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gothic+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiskNCu2-PVAhWF6RQKHXAFA_EQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gothic Architecture|last=Frankl|first=Paul|last2=Crossley|first2=Paul|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300087993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the 15th and 16th century, the change in ethics and society due to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]] also influenced the building of churches. The common style was much like the gothic style, but in a simplified way. The [[basilica]] was not the most popular type of church anymore, but instead [[hall church]]es were built. Typical features are columns and classical [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=70m1KbuD5YoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=renaissance+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWwu-Bo-TVAhUDORQKHfd9B3YQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=renaissance%20architecture&amp;f=false|title=Renaissance Architecture|last=Anderson|first=Christy|date=2013-02-28|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780192842275|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]], where the proclamation of God's Word is of special importance, the visitor's line of view is directed towards the [[pulpit]].

=== Baroque architecture ===
The [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style was first used in [[Italy]] around 1575. From there it spread to the rest of Europe and to the European colonies. During the baroque era, the building industry increased heavily. Buildings, even churches, were used as indicators for wealth, authority and influence. The use of forms known from the [[renaissance]] were extremely exaggerated. [[Dome]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] were decorated with moulding and the former [[Stucco|stucco-sculptures]] were replaced by [[fresco]] paintings on the ceilings. For the first time, churches were seen as one connected work of art and consistent artistic concepts were developed. Instead of long buildings, more central-plan buildings were created. The sprawling decoration with floral ornamentation and mythological motives raised until about 1720 to the [[Rococo|rococo era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=eaC7yKbxj8UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=baroque+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi14YH0rOTVAhXQERQKHZaZDEoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%20architecture&amp;f=false|title=Pietro Da Cortona and Roman Baroque Architecture|last=Merz|first=Jörg Martin|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300111231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protestantism|Protestant parishes]] preferred lateral churches, in which all the visitors could be as close as possible to the [[pulpit]] and the [[altar]].

==Architecture==
{{main article|Church architecture}}
[[File:Norwich Cathedral from Cloisters, Norfolk, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Norwich Cathedral]] in England is an example of a Cathedral complex built during the [[Middle Ages]].]]
A common architecture for churches is the shape of a [[Christian cross|cross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=dqIZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Remarks on Church Architecture ...|last=Petit|first=John Louis|date=1841|publisher=J. Burns|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a long central rectangle, with side rectangles, and a rectangle in front for the [[altar]] space or sanctuary). These churches also often have a [[dome]] or other large [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] space in the interior to represent or draw attention to the heavens. Other common shapes for churches include a circle, to represent eternity, or an [[octagon]] or similar star shape, to represent the church's bringing light to the world. Another common feature is the [[spire]], a tall tower on the &quot;west&quot; end of the church or over the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]].

Another common feature of many Christian churches is the [[Orientation of churches|eastwards orientation]] of the front [[altar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/sacred_places_the_significance_of_the_church_building/|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture {{!}} Articles {{!}} Sacred Places: The Significance of the Church Building|website=www.sacredarchitecture.org|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Often, the altar will not be oriented due east, but in the direction of sunrise. This tradition originated in Byzantium in the 4th century, and becomes prevalent in the West in the 8th to 9th century. 
The old Roman custom of having the altar at the west end and the entrance at the east was sometimes followed as late as the 11th century even in areas of northern Europe under Frankish rule, as seen in [[Petershausen (Constance)]], [[Bamberg Cathedral]], [[Augsburg Cathedral]], [[Regensburg Cathedral]], and [[Hildesheim Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sX8w667tblMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22XI+Jahrh+fortgedauert%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir9NbtjObLAhWHDg8KHUFVA8kQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22XI%20Jahrh%20fortgedauert%22&amp;f=false Heinrich Otte, ''Handbuch der kirchlichen Kunst-Archäologie des deutschen Mittelalters'' (Leipzig 1868), p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Basilica===
{{main article|Basilica}}
The [[Latin]] word basilica (derived from [[Greek language|Greek]], ''[[Stoa Basileios|Basiliké Stoà]]'', Royal ''[[Stoa]]'') was originally used to describe a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] public building (as in [[Greece]], mainly a [[tribunal]]), usually located in the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]] of a Roman town.&lt;ref name=&quot;OXFORD1&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Te2dAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art and Architecture''] (2013 {{ISBN|978-0-19968027-6}}), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacredarchitecture.org/articles/the_eschatological_dimension_of_church_architecture|title=The Institute for Sacred Architecture - Articles- The Eschatological Dimension of Church Architecture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Roman Empire]] became [[Edict of Thessalonica|officially Christian]], the term came by extension to refer to a large and important church that has been given special ceremonial rights by the [[Pope]]. Thus the word retains two senses today, one architectural and the other ecclesiastical.[[File:St. Peter and St. Paul's Church 1, Vilnius, Lithuania - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Central [[nave]] of [[St. Peter and St. Paul's Church, Vilnius]], Lithuania looking north-east towards the altar. An example of a [[Baroque]] church interior.]]

===Cathedral===
{{main article|Architecture of cathedrals and great churches}}
{{see|Duomo}}
[[File:Sant Vasily cathedral in Moscow.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Moscow]], Russia (today a museum) is a famous and characteristic example of a [[Russian Orthodox Church]] building.]]
A [[cathedral]] is a church, usually [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglican]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] or [[Eastern Orthodox]], housing the seat of a bishop. The word cathedral takes its name from ''[[cathedra]]'', or Bishop's Throne (In {{lang-la|ecclesia cathedralis}}). The term is sometimes (improperly) used to refer to any church of great size.

A church that has the function of cathedral is not necessarily a large building. It might be as small as [[Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford|Christ Church Cathedral]] in [[Oxford]], England, [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh, United States]], or [[Chur]] Cathedral in [[Switzerland]]. However, frequently, the cathedral along with some of the abbey churches, was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]] in any region.
[[File:Utrecht Domkerk 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|St. Martin's Cathedral]], [[Utrecht]], Netherlands]]

===Pilgrimage church===
{{main|Pilgrimage church}}
A pilgrimage church is a church to which [[pilgrimage]]s are regularly made, or a church along a pilgrimage route, often located at the tomb of a [[saint]]s, or holding icons or [[relic]]s to which miraculous properties are ascribed, the site of [[Marian apparition]]s, etc.

===Conventual church===
{{see|Priory|Katholikon}}
A conventual church (or monastery church, [[Minster (church)|minster]], ''[[katholikon]]'') is the main church building in a Christian [[monastery]] or [[abbey]].

===Collegiate church===
{{main|Collegiate church}}
A collegiate church is a church where the [[daily office]] of worship is maintained by a [[college (canon law)|college]] of [[canon (priest)|canons]], which may be presided over by a [[Dean (religion)|dean]] or [[Provost (religion)|provost]].
Collegiate churches were often supported by extensive lands held by the church, or by [[tithe]] income from [[impropriation|appropriated]] [[benefices]]. They commonly provide distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of their clerical community.

===Alternative buildings===
{{see|Road church|Simultaneum}}
Old and disused church buildings can be seen as an interesting proposition for developers as the architecture and location often provide for attractive homes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/new_homes/article3047285.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Church conversions | first=Lucy | last=Alexander | date=14 December 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or city centre entertainment venues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Site design and technology by Lightmaker.com |url=http://www.pitcherandpiano.com/locations/bar.cfm?area=Nottingham |title=quality food and drink |publisher=Pitcher and Piano |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many newer churches have decided to host meetings in public buildings such as schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familychurchchristchurch.org.uk |title=Welcome to the Family Church Christchurch Dorset |publisher=The Family Church Christchurch |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-hope.org.uk |title=Welcome to The Hope Church, Manchester...

There is another trend to convert old buildings for [[worship]] rather than face the construction costs and planning difficulties of a new build.

There has been an increase in partnerships between church management and private real estate companies to redevelop church properties into mixed uses. While it has garnered criticism from some, the partnership offers congregations the opportunity to increase revenue while preserving the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Churches Redeveloping Properties to Give Them New Life|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/churches-redeveloping-properties-to-give-them-new-life-1443519001|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-10-23|issn = 0099-9660|first = Robyn A.|last = Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
