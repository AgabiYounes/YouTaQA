'''Camelopardalis''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˌ|m|ɛ|l|ə|ˈ|p|ɑːr|d|əl|ᵻ|s}} is a large but faint [[constellation]] of the [[celestial sphere|northern sky]] representing a giraffe. The constellation was introduced in 1612 or 1613 by [[Petrus Plancius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-EJOCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 |p=164 |title=Knowledge Encyclopedia Space! |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Ltd |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}} Some older astronomy books give '''Camelopardalus''' or '''Camelopardus''' as alternative spellings of the name, but the official version recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] is Camelopardalis.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}}

==Etymology==
First attested in English in 1785, the word ''camelopardalis'' comes from [[Latin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dcamelopardalis |title = camelopardalis |last1 = Lewis |first1 = Charlton T. |last2 = Short |first2 = Charles |work = A Latin Dictionary |publisher = [[Perseus Digital Library]]|accessdate =8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the [[romanization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;καμηλοπάρδαλις&quot; meaning &quot;giraffe&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkamhlopa%2Frdalis |title = καμηλοπάρδαλις
|first1 = Henry George |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |work = A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library |accessdate =8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from &quot;κάμηλος&quot; (''kamēlos''), &quot;[[camel]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dka%2Fmhlos |title = κάμηλος |first1 = Henry George |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |work = A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library |accessdate =8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; + &quot;πάρδαλις&quot; (''pardalis''), &quot;[[leopard]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpa%2Frdalis |title = πάρδαλις |first1 = Henry George |last1 = Liddell |first2 = Robert |last2 = Scott |work = A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher = Perseus Digital Library |accessdate =8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it has a long neck like a camel and spots like a leopard.

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Camelopardalis}}

Although Camelopardalis is the 18th largest constellation, it is not a particularly bright constellation, as the brightest stars are only of fourth magnitude. In fact, it only contains four stars below (brighter than) magnitude 5.0.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=241}}

*[[Alpha Camelopardalis|α Cam]] is a blue-hued supergiant star of magnitude 4.3, over 6,000 light-years from Earth. It is one of the most distant stars easily visible with the naked eye.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}}
*[[Beta Camelopardalis|β Cam]] is the brightest star in Camelopardalis with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 4.03. This star is a [[double star]], with components of magnitudes 4.0{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118–119}} and 8.6. The primary is a yellow-hued supergiant 1000 light-years from Earth.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}}
*[[11 Camelopardalis|11 Cam]] is a star of magnitude 5.2, 650 light-years from Earth. It appears without intense magnification very close to magnitude 6.1 [[12 Camelopardalis|12 Cam]], at about the same distance from us, but the two are not a true double star; they have considerable separation.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}}
*[[Struve 1694|Σ 1694]] (Struve 1694, 32 Cam) is a [[binary star]] 300 light-years from Earth. Both components have a blue-white hue; the primary is of magnitude 5.4 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.9.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}}
*[[CS Camelopardalis|CS Cam]] is the second brightest star, though it has neither a [[Bayer designation|Bayer]] nor a [[Flamsteed designation]]. It is of magnitude 4.21 and is slightly [[variable star|variable]].{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118–119}}
*[[Z Camelopardalis|Z Cam]] (varying from amateur telescope visibility to extremely faint) is frequently observed as part of a program of [[AAVSO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aavso.org/vsots_zcam American Association of Variable Star Observers]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the prototype of [[Z Camelopardalis variable stars]].

Other variable stars are [[U Camelopardalis]], [[VZ Camelopardalis]], and [[Mira variable]]s [[T Camelopardalis]], [[X Camelopardalis]], and [[R Camelopardalis]].{{sfn|Norton|1973|pp=118–119}} [[RU Camelopardalis]] is one of the brighter [[Type II Cepheid]]s visible in the night sky.

In 2011 a supernova was discovered in the constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/10-year-old-canadian-girl-youngest-discover-supernova |title = 10-Year-Old Canadian Girl Is The Youngest Person Ever to Discover a Supernova |last = Boyle |first = Rebecca |accessdate =8 June 2012 |journal = Popular Science |date = 3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep-sky objects===
Camelopardalis is in the part of the celestial sphere facing away from the [[galactic plane]]. Accordingly, many distant galaxies are visible within its borders. 
* [[NGC 2403]] is a galaxy in the [[M81 group]] of galaxies, located approximately 12 million light-years from Earth{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}} with a redshift of 0.00043. It is classified as being between an [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] and a [[spiral galaxy]] because it has faint arms and a large central bulge. NGC 2403 was first discovered by the 18th century astronomer [[William Herschel]], who was working in England at the time.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} It has an [[integrated magnitude]] of 8.0 and is approximately 0.25° long.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}}
* [[NGC 1502]] is a magnitude 6.9 [[open cluster]] about 3,000 [[light year]]s from Earth. It has about 45 bright members, and features a double star of magnitude 7.0 at its center.&lt;ref&gt;Revised NGC/IC Data 2013. Dr. Wolfgang Steinicke.&lt;/ref&gt; NGC 1502 is also associated with [[Kemble's Cascade]], a simple but beautiful asterism appearing in the sky as a chain of stars 2.5° long that is parallel to the Milky Way and is pointed towards [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]].{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}} * [[NGC 1501]] is a planetary nebula located roughly 1.4° south of NGC 1502.
* Stock 23 is an open star cluster at the southern part of the border between Camelopardalis and Cassiopeia. It is also known as ''Pazmino's Cluster''. It could be categorized as an ''asterism'' because of the small number of stars in it (a small telescopic ''constellation'').
* [[IC 342]] is one of the brightest two galaxies in the [[IC 342/Maffei Group]] of galaxies.
* The dwarf irregular galaxy [[NGC 1569]] is a magnitude 11.9 [[starburst galaxy]], about 11 million light years away.
* [[NGC 2655]] is a large [[lenticular galaxy]] with visual magnitude 10.1.
* UGC 3697 is known as the ''Integral Sign Galaxy'' (its location is 7:11:4 / +71°50').
* [[MS0735.6+7421]] is a galaxy cluster with a [[redshift]] of 0.216, located 2.6&amp;nbsp;billion light-years from Earth. It is unique for its [[intracluster medium]], which emits [[X-ray]]s at a very high rate. This galaxy cluster features two cavities 600,000 light-years in diameter, caused by its central [[supermassive black hole]], which emits jets of matter. MS0735.6+7421 is one of the largest and most distant examples of this phenomenon.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}
* Tombaugh 5 is a fairly dim open cluster in Camelopardalis. It has an overall magnitude of 8.4 and is located 5,800 light-years from Earth. It is a Shapley class c and Trumpler class III 1 r cluster, meaning that it is irregularly shaped and appears loose. Though it is detached from the star field, it is not concentrated at its center at all. It has more than 100 stars which do not vary widely in brightness,{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=89}} mostly being of the 15th and 16th magnitude.{{sfn|Levy|2005|p=91}}
* [[NGC 2146]] is an 11th magnitude barred spiral starburst galaxy conspicuously warped by interaction with a neighbour.
* [[MACS0647-JD]], one of the possible candidates for the farthest known galaxies in the universe ([[Redshift|z]]= 10.7), is also in Camelopardalis.

The [[space probe]] ''[[Voyager 1]]'' is moving in the direction of this constellation, though it will not be nearing any of the stars in this constellation for many thousands of years, by which time its power source will be long dead.

==History==
[[Image:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Camelopardalis, Tarandus and Custos Messium.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Camelopardalis as depicted in ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'', a set of constellation cards published in London c.1823.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by Petrus Plancius in 1613.{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=92–93}} It first appeared in a globe designed by him and produced by [[Pieter van den Keere]]. One year later, [[Jakob Bartsch]] featured it in his atlas. [[Johannes Hevelius]] depicted this constellation in his works which were so influential that it was referred to as Camelopardali Hevelii or abbreviated as Camelopard. Hevel.

Part of the constellation was hived off to form the constellation Sciurus Volans, the Flying Squirrel, by William Croswell in 1810. However this was not taken up by later cartographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Nick | last=Kanas | date=2007 | title=Star maps: history, artistry, and cartography | page=131 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bae3LP4tfP4C&amp;pg=PA131 | publisher=Springer |location=New York City | isbn=0-387-71668-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
