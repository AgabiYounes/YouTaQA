==Old Testament characters==
===Women===
*[[Abijah (queen)|Abijah]] ([[2 Chronicles]] 29:1), who married King [[Ahaz]] of Judah. She is also called Abi (2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 18:2). Her father's name was Zechariah; she was the mother of King [[Hezekiah]] ({{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:1}}).
*A wife of [[Hezron]], one of the grandchildren of [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]] (1 Chronicles 2:24).

===Men===
*[[Abijah of Judah]], also known as Abijam (אבים, ''Abiyam'', &quot;My Father is Yam [Sea]&quot;), who was son of [[Rehoboam]] and succeeded him on the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (1 Chronicles 3:10, [[Matthew 1:7]], 1 Kings 14:31).
*A son of [[Becher (biblical figure)|Becher]], the son of [[Benjamin]] (1 Chr. 7:8).
*The second son of [[Samuel]] ([[1 Samuel]] 8:2; 1 Chronicles 6:28). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in [[Beersheba]], to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a [[monarchy]].
*A descendant of [[Eleazar]], the son of [[Aaron]], a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by [[David]] (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah is listed with the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Joshua. ([[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 12:4; 17).
*A son of [[Jeroboam]], the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent [[Wife of Jeroboam|his wife]] to consult the prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found &quot;some good thing toward the Lord&quot;, he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and &quot;all Israel mourned for him&quot; ([[1 Kings]] 14:1–18). According to the Jewish Encyclopedia the good that he did &quot;Rabbinical Literature:The passage, I Kings, xiv. 13, in which there is a reference to &quot;some good thing [found in him] toward the Lord God of Israel,&quot; is interpreted (M. Ḳ. 28b) as an allusion to Abijah's courageous and pious act in removing the sentinels placed by his father on the frontier between Israel and Judah to prevent pilgrimages to Jerusalem. Some assert that he himself undertook a pilgrimage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/300-abijah Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which [[David]] divided the priests, and an ancestor of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], the priest who was the father of [[John the Baptist]] ({{bibleref|1|Chronicles|24:10|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:5|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:13|KJV}}).
