'''Abimelech''' (also spelled '''Abimelek''' or '''Avimelech'''; {{Hebrew Name 2|אֲבִימֶלֶךְ|אֲבִימָלֶךְ|Aviméleḵ|Avimáleḵ|ʼAḇîméleḵ|ʼAḇîmāleḵ|&quot;father/leader of a king; my father/leader, a king&quot;}}) was the name of multiple [[Philistine]] [[monarch|kings]] mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

==Etymology==
The name or title ''Abimelech'' is formed from Hebrew words for &quot;father&quot; and &quot;king,&quot; and may be interpreted in a variety of ways, including &quot;Father-King&quot;, &quot;My father is king,&quot; or &quot;Father of a king.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bluedorn2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Bluedorn |title=Yahweh Versus Baalism: A Theological Reading of the Gideon-Abimelech Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jx7KrAnNOoC&amp;pg=PA192 |date=19 December 2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-84127-200-9|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pentateuch, it is used as a title for kings in the land of Canaan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bluedorn2001b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Bluedorn|title=Yahweh Versus Baalism: A Theological Reading of the Gideon-Abimelech Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jx7KrAnNOoC&amp;pg=PA192|date=19 December 2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-84127-200-9|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[Amarna tablets]] (mid-14th century BC), there was an Egyptian governor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] similarly named [[Abimilki]], who is sometimes speculated to be connected with one or more of the biblical Abimelechs.

Abimelech was most prominently the name of a polytheistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benamozegh|first=Elia|title=Israel and Humanity|year=1995|publisher=Paulist Press International|isbn=978-0809135417|author2=Maxwell Luria|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Victor P.|title=Exodus: An Exegetical Commentary|year=2012|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0801031830|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vUry0cGNR_IC&amp;pg=PT1003&amp;lpg=PT1003&amp;dq=Abimelech{{!}}Abimilek+polytheism#v=onepage&amp;q=Abimelech{{!}}Abimilek%20polytheism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; king of [[Gerar]] who is mentioned in two of the three [[wife-sister narratives in Genesis]], in connection with both [[Abraham]] (chap. 20) and [[Isaac]] (chap. 26).  

King Abimelech of Gerar also appears in an extra-biblical tradition recounted in texts such as the [[Clementine literature|''Kitab al-Magall'']], the ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' and the ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'', as one of 12 regional kings in Abraham's time said to have built the city of [[Jerusalem]] for [[Melchizedek]].

==Other people with this name==
Apart from the king (or kings) of Gerar, the Bible also records this name for:
*[[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]], son of [[Gideon]] ({{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|HE}}), proclaimed king after the death of his father ({{bibleverse||Judges|9:1–6|HE}}).
*The father of [[Abiathar]], and [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priest]] in the time of David ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|18:16|HE}}). In the parallel passage, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|8:17|HE}}, the name is given as [[Ahimelech]]; most authorities consider this the more correct reading.
*The king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] better known as [[Achish]], referred to as Abimelech or Achimelech in the title of {{bibleverse||Psalm|34|HE}}.
*The husband of [[Naomi (biblical figure)|Naomi]], and father of [[Mahlon]] and [[Chilion]] who leaves [[Bethlehem]] and dies in the land of [[Moab]], {{bibleverse||Ruth|1:2–3|HE}} in the Hebrew, his name is given as [[Elimelek]], which is likely the correct reading.
Other literary references include:
*Abimélech, [[Satrap]] of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] is a character (baritone) in [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' opera ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Weimar, 1877)
