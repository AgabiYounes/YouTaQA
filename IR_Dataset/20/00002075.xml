'''Aircraft hijacking''' (also known as '''airplane hijacking''', '''skyjacking''', '''plane hijacking''', '''plane jacking''', '''air robbery''', '''air piracy''', or '''aircraft piracy''', with the latter term being used within the special aircraft [[jurisdiction]] of the [[United States]]), or simply '''hijacking''', is the [[Crime|unlawful]] seizure of an [[aircraft]] by an individual or a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46502|title=49 U.S. Code § 46502 – Aircraft piracy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2015-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116050854/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46502|archive-date=2015-11-16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating from the earliest of hijackings, most cases involve the [[Pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] being forced to fly according to the hijacker's demands. However, in rare cases, the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves and used them in [[suicide attacks]]; most notably in the [[September 11 attacks]], and in several cases, planes have been hijacked by the official pilot or co-pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photos: Major aircraft hijackings that shocked the world|url=http://www.mid-day.com/photos/photos-major-aircraft-hijackings-that-shocked-the-world/8324|accessdate=24 December 2014|issue=[[Mid Day]]|publisher=Mid-Day.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224104706/http://www.mid-day.com/photos/photos-major-aircraft-hijackings-that-shocked-the-world/8324|archive-date=24 December 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Air China pilot hijacks his own jet to Taiwan|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=28 October 1998|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9810/28/hijack.china.taiwan.02/index.html|accessdate=25 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321171516/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9810/28/hijack.china.taiwan.02/index.html|archivedate=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B.

Unlike [[carjacking]] or sea [[piracy]], an aircraft hijacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft. Individuals driven by personal gain often divert planes to destinations where they are not planned to go.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/29/11326472/hijacking-airplanes-egyptair|title=The US once had more than 130 hijackings in 4 years.

Various motives have driven such occurrences, such as demanding the release of certain high-profile individuals or for the right of [[political asylum]] (notably Flight [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961|ET 961]]). Hijackings involving hostages have produced violent confrontations between hijackers and the authorities, during [[negotiation]] and settlement. In the case of [[Lufthansa Flight 181]] and [[Operation Entebbe|Air France Flight 139]], the hijackers were not satisfied and showed no inclination to surrender, resulting in attempts by [[special forces]] to rescue passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578183.stm|title=History of airliner hijackings|date=2001-10-03|access-date=2019-06-29|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628042022/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578183.stm|archive-date=2019-06-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most jurisdictions of the world, aircraft hijacking is punishable by life imprisonment or a long prison sentence. In most jurisdictions where the death penalty is a legal punishment, aircraft hijacking is a [[capital crime]], including in China, India, and the U.S. states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Mississippi]].

==History==
{{Main|List of aircraft hijackings}}Airplane hijackings have occurred since the early days of flight. These can be classified in the following eras: 1929–1957, 1958–1979, 1980–2000 and 2001–present. Early incidents involved light planes but this later involved passenger aircraft as [[commercial aviation]] became widespread.

=== 1929–1957 ===
Between 1929 and 1957, there were fewer than 20 incidents of reported hijackings worldwide and several occurred in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=A profile of the global airline industry |last=Gourdin, Kent N. |isbn=9781606495551 |edition=First |location=New York |oclc=935736423|date=2015-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first unconfirmed hijackings occurred in December 1929. J. Howard &quot;Doc&quot; DeCelles was flying a postal route for a Mexican firm, Transportes Aeras Transcontinentales, ferrying mail from [[San Luis Potosí]] to [[Torreón|Torreon]] and then on to [[Guadalajara]]. A lieutenant named [[Saturnino Cedillo]], the governor of the state of San Luis Potosí, ordered him to divert. Several other men were also involved, and through an interpreter, DeCelles had no choice but to comply. He was allegedly held captive for several hours under armed guard before being released.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence in the Skies: A History of Aircraft Hijacking and Bombing|last=Baum|first=Philip|publisher=Summersdale Publishers LTD|year=2016|isbn=9781783727902|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded aircraft hijack took place on February 21, 1931, in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]. Byron Richards, flying a [[Ford Tri-Motor]], was approached on the ground by armed revolutionaries. He refused to fly them anywhere during a 10-day standoff. Richards was informed that the revolution was successful and he could be freed in return for flying one of the men to [[Lima]].&lt;ref&gt;30 years later Richards was again the victim of a failed hijacking attempt. A father and son boarded his [[Continental Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] in [[El Paso, Texas]] and tried to force him at gunpoint to fly the plane to [[Cuba]] hoping for a cash reward from [[Fidel Castro]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents and police chased the plane down the runway and shot out its tires, averting the hijacking. See http://www.airdisaster.com/features/hijack/hijack.shtml {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070724125115/http://www.airdisaster.com/features/hijack/hijack.shtml |date=2007-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in September 1932, a [[Sikorsky S-38]] with registration P-BDAD, still bearing the titles of [[Panair do Brasil|Nyrba do Brasil]] was seized in the company's hangar by three men, who took a fourth as a hostage. Despite having no flying experience, they managed to take-off. However, the aircraft crashed in [[São João de Meriti]], killing the four men. Apparently, the hijack was related to the events of the [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] in São Paulo and it is considered to be the first hijack that took place in Brazil.

On October 28, 1939, the first murder on a plane took place in [[Brookfield, Missouri]], US. The victim was Carl Bivens, a flight instructor, who was teaching a man named Earnest P. &quot;Larry&quot; Pletch. While airborne in a [[Taylor Cub|Taylor Club]] [[monoplane]], Pletch shot Bivens twice in the back of the head. Pletch later told prosecutors, &quot;Carl was telling me I had a natural ability and I should follow that line&quot;, adding, &quot;I had a revolver in my pocket and without saying a word to him, I took it out of my overalls and I fired a bullet into the back of his head. He never knew what struck him.&quot; The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' stated it was one of the most spectacular crimes of the 20th century. Pletch pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. However, he was released on March 1, 1957 after serving 17 years, and lived until June 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/murderous-story-americas-first-hijacking-180956152/ &quot;The Murderous Story of America's First Hijacking&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807171224/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/murderous-story-americas-first-hijacking-180956152/ |date=2015-08-07 }}, Mike Dash, smithsonian.com (5 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.magbloom.com/PDF/bloom20/Bloom_20_Killer.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628144121/http://magbloom.com/PDF/bloom20/Bloom_20_Killer.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-28 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, two New Zealanders, a South African and an Englishman achieved the first confirmed in-air hijack when they violently captured an Italian seaplane that was flying them to a prison camp. As they approached an Allied base, they were strafed by [[Spitfires]] and forced to land on the water. However, all on board survived to be picked up by a British boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvuQQaQLDPQ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221093841/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvuQQaQLDPQ&amp;gl=US&amp;hl=en&amp;has_verified=1&amp;bpctr=9999999999 |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/43/a2040643.shtml |title=The World's First Air Hijack!

In the years following [[World War II]], Philip Baum, an [[Airport security|aviation security]] expert suggests that the development of a rebellious youth &quot;piggybacking on to any cause which challenged the status quo or acted in support of those deemed oppressed&quot;, may have been a contributor to attacks against the aviation industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The first hijacking of a commercial flight occurred on the [[Cathay Pacific]] ''[[Miss Macao]]'' on July 16, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/May-June-08/On-this-Day--The-First-Commercial-Flight-is-Hijacked.html |title=On This Day: First Commercial Flight Hijacked |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103075904/http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/May-June-08/On-this-Day--The-First-Commercial-Flight-is-Hijacked.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident and others in the 1950s, airlines recommended that flight crews comply with the hijackers demands than risk a violent confrontation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; There were also various hijacking incidents and assaults on planes in [[China]] and the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The first hijacking of a flight for political reasons happened in [[Bolivia]], affecting the airline [[Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano|Lloyd Aereo Boliviano]] on September 26, 1956. The [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] was carrying 47 prisoners who were being transported from [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz, Bolivia]] to El Alto, in [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]]. A political group was waiting to take them to a concentration camp located in Carahuara de Carangas, [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]]. The 47 prisoners overpowered the crew and gained control of the aircraft while airborne and diverted the plane to [[Tartagal, Argentina]]. Prisoners took control of the aircraft and received instructions to again fly to [[Salta|Salta, Argentina]] as the airfield in Tartagal was not big enough. Upon landing, they told the government of the [[injustice]] they were subjected to, and received [[political asylum]].

=== 1958–1979 ===
Between 1958 and 1967, there were approximately 40 hijackings worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Beginning 1958, hijackings ''from'' [[Cuba]] to other destinations started to occur, and then in 1961, hijackings ''to'' Cuba became prevalent.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The first happened on May 1, 1961, on a flight from [[Miami]] to [[Key West]]. The perpetrator, armed with a knife and gun, forced the captain to land in Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volpe|first=John A.|last2=Stewart|first2=John T.|date=1970|title=Aircraft Hijacking: Some Domestic and International Responses|url=|journal=Kentucky Law Journal|volume=59|issue=2|pages=273–318|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] was relatively untouched by the threat of hijackings until July 19, 1960. On that evening, a 22-year-old Russian man attempted to divert [[Trans Australia Airlines Flight 408]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] or [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The crew were able to subdue the man after a brief struggle.

In the 1960s, there were over 200 attempts of hijackings involving U.S aircraft: 77 successful and 23 unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Recognizing the danger early, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued a directive on July 28, 1961, which prohibits unauthorized persons from carrying concealed [[firearm]]s and interfering with crew member duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958]] was amended to impose severe penalties for those seizing control of a commercial aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Airlines could also refuse to transport passengers who were likely to cause danger. That same year, the FAA and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] created the [[Federal Air Marshal Service|Peace Officers Program]] which put trained marshals on flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; A few years later, on May 7, 1964, the FAA adopted a rule requiring that [[cockpit]] doors on commercial aircraft be kept locked at all times.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

In a five-year period (1968–1972) the world experienced 326 hijack attempts, or one every 5.6 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Robert T.|date=1986|title=The Contagiousness of Aircraft Hijacking|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=91|issue=4|pages=874–904|issn=0002-9602|jstor=2779961|doi=10.1086/228353}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents were frequent and often just an inconvenience, which resulted in [[television show]]s creating parodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/3/29/11326472/hijacking-airplanes-egyptair|title=The US once had more than 130 hijackings in four years.

In contrast, there were 26 extortion attempts (see table on the right). The longest and first transcontinental (Los Angeles, Denver, New York, Bangor, Shannon and Rome) from the US started on the 31 October 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;LongestHijacking&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48069272|title=TWA85: The world's longest and most spectacular hijacking|date=26 October 2019|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027051638/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48069272|archive-date=27 October 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents also became problematic outside of the U.S. For instance, in 1968, [[El Al Flight 426 hijacking|El Al Flight 426]] was seized by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) militants on 23 July, an incident which lasted 40 days, making it one of the longest. This record was later beaten in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryHijackings&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578183.stm|title=History of airliner hijackings|date=3 October 2001|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210225214/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1578183.stm|archive-date=10 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the evolving threat, [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] issued a directive in 1970 to promote security at airports, electronic surveillance and multilateral agreements for tackling the problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

Furthermore, a report by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) in July 1970 revealed the need for action. Beginning of 1969 until the end of June 1970, there were 118 incidents of unlawful seizure of aircraft and 14 incidents of sabotage and armed attacks against civil aviation. This involved airlines of 47 countries and more than 7,000 passengers. In this period, 96 people were killed and 57 were injured as a result of hijacking, sabotage and armed attacks. The ICAO stated that this is not isolated to one nation or one region, but a worldwide issue to the safe growth of international [[civil aviation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=News Release|last=|first=|date=July 3, 1970|work=International Civil Aviation Organization|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidents also became notorious—in 1971, a man known as [[D. B. Cooper]] hijacked a plane and extorted US$200,000 in ransom before parachuting over [[Oregon]]. He was never identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Geoffrey|date=21 October 2007|title=Unmasking D.B.

[[Flight Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Matiur Rahman (military pilot)|Matiur Rahman]] attacked [[Pilot Officer|Officer]] [[Rashid Minhas]] and attempted to land in India. Minhas deliberately crashed the plane into the ground near [[Thatta]] to prevent the diversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408215819/http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/awpreview/TextContent.aspx?pId=176|title=Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas|date=2012-04-08|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries around the world continued their efforts to tackle crimes committed on-board planes. The [[Tokyo Convention]], drafted in 1958, established an agreement between signatories that the &quot;state in which the aircraft is registered is competent to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on board that aircraft while it is in flight&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; While the Convention does not make hijacking an international crime, it does contain provisions which obligate the country in which a hijacked aircraft lands to restore the aircraft to its responsible owner, and allow the passengers and crew to continue their journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LOY|first=FRANK E.|date=1970|title=Some International Approaches to Dealing With Hijacking of Aircraft|journal=The International Lawyer|volume=4|issue=3|pages=444–452|issn=0020-7810|jstor=40704612}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention came into force in December 1969. A year later, in December 1970, the [[Hague Hijacking Convention|Hague Convention]] was drafted which punishes hijackers, enabling each state to prosecute a hijacker if that state does not extradite them, and to deprive them from asylum from prosecution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

On December 5, 1972, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued emergency rules requiring all passengers and their carry-on baggage to be screened.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Commercial Aviation Security|last=|first=|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Washington D.C|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airports slowly implemented walk-through [[Magnetometer|metal detectors]], hand-searches and [[x-ray]] machines, to prohibit weapons and explosive devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; These rules came into effect on January 5, 1973 and were welcomed by most of the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; Between 1968 and 1977, there were approximately 41 hijackings per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== 1980–2000 ===
By 1980, airport screening and greater cooperation from the international community led to fewer successful hijackings; the number of events had significantly dropped below the 1968 level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The FBI Encyclopedia|last1=Newton|first1=Michael|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1978 and 1988, there were roughly 26 incidents of hijackings a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; A new threat emerged in the 1980s and this was from [[Terrorism|organised terrorists]] destroying aircraft to draw attention. For instance, terrorist groups were responsible for the bombing of [[Air India Flight 182]] over the Irish coast. In 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] was bombed flying over Scotland.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Terrorist activity which included hijack attempts in the Middle East were also a cause of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plane clothes: lack of anonymity at the Federal Air Marshal Service compromises aviation and national security: investigative report|last=On The Judiciary|first=The Committee|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=2006|isbn=9781428994294|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, there was relative peace in the United States airspace as the threat of domestic hijacking was seen as a distant memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=John M.|date=2007-09-01|title=Conceptualizing the Hijacking Threat to Civil Aviation|journal=Criminal Justice Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=3|pages=209–232|doi=10.1177/0734016807306152|issn=0734-0168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, however, hijackings still persisted. Between 1993 and 2003, the highest number of hijackings occurred in 1993 (see table below). This number can be attributed to events in [[China]] where hijackers were trying to gain political asylum in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Europe and the rest of [[East Asia]] were not immune either. On December 26, 1994, [[Air France Flight 8969]] with 172 passengers and crew was hijacked after leaving [[Algiers]]. Authorities believed that the goal was to crash the plane into the [[Eiffel Tower]]. On June 21, 1995, [[All Nippon Airways Flight 857]] was hijacked by a man claiming to be a member of the [[Aum Shinrikyo]] religious cult, demanding the release of its imprisoned leader [[Shoko Asahara]]. The incident was resolved when the police stormed the plane.

On October 17, 1996, the first hijacking that was brought to an end while airborne was carried out by four operatives of the [[Austria]]n [[List of special law enforcement units|special law enforcement unit]] [[EKO Cobra|Cobra]] on a [[Russian Federation|Russian]] [[Aeroflot]] flight from [[Malta]] to [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], aboard a [[Tupolev Tu-154]].

{{See also|September 11 attacks}}
On September 11, 2001, four airliners were hijacked by 19 [[Al-Qaeda]] [[Islamic extremist]]s: [[American Airlines Flight 11]], [[United Airlines Flight 175]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]] and [[United Airlines Flight 93]]. The first two planes were deliberately crashed into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and the third was crashed into [[The Pentagon]] building. The fourth crashed in a field in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] after crew and passengers attempted to overpower the hijackers. Authorities believe that the intended target was the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]]. In total, [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|2,996 people]] perished and more than 6,000 were injured in the attacks, making the hijackings the most deadly in modern history.

Following the attacks, the U.S formed the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) to handle airport screening at U.S airports. Government agencies around the world tightened their airport security, procedures and intelligence gathering.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Mark J.|last2=Mueller|first2=John|date=29 April 2008|title=A risk and cost-benefit assessment of United States aviation security measures|url=|journal=Journal of Transportation Security|volume=|pages=|via=Springer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the September 11 attacks, there had never been an incident whereby an aircraft was used as a weapon of mass destruction. The [[9/11 Commission]] report stated that it was always assumed that a &quot;hijacking would take the traditional form&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|website=govinfo.library.unt.edu|access-date=2019-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514052417/http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm|archive-date=2008-05-14|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, airline crews never had a contingency plan for a suicide-hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/politics/summary-of-final-report.html|title=Summary of Final Report|date=2004-07-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705221731/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/politics/summary-of-final-report.html|archive-date=2019-07-05|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Patrick Smith, an airline pilot, summarizes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the big ironies here is the success of the 2001 attacks had nothing to do with airport security in the first place. It was a failure of national security. What the men actually exploited was a weakness in our mind-set – a set of presumptions based on decades-long track record of hijackings. In years past, a hijacking meant a diversion, with hostage negotiations and standoffs. The only weapon that mattered was the intangible one: the element of surprise.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cockpit confidential : everything you need to know about air travel : questions, answers &amp; reflections |last=Smith, Patrick |isbn=9781492663973 |edition=Revised and updated |location=Naperville, Illinois |oclc=1039369001|date=2018-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout the mid-2000s, hijackings still occurred but there were much fewer incidents and casualties. The number of incidents had been declining, even before the September 11 attacks. One notable incident in 2006 was the hijacking of [[Turkish Airlines Flight 1476]], flying from [[Tirana]] to [[Istanbul]], which was seized by a man named Hakan Ekinci. The aircraft, with 107 passengers and 6 crew, made distress calls to [[air traffic control]] and the plane was escorted by military aircraft before landing safely at [[Brindisi]], Italy. In 2007, several incidents occurred in the Middle East and [[North Africa|Northern Africa]], one of which men claimed to be affiliated with [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622142418/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/19/europe/turkey.php|title=Pilots and passengers foil hijacking of Turkish jet - International Herald Tribune|date=2008-06-22|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the decade, [[Aeroméxico|AeroMexico]] experienced its first terror incident when [[Aeroméxico Flight 576|Flight 576]] was hijacked by a man demanding to speak with [[Mexican President|President]] [[Felipe Calderón|Calderón]].

Since 2010, the [[Aviation Safety Network]] estimates there have been 15 hijackings worldwide with three fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/statistics/period/stats.php?cat=A1|title=Aviation Safety Network &gt; Statistics &gt; By period|last=Ranter|first=Harro|website=aviation-safety.net|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824230442/https://aviation-safety.net/statistics/period/stats.php?cat=A1|archive-date=2019-08-24|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a considerable lower figure than in previous decades which can be attributed to greater security enhancements and awareness of September 11–style attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/29/hijackings-rare-after-911-security-improvements/82375474/|title=Hijackings rare after 9/11 security improvements|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706110314/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/29/hijackings-rare-after-911-security-improvements/82375474/|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/03/30/why-hijackings-are-no-longer-common|title=Why hijackings are no longer common|date=2016-03-30|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-07-06|issn=0013-0613|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706110314/https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2016/03/30/why-hijackings-are-no-longer-common|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2012, an attempt was made to hijack [[Tianjin Airlines Flight GS7554]] from [[Hotan]] to [[Ürümqi]] in China. More recently was the 2016 hijacking of [[EgyptAir]] [[EgyptAir Flight 181|Flight MS181]], involving an Egyptian man who claimed to have a bomb and ordered the plane to land in [[Cyprus]]. He surrendered several hours later, after freeing the passengers and crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

==Countermeasures==
{{See also|Airport security}}As a result of the U.S–Cuba hijacking epidemic of the late 1960s to early 1970s, international airports introduced screening technology such as metal detectors, x-ray machines and [[Explosive detection|explosive]] detection tools. In the U.S, these rules were enforced starting from January 1973&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; and were eventually copied around the world. These security measures did make hijacking a &quot;higher-risk proposition&quot; and deter criminals in later decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/a-brief-history-of-airline-security-hijackings-and-metal-detectors/|title=A brief history of airline security, hijackings and metal detectors|date=2019-04-24|website=IBM IT Infrastructure Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706110312/https://www.ibm.com/blogs/systems/a-brief-history-of-airline-security-hijackings-and-metal-detectors/|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until September 2001, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] set and enforced a &quot;layered&quot; system of defense: hijacking intelligence, passenger pre-screening, checkpoint screening and on-board security. The idea was that if one layer were later to fail, another would be able stop a hijacker from boarding a plane. However, the [[9/11 Commission]] found that this layered approach was flawed and unsuitable to prevent the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|website=govinfo.library.unt.edu|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526072202/http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm|archive-date=2019-05-26|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S [[Transportation Security Administration]] has since strengthened this approach, with a greater emphasis on intelligence sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol50no3/airport_security_5.htm|title=Intelligence and Airport Security — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706201149/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol50no3/airport_security_5.htm|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsa.gov/news/testimony/2018/09/05/keeping-our-skies-secure-oversight-tsa|title=Keeping Our Skies Secure: Oversight of the TSA|date=2018-09-05|website=Transportation Security Administration|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706201203/https://www.tsa.gov/news/testimony/2018/09/05/keeping-our-skies-secure-oversight-tsa|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On-board security ===
[[File:Security simulation at Swartkops Air Force Base1.jpg|thumb|An aircraft hijacking assault simulation by South African special forces|200x200px]]
In the history of hijackings, most incidents involved planes being forced to land at a certain destination with demands. As a result, commercial airliners adopted a &quot;total compliance&quot; rule which taught pilots and [[Flight attendant|cabin crew]] to comply with the hijackers demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; Crews advise passengers to sit quietly to increase their chances of survival. The ultimate goal is to land the plane safely and let the [[SWAT|security forces]] handle the situation. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] suggested that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it would end peacefully with the hijackers reaching their goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|publisher=|access-date=2008-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927230023/http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm|archive-date=2008-09-27|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although total compliance is still relevant, the events of September 11 changed this paradigm as this technique cannot prevent a suicide hijacking.

It is now evident that each hijacking situation needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Cabin crew, now aware of the severe consequences, have a greater responsibility for maintaining control of their aircraft. Most airlines also give crew members training in self-defense tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/26/opinion/abend-terror-hijack-threat/index.html|title=Pilot: Here's what keeps you safe on a plane (Opinion) - CNN|last=Les Abend|work=CNN|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706114524/https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/26/opinion/abend-terror-hijack-threat/index.html|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since the 1970s, crew are taught to be vigilant for suspicious behaviour. For example, passengers who have no carry-on luggage, or are standing next to the cockpit door with fidgety movements. There have been various incidents when crew and passengers intervened to prevent attacks: on December 22, 2001, [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]] attempted to ignite explosives on [[2001 failed shoe bomb attempt|American Airlines Flight 63]]. In 2009, on [[Northwest Flight 253]], [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] attempted to detonate explosives sewn into his underwear. In 2012, the attempted hijacking of [[Tianjin Airlines Flight 7554]] was stopped when cabin crew placed a trolley in-front of the cockpit door and asked passengers for help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-07/07/content_15556586.htm|title=Hotan airport security staff cleared{{!}}Society{{!}}chinadaily.com.cn|website=usa.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706114526/http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-07/07/content_15556586.htm|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American Airlines Flight 11 ====
In the September 11 attacks, crew on one of the hijacked planes went beyond their scope of training by informing the airline [[Groundcrew|ground crew]] about the events on board. In separate phone calls, [[Madeline Amy Sweeney|Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]] provided information on seat numbers of the attackers and passenger injuries. This helped authorities identify them.

=== Cockpit security ===
As early as 1964, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] required cockpit doors on commercial aircraft be kept locked during flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In 2002, [[United States Congress|U.S Congress]] passed the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act, allowing pilots at U.S airlines to carry guns in the cockpit. Since 2003, these pilots are known as [[Federal Flight Deck Officer]]s. It is estimated that one in 10 of the 125,000 commercial pilots are trained and armed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43377461|title=The US airline pilots trained to shoot hijackers|last=Amos|first=Owen|date=2018-03-26|access-date=2019-07-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706124236/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43377461|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2002, aircraft manufacturers such as [[Airbus]] introduced a reinforced cockpit door which is resistant to gunfire and forced entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germanwings-crash-airbus-video-reveals-how-reinforced-cockpit-doors-work-10135414.html|title=Airbus video reveals exactly how reinforced cockpit doors work|date=2015-03-26|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706140054/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germanwings-crash-airbus-video-reveals-how-reinforced-cockpit-doors-work-10135414.html|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, the FAA required operators of more than 6,000 aircraft to install tougher cockpit doors by 9 April 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Rules were also tightened to restrict cockpit access and make it easier for pilots to lock the doors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/sept11/faa_001.asp|title=The Avalon Project : FAA Sets New Standards for Cockpit Doors; January 11, 2002|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706110315/https://avalon.law.yale.edu/sept11/faa_001.asp|archive-date=July 6, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-32070528|title=How are cockpit doors locked?|last=Why|first=Who, What|date=2015-03-26|access-date=2019-07-06|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706140621/https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-32070528|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a [[Germanwings Flight 9525|Germanwings plane]] was seized by the co-pilot and deliberately crashed, while the captain was out. The captain was unable to re-enter the cockpit, because the airline had already reinforced the cockpit door. The [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] issued a recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two people, one pilot and a member of cabin crew, occupy the cockpit during flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/easa-recommends-minimum-two-crew-cockpit|title=EASA recommends minimum two crew in the cockpit {{!}}|website=EASA|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706145050/https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/easa-recommends-minimum-two-crew-cockpit|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA in the United States enforce a similar rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiro7.com/news/faa-cockpit-pilot-requirements/43326524|title=Q &amp; A: FAA cockpit, pilot requirements|last=EndPlay|date=2015-03-26|website=KIRO|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706145040/https://www.kiro7.com/news/faa-cockpit-pilot-requirements/43326524|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air marshal service ===
{{See also|Sky marshal}}
Some countries operate a marshal service, which puts members of [[law enforcement]] on high-risk flights based on intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Their role is to keep passengers safe, by preventing hijackings and other criminal acts committed on a plane. [[Federal Air Marshal Service|Federal marshals]] in the U.S are required to identify themselves before boarding a plane, however, marshals of other countries often are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2014/08/07/5-myths-about-air-marshals/13724331/|title=Five myths about air marshals|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706134542/https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2014/08/07/5-myths-about-air-marshals/13724331/|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], the budget for the U.S Federal Air Marshal Service was US$719 million in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Marshals often sit as regular passengers, at the front of the plane to allow observation of the cockpit. Despite the expansion of the marshal service, they cannot be on every plane, and they rarely face a real threat on a flight. Critics have questioned the need for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/17/tsa-air-marshal-training-terrorism-planes/601236002/|title=Terror in the skies: TSA's air marshals are 'last line of defense,' but is the program really needed?|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706134542/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/17/tsa-air-marshal-training-terrorism-planes/601236002/|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air traffic control===
There is no generic or set of rules for handling a hijacking situation. [[Air traffic controller]]s are expected to exercise their best judgement and expertise when dealing with the apparent consequences of an unlawful interference/hijack.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Unlawful_Interference:_Guidance_for_Controllers|title=Unlawful Interference: Guidance for Controllers - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|website=www.skybrary.aero|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706134547/https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Unlawful_Interference:_Guidance_for_Controllers|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilots, however, are expected to notify controllers via radio or by &quot;squawking&quot; a transponder code of &quot;7500&quot; – the universal code for a hijack in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|website=govinfo.library.unt.edu|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514052417/http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm|archive-date=2008-05-14|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Emergency_Transponder_Codes|title=Emergency Transponder Codes - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|website=www.skybrary.aero|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706134543/https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Emergency_Transponder_Codes|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the jurisdiction, the controller will inform the authorities such as the military who will escort the hijacked plane. Controllers are expected to keep communications to a minimum and clear the [[runway]] for a possible landing.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt;

==Aircraft shot down==

===Germany===
In January 2005, a federal law came into force in [[Germany]], called the [[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]], which allows &quot;direct action by armed force&quot; against a hijacked aircraft to prevent a September 11–style attack. However, in February 2006 the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] struck down these provisions of the law, stating such preventive measures were unconstitutional and would essentially be state-sponsored murder, even if such an act would save many more lives on the ground. The main reason behind this decision was that the state would effectively be taking the lives of innocent hostages in order to avoid a terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/EN/2006/02/rs20060215_1bvr035705en.html|title=Bundesverfassungsgericht - Decisions - Authorisation to shoot down aircraft in the Aviation Security Act void|last=Bundesverfassungsgericht|first=1 Senat|date=2006-02-15|website=www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de|language=en|access-date=2019-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706145039/https://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/SharedDocs/Entscheidungen/EN/2006/02/rs20060215_1bvr035705en.html|archive-date=2019-07-06|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also ruled that the [[Minister of Defense]] is constitutionally not entitled to act in terrorism matters, as this is the duty of the state and federal police forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4715878.stm|title=German court rejects hijack law|website=news.bbc.co.uk|date=2006-02-15|access-date=2006-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629200323/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4715878.stm|archive-date=2006-06-29|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Germany]], [[Horst Köhler]], urged judicial review of the constitutionality of the Luftsicherheitsgesetz after he signed it into law in 2005.

===India===
India published its new anti-hijacking policy in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4150640.stm &quot;India adopts tough hijack policy&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314140955/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4150640.stm |date=2011-03-14 }}. [[BBC News]], 14 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The policy came into force after approval from the [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] (CCS). The main points of the policy are:
* Any attempt to hijack will be considered an act of aggression against the country and will prompt a response fit for an aggressor.
* Hijackers, if captured alive, will be put on trial, convicted, and sentenced to death.
* Hijackers will be engaged in negotiations only to bring the incident to an end, to comfort passengers and to prevent loss of lives.
* The hijacked plane will be shot down if it is deemed to become a missile heading for strategic targets.
* The hijacked plane will be escorted by armed fighter aircraft and will be forced to land.
* A hijacked grounded plane will not be allowed to take off under any circumstance.
