&quot;'''Advance Australia Fair'''&quot; is the [[national anthem]] of [[Australia]]. Created by the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born composer [[Peter Dodds McCormick]], the song was first performed in 1878 and sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It replaced &quot;[[God Save the Queen]]&quot; as the official national anthem in 1984, following a [[1977 Australian plebiscite (National Song)|plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977]]. Other songs and marches have been influenced by &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, such as the Australian [[Honors music|vice-regal salute]].

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Petermccormick.jpg|thumb|Peter Dodds McCormick, the composer of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;]]
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Advance Australia Fair (1915).ogg|title=&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;|description=Performed in 1915}}
&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; was composed in the late 19th century by [[Peter Dodds McCormick]] under the pen-name &quot;Amicus&quot; (which means &quot;friend&quot; in Latin). It was first performed by Andrew Fairfax at a function of the Highland Society of New South Wales in Sydney on 30 November 1878. The song quickly gained popularity and an amended version was sung by a choir of around 10,000 at the inauguration of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] on 1 January 1901. In 1907 the Australian Government awarded McCormick £100 for his composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AuDB | id2=mccormick-peter-dodds-7323 |title=McCormick, Peter Dodds (1834–1916) |first=Jim |last=Fletcher |volume=10 |year=1986 |access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to R.B. Fuller dated 1 August 1913, McCormick described the circumstances that inspired him to write &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;:

{{quote|One night I attended a great concert in the Exhibition Building, when all the National Anthems of the world were to be sung by a large choir with band accompaniment. This was very nicely done, but I felt very aggravated that there was not one note for Australia. On the way home in a bus, I concocted the first verse of my song &amp; when I got home I set it to music. I first wrote it in the Tonic Sol-fa notation, then transcribed it into the Old Notation, &amp; I tried it over on an instrument next morning, &amp; found it correct. Strange to say there has not been a note of it altered since. Some alteration has been made in the wording, but the sense is the same. It seemed to me to be like an inspiration, &amp; I wrote the words &amp; music with the greatest ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an000008257145|title=Letters [manuscript]|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=26 October 2008}} Letter to R.B. Fuller Esq. dated 1 August 1913&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known sound recording of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; appears in ''The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt'' (circa 1916), a short commercial recording dramatising the arrival of Australian troops in Egypt ''en route'' to Gallipoli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/historical/landing-of-australian-troops/clip1/ The Landing of the Australian Troops in Egypt] from National Film and Sound Archive, at australianscreen online&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its adoption as Australia's national anthem, &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; had considerable use elsewhere. For example, Australia's national broadcaster, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]], used it to announce its news bulletins until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screensound.gov.au/services/soa-media/index.html |title=Media Resources – Images and Audio files for Download |publisher=[[National Film and Sound Archive]] |accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018045853/http://screensound.gov.au/services/soa-media/index.html |archivedate=18 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }} (1943 – The Majestic Fanfare by Charles Williams, the ABC radio news theme)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also frequently played at the start or end of official functions. Towards the end of World War II it was one of three songs played in certain picture theatres, along with &quot;God Save the King&quot; and the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|US national anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17882691|title=Song and Two Anthems|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 November 1943|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competitions, plebiscite and adoption===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Advance Australia Fair (1927).ogg|title=&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;|description=First vocal performance in 1927}}
Until 1974 &quot;[[God Save the Queen]]&quot; was Australia's national anthem. In 1973 the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government decided that the country needed an anthem that could represent Australia with &quot;distinction&quot; and started a competition to find one. This decision by Whitlam was driven by the desire to forge a new nationalism separate from Great Britain. In 1973, Gough Whitlam dedicated an entire Australia Day speech to the search for a new anthem saying that it will be a &quot;symbolic expression of our national pride and dignity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Whitlam, G 1973, 'National Anthem', Australia Day Broadcast&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australia Council for the Arts]] organised the contest, which was dubbed the &quot;Australian National Anthem Quest&quot;. The contest was held in two stages, the first seeking lyrics and the second music, each having an [[Australian dollar|A$]]5,000 prize for the winning entry. On the recommendation of the Council for the Arts, none of the new entries were felt worthy enough, so the contest ended with the suggestions for &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, &quot;[[Waltzing Matilda]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Song of Australia]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#history|title=Australian National Anthem – History|publisher=Australian Government|date=10 July 2007|accessdate=1 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109134834/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/anthem.cfm#dvd_cd|archivedate=9 November 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 the Whitlam government then performed a nationwide opinion survey to determine the song to be sung on occasions of national significance. Conducted through the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], it polled 60,000 people nationally. &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; was chosen and was enshrined as the national song, to be used on all occasions excepting those of a specifically regal nature. A spokesman for the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam stated that the Government regarded the tune primarily as the national anthem.  During the [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 election campaign]] following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissal of Whitlam by Sir John Kerr]], it was proposed by [[David Combe]] that the song be played at the start of the Labor Party's official campaign launch on 24 November 1975 at Festival Hall, Melbourne. Whitlam's speechwriter [[Graham Freudenberg]] rejected this idea, on two grounds, one of which was that the status of the anthem was still tentative.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Freudenberg, &quot;We've been sacked&quot;, ''The Sunday Age'', 6 November 2005, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1976 the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government reinstated &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; for royal, vice-regal, defence and [[loyal toast]] occasions as well as making plans to conduct a national poll to find a song for use on ceremonial occasions when it was desired to mark a separate Australian identity. This was conducted as a [[1977 Australian plebiscite (National Song)|plebiscite to choose the National Song]], held as an optional additional question in the [[1977 Australian referendum|1977 referendum]] on various issues. &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; received 43.29% of the vote, defeating the three alternatives, &quot;[[Waltzing Matilda]]&quot; (28.28%), &quot;[[Song of Australia]]&quot; (9.65%) and the existing national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; (18.78%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm |title=Plebiscite results: National Song Poll |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=13 February 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205110200/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/elect/referend/pleb.htm |archivedate=5 February 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, with modified lyrics from the original (see [[#Development of lyrics|development of lyrics]]), was adopted as the Australian national anthem on 19 April 1984 by a proclamation by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm |title=Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia – National Symbols |publisher=[[Parliament of Australia]] |date=21 September 2005 |accessdate=1 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830052800/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/handbook/national_symbols/index.htm |archivedate=30 August 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }} (proclamation by Governor-General dated 19 April 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; on a recommendation by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[Bob Hawke]]. &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, now known as the [[royal anthem]], continues to be played alongside the Australian national anthem at public engagements in Australia that are attended by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] or members of the Royal Family.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; were officially adopted in 1984 as follows:&lt;ref name=anthem&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/nat_anthem.html|title=The Australian National Anthem|publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]]|accessdate=1 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023080802/http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/nat_anthem.html|archivedate=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of lyrics==
Since the original lyrics were written in 1879, there have been several changes, in some cases with the intent of increasing the anthem's inclusiveness and [[gender neutrality]]. Some of these were minor while others have significantly changed the song. The original song was four verses long. For its adoption as the national anthem, the song was cut from four verses to two. The first verse was kept largely as the 1879 original, except for the change in the first line from &quot;{{em|Australia's sons}} let us rejoice&quot; to &quot;{{em|Australians all}} let us rejoice&quot;.&lt;ref name=anthem/&gt; The second, third and fourth verses of the original were dropped, in favour of a modified version of the new third verse which was sung at [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.mus-an6397822|title=Digital Collections – Advance Australia Fair (1901–1919)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=3 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original lyrics published in 1879 were as follows:&lt;ref name=1879orig&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.mus-an24220024-s1-e|title=Digital Collections – Advance Australia Fair (1879)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=1 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:2em;&quot;&gt;When gallant [[James Cook|Cook]] from [[Albion]] sailed,
To trace wide oceans o'er,
True British courage bore him on,
Til he landed on our shore.
Then here he raised Old England's flag,
The standard of the brave;
&quot;With all her faults we love her still&quot;
&quot;[[Command of the sea|Britannia rules the wave]].&quot;
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;

Behold us from afar,
We'll rise to high renown and shine
Like our glorious southern star;

[[Scotland|Scotia]] and [[Ireland|Erin]] fair,
Let all combine with heart and hand
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Should foreign foe e'er sight our coast,
Or dare a foot to land,
We'll rouse to arms like sires of yore,
To guard our native strand;
Britannia then shall surely know,
Though oceans roll between,
Her sons in fair Australia's land
Still keep their courage green.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;{{Clear|left}}

The 1901 Federation version of the third verse was originally sung as:
&lt;poem&gt;Beneath our radiant Southern Cross,
We'll toil with hearts and hands;
To make our youthful Commonwealth,
Renowned of all the lands;
For loyal sons beyond the seas
We've boundless plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To advance Australia fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing
Advance Australia fair!&lt;/poem&gt;

==Orchestral arrangement==
The orchestral arrangement of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; that is now regularly played for Australian victories at international sporting medal ceremonies, and at the openings of major domestic sporting, cultural and community events, is by [[Tommy Tycho]], an immigrant from Hungary. It was commissioned by [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Records in 1984 and then televised by [[Network Ten|Channel 10]] in 1986 in their Australia Day broadcast, featuring [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]] as the soloist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tommytycho.com.au/arranger.htm|title=Tommy Tycho—Arranger|access-date=27 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822093116/http://www.tommytycho.com.au/arranger.htm|archive-date=22 August 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}{{Better source|date=December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The song has been criticised for failing to represent or acknowledge [[Indigenous Australians|Australia's Indigenous peoples]] and the country's colonial history. The lyrics have been accused of celebrating British colonisation and perpetuating the racist myth of [[terra nullius]]. 

Australian author and academic [[Christopher Kelen]] has argued that the repetition of &quot;fair&quot; in the chorus celebrates the &quot;civilising&quot; mission of European colonists, in the tradition of the &quot;[[The White Man's Burden|white man's burden]]&quot; described by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. Kelen suggests that the word &quot;fair&quot; – which he takes to mean &quot;beautiful', &quot;just&quot; or &quot;white&quot; – reinforces the [[terra nullius]] myth, and that the anthem fails to acknowledge a time before European colonisation and the [[Genocide of indigenous peoples|genocide]] of much of the Indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelen|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Kelen|title=How fair is fair?

The second line of the anthem, &quot;for we are young and free&quot;, has been criticised for ignoring the long history of Indigenous Australians, who have inhabited Australia for at least 60,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/19/dig-finds-evidence-of-aboriginal-habitation-up-to-80000-years-ago|title=Australian dig finds evidence of Aboriginal habitation up to 80,000 years ago|last=Davidson|first=Helen|date=2017-07-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-14|last2=Wahlquist|first2=Calla|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New version of national anthem cuts 'offensive' lyrics|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/indigenous-australians/alternative-version-of-advance-australia-fair-recognises-aboriginal-culture-ng-b88484280z|work=[[The West Australian]]|date=22 May 2017|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, public debate about the anthem has increased. In 2015, Aboriginal Australian soprano [[Deborah Cheetham]] declined an invitation to sing the anthem at the 2015 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] grand final after the AFL turned down her request to replace the words &quot;for we are young and free&quot; with &quot;in peace and harmony&quot;. She has advocated for the lyrics be rewritten and endorsed Judith Durham and Kutcha Edwards' alternative version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/young-and-free-why-i-declined-to-sing-the-national-anthem-at-the-2015-afl-grand-final-49234|title=Young and free?

Several alternative versions of &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; have been proposed to address the exclusion of Indigenous Australians. [[Judith Durham]] of [[The Seekers]] and [[Muthi Muthi|Mutti Mutti]] musician [[Kutcha Edwards]] released their alternative lyrics in 2009, replacing &quot;for we are young and free&quot; with the opening lines &quot;Australians let us stand as one, upon this sacred land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/nitv-news/article/2015/11/06/judith-durhams-new-anthem-lyric-contemporary-australia|title=Judith Durham's new anthem: 'Lyric For Contemporary Australia'|website=NITV|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the [https://www.rap.org.au/ Recognition in Anthem Project] was established and began work on a new version, with lyrics written by poet and former Victorian Supreme Court judge [[Peter Vickery]] following consultation with Indigenous communities and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/04/06/new-call-update-national-anthem|title=New call to update the National Anthem|website=NITV|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vickery's proposed lyrics retain most of the original first verse, but change &quot;we are young and free&quot; to &quot;we are one and free&quot;. The second verse acknowledges Indigenous history, immigration, and calls for unity and respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-are-one-not-young-change-to-national-anthem-proposed-20190912-p52qs7.html|title=We are 'one', not 'young': Change to national anthem proposed|last=Power|first=Julie|date=2019-09-13|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political sentiment is divided. [[Craig Emerson]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]] has critiqued the anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,1570357%5E1683,00.html|title=Advance Australia Fair strikes a sour note|date=2 January 2001|newspaper=The Australian|accessdate=20 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; former MP [[Peter Slipper]] has said that Australia should consider another anthem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/politics/2001/06/item20010621121726_1.htm|title=Senator reignites debate over national anthem|date=21 June 2001|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20010719092243/http://www.abc.net.au/news/politics/2001/06/item20010621121726_1.htm|archive-date=19 July 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011 former Victorian Premier [[Jeff Kennett]] suggested &quot;[[I Am Australian]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/strewth-time-for-dinki-di-anthem/story-e6frea6u-1226004056508|title=Jeff Kennett wants national anthem change|author1=Grant McArthur|date=11 February 2011|website=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while former [[Australian Labor Party]] leader [[Kim Beazley]] defended it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alp.org.au/media/0601/kbmcact210601.html|title=Kim Beazley – Doorstop Interview (transcript)|date=21 June 2001|publisher=[[Australian Labor Party]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010718044509/http://www.alp.org.au/media/0601/kbmcact210601.html|archivedate=18 July 2001|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former prime minister Bob Hawke endorsed Peter Vickery's alternative lyrics in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rap.org.au/milestones|title=Milestones|website=Recognition in Anthem|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the federal government under then prime minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] granted permission for Vickery's lyrics to be sung at certain occasions as a &quot;patriotic song&quot;, but said that before making any official change to the anthem, &quot;The Government would need to be convinced of a sufficient groundswell of support in the wider community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/indigenous-australians/alternative-version-of-advance-australia-fair-recognises-aboriginal-culture-ng-b88484280z|title=New version of national anthem cuts ‘offensive’ lyrics|date=2017-05-22|website=The West Australian|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth line of the anthem, &quot;our home is girt by sea&quot;, has been criticised for using the so-called [[Archaism|archaic]] word &quot;[[wikt:girt|girt]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/time-girt-went-down-the-gurgler/story-e6frfifo-1111116123498|title=Time girt went down the gurgler|last=Campbell|first=David|date=22 April 2008|newspaper=Herald Sun|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the lyrics and melody of the Australian national anthem have been criticised in some quarters as being dull and unendearing to the Australian people. [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] senator [[Sandy Macdonald]] said in 2001 that &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot; is so boring that the nation risks singing itself to sleep, with boring music and words impossible to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/06/22/waust22.xml|title=Call to scrap Australia's 'dull' anthem|author=Barbie Dutter|date=27 June 2001|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;Australians let us stand as one, upon this sacred land
A new day dawns, we’re moving on to trust and understand.
Combine our ancient history and cultures everywhere,
To bond together for all time, advance Australia fair.
With joyful hearts then let us sing, advance Australia fair.

Australians let us all be one, with peace and harmony.
Our precious water, soil and sun, grant life for you and me.
Our land abounds in nature’s gifts to love, respect and share,
And honouring the Dreaming, advance Australia fair.
With joyful hearts then let us sing, advance Australia fair.

Australians let us strive as one, to work with willing hands.
Our Southern Cross will guide us on, as friends with other lands.
While we embrace tomorrow’s world with courage, truth and care,
And all our actions prove the words, advance Australia fair,
With joyful hearts then let us sing, advance Australia fair.

And when this special land of ours is in our children’s care,
From shore to shore forever more, advance Australia fair.
With joyful hearts then let us sing, advance Australia fair.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Australians all let us rejoice
For we are one, and free
We've golden soil and wealth for toil
Our home is girt by sea
Our land abounds in nature's gifts
Of beauty rich and rare
In history's page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair.

For sixty thousand years and more
First peoples of this land
Sustained by Country, Dreamtime told
By word and artist’s hand.
Unite our cultures from afar
In peace with those first here
To walk together on this soil
Respect for all grows there.
From everywhere on Earth we sing
Advance Australia Fair.

In times of drought and flood and fire
When all but hope is gone
Australians join with helping hands 
And wattles bloom again.
Tomorrow may this timeless land 
Live for our young to share
From red-rock heart to sun-filled shore
Our country free and fair.
Beneath the Southern Cross we sing,
Advance Australia Fair.

&lt;poem&gt;With Christ our head and cornerstone,
We'll build our nation's might;
Whose way and truth and light alone,
Can guide our path aright;
Our lives a sacrifice of love,
Reflect our master's care;
With faces turned to heav'n above,
Advance Australia Fair;
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair.&lt;/poem&gt;
