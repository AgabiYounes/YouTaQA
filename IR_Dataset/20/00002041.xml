'''Ares''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|…õ…ôr|iÀê|z}}; {{lang-grc|·ºåœÅŒ∑œÇ}}, ''√Åres'' {{IPA-el|√°r…õÀês|}}) is the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek god]] [[war god|of war]]. He is one of the [[Twelve Olympians]], the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Theogony'' 921 ([[Loeb Classical Library]] [https://archive.org/details/hesiod00hesi &lt;!-- quote=&quot;she, mingling in love&quot; Ares. --&gt; numbering]); ''[[Iliad]]'', 5.890‚Äì896. By contrast, Ares's Roman counterpart [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] was born from [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] alone, according to [[Ovid]] (''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' 5.229‚Äì260).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]], he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification of sheer brutality, in contrast to his sister, the armored [[Athena]], whose functions as a [[knowledge deity|goddess of intelligence]] include [[military strategy]] and [[general officer|generalship]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (Blackwell, 1985, 2004 reprint, originally published 1977 in German), pp. 141; William Hansen, ''Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greeks were [[Wiktionary:ambivalent#English|ambivalent]] toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, &quot;overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert, p. 169&quot;&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; His sons  [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]] (Fear) and [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]] (Terror) and his lover, or sister, [[Enyo]] (Discord) accompanied him on his war [[chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p.169.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iliad]],'' his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful to him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 5.890‚Äì891.&lt;/ref&gt; An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 114‚Äì115.&lt;/ref&gt; His value as a war god is placed in doubt: during the [[Trojan War]], Ares was on the losing side, while Athena, often depicted in [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]] as holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike (Victory)]] in her hand, favoured the triumphant Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert, p. 169&quot;/&gt;

Ares plays a relatively limited role in [[Greek mythology]] as represented in literary narratives, though his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often [[allusion|alluded]] to.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 113‚Äì114; Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; When Ares does appear in myths, he typically faces humiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 113‚Äì114. See for instance [[Ares#Ares and the giants|Ares and the giants]] below.&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known as the lover of [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, who was married to [[Hephaestus]], god of craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Iliad'', however, the wife of Hephaestus is Charis, &quot;Grace,&quot; as noted by Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous story related to Ares and Aphrodite shows them exposed to ridicule through the wronged husband's device.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.266‚Äì366; Hansen, ''Classical Mythology'', pp. 113‚Äì114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The counterpart of Ares among the [[List of Roman deities|Roman gods]] is [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]],&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; who as a father of the Roman people was given a more important and dignified place in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] as a [[tutelary deity|guardian deity]]. During the [[Hellenization]] of [[Latin literature]], the myths of Ares were [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] by Roman writers under the name of Mars. Greek writers under [[Roman Empire|Roman rule]] also recorded [[cult (religious practice)|cult practices]] and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares. Thus in the [[classical mythology|classical tradition]] of later [[Western culture|Western art and literature]], the mythology of the two figures later became virtually indistinguishable.

==Names==
The etymology of the name ''Ares'' is traditionally connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|·ºÄœÅŒÆ}} (''arƒì''), the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] form of the [[Doric Greek|Doric]] {{lang|grc|·ºÄœÅŒ¨}} (''ara''), &quot;bane, ruin, curse, imprecation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Ares}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3Da%29rh%2F ·ºÄœÅŒÆ], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary''. {{LSJ|a)ra/|·ºÄœÅŒÆ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be a connection with the Roman god of war, [[Mars (god)|Mars]], via hypothetical [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''MÃ•rƒìs'';{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} compare Ancient Greek ŒºŒ¨œÅŒΩŒ±ŒºŒ±Œπ (''marnamai''), &quot;I fight, I battle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|ma/rnamai|ŒºŒ¨œÅŒΩŒ±ŒºŒ±Œπ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Burkert]] notes that &quot;Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle, war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Greek Religion'' (Harvard) 1985:pt III.2.12 p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin of the name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, pp. 129‚Äì130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|êÄÄêÄ©}}, ''a-re'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A-re in the Linear B Tablets and the Continuity of the Cult of Ares in the Historical Period| url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/pasp/publications/pdf/are.pdf|first=Joannn|last=Gulizio|journal=Journal of Prehistoric Religion|volume=15|pages=32‚Äì38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Raymoure| first=K.A.| url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/a/a-re/|title=a-re| work=Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B| publisher=Deaditerranean| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=346723|title=The Linear B word a-re|website= Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[adjective|adjectival]] [[epithet]], ''Areios,'' was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they took on a warrior aspect or became involved in warfare: ''Zeus Areios'', ''Athena Areia'', even ''Aphrodite Areia''. In the ''Iliad'', the word ''ares'' is used as a [[common noun]] synonymous with &quot;battle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert, p. 169&quot;/&gt;

Inscriptions as early as [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] times, and continuing into the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], attest to [[Enyalios]] as another name for the god of war.{{refn|group=n|''Enyalios'' is thought to be attested on the [[Knossos|KN]] V 52 tablet as {{lang|gmy|êÄÅêÄùêÄ∑êÄ™êÄç}}, ''e-nu-wa-ri-jo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|authorlink=John Chadwick|title=The Mycenaean World|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1976|isbn=0-521-29037-6|url=https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/mycenaeanworld00chad/page/88 88]}} At [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/resources/linear-b-sign-groups/e/e-nu-wa-ri-jo/ |title=e-nu-wa-ri-jo |work=Minoan Linear A &amp; Mycenaean Linear B |last=Raymoure |first=K.A. |publisher=Deaditerranean }} {{cite web|title=KN 52 V + 52 bis + 8285 (unknown) |website=DƒÄMOS: Database of Mycenaean at Oslo |url=https://www2.hf.uio.no/damos/Index/item/chosen_item_id/49 |publisher=[[University of Oslo]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319204420/https://www2.hf.uio.no/damos/Index/item/chosen_item_id/49 |archivedate=2014-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Character, origins, and worship==

[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2561.jpg|thumbnail|left|Vatican, Rome, Italy. Statue of Ares, [[Scopas]]'s influence. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
Ares was one of the Twelve Olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]].'' Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the [[Trojan War|battlefield at Troy]]:

{{quote|Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced liar.&lt;br /&gt;To me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold Olympus.&lt;br /&gt;Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, since&lt;br /&gt;you are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.&lt;br /&gt;But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinous&lt;br /&gt;long since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', Book 5, lines 798‚Äì891, 895‚Äì898 in the translation of [[Richmond Lattimore]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This ambivalence is expressed also in the Greeks' association of Ares with the [[Thracians]], whom they regarded as a barbarous and warlike people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 13.301; [[Ovid]], ''Ars Amatoria'', II.10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thrace]] was Ares's birthplace, his true home, and his refuge after the affair with Aphrodite was exposed to the general mockery of the other gods.{{refn|group=n|Homer ''Odyssey'' viii. 361; for Ares/Mars and Thrace, see [[Ovid]], ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', book ii.part xi.585, which tells the same tale: &quot;Their captive bodies are, with difficulty, freed, at your plea, Neptune: Venus runs to Paphos: Mars heads for Thrace.&quot;; for Ares/Mars and Thrace, see also [[Statius]], ''Thebaid'' vii. 42; [[Herodotus]], iv. 59, 62.}}

A late-6th-century BC funerary inscription from [[Attica]] emphasizes the consequences of coming under Ares's sway:{{quote|Stay and mourn at the tomb of dead Kroisos&lt;br /&gt;Whom raging Ares destroyed one day, fighting in the foremost ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Athens, NM 3851 quoted in Andrew Stewart, ''One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works'', Introduction: I. &quot;The Sources&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ares in Sparta===
In [[Sparta]], Ares was viewed as a model soldier: his resilience, physical strength, and military intelligence were unrivaled.  An ancient statue, representing the god in chains, suggests that the martial spirit and victory were to be kept in the city of Sparta. That the Spartans admired him is indicative of the cultural divisions that existed between themselves and other Greeks, especially the Athenians (see [[Pelopponesian War]]).

===Ares in the Arabian Peninsula===
Ares was also worshipped by the inhabitants of [[Tylos]]. It is not known if he was worshipped in the form of an Arabian god (or which one) or if he was worshipped in his Greek form.&lt;ref&gt;ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≠ÿ™ŸÑÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿØŸàŸÜŸä ŸÑŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±ŸäŸÜ ÿµ Ÿ°Ÿ¢Ÿ®&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ares in the Scythians===
According to [[Herodotus]]' ''Histories'', the [[Scythians]] worshipped a god he equated with the Greek Ares; unlike most [[Scythian religion|other Scythian gods]], he does not offer the indigenous name for this deity. While ranking beneath [[Tabiti]], [[Api]] and [[Papaios]] in the divine hierarchy, this god was apparently worshipped differently from other Scythian gods, with statues and complex altars devoted to him. This type of worship is noted to be present among the [[Alans]].&lt;ref&gt;Sulimirski, T. (1985). &quot;The Scyths&quot; in: Fisher, W. B. (Ed.) The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 2: The Median and Achaemenian Periods. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-20091-1}}. pp. 158‚Äì159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting how Greek mythological [[Amazons]] are devotees of Ares and most likely based on Scythian warriors, some researchers have considered the possibility that a Scythian warrior women cult of this deity existed.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). &quot;Amazons&quot;. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 1 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have also posited that the &quot;[[Sword of Mars]]&quot; alludes to the [[Huns]] having adopted this deity.&lt;ref&gt;Geary, Patrick J. (1994). &quot;Chapter 3. Germanic Tradition and Royal Ideology in the Ninth Century: The Visio Karoli Magni&quot;. Living with the Dead in the Middle Ages. Cornell University Press. p. 63. {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8098-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attributes==
[[Image:Ares Borghese2.gif|thumb|250px|The ''[[Ares Borghese]]''.]]
Ares‚Äô attributes were a helmet, shield, and sword or spear.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The birds of Ares (''Ornithes Areioi'') were a flock of feather-dart-dropping birds that guarded the [[Amazons]]' shrine of the god on a [[coast]]al [[island]] in the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Argonautica]]'' (ii.382ff and 1031ff; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and ritual==
Although Ares received occasional sacrifice from armies going to war, the god had a formal temple and cult at only a few sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert, p. 170&quot;&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Sparta]], however, each company of youths sacrificed a puppy to [[Enyalios]] before engaging in ritual fighting at the Phoebaeum.{{refn|group=n|&quot;Here each company of youths sacrifices a puppy to Enyalius, holding that the most valiant of tame animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppies except the people of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]; these too sacrifice a puppy, a black bitch, to the Wayside Goddess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], 3.14.9.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[chthonic]] night-time sacrifice of a dog to Enyalios became assimilated to the cult of Ares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/9344|title=Ares|last=|first=|date=2007-10-10|website=academic.eb.com/levels/collegiate/article/9344|publisher=Britannica Academic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just east of Sparta stood an archaic statue of Ares in chains, to show that the spirit of war and victory was to be kept in the city.{{refn|group=n|&quot;Opposite this temple [the temple of Hipposthenes] is an old image of Enyalius in fetters. The idea the Lacedaemonians express by this image is the same as the Athenians express by their Wingless Victory; the former think that Enyalius will never run away from them, being bound in the fetters, while the Athenians think that Victory, having no wings, will always remain where she is&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 3.15.7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Temple of Ares]] in the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|agora]] of [[Athens]], which [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] saw in the second century AD, had been moved and rededicated there during the time of [[Augustus]]. Essentially, it was a [[Roman temple]] to the Augustan [[Mars Ultor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burkert, p. 170&quot;/&gt; From archaic times, the [[Areopagus]], the &quot;mount of Ares&quot; at some distance from the Acropolis, was a site of trials. [[Paul the Apostle]] later preached about Christianity there. Its connection with Ares, perhaps based on a false etymology, is [[Etiology|etiological myth]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} A second temple to Ares has been located at the archaeological site of [[Metropolis (Anatolia)|Metropolis]] in what is now Western [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/city-of-mother-goddess-opens-to-tourism--70668|title=City of mother goddess opens to tourism|date=August 21, 2014|work=Hurriyet Daily News|accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attendants==
[[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]] (&quot;Terror&quot; or &quot;Dread&quot;), [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]] (&quot;Fear&quot;), and [[Adrestia]] are his companions in war.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 4.436f, and 13.299f' [[Hesiod|Hesiod's]] ''[[Shield of Heracles]] 191, 460; [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], 10.51, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hesiod]], they were also his children, born to him by [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' 934f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], the goddess of discord, or [[Enyo]], the goddess of war, bloodshed, and violence, was considered the sister&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Jessica|date=2005|title=Spenser, Homer, and the mythography of strife|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A141260392/GPS?u=nm_p_losalamos&amp;xid=ab4996a1|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|volume=58|pages=1220+|via=Gale General Reference Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and companion of the violent Ares. In at least one tradition, Enyalius, rather than another name for Ares, was his son by Enyo.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on Homer, 944&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares may also be accompanied by [[Kydoimos]], the daemon of the din of battle; the [[Makhai]] (&quot;Battles&quot;); the &quot;Hysminai&quot; (&quot;Acts of manslaughter&quot;); [[Polemos]], a minor spirit of war, or only an epithet of Ares, since it has no specific dominion; and Polemos's daughter, [[Alala]], the [[goddess]] or [[personification]] of the Greek war-cry, whose name Ares uses as his own war-cry. Ares's sister [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] (&quot;Youth&quot;) also draws baths for him.

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], local inhabitants of [[Therapne]], [[Sparta]], recognized [[Thero (Greek mythology)|Thero]], &quot;feral, savage,&quot; as a nurse of Ares.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 3. 19. 7&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consorts and children==
[[Image:Areopagus from the Acropolis.jpg|thumb|185.99x185.99px|The [[Areopagus]] as viewed from the [[Acropolis]].]]

The union of Ares and Aphrodite created the gods [[Eros]], [[Anteros]], [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]], [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]], [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], and [[Adrestia]]. While Eros's and Anteros's godly stations favored their mother, Adrestia preferred to emulate her father, often accompanying him to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.sabatmagazine.com/she-walks-at-night-6784a0b13be8|title=She Walks At Night|last=Magazine|first=Sabat|date=2018-10-15|website=SABAT Magazine|access-date=2019-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions include Alcippe as one of his daughters.

Upon one occasion, Ares incurred the anger of [[Poseidon]] by slaying his son, [[Halirrhothius]], because he had raped Alcippe, a daughter of the war-god. For this deed, Poseidon summoned Ares to appear before the tribunal of the Olympic gods, which was held upon a hill in Athens. Ares was acquitted. This event is supposed to have given rise to the name [[Areopagus]] (or Hill of Ares), which afterward became famous as the site of a court of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Berens, E.M.: ''Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece and Rome'', page 113. Project Gutenberg, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts tell of [[Cycnus]] (ŒöœçŒ∫ŒΩŒøœÇ) of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], a son of Ares who was so murderous that he tried to build a temple with the skulls and the bones of travellers. [[Heracles]] slaughtered this abominable monstrosity, engendering the wrath of Ares, whom the hero wounded in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 2. 5. 11 &amp; 2. 7. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hymns to Ares==

;Homeric Hymn 8 to Ares (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic 7th to 4th centuries BC)

:&quot;Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities, harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the spear, O defence of Olympus, father of warlike Victory, ally of Themis, stern governor of the rebellious, leader of righteous men, sceptred King of manliness, who whirl your fiery sphere among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of men, giver of dauntless youth! Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life, and strength of war, that I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul. Restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes me to tread the ways of blood-curdling strife. Rather, O blessed one, give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of peace, avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D8 ''Homeric Hymn to Ares''].&lt;/ref&gt;

;Orphic Hymn 65 to Ares (trans. Taylor) (Greek hymns 3rd century BC to 2nd century AD)

:&quot;To Ares, Fumigation from [[Frankincense]]. Magnanimous, unconquered, boisterous Ares, in darts rejoicing, and in bloody wars; fierce and untamed, whose mighty power can make the strongest walls from their foundations shake: mortal-destroying king, defiled with gore, pleased with war's dreadful and tumultuous roar. Thee human blood, and swords, and spears delight, and the dire ruin of mad savage fight. Stay furious contests, and avenging strife, whose works with woe embitter human life; to lovely Kyrpis [Aphrodite] and to Lyaios [Dionysos] yield, for arms exchange the labours of the field; encourage peace, to gentle works inclined, and give abundance, with benignant mind.&quot;

==Mythology==

===Founding of Thebes===
One of the roles of Ares was expressed in mainland Greece as the [[founding myth]] of Thebes: Ares was the progenitor of the water-dragon slain by [[Cadmus]], for the dragon's teeth were sown into the ground as if a crop and sprang up as the fully armored [[indigenous peoples|autochthon]]ic [[Spartoi]]. Cadmus placed himself in the god's service for eight years atoning for the crime of killing Ares‚Äô dragon.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M. (2010). {{Google books|tOgWfjNIxoMC|Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology.|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; To propitiate Ares, Cadmus took as a bride [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], a daughter of Ares's union with Aphrodite. In this way, Cadmus harmonized all strife and founded the city of Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion,'' p.169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ares and Aphrodite===
[[File:Venus_and_Mars_(detail)_Surprised_by_Vulcan_-_Guillemot_Alexandre_Charles.jpg|thumb|''Mars and Venus Surprised by Vulcan'' (1827) by Alexandre Charles Guillemot (detail)]]
In the tale sung by the bard in the hall of [[Alcinous]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Odyssey]]'' 8.300&lt;/ref&gt; the Sun-god [[Helios]] once spied Ares and Aphrodite having sex secretly in the hall of [[Hephaestus]], her husband. He reported the incident to Hephaestus. Contriving to catch the illicit couple in the act, Hephaestus fashioned a finely-knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare them. At the appropriate time, this net was sprung, and trapped Ares and Aphrodite locked in very private embrace.{{refn|group=n|name=&quot;Odyssey, 8.295&quot;|{{cite web | title = Odyssey, 8.295 | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0218;query=card%3D%2371;layout=;loc=8.333 | quote = [In [[Robert Fagles]]'s translation]: ... and the two lovers, free of the bonds that overwhelmed them so, sprang up and away at once, and the Wargod sped Thrace, while Love with her telltale laughter sped to Paphos ...}}}}

But Hephaestus was not satisfied with his revenge, so he invited the Olympian gods and goddesses to view the unfortunate pair. For the sake of modesty, the goddesses demurred, but the male gods went to witness the sight. Some commented on the beauty of Aphrodite, others remarked that they would eagerly trade places with Ares, but all who were present mocked the two. Once the couple was released, the embarrassed Ares returned to his homeland, Thrace, and Aphrodite went to Paphos.{{refn|group=n|name=&quot;Odyssey, 8.295&quot;}}

In a much later interpolated detail, Ares put the young soldier [[Alectryon (mythology)|Alectryon]] by his door to warn them of Helios's arrival as Helios would tell Hephaestus of Aphrodite's infidelity if the two were discovered, but Alectryon fell asleep on guard duty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Helios discovered the two and alerted Hephaestus. The furious Ares turned the sleepy Alectryon into a [[rooster]] which now always announces the arrival of the sun in the morning.

===Ares and the giants===
In one archaic myth, related only in the ''Iliad'' by the goddess [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] to her daughter Aphrodite, two chthonic giants, the [[Aloadae]], named Otus and Ephialtes, threw Ares into chains and put him in a bronze urn, where he remained for thirteen months, a [[lunar year]]. &quot;And that would have been the end of Ares and his appetite for war, if the beautiful Eriboea, the young giants' stepmother, had not told [[Hermes]] what they had done,&quot; she related.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 5.385‚Äì391.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In this one suspects a festival of licence which is unleashed in the thirteenth month.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;rjblqd&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|title=Greek Religion| year=1985| page= 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him, and [[Artemis]] tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other. In [[Nonnus]]'s ''[[Dionysiaca]]''&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'' 18. 274 ff; [http://www.theoi.com/Gigante/GiganteEkhidnades.html Theoi.com, &quot;Ekhidnades&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Ares also killed Ekhidnades, the giant son of [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], and a great enemy of the gods. Scholars have not concluded whether the nameless Ekhidnades (&quot;of Echidna's lineage&quot;) was entirely Nonnus's invention or not. &lt;!--is this in Dionysiaca?:Zeus helped him heal afterwards.--&gt;

===''Iliad''===
In the ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;References to Ares's appearance in the ''Iliad'' are collected and quoted at [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresMyths2.html#Troy www.theoi.com: Ares Myths 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] represented Ares as having no fixed allegiances, rewarding courage on both sides: he promised Athena and Hera that he would fight on the side of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] (''Iliad'' V.830‚Äì834, XXI.410‚Äì414), but [[Aphrodite]] persuaded Ares to side with the [[Troy|Trojans]]. During the war, [[Diomedes]] fought with [[Hector]] and saw Ares fighting on the Trojans' side. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly (V.590‚Äì605).

Athene or Athena, Ares's sister, saw his interference and asked Zeus, his father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield, which Zeus granted (V.711‚Äì769). Hera and Athena encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares (V.780‚Äì834). Diomedes thrust with his spear at Ares, with Athena driving it home, and Ares's cries made Achaeans and Trojans alike tremble (V.855‚Äì864). Ares fled to [[Mt. Olympus]], forcing the Trojans to fall back.

When Hera mentioned to [[Zeus]] that Ares's son, Ascalaphus, was killed, Ares overheard and wanted to join the fight on the side of the Achaeans, disregarding Zeus's order that no Olympic god should enter the battle, but Athena stopped him (XV.110‚Äì128). Later, when Zeus allowed the gods to fight in the war again (XX.20‚Äì29), Ares was the first to act, attacking Athena to avenge himself for his previous injury. Athena overpowered him by striking Ares with a boulder (XXI.391‚Äì408).

==Renaissance==
In [[Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] works of art, Ares's symbols are a spear and helmet, his animal is a dog, and his bird is the [[vulture]]. In literary works&lt;!--examples would be more enlightening than this generality--&gt; of these eras, Ares is replaced by the Roman [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], a romantic emblem of manly valor rather than the cruel and blood-thirsty god of Greek mythology.
