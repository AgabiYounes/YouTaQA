The '''Act of Settlement''' is an [[Acts of the Parliament of England|Act of the Parliament of England]] that was passed in 1701&lt;ref&gt;The act received Royal Assent in 1701. However, it is formally dated as 1700 in official use, such as the listing for the act in the ''[[Chronological Table of the Statutes]]'', because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force are dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 1700 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]).&lt;/ref&gt; to settle the [[order of succession|succession]] to the [[List of English monarchs|English]] and [[List of Irish monarchs|Irish]] crowns on [[Protestant]]s only. The next Protestant in line to the throne was the [[Electress]] [[Sophia of Hanover]], a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland, I of England and Ireland]]. After her the crowns would descend only to her non-[[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] heirs.

The act was prompted by the failure of [[William III of England|King William III &amp; II]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], as well as of Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], to produce any surviving children, and the [[Roman Catholic]] religion of all other members of the [[House of Stuart]]. The line of [[Sophia of Hanover]] was the most junior among the Stuarts, but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714, before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714. On Queen Anne's death, Sophia's son duly became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] and started the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] in Britain.

The act played a key role in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. England and Scotland had [[Union of the Crowns|shared a monarch]] since 1603, but had remained separately governed countries. The [[Scottish Parliament (pre-1707)|Scottish parliament]] was more reluctant than the [[English Parliament|English]] to abandon the House of Stuart, members of which had been [[Scottish monarchs]] long before they became [[English monarchs|English ones]]. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the [[Acts of Union 1707|parliamentary union of the two countries]] in 1707.

Under the Act of Settlement anyone who became a Roman Catholic, or who married one, became disqualified to inherit the throne. The act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England. Some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.

Along with the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] not only to the [[throne of the United Kingdom]], but to those of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, whether by assumption or by [[patriation]].&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite journal| last=Toporoski| first=Richard| title=The Invisible Crown| journal=Monarchy Canada| issue=Summer 1998| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1998| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| accessdate=16 May 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archivedate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|shared crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1931 |chapter=4 |act=The Statute of Westminster 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending the act came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, and removed the disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic.

==Original context==
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]], the line of succession to the English throne was governed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which declared that the flight of [[James II]] from England to France during the revolution amounted to an [[abdication]] of the throne and that James' daughter [[Mary II]] and her husband, [[William III of England|William III]] (who was also James' nephew),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siena.edu/uploadedfiles/home/parents_and_community/community_page/sri/independent_research/Presidents%20Release_2010_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707011431/http://www2.siena.edu/uploadedfiles/home/parents_and_community/community_page/sri/independent_research/Presidents%20Release_2010_final.pdf |archivedate= 7 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were James' successors. The Bill of Rights also provided that the line of succession would go through their descendants, then through Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] and her descendants, and then to the issue of William III by a possible later marriage. During the debate, the House of Lords had attempted to append Sophia and her descendants to the line of succession, but the amendment failed in the Commons.&lt;ref name=melville&gt;{{cite book|last=Melville|first=Lewis|title=The First George in Hanover and England|url=https://archive.org/details/firstgeorgeinhan00melvuoft|year=1908|publisher=Isaac Pitman and Sons|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstgeorgeinhan00melvuoft/page/130 130]–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry. In 1700, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], who was Anne's only child to survive infancy, died of a fever at the age of 11. Thus, Anne was left as the only person in line to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his descendants. However, it did not provide for the further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.

With religion and lineage initially decided, the ascendancy of William of Orange in 1689 would also bring his partiality to his foreign favourites that followed. By 1701 English jealousy of foreigners was rampant, and action was considered necessary for correction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henriq&quot;/&gt;

==Provisions==
The Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]]&amp;nbsp;– a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI and I]] and a niece of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]&amp;nbsp;– and her descendants, but it excluded &quot;for ever&quot; &quot;all and every Person and Persons who ... is are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the [[Holy See|See]] or [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] or shall profess the Popish Religion or shall marry a Papist&quot;. Thus, those who were Roman Catholics, and those who married Roman Catholics, were barred from ascending the throne. Notably, the Act did not even mention the concept of marriages involving heirs to the throne and members of non-Christian faiths because that would have been unthinkable in eighteenth century Great Britain.

The Act contained eight additional provisions that were to only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1700/1565208.html |title=Act of Settlement 1700 |publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|BAILII]] |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The monarch &quot;shall join in communion with the [[Church of England]]&quot;. This was intended to ensure the exclusion of a Roman Catholic monarch. Along with James II's perceived despotism, his religion was the main cause of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and of the previous linked religious and succession problems which had been resolved by the joint monarchy of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].
* If a person not native to England comes to the throne, England will not wage war for &quot;any dominions or territories which do not belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament&quot;. This was far-sighted, because when a member of the [[House of Hanover]] ascended the British throne, he would retain the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Electorate of Hanover]] in what is now [[Lower Saxony]], then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This provision has been dormant since [[Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the [[Salic Law]]s of the German-speaking states.
* No monarch may leave &quot;the dominions of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], or [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]&quot;, without the consent of Parliament. This provision was repealed in 1716, at the request of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] who was also the [[prince-elector|Elector of Hanover]] and Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; because of this, and also for personal reasons, he wished to visit Hanover from time to time.&lt;ref name=tarkowp547&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naamani Tarkow |first=I. |year=1943 |title= The Significance of the Act of Settlement in the Evolution of English Democracy |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=537–561 at p. 547 |doi=10.2307/2144947}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All government matters within the jurisdiction of the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] were to be transacted there, and all council resolutions were to be signed by those who advised and consented to them. This was because Parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent. This provision was repealed early in Queen Anne's reign, as many councillors ceased to offer advice and some stopped attending meetings altogether.&lt;ref name=tarkowp547 /&gt;
* No foreigner (&quot;no Person born out of the Kingdoms of England Scotland or Ireland or the Dominions thereunto belonging&quot;), even if naturalised or made a [[Denization|denizen]] (unless born of English parents), can be a Privy Councillor or a member of either House of Parliament, or hold &quot;any Office or Place of Trust, either Civill {{sic}} or Military, or to [''sic''] have any Grant of Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments from the Crown, to himself or to any other or others in Trust for him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henriq&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. S. |last=Henriques |jstor=1451130 |title=The Political Rights of English Jews |journal=[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |date=January 1907 |pages=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent nationality laws (today primarily the [[British Nationality Act 1981]]) made naturalised citizens the equal of those native born, and excluded Commonwealth and Irish citizens from the definition of foreigners, but otherwise this provision still applies. It has however been disapplied in particular cases by a number of other statutes.
* No person who has an office under the monarch, or receives a pension from the Crown, was to be a Member of Parliament. This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the House of Commons. It remains in force, but with several exceptions. (As a side effect, this provision means that members of the Commons seeking to resign from parliament can get round the age-old prohibition on [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]] by obtaining a [[sinecure]] in the control of the Crown; while several offices have historically been used for this purpose, two are currently in use: appointments generally alternate between the stewardships of the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] and of the [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead|Manor of Northstead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |work=House of Commons Information Office |title=The Chiltern Hundreds |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003101512/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Judges' commissions are valid ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed only by both Houses of Parliament (or in other Commonwealth realms the one House of Parliament, depending on the legislature's structure.) This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' decisions, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]]. This [[letters patent|patent]] was used prior to 1701 but did not prevent [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] from removing [[John Walter (judge)|Sir John Walter]] as [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].
* That &quot;no Pardon under the [[Great Seal of England]] be pleadable to an Impeachment by the Commons in Parliament&quot;. This meant in effect that no pardon by the monarch was to save someone from being [[Impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Commons.

==Opposition==
The [[Tories_(British_political_party)|Tory]] administration that replaced the [[Whig Junto]] in 1699 took responsibility for steering the Act through Parliament. As a result, it passed with little opposition, although five peers voted against it in the House of Lords, including the [[Theophilus_Hastings,_7th_Earl_of_Huntingdon|Earl of Huntingdon]], his brother-in-law the [[Robert_Leke,_3rd_Earl_of_Scarsdale|Earl of Scarsdale]] and three others.&lt;ref&gt;House of Lords Journal Volume 16: 22 May 1701, in https://www.british-history.ac.uk/lords-jrnl/vol16/pp698-699#h3-0009. Retrieved 1 October 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; While many shared their opposition to a 'foreign' king, the general feeling was summed up as 'better a German prince than a French one.'{{sfn|Somerset|2012|p=165}}

==Effects==
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2011}}
For different reasons, various [[constitutionalist]]s have praised the Act of Settlement: [[Henry Hallam]] called the Act &quot;the seal of our constitutional laws&quot; and [[David Lindsay Keir]] placed its importance above the Bill of Rights of 1689.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tarkow, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Naamani Tarkow has written: &quot;If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save [[Magna Carta]] (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tarkow, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=October 2015}}

===Kingdom of Great Britain===
[[Image:Act of Settlement 3323.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of the Act of Settlement sent to Electress Sophia of Hanover]]
[[Image:Kurfuerstin Sophie.JPG|thumb|right|''Sophia, Electress of Hanover'']]

The Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of [[Scotland]] with [[England and Wales]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Stemming from this, the Parliament of England decided that, to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death.

It used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve this within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]]. This success was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the throne of Great Britain, the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots Law]] as well.

===Succession to the Crown===
In addition to [[James II of England|James II]] (who died a few months after the act received royal assent) and his Roman Catholic children, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince James]] and the [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Princess Royal]], the act also excluded the descendants of King James's sister, [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], the youngest daughter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Henrietta's daughter, [[Anne Marie d'Orléans|Anne]], was then the Queen of Sardinia and a Roman Catholic; [[Jacobite succession|Jacobite pretenders]] after 1807 are descended from her.

With the legitimate descendants of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] either childless (in the case of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]) or Roman Catholic, Parliament's choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, the daughter of the late [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]]. Elizabeth was the only other child of [[James I of England|King James I]] not to have died in childhood. Elizabeth had borne nine children who reached adulthood, of whom [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] was the youngest daughter. However, in 1701, Sophia was the senior Protestant with a legitimate claim to the English throne; Parliament passed over senior living representatives of lines which included [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans]]; [[Louis Otto, Prince of Salm]], and his sisters; [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Anne Henriette, Princess of Condé]]; [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate|Benedicta Henrietta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]; and Sophia's sister, [[Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate]] because they were all Roman Catholic.

===Removal from the succession due to Catholicism===
Since the Act's passing the most senior living member of the royal family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby to have been removed from the line of succession, is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who married [[Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time. He was restored to the line of succession in 2015 when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] came into force, and became 34th in line.&lt;ref name=royalcentral&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalcentral.co.uk/state/what-do-the-new-royal-succession-changes-mean-46610 |title=What do the new royal succession changes mean? |publisher=Royal Central |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next most senior living descendant of the Electress Sophia who had been ineligible to succeed on this ground is [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], the elder son of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who married the Roman Catholic [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. His son, [[Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick|Lord Downpatrick]], converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003 and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his religion. In 2008 his daughter, [[Lady Marina Windsor]], also converted to Catholicism and was removed from the line of succession. More recently, [[Peter Phillips]], the son of [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and eleventh in line to the throne, married [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]]; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to [[Anglicanism]] prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage, only to have it restored in 2015.

Excluding those princesses who have married into Roman Catholic royal families, such as [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh]], one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'') has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the Act: the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], wife of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who converted on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession because she was an Anglican at the time of their marriage.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Present status==
As well as being part of the law of the United Kingdom, the Act of Settlement was received into the laws of all the countries and territories over which the British monarch reigned. It remains part of the laws of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s and the relevant jurisdictions within those realms. In accordance with established convention, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and later laws, the Act of Settlement (along with the other laws governing the succession of the Commonwealth realms) may only be changed with the agreement of all the realms (and, in some federal realms, the constituent members of those federations).

==Amendment proposals==
{{Succession to the British throne vertical}}
Challenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and [[Primogeniture|preference for males]]. However, changing the Act is a complex process, since the Act governs the shared succession of all the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] acknowledges by established convention that any changes to the rules of succession may be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments to be made by each state's parliament or parliaments. Further, as the current monarch's eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any change to the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there was little public concern with the issues and debate had been confined largely to academic circles until the November 2010 announcement that [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|Prince William was to marry]]. This raised the question of what would happen if he were to produce first a daughter and then a son.

''[[The Times]]'' reported on 6 November 1995 that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] had said on that day to [[Tony Blair]] and [[Paddy Ashdown]] that &quot;Catholics should be able to ascend to the British throne&quot;.

In October 2011 the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] was reported to have reached an agreement with all of [[States and territories of Australia|the states]] on potential changes to their laws in the wake of amendments to the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref name=Coorey2011-10-29&gt;{{cite news| last=Coorey| first=Phillip| title=Leaders abandon rule on male heir succession| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/leaders-abandon-rule-on-male-heir-succession-20111028-1mo9q.html| date=29 October 2011| newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of the Australian states—for example, New South Wales and Victoria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1969| title=Imperial Acts Application Act 1969| series=6| publication-place=Sydney| publisher=New South Wales Government Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/iaaa1969240/| accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1980| title=Imperial Acts Act 1980| series=6| publication-place=Melbourne| publisher=Government Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/iaaa1980240/| accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—has been, when legislating to repeal some imperial statutes so far as they still applied in Australia, to provide that imperial statutes concerning the royal succession remain in force.

The legal process required at the federal level remains, theoretically, unclear. The [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], as was noted during the crisis of 1936, contains no power for the federal parliament to legislate with respect to the monarchy.&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;[[#Twomey|Twomey]], pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Everything thus turns upon the status and meaning of clause 2 in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, which provides: &quot;The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Queen Victoria| publication-date=1901| title=Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900| series=2| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00469| accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Twomey reviews three possible interpretations of the clause.&lt;ref name=Twomey /&gt;
* First: it &quot;mandates that whoever is the sovereign of the United Kingdom is also, by virtue of this external fact, sovereign of Australia&quot;; accordingly, changes to British succession laws would have no effect on Australian law, but if the British amendment changed the sovereign, then the new sovereign of the United Kingdom would automatically become the new [[Monarchy of Australia|sovereign of Australia]].
* Second, it is &quot;merely an interpretative provision&quot;, operating to ensure that references to &quot;the Queen&quot; in the Constitution are references to whoever may at the time be the incumbent of the &quot;sovereignty of the United Kingdom&quot; as determined with regard to Australia, following the [[Australia Act 1986]], by Australian law.
* Or, third, it incorporates the United Kingdom rules of succession into the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, which itself can now be altered only by Australia, according to the [[Australia Act 1986]]; in that way, the British rules of succession have been patriated to Australia and, with regard to Australia, are subject to amendment or repeal solely by Australian law.
However, Twomey expresses confidence that, if the [[High Court of Australia]] were to be faced with the problems of covering clause 2, it would find some way to conclude that, with regard to Australia, the clause is subject solely to Australian law.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Twomey|Twomey]], pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian scholar Richard Toporoski theorised in 1998 that &quot;if, let us say, an alteration were to be made in the United Kingdom to the Act of Settlement 1701, providing for the succession of the Crown... [i]t is my opinion that the domestic constitutional law of Australia or Papua New Guinea, for example, would provide for the succession in those countries of the same person who became Sovereign of the United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref name=Topo /&gt;

In practice, when legislating for the Perth Agreement (see below), the Australian governments took the approach of the states requesting, and referring power to, the federal government to enact the legislation on behalf of the states (under paragraph 51(xxxviii) of the Australian Constitution) and the Commonwealth of Australia.

===Canada===
{{See also|Monarchy of Canada#Succession and regency}}

In [[Canada]], where the Act of Settlement ({{Lang-fr|Acte d'établissement}}) is now a part of [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitutional law]], [[Tony O'Donohue]], a Canadian civic politician, took issue with the provisions that exclude Roman Catholics from the throne, and which make the [[monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], requiring him or her to be an [[Church of England|Anglican]]. This, he claimed, discriminated against non-Anglicans, including Catholics, who are the largest faith group in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spector&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://members.shaw.ca/nspector3/globe302.htm |first=Norman |last=Spector |title=Why Canada must take on Britain over the 1701 Act of Settlement |date=30 August 2007 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, O'Donohue launched [[O'Donohue v.

Also, the court noted that, while Canada has the power to amend the line of succession to the Canadian throne, the Statute of Westminster stipulates that the agreement of the governments of the fifteen other Commonwealth realms that share the Crown would first have to be sought if Canada wished to continue its relationship with these countries. An appeal of the decision was dismissed on 16 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=O'Donohue v. Canada |link=O'Donohue v.

With the announcement in 2007 of the [[engagement]] of [[Peter Phillips]] to [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]], a Roman Catholic and a Canadian, discussion about the Act of Settlement was revived. [[Norman Spector]] called in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' for [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] to address the issue of the act's bar on Catholics, saying Phillips' marriage to Kelly would be the first time the provisions of the act would bear directly on Canada—Phillips would be barred from acceding to the Canadian throne because he married a Roman Catholic Canadian.&lt;ref name=Spector/&gt; (In fact, [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews|the Earl of St Andrews]] had already lost his place in the line of succession when he married the Roman Catholic Canadian [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. But St Andrews' place in the line of succession was significantly lower than Phillips'.) Criticism of the Act of Settlement due to the Phillips–Kelly marriage was muted when Autumn Kelly converted to Anglicanism shortly before her marriage, thus preserving her husband's place in the line of succession.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Succession to the British throne#Reform}}

From time to time there has been debate over repealing the clause that prevents Roman Catholics, or those who marry one, from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a bigoted anachronism; [[Thomas Winning|Cardinal Winning]], who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in [[Scotland]], called the act an &quot;insult&quot; to Catholics. [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) &quot;can marry by law a [[Hindu]], a [[Buddhist]], anyone, but not a Roman Catholic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Let monarchy marry Catholics |date=2 June 2002 |accessdate=30 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of repeal, such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]], but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of sovereignty for the Anglican Church.

When in December 1978 there was media speculation that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] might marry a Roman Catholic, Powell defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne, claiming his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He stated a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and &quot;in the literal sense, foreign to the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]] ... Between Roman Catholicism and [[royal supremacy]] there is, as Saint [[Thomas More]] concluded, no reconciliation.&quot; Powell concluded that a Roman Catholic crown would be the destruction of the Church of England because &quot;it would contradict the essential character of that church.&quot;

He continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote that &quot;the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased [[Roman Empire]] sitting crowned upon the grave thereof&quot;, he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that ''imperium'' from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the ''alter imperium'', the &quot;other empire&quot;, of which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] declared &quot;This realm of England is an empire&quot; ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell]] |last=Heffer |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Heffer |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |isbn=0-7538-0820-X |page= |pages=810–812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Scottish Parliament]] unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref name=Scotsman2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/catholics_still_barred_from_throne_despite_law_change_1_1937348 |title=Catholics still barred from throne despite law change |date=28 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' challenged the succession law in court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.claredyer |last=Dyer |first=Clare |title=A Challenge to the Crown: now is the time for change |date=6 December 2000 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that it violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which provides,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth, or other status.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Convention nowhere lists the right to succeed to the Crown as a human right, the challenge was rejected.

[[Adrian Hilton]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not &quot;irrational prejudice or blind bigotry&quot;, but claimed that it was passed because &quot;the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost.&quot; He points to the Pope's claiming universal jurisdiction, and Hilton argues that &quot;it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state&quot; and contends that, if such situation came about, &quot;we will have undone centuries of common law.&quot; He said that because the Roman Catholic Church [[apostolicae curae|does not recognise the Church of England as an apostolic church]], a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and [[Church of Scotland]] archbishops, bishops, and clergy as part of the laity and therefore &quot;lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments.&quot; (Hilton noted that the Church of Scotland's [[Presbyterian polity]] does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton said a Roman Catholic monarch would be unable to be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and notes that other European states have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]], whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]; the [[Netherlands]], which has a constitution requiring its monarchs be members of the Protestant [[House of Orange]]; and [[Belgium]], which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |last=Hilton |first=Adrian |title=The price of liberty |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |date=8 November 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604070506/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |archivedate= 4 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, a private member's bill—the [[Succession to the Crown Bill 2004|Succession to the Crown Bill]]—was introduced in the House of Lords. The government, headed by [[Tony Blair]], blocked all attempts to revise the succession laws, claiming it would raise too many constitutional issues and it was unnecessary at the time. In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|British general election the following year]], [[Michael Howard]] promised to work towards having the prohibition removed if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] gained a majority of seats in the House of Commons, but the election was won by Blair's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Four years later, plans drawn up by [[Chris Bryant]] were revealed that would end the exclusion of Catholics from the throne and end the doctrine of agnatic (male-preference) [[primogeniture]] in favour of absolute primogeniture, which governs succession solely on birth order and not on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1| last=Wintour| first=Patrick| title=End of the Anglican crown – 300 year bar to be lifted| date=25 September 2008| newspaper=The Guardian| accessdate=25 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080926085427/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1| archivedate= 26 September 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was raised again in January 2009, when a private member's bill to amend the Act of Succession was introduced in parliament.

{{main|Perth Agreement}}
In early 2011 [[Keith Vaz]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament, introduced to the House of Commons at Westminster a [[private member's bill]] which proposed that the Act of Settlement be amended to remove the provisions relating to Roman Catholicism and change the primogeniture governing the line of succession to the British throne from [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] to [[Absolute cognatic primogeniture|absolute cognatic]]. Vaz sought support for his project from the Canadian Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], but the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister of Canada]] responded that the issue was &quot;not a priority for the government or for Canadians without further elaboration on the merits or drawbacks of the proposed reforms&quot;. [[Stephenson King]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia|Prime Minister of Saint Lucia]], said he supported the idea and it was reported that the government of New Zealand did, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cecil |first=Nicholas |title=St Lucia backs change to laws of succession |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=8 March 2011 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23929938-st-lucia-backs-change-to-laws-of-succession.do |accessdate=14 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528094354/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23929938-st-lucia-backs-change-to-laws-of-succession.do |archivedate=28 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monarchist League of Canada]] said at the time to the media that it &quot;supports amending the Act of Settlement in order to modernize the succession rules.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Boswell| first=Randy| title=Brit asks Canada for help rewriting the rules of the Crown| newspaper=Vancouver Sun| date=21 January 2011| url=https://vancouversun.com/life/Brit+asks+Canada+help+rewriting+rules+Crown/4146719/story.html| accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
