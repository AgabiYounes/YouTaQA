'''André Weil''' ({{IPAc-en|v|eɪ}}; {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe vɛj|lang}}; 6 May 1906 – 6 August 1998) was a French [[mathematician]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horgan | first1 = J | authorlink=John Horgan (journalist) | year = 1994 | title = Profile: Andre Weil – The Last Universal Mathematician | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 270 | issue = 6| pages = 33–34 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0694-33| bibcode = 1994SciAm.270f..33H}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for his foundational work in [[number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. He was a founding member and the ''de facto'' early leader of the mathematical [[Bourbaki group]]. The [[philosopher]] [[Simone Weil]] was his sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil_family|class=HistTopics|title=Weil family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
André Weil was born in [[Paris]] to [[agnosticism|agnostic]] [[Alsatian Jew]]ish parents who fled the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] by the [[German Empire]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870–71. The famous philosopher [[Simone Weil]] was Weil's only sibling. He studied in Paris, [[Rome]] and [[Göttingen]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]]. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in [[Hinduism]] and [[Sanskrit literature]]: he taught himself Sanskrit in 1920.&lt;ref name =&quot;Aczel&quot;&gt;Amir D. Aczel,[https://books.google.com/books?id=fRCH-at7wgYC&amp;pg=PA25 ''The Artist and the Mathematician,''] Basic Books, 2009 pp.17ff.,p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~aknapp/BorelOnWeil.pdf Borel, Armand]&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching for one year in [[Aix-Marseille University]], he taught for six years in [[Strasbourg]]. He married Éveline in 1937.

Weil was in [[Finland]] when [[World War II]] broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife Éveline returned to France without him. Weil was mistakenly arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the [[Winter War]] on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;Osmo Pekonen: ''L'affaire Weil à Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des mathématiciens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13–20. With an afterword by André Weil.&lt;/ref&gt; Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at [[Le Havre]] in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then [[Rouen]]. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. After the [[fall of France]], he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where he managed to join his wife Éveline, who had been living in German-occupied France.

In January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from [[Marseille]] to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at [[Lehigh University]], where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would never talk about &quot;Lehigh&quot; any more.{{citation needed|date=May 2015|http://www.landsburg.com/weil.htm=}} He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the [[Universidade de São Paulo]] from 1945 to 1947, where he worked with [[Oscar Zariski]]. He then returned to the United States and taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;Weil, André.

Congres., Cambridge, Mass., vol. 2, pp. 90–100. 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954 in Amsterdam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weil, A.|chapter=Abstract versus classical algebraic geometry|title=''In:'' Proceedings of International Congress of Mathematicians, 1954, Amsterdam|volume=vol. 3|pages=550–558|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1954.3/Main/icm1954.3.0550.0558.ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1978 in Helsinki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weil, A.|chapter=History of mathematics: How and why|title=''In:'' Proceedings of International Congress of Mathematicians, (Helsinki, 1978)|volume=vol. 1|pages=227–236|chapter-url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1978.1/Main/icm1978.1.0227.0236.ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Weil shared the second [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] with Jean Leray.

==Work==
Weil made substantial contributions in a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]]. This began in his doctoral work leading to the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] (1928, and shortly applied in [[Siegel's theorem on integral points]]).&lt;ref&gt;A. Weil, ''L'arithmétique sur les courbes algébriques'', Acta Math 52, (1929) p.&amp;nbsp;281–315, reprinted in vol 1 of his collected papers {{isbn|0-387-90330-5}}
.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mordell's theorem]] had an ''ad hoc'' proof;&lt;ref&gt;L.J. Mordell, ''On the rational solutions of the indeterminate equations of the third and fourth degrees'', Proc Cam. Phil. Soc. 21, (1922) p.&amp;nbsp;179&lt;/ref&gt; Weil began the separation of the [[infinite descent]] argument into two types of structural approach, by means of [[height function]]s for sizing rational points, and by means of [[Galois cohomology]], which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories.

Among his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the [[Weil conjectures|Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions]] of curves over finite fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Weil | first1=André | author1-link=André Weil | title=Numbers of solutions of equations in finite fields | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1949-09219-4 | mr=0029393 | year=1949 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=55 | pages=497–508 | issue=5}} Reprinted in Oeuvres Scientifiques/Collected Papers by André Weil {{isbn|0-387-90330-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his subsequent laying of proper [[foundations for algebraic geometry]] to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). The so-called [[Weil conjectures]] were hugely influential from around 1950; these statements were later proved by [[Bernard Dwork]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Dwork | first1=Bernard | author1-link=Bernard Dwork | title=On the rationality of the zeta function of an algebraic variety | jstor=2372974 | mr=0140494 | year=1960 | journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics]] | issn=0002-9327 | volume=82 | pages=631–648 | doi=10.2307/2372974 | issue=3 | publisher=American Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 82, No. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Grothendieck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Grothendieck | first1=Alexander | author1-link=Alexander Grothendieck | title=Proc.

Weil introduced the [[adele ring]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Weil, ''Adeles and algebraic groups'', Birkhauser, Boston, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1930s, following [[Claude Chevalley]]'s lead with the [[idele]]s, and gave a proof of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] with them (a version appeared in his ''Basic Number Theory'' in 1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|mr=0234930 |last=Weil|first= André |title=Basic number theory.|series=Die Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften |volume=144 |publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York |date=1967 |isbn= 3-540-58655-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 'matrix divisor' ([[vector bundle]] ''avant la lettre'') Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The [[Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Weil | first1=André | author1-link=André Weil | title=Exp. No. 186, Adèles et groupes algébriques | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=SB_1958-1960__5__249_0 | series=Séminaire Bourbaki | year=1959 | volume=5 | pages=249–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in [[automorphic representation]] theory. He picked up another credited ''Weil conjecture'', around 1967, which later under pressure from [[Serge Lang]] (resp. of Serre) became known as the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S. &quot;Some History of the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture.&quot; Not. Amer. Math. Soc. 42, 1301–1307, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant results were on [[Pontryagin duality]] and [[differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Borel, A.|title=André Weil and Algebraic Topology|journal=Notices of the AMS|year=1999|volume=46|issue=4|pages=422–427|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199904/borel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the concept of a [[uniform space]] in [[general topology]], as a by-product of his collaboration with [[Nicolas Bourbaki]] (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on [[sheaf theory]] hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with [[Henri Cartan]] in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential. He also created the symbol [[null sign|∅]] to represent the [[empty set]].

Weil also made a well-known contribution in [[Riemannian geometry]] in his very first paper in 1926, when he showed that the classical [[isoperimetric inequality]] holds on non-positively curved surfaces. This established the 2-dimensional case of what later became known as the [[Cartan–Hadamard conjecture]].

He discovered that the so-called [[Weil representation]], previously introduced in [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Irving Segal]] and [[David Shale]], gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of [[quadratic form]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Weil |title=Sur certains groupes d'opérateurs unitaires |language=fr|journal=Acta Math. |volume=111 |year=1964 |pages=143–211 |doi=10.1007/BF02391012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting [[representation theory]] and [[theta function]]s.

He also wrote several books on the history of Number Theory. Weil was elected [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1966|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1966]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot; /&gt;

==As expositor==
Weil's ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]], before and after [[World War II]].

He says on page 114 of his [[#autobiography|autobiography]] that he was responsible for the null set symbol (Ø) and that it came from the [[Norwegian alphabet]], which he alone among the Bourbaki group was familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Jeff|last=Miller|date=1 September 2010 |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/set.html|title=Earliest Uses of Symbols of Set Theory and Logic|publisher=Jeff Miller Web Pages|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

[[Hindu philosophy|Indian (Hindu) thought]] had great influence on Weil.&lt;ref&gt;Borel, Armand. [http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~aknapp/BorelOnWeil.pdf] (see also)[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/638991/Andre-Weil]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an agnostic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American National Biography: Supplement, Volume 1|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195150636|author1=Paul Betz |author2=Mark Christopher Carnes, [[American Council of Learned Societies]]|page=676|quote=Although as a lifelong agnostic he may have been somewhat bemused by Simone Weil's preoccupations with [[Christian mysticism]], he remained a vigilant guardian of her memory,...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he respected religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Mathematical Sciences|year=2004|publisher=Hindustan Book Agency|isbn=9788185931456|author=I.
