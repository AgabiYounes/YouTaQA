'''Augustine of Hippo''' ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|s|t|ᵻ|n}}; 13 November 354 – 28 August 430 AD)&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wells |first=J. |authorlink=John C. Wells |title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-582-36467-7 |edition=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/longmanpronuncia00jcwe }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Roman Africans|Roman African]], Manichaean, early [[Christian theologian]], [[doctor of the Church]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] [[philosopher]] from [[Numidia (Roman province)|Numidia]] whose writings influenced the development of the [[Western Church]] and [[Western philosophy]], and indirectly all of [[Western Christianity]]. He was the [[bishop]] of [[Hippo Regius]] in [[North Africa]] and is viewed as one of the most important [[Latin Church Fathers|Church Fathers]] of the [[Latin Church]] for his writings in the [[Patristics|Patristic Period]]. Among his most important works are ''[[The City of God]]'', ''[[De doctrina Christiana]]'', and ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''.

According to his contemporary, [[Jerome]], Augustine &quot;established anew the ancient Faith&quot;.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Jerome]] wrote to Augustine in 418: &quot;You are known throughout the world; Catholics honour and esteem you as the one who has established anew the ancient Faith&quot; (''conditor antiquae rursum fidei''). Cf. [http://www.augustinus.it/latino/lettere/lettera_200_testo.htm Epistola 195]; {{cite book |title= Augustine the Theologian |last=TeSelle |first=Eugene |year=1970 |location= London |page=343 |isbn=978-0-223-97728-0}} March 2002 edition: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he was drawn to [[Manichaeism]] and later to [[neoplatonism]]. After his baptism and conversion to Christianity in 386, Augustine developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Augustine the Theologian |last=TeSelle |first=Eugene |year=1970 |location=London |pages=347–349 |isbn= 978-0-223-97728-0}} 2002: {{ISBN|1-57910-918-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the [[Grace in Christianity|grace of Christ]] was indispensable to human freedom, he helped formulate the doctrine of [[original sin]] and made seminal contributions to the development of [[just war theory]]. When the [[Western Roman Empire]] began to disintegrate, Augustine imagined the Church as a spiritual [[New Jerusalem#Christianity|City of God]], distinct from the material Earthly City.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will |title=Caesar and Christ: a History of Roman Civilization and of Christianity from Their Beginnings to A.D. 325 |publisher=MJF Books |location=New York |year=1992 |isbn=978-1-56731-014-6 |authorlink=Will Durant|title-link=Ancient Rome }}&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts profoundly influenced the medieval worldview.

Augustine is recognized as a saint in the Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the [[Anglican Communion]] and as a preeminent [[Doctor of the Church]]. He is also the patron of the [[Augustinians]]. His memorial is celebrated on 28 August, the day of his death. Augustine is the [[patron saint]] of brewers, printers, theologians, and a number of cities and dioceses.&lt;ref name=&quot;KnoYrSaint&quot;&gt;[http://www.catholicapologetics.info/library/saints/index.htm Know Your Patron Saint]. catholicapologetics.info&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] and [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], consider him to be one of the theological fathers of the [[Protestant Reformation]] due to his teachings on [[salvation]] and [[divine grace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hägglund 2007 139–140&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Hägglund| first=Bengt| title=Teologins historia| language=German|trans-title=History of Theology| others=Translated by Gene J.

Augustine's family name, Aurelius, suggests that his father's ancestors were [[liberti|freedmen]] of the ''[[Aurelia (gens)|gens Aurelia]]'' given full Roman citizenship by the [[Edict of Caracalla]] in 212. Augustine's family had been Roman, from a legal standpoint, for at least a century when he was born.&lt;ref&gt;Lancel, Serge (2002) ''Saint Augustine'', Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern, p. 5, {{ISBN|0334028663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that his mother, Monica, was of [[Berbers|Berber]] origin, on the basis of her name,&lt;ref name=&quot;KP&quot;&gt;Power, Kim (1999) &quot;Family, Relatives&quot;, pp. 353–354 in ''Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia''.

At the age of 11, Augustine was sent to school at Madaurus (now [[M'Daourouch]]), a small [[Numidia]]n city about {{convert|19|mi}} south of Thagaste. There he became familiar with [[Latin literature]], as well as pagan beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Andrew and Penkett, Pachomios (2004) ''Augustine and His World''. InterVarsity Press. Ch. 2. {{ISBN|978-0830823567}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His first insight into the nature of sin occurred when he and a number of friends stole fruit they did not want from a neighborhood garden. He tells this story in his autobiography, ''The Confessions''. He remembers that he stole the fruit, not because he was hungry, but because &quot;it was not permitted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:4&lt;/ref&gt; His very nature, he says, was flawed. 'It was foul, and I loved it. I loved my own error—not that for which I erred, but the error itself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; From this incident he concluded the human person is naturally inclined to sin, and in need of the grace of Christ.

At the age of 17, through the generosity of his fellow citizen Romanianus,&lt;ref name=EA&gt;''Encyclopedia Americana'', v. 2, p. 685. Danbury, Connecticut: Grolier, 1997. {{ISBN|0-7172-0129-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine went to [[Carthage]] to continue his education in [[rhetoric]], though it was above the financial means of his family.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:3.5&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the good warnings of his mother, as a youth Augustine lived a [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle for a time, associating with young men who boasted of their sexual exploits. The need to gain their acceptance forced inexperienced boys like Augustine to seek or make up stories about sexual experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;FLNZ1&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 2:3.7&lt;/ref&gt;

It was while he was a student in Carthage that he read [[Cicero]]'s [[dialogue]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' (now lost), which he described as leaving a lasting impression, enkindling in his heart the love of wisdom and a great thirst for truth. It started his interest in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4&lt;/ref&gt; Although raised to follow Christianity, Augustine decided to become a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], much to his mother's despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Pope | first = Hugh | work =Catholic Encyclopedia | title = Saint Monica| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm | accessdate = 20 April 2012|quote= At Carthage Augustine had become a Manichaean and when on his return home he propounded certain heretical propositions she drove him away from her table, but a strange vision urged her to recall him. It was at this time that she went to see a certain holy bishop, whose name is not given, but who consoled her with the now famous words, &quot;the child of those tears shall never perish.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the age of 17, Augustine began an affair with a young woman in Carthage. Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman remained his lover&lt;ref name=Uta&gt;{{cite book |title= Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality and the Catholic Church | last =Ranke-Heineman | first = Uta| publisher= Penguin Books | place = US |year=1988| isbn=978-0385265270}}&lt;/ref&gt; for over fifteen years&lt;ref name=&quot;utne.com&quot;&gt;Boyce, James (May 2015) [http://www.utne.com/mind-and-body/st-augustine-and-original-sin-ze0z1505zken.aspx &quot;Don't Blame the Devil: St Augustine and Original Sin&quot;].

In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the legal age of marriage for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.&lt;ref name=&quot;utne.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was from the beginning a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek&lt;ref name=O&gt;[http://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/augustine/ O'Donnell, James J. &quot;Augustine the African&quot;, Georgetown University]. Faculty.georgetown.edu. Retrieved on 2015-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;—he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that he needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.

===Move to Carthage, Rome, Milan===
[[File:Augustine Lateran.jpg|thumb|The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome]]

Augustine taught grammar at Thagaste during 373 and 374. The following year he moved to Carthage to conduct a school of rhetoric and would remain there for the next nine years.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Disturbed by unruly students in Carthage, he moved to establish a school in Rome, where he believed the best and brightest rhetoricians practiced, in 383. However, Augustine was disappointed with the apathetic reception. It was the custom for students to pay their fees to the professor on the last day of the term, and many students attended faithfully all term, and then did not pay.

Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the City of Rome, [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who while traveling through Carthage had been asked by the imperial court at [[Milan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot; /&gt; to provide a rhetoric professor. Augustine won the job and headed north to take his position in Milan in late 384. Thirty years old, he had won the most visible academic position in the Latin world at a time when such posts gave ready access to political careers.

Although Augustine spent ten years as a Manichaean, he was never an initiate or &quot;elect&quot;, but an &quot;auditor&quot;, the lowest level in this religion's hierarchy.&lt;ref name = &quot;celife&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chadwick |first1=Henry |title=Augustine: A Very Short Introduction |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0191606632 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still at Carthage a disappointing meeting with the Manichaean Bishop, [[Faustus of Mileve]], a key exponent of Manichaean theology, started Augustine's scepticism of Manichaeanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot; /&gt; In Rome, he reportedly turned away from Manichaeanism, embracing the [[Philosophical scepticism|scepticism]] of the [[New Academy]] movement. Because of his education, Augustine had great rhetorical prowess and was very knowledgeable of the philosophies behind many faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Kishlansky| first1=Mark| last2=Geary| first2=Patrick| last3=O'Brien| first3=Patricia| title=Civilization in the West| date=2010| publisher=Pearson Education Inc.| location=New Jersey| pages=142–143| volume=Vol. 1: to 1715| ref=Augustine of Hippo|isbn=978-0205664726}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Milan, his mother's religiosity, Augustine's own studies in [[Neoplatonism]], and his friend [[Simplician]]us all urged him towards Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EA&quot; /&gt; Not coincidentally, this was shortly after the Roman emperor Theodosius I had issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 and shortly before he declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire in 391.&lt;ref&gt; Wendy Doniger (1999). Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions. Merriam-Webster. pp. 689, 690. {{ISBN|9789068310023}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially Augustine was not strongly influenced by Christianity and its ideologies, but after coming in contact with [[Ambrose]] of Milan, Augustine reevaluated himself and was forever changed.

Augustine arrived in Milan and visited Ambrose having heard of his reputation as an orator. Augustine quickly discovered that Ambrose was a spectacular orator. Like Augustine, Ambrose was a master of rhetoric, but older and more experienced.&lt;ref name = &quot;BeDuhn2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first = Jason David | last = BeDuhn | title = Augustine's Manichaean Dilemma: Conversion and Apostasy, 373–388 C.E. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEmZaq1Gg3wC&amp;pg=PA163 | accessdate = 17 June 2011 | date =2009| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-4210-2|page= 163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, their relationship grew, as Augustine wrote, &quot;And I began to love him, of course, not at the first as a teacher of the truth, for I had entirely despaired of finding that in thy Church—but as a friendly man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion&quot;/&gt; Eventually, Augustine says that he was spiritually led into the faith of Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Augustine: Account of His Own Conversion&quot;/&gt; Augustine was very much influenced by Ambrose, even more than by his own mother and others he admired.

Augustine's mother had followed him to Milan and arranged a respectable marriage for him. Although Augustine acquiesced, he had to dismiss his concubine and grieved for having forsaken his lover. He wrote, &quot;My mistress being torn from my side as an impediment to my marriage, my heart, which clave to her, was racked, and wounded, and bleeding.&quot; Augustine confessed that he was not a lover of wedlock so much as a slave of lust, so he procured another concubine since he had to wait two years until his fiancée came of age. However, his emotional wound was not healed.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 6:15&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that he uttered his famous prayer, &quot;Grant me [[chastity]] and [[sexual abstinence|continence]], but not yet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FLNZ2&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 8:7.17&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Augustine may have considered this former relationship to be equivalent to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Burrus | first=Virginia| year=2011| title=&quot;Fleeing the Uxorious Kingdom&quot;: Augustine's Queer Theology of Marriage | journal =Journal of Early Christian Studies|volume=19| issue=1| pages = 1–20| doi=10.1353/earl.2011.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Confessions'', he admitted that the experience eventually produced a decreased sensitivity to pain. Augustine eventually broke off his engagement to his eleven-year-old fiancée, but never renewed his relationship with either of his concubines. [[Alypius of Thagaste]] steered Augustine away from marriage, saying that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine looked back years later on the life at [[Cassago Brianza|Cassiciacum]], a villa outside of Milan where he gathered with his followers, and described it as ''Christianae vitae otium'' – the leisure of Christian life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferguson208&quot;&gt;Ferguson, Everett (1999) ''Christianity in Relation to Jews, Greeks, and Romans'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], p. 208, {{ISBN|0-8153-3069-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August of 386,&lt;ref&gt;The historian Peter Brown places Augustine's garden conversion at the end of August, 386. [[#Brown|Brown]], p. 64.
&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 31, having heard of Ponticianus's and his friends' first reading of the life of [[Anthony the Great|Anthony of the Desert]], Augustine converted to Christianity. As Augustine later told it, his conversion was prompted by hearing a child's voice say &quot;take up and read&quot; ({{lang-la|tolle, lege}}). Resorting to the [[Sortes Sanctorum]], he opened the Bible at random and read Romans 13: 13-14: ''Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Augustine of Hippo | title = Confessions |year= 2008| publisher= Oxford University Press| place = New York | pages =152–153 | others = Chadwick, Henry transl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later wrote an account of his conversion in his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' ({{lang-la|Confessiones}}), which has since become a classic of Christian theology and a key text in the history of [[autobiography]]. This work is an outpouring of thanksgiving and penitence. Although it is written as an account of his life, the ''Confessions'' also talks about the nature of time, causality, free will, and other important philosophical topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;justus.anglican.org&quot;&gt;[http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/50.html Augustine of Hippo, Bishop and Theologian].

&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in 388, Augustine completed his [[Christian apologetics|apology]] ''On the Holiness of the Catholic Church''.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;/&gt; That year, also, Adeodatus and Augustine returned home to Africa.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt; Augustine's mother Monica died at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], Italy, as they prepared to embark for Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Pope| first=Hugh| work = [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | title = Saint Monica| url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10482a.htm| accessdate=20 April 2012| quote=Here death overtook Monica and the finest pages of his &quot;Confessions&quot; were penned as the result of the emotion Augustine then experienced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their arrival, they began a life of aristocratic leisure at Augustine's family's property.&lt;ref&gt;Possidius, ''v.

The only thing he kept was the family house, which he converted into a [[monastic]] foundation for himself and a group of friends.&lt;ref name=EA/&gt;

In 391 Augustine was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] in [[Hippo Regius]] (now [[Annaba]]), in [[Algeria]]. He became a famous [[preacher]] (more than 350 preserved sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating the Manichaean religion, to which he had formerly adhered.&lt;ref name=&quot;celife&quot;&gt;Portalié, Eugène (1907).

In 395, he was made [[coadjutor Bishop]] of Hippo, and became full Bishop shortly thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]]&lt;/ref&gt; hence the name &quot;Augustine of Hippo&quot;; and he gave his property to the church of Thagaste.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''ep.''126.1&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in that position until his death in 430. He wrote his autobiographical ''Confessions'' in 397–398. His work ''The City of God'' was written to console his fellow Christians shortly after the [[Visigoths]] had [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]].

Augustine worked tirelessly in trying to convince the people of Hippo to convert to Christianity. Though he had left his monastery, he continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal residence. He left a ''[[Monastic rule|regula]]'' for his monastery that led to his designation as the &quot;[[patron saint]] of [[regular clergy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-augustine-of-hippo/ Saint Augustine of Hippo] at ''saints.sqpn.com''.

Much of Augustine's later life was recorded by his friend [[Possidius]], bishop of [[Calama (Numidia)|Calama]] (present-day [[Guelma]], Algeria), in his ''Sancti Augustini Vita''. Possidius admired Augustine as a man of powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors.

Shortly before Augustine's death, the [[Vandals]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe that had converted to [[Arianism]], invaded [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]]. The Vandals besieged Hippo in the spring of 430, when Augustine entered his final illness. According to Possidius, one of the few miracles attributed to Augustine, the healing of an ill man, took place during the siege.&lt;ref name=Weiskotten/&gt;{{rp|43}} According to Possidius, Augustine spent his final days in prayer and repentance, requesting that the penitential [[Psalms|Psalms of David]] be hung on his walls so that he could read them.

He died on 28 August 430.&lt;ref name=Weiskotten/&gt;{{rp|57}} Shortly after his death, the Vandals lifted the siege of Hippo, but they returned not long thereafter and burned the city.

====Relics====
[[File:Basilica-sant'agostino-annaba03.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Augustine's arm bones, [[Saint Augustin Basilica]], [[Annaba]], Algeria]]
According to [[Bede]]'s ''True Martyrology'', Augustine's body was later [[Translation (relic)|translated]] or moved to [[Cagliari]], [[Sardinia]], by the Catholic bishops expelled from North Africa by [[Huneric]]. Around 720, his remains were transported again by Peter, [[bishop of Pavia]] and uncle of the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], to the church of [[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]] in Pavia, in order to save them from frequent coastal raids by [[Muslim]]s. In January 1327, [[Pope John XXII]] issued the papal bull ''Veneranda Santorum Patrum'', in which he appointed the [[Augustinians]] guardians of the tomb of Augustine (called ''Arca''), which was remade in 1362 and elaborately carved with bas-reliefs of scenes from Augustine's life.

In October 1695, some workmen in the Church of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia discovered a marble box containing some human bones (including part of a skull). A dispute arose between the Augustinian hermits (Order of Saint Augustine) and the [[regular canons]] (Canons Regular of Saint Augustine) as to whether these were the bones of Augustine. The hermits did not believe so; the canons affirmed that they were. Eventually [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730) directed the Bishop of Pavia, [[Monsignor]] Pertusati, to make a determination. The bishop declared that, in his opinion, the bones were those of Saint Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=2213&amp;iparentid=145 Augustine's tomb, Augnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172526/http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=2213&amp;iparentid=145 |date=22 February 2014 }}.

The Augustinians were expelled from Pavia in 1700, taking refuge in [[Milan]] with the relics of Augustine, and the disassembled ''Arca'', which were removed to the cathedral there. San Pietro fell into disrepair, but was finally rebuilt in the 1870s, under the urging of [[Agostino Gaetano Riboldi]], and reconsecrated in 1896 when the relics of Augustine and the shrine were once again reinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dale, Shanon |title=A house divided: San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia and the politics of Pope John XXII| doi=10.1016/S0304-4181(00)00016-6| year=2001| journal=Journal of Medieval History| volume=27| page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Harold Samuel (2002) ''St. Augustine's Bones: A Microhistory'' (Studies in Print Culture and the History of the Book) Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], {{ISBN|1558493883}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's large contribution of writings covered diverse fields including theology, philosophy and sociology. Along with [[John Chrysostom]], Augustine was among the most prolific scholars of the early church by quantity

===Theology===
====Christian anthropology====
Augustine was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with a very clear vision of [[Christian anthropology|theological anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | publisher = Stanford | title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#PhiAnt | contribution = Saint Augustine {{ndash}} Philosophical Anthropology | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise ''[[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5]]'' (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human [[person]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627 [13–22]; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...)Haec enim non ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is marriage: ''caro tua, coniunx tua – your body is your wife''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]; 46, 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine was not preoccupied, as [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the free will'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7–6.13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = WE | last = Mann | contribution = Inner-Life Ethics | title=The Augustinian Tradition | publisher=University of California Press | year=1999 | pages=141–142 | isbn=978-0-520-20999-2 | editor-first = GB | editor-last = Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other Church Fathers such as [[Athenagoras of Athens|Athenagoras]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Plea for the Christians |first = Athenagoras | last = the Athenian | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0205.htm | publisher = New advent}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]],&lt;ref&gt;Flinn, Frank K. and Melton, J.

His view was based on the Aristotelian distinction &quot;between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'&quot;. Therefore, he did not classify as murder the abortion of an &quot;unformed&quot; fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgerald, 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/respect-for-unborn-human-life.cfm Respect for Unborn Human Life: the Church's Constant Teaching]. U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine held that &quot;the timing of the infusion of the soul was a mystery known to God alone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Moral Medicine: Theological Perspectives on Medical Ethics|editor1=Lysaught, M. Therese |editor2=Kotva, Joseph |editor3=Lammers, Stephen E. |editor4=Verhey, Allen |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8028-6601-1|page=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he considered procreation as one of the goods of marriage; abortion figured as a means, along with drugs which cause sterility, of frustrating this good. It lay along a continuum which included infanticide as an instance of ‘lustful cruelty’ or ‘cruel lust.’ Augustine called the use of means to avoid the birth of a child an ‘evil work:’ a reference to either abortion or contraception or both.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vasa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/bishops/vasapelosi.htm|title=Modern Look at Abortion Not Same as St. Augustine's|website=www.ewtn.com|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation====
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis}}
In ''City of God'', Augustine rejected both the contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-02/npnf1-02-18.htm#P2017_1154484 |chapter=Of the Falseness of the History Which Allots Many Thousand Years to the World's Past |title=The City of God |at=Book&amp;nbsp;12: Chapt.&amp;nbsp;10 [419]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Literal Interpretation of Genesis'' Augustine took the view that God had created everything in the universe simultaneously, and not over a period of six days as a literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a [[framework interpretation (Genesis)|logical framework]], rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which is no less literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in [[Sirach]]&amp;nbsp;18:1, ''creavit omnia simul'' (&quot;He created all things at once&quot;), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis&amp;nbsp;1 had to be taken non-literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |publisher=Wm B Eerdmans |isbn=978-0-8028-3843-8 |pages=377–378 |editor-first=Allan D. |editor-last=Fitzgerald |last=Teske |first=Roland J. |title=Genesi ad litteram liber imperfectus, De |encyclopedia=Augustine through the Ages: An Encyclopedia |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an additional support for describing the six days of creation as a [[heuristic]] device, Augustine thought that the actual event of creation would be incomprehensible by humans and therefore needed to be translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |title=Reading the world: Encyclopedic writing in the scholastic age |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago &amp; London |year=2012 |isbn=978-0226260709 |p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine also does not envision original sin as causing structural changes in the universe, and even suggests that the bodies of [[Adam and Eve]] were already created mortal before [[Fall of man|the Fall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=On the Merits |at=1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=City of God |at=13:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustine of Hippo |title=Enchiridion |at=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecclesiology====
{{See also|Ecclesiology}}
[[File:Carlo Crivelli - St. Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|''St. Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]]]
Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect. He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the [[laity]]) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven). The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s, while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God. The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of &quot;wheat&quot; and &quot;tares&quot;, that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat. 13:30), until the end of time. This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| date=1970–1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

Augustine's ecclesiology was more fully developed in ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''. There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride. Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; and that their authority in the Church is God-given.

==== Eschatology ====
Augustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal. He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]. The Catholic Church during the Medieval period built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Blomberg, Craig L. |title=From Pentecost to Patmos| publisher=Apollos| year=2006| page=519| isbn=978-0805432480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Reformation]] theologians such as [[John Calvin]] accepted amillennialism. Augustine taught that the eternal fate of the soul is determined at death,&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=Frank L. |editor2-last=Livingstone |editor2-first=Elizabeth |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-19-280290-3 |ref=Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Enchiridion'', 110&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[purgatory|purgatorial]] fires of the [[intermediate state]] purify only those that died in communion with the Church. His teaching provided fuel for later theology.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;

====Mariology====
Although Augustine did not develop an independent [[Mariology]], his statements on Mary surpass in number and depth those of other early writers. Even before the [[Council of Ephesus]], he defended the [[perpetual virginity of Mary|Ever-Virgin Mary]] as the [[theotokos|Mother of God]], believing her to be &quot;full of grace&quot; (following earlier Latin writers such as [[Jerome]]) on account of her sexual integrity and innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 6,6, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, he affirmed that the Virgin Mary &quot;conceived as virgin, gave birth as virgin and stayed virgin forever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De Sancta Virginitate'', 18&lt;/ref&gt;

====Natural knowledge and biblical interpretation====
Augustine took the view that, if a literal interpretation contradicts science and our God-given reason, the Biblical text should be interpreted metaphorically. While each passage of Scripture has a literal sense, this &quot;literal sense&quot; does not always mean that the Scriptures are mere history; at times they are rather an extended [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De Genesi ad literam 1:19–20'', Chapt. 19 [408], ''De Genesi ad literam'', 2:9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Original sin====
{{see also|Original sin}}

[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 17th century]]
Augustine taught that the sin of Adam and Eve was either an act of foolishness (''insipientia'') followed by pride and disobedience to God or that pride came first.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;He explained to Julian of Eclanum that it was a most subtle job to discern what came first: ''Sed si disputatione subtilissima et elimatissima opus est, ut sciamus utrum primos homines insipientia superbos, an insipientes superbia fecerit''. (''Contra Julianum'', V, 4.18; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 795)&lt;/ref&gt; The first couple disobeyed God, who had told them not to eat of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] (Gen 2:17).&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 6:12, vol. 1, pp. 192–93 and 12:28, vol. 2, pp. 219–20, trans. John Hammond Taylor SJ; [[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49,28 and 50–52; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 34, 377; cf. idem, ''De Trinitate'', XII, 12.17; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 371–372 [v. 26–31; 1–36];  ''De natura boni'' 34–35; CSEL 25, 872; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 42, 551–572&lt;/ref&gt; The tree was a symbol of the order of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On the Literal Meaning of Genesis'' (''De Genesi ad litteram''), VIII, 4.8; [[Bibliothèque Augustinniene|BA]] 49, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Self-centeredness made Adam and Eve eat of it, thus failing to acknowledge and respect the world as it was created by God, with its hierarchy of beings and values.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Augustine explained it in this way: &quot;Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more.&quot; (&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/130105.htm On the Trinity]&quot; (''De Trinitate''), 5:7; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 50, 320 [1–12])&lt;/ref&gt;

They would not have fallen into pride and lack of wisdom, if [[Satan]] hadn't sown into their senses &quot;the root of evil&quot; (''radix Mali'').&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus''  (&quot;Contra Julianum&quot;, I, 9.42; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 670)&lt;/ref&gt; Their nature was wounded by [[concupiscence]] or [[libido]], which affected human intelligence and will, as well as affections and desires, including sexual desire.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In one of Augustine's late works, ''[[Retractationes]]'', he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual, moral libido and the sexual desire: &quot;Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido&quot; (&quot;libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis&quot;). See the whole passage: ''Dixi etiam quodam loco: «Quod enim est cibus ad salutem hominis, hoc est concubitus ad salutem generis, et utrumque non est sine delectatione carnali, quae tamen modificata et temperantia refrenante in usum naturalem redacta, libido esse non potest». Quod ideo dictum est, quoniam &quot;libido non est bonus et rectus usus libidinis&quot;. Sicut enim malum est male uti bonis, ita bonum bene uti malis. De qua re alias, maxime contra novos haereticos Pelagianos, diligentius disputavi''. Cf. ''De bono coniugali'', 16.18; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 385; ''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', II, 21.36; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 443; ''Contra Iulianum'', III, 7.16; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 710; ibid., V, 16.60; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 817.

Une théologie baptismale de la vie conjugale |author= Idem |year= 1983 |publisher= Études Augustiniennes |location=Paris |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[metaphysics]], concupiscence is not a being but bad quality, the privation of good or a wound.&lt;ref&gt;''Non substantialiter manere concupiscentiam, sicut corpus aliquod aut spiritum; sed esse affectionem quamdam malae qualitatis, sicut est languor''. (''De nuptiis et concupiscentia'', I, 25. 28; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 430; cf. ''Contra Julianum'', VI, 18.53; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 854; ibid.

Augustine's understanding of the consequences of original sin and the necessity of redeeming grace was developed in the struggle against [[Pelagius]] and his [[Pelagianism|Pelagian]] disciples, [[Caelestius]] and [[Julian of Eclanum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; who had been inspired by [[Rufinus of Syria]], a disciple of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marius Mercator]] ''Lib. subnot.in verb. Iul. Praef.'',2,3; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 48,111 /v.5-13/; {{cite book |last= Bonner |first= Gerald |chapter= Rufinus of Syria and African Pelagianism |title= God's Decree and Man's Destiny |location= London |year= 1987 |pages= 31–47 |isbn= 978-0-86078-203-2 |publisher=  Variorum Reprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} They refused to agree that original sin wounded human will and mind, insisting that human nature was given the power to act, to speak, and to think when God created it. Human nature cannot lose its moral capacity for doing good, but a person is free to act or not to act in a righteous way. Pelagius gave an example of eyes: they have capacity for seeing, but a person can make either good or bad use of it.&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;{{rp|355–356}}&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''[http://www.augustinus.it/latino/grazia_cristo/grazia_cristo_1_libro.htm De gratia Christi et de peccato originali]'', I, 15.16; CSEL 42, 138 [v. 24–29]; Ibid., I,4.5; CSEL 42, 128 [v.15–23].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Jovinian]], Pelagians insisted that human affections and desires were not touched by the fall either. Immorality, ''e.g.'' [[fornication]], is exclusively a matter of will, ''i.e.'' a person does not use natural desires in a proper way. In opposition to that, Augustine pointed out the apparent disobedience of the flesh to the spirit, and explained it as one of the results of original sin, punishment of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 1.31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine had served as a &quot;Hearer&quot; for the Manichaeans for about nine years,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]], p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; who taught that the original sin was [[carnal knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm |title=The Manichaean Version of Genesis 2–4 |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029144459/http://www.religiousstudies.uncc.edu/jcreeves/manichaean_version_of_genesis_2-4.htm |archivedate=29 October 2005 }}.

In the matter which concerns us here, the agreement with Neoplatonism (and with the Platonic tradition in general) centers on two related notions: immutability as primary characteristic of divinity, and likeness to divinity as the primary vocation of the soul. The disagreement chiefly concerned, as we have said, two related and central Christian dogmas: the Incarnation of the Son of God and the resurrection of the flesh''. {{cite journal |last= Clarke, [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] |first= T.E. |title=St. Augustine and Cosmic Redemption |journal= Theological Studies |volume=19 |issue= 1958 |page= 151}}  Cf.

Some authors perceive Augustine's doctrine as directed against [[human sexuality]] and attribute his insistence on continence and devotion to God as coming from Augustine's need to reject his own highly sensual nature as described in the ''Confessions''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|&quot;It is, of course, always easier to oppose and denounce than to understand.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;{{rp|312}}}} Augustine taught that human sexuality has been wounded, together with the whole of human nature, and requires [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] of Christ. That healing is a process realized in conjugal acts. The virtue of continence is achieved thanks to the grace of the sacrament of Christian marriage, which becomes therefore a ''remedium concupiscentiae'' – remedy of concupiscence.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''De continentia'', 12.27; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 368; Ibid., 13.28; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 40, 369; ''Contra Julianum'', III, 15.29, &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 717; Ibid., III, 21.42, &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 724.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=A Postscript to the Remedium Concupiscentiae| journal=The Thomist| volume= 70 | issue=4|year=2006| pages= 481–536 |url=http://www.cormacburke.or.ke/node/932| doi=10.1353/tho.2006.0000| last1=Burke| first1=Cormac}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redemption of human sexuality will be, however, fully accomplished only in the resurrection of the body.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1501.htm Merits and Remission of Sin, and Infant Baptism]'' (''De peccatorum meritis et remissione et de baptismo parvulorum''), I, 6.6; &lt;abbr title=&quot;Patrologia Latina&quot;&gt;[[Patrologia Latina|PL]]&lt;/abbr&gt; 44, 112–113; cf.

The sin of Adam is inherited by all human beings. Already in his pre-Pelagian writings, Augustine taught that Original Sin is transmitted to his descendants by [[concupiscence]],&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Imperfectum Opus contra Iulianum'', II, 218&lt;/ref&gt; which he regarded as the passion of both, soul and body,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In 393 or 394 he commented: ''Moreover, if unbelief is fornication, and [[idolatry]] unbelief, and [[covetousness]] idolatry, it is not to be doubted that covetousness also is fornication. Who, then, in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication, if covetousness is fornication? And from this we perceive, that because of unlawful lusts, not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with another's husband or wife, but any unlawful lusts whatever, which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God, and to be ruinously and basely corrupted, a man may, without crime, put away his wife, and a wife her husband, because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception; which fornication, in accordance with the above considerations, we are compelled to understand as being general and universal.'' (&quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/16011.htm On the Sermon on the Mount]&quot;, ''De sermone Domini in monte'', 1:16:46; [[Corpus Christianorum|CCL]] 35, 52)&lt;/ref&gt; making humanity a ''massa damnata'' (mass of perdition, condemned crowd) and much enfeebling, though not destroying, the freedom of the will.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}} Although earlier Christian authors taught the elements of physical death, moral weakness, and a sin propensity within original sin, Augustine was the first to add the concept of inherited guilt (''reatus'') from Adam whereby an infant was eternally damned at birth.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Augustine's Conversion from Traditional Free Choice to &quot;Non-free Free Will&quot;: A Comprehensive Methodology |date=2018 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen |isbn=978-3161557538 |pages=93, 127, 140, 146, 231–233, 279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Augustine's anti-Pelagian defense of original sin was confirmed at numerous councils, ''i.e.'' [[Council of Carthage (418)|Carthage (418)]], [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] (431), [[Council of Orange (529)|Orange]] (529), [[Council of Trent|Trent]] (1546) and by popes, ''i.e.'' [[Pope Innocent I]] (401–417) and [[Pope Zosimus]] (417–418), his inherited guilt eternally damning infants was omitted by these councils and popes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Augustine's Conversion from Traditional Free Choice to &quot;Non-free Free Will&quot;: A Comprehensive Methodology |date=2018 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen |isbn=978-3161557538 |pages=221, 231, 267, 296}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anselm of Canterbury]] established in his ''[[Cur Deus Homo]]'' the definition that was followed by the great 13th-century Schoolmen, namely that Original Sin is the &quot;privation of the righteousness which every man ought to possess&quot;, thus separating it from ''concupiscence'', with which some of Augustine's disciples had defined it&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;{{rp|371}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Making of the Middle Ages |url=https://archive.org/details/makingofmiddleag00sout |url-access=registration |last=Southern |first=R.W. |year=1953 |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/makingofmiddleag00sout/page/234 234–237]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as later did Luther and Calvin.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}} In 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] condemned the identification of Original Sin with concupiscence.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}}

====Predestination====
{{see also|Predestination}}
Augustine taught that God orders all things while preserving human freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levering&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Levering |first=Matthew |title=Predestination: Biblical and Theological Paths |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-19-960452-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cLBS6Dl1OYgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} Prior to 396, he believed that predestination was based on God's foreknowledge of whether individuals would believe in Christ, that God's grace was &quot;a reward for human assent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levering&quot;/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} Later, in response to [[Pelagius]], Augustine said that the sin of [[pride]] consists in assuming that &quot;we are the ones who choose God or that God chooses us (in his foreknowledge) because of something worthy in us&quot;, and argued that God's grace causes individual act of faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levering&quot;/&gt;{{rp|47–48}}

Scholars are divided over whether Augustine's teaching implies [[double predestination]], or the belief that God chooses some people for damnation as well as some for salvation. Catholic scholars tend to deny that he held such a view while some Protestants and secular scholars have held that Augustine did believe in double predestination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Frank A., III |year=1998 |title=Peter Martyr Vermigli and Predestination: The Augustinian Inheritance of an Italian Reformer |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford |url=https://www.questia.com/library/1833170/peter-martyr-vermigli-and-predestination-the-augustinian |url-access=subscription  |via=[[Questia]] |p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 412 AD, Augustine became the first Christian to understand predestination as a divine unilateral pre-determination of individuals' eternal destinies independently of human choice, although his prior Manichaean sect did teach this concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Widengren |first1=Geo |title=Der Manichäismus |date=1977 |publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft |location=Darmstadt |pages=63–65, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stroumsa |first1=Gediliahu |title=Titus of Bostra and Alexander of Lycopolis: A Christian and a Platonic Refutation of Manichaean Dualism |journal=Neoplatonism and Gnosticism |date=1992 |volume=New York: University of New York Press. |pages=344–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Augustine's Conversion from Traditional Free Choice to &quot;Non-free' Free Will&quot;: A Comprehensive Methodology |date=2018 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck; Studien und Texte zu Antike und Christentum 111 |location=Tübingen |isbn=978-3161557538 |pages=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Oort |first1=Johannes |title=Manichaean Christians in Augustine's Life and Work |journal=History and Religious Culture |date=2010 |volume=90 |page=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Protestant theologians, such as [[Justo L. González]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt;{{rp|44}} and [[Bengt Hägglund]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hägglund 2007 139–140&quot;/&gt; interpret Augustine's teaching that grace is [[irresistible grace|irresistible]], results in conversion, and leads to [[perseverance of the saints|perseverance]].

In ''On Rebuke and Grace'' (''De correptione et gratia''), Augustine wrote: &quot;And what is written, that He wills all men to be saved, while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings of mine; but here I will say one thing: He wills all men to be saved, is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Augustine of Hippo&quot;/&gt;

====Sacramental theology====
[[File:Vittore carpaccio, visione di sant'agostino 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''[[St. Augustine in His Study (Carpaccio)|St. Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], 1502]]

Also in reaction against the Donatists, Augustine developed a distinction between the &quot;regularity&quot; and &quot;validity&quot; of the [[sacrament]]s. Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church, while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular. Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church. On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of [[Cyprian]], who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; Augustine taught that sacraments administered outside the Catholic Church, though true sacraments, avail nothing. However, he also stated that baptism, while it does not confer any grace when done outside the Church, does confer grace as soon as one is received into the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=of Hippo|first=St. Augustine|title=St. Augustine's Writings Against The Manichaeans And Against The Donatists: eBook Edition|year= 2012|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=9783849621094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], saying that Christ's statement, &quot;This is my body&quot; referred to the bread he carried in his hands,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance he stated that &quot;He [Jesus] walked here in the same flesh, and gave us the same flesh to be eaten unto salvation. But no one eats that flesh unless first he adores it; and thus it is discovered how such a footstool of the Lord's feet is adored; and not only do we not sin by adoring, we do sin by not adoring.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jurgens |first1=William |title=The Faith of the Early Fathers Vol 3 |date=June 1979 |publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0814610213 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rkvLsueY_DwC |accessdate=25 December 2019 |chapter=Ch. 1479a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless in some of his writings, Augustine expressed a symbolic view of the Eucharist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = J.H. Srawley | title = St. Ambrose on the Sacraments and on the Mysteries |year= 1950| publisher= S.P.C.K.| place = London | pages =39 | others = Thompson, T. transl}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in his work ''[[On Christian Doctrine]]'', Augustine referred to the Eurcharist as a &quot;figure&quot; and a &quot;sign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine,'' Book II, Chapter 3; Book III, Chapter 9; Book III, Chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Against the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]. About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position. He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was shared by many early Christians. However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the [[Apocalypse]], may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Astrology====
Augustine's contemporaries often believed [[astrology]] to be an exact and genuine science. Its practitioners were regarded as true men of learning and called ''mathemathici''. Astrology played a prominent part in Manichaean doctrine, and Augustine himself was attracted by their books in his youth, being particularly fascinated by those who claimed to foretell the future. Later, as a bishop, he used to warn that one should avoid astrologers who combine science and [[horoscope]]s. (Augustine's term &quot;mathematici&quot;, meaning &quot;astrologers&quot;, is sometimes mistranslated as &quot;mathematicians&quot;.) According to Augustine, they were not genuine students of [[Hipparchus]] or [[Eratosthenes]] but &quot;common swindlers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Augustine the Bishop.

====Epistemology====
[[Epistemology|Epistemological]] concerns shaped Augustine's intellectual development. His early dialogues [''Contra academicos'' (386) and ''De Magistro'' (389)], both written shortly after his conversion to Christianity, reflect his engagement with sceptical arguments and show the development of his doctrine of [[divine illumination]]. The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays an active and regular part in human perception (as opposed to God designing the human mind to be reliable consistently, as in, for example, Descartes' idea of clear and distinct perceptions) and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents. According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of [[sense perception]]. It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last=Mendelson| first=Michael| title=Saint Augustine| url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/augustine/| encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=21 December 2012| date=2000-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII.6.9), and developed what has come to be a standard solution: the argument from analogy to other minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Matthews, Gareth B. |title=Thought's ego in Augustine and Descartes| url=https://archive.org/details/thoughtsegoinaug00matt | url-access=registration | isbn=978-0801427756| publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Plato and other earlier philosophers, Augustine recognized the centrality of [[Philosophical problems of testimony|testimony]] to human knowledge and argued that what others tell us can provide knowledge even if we don't have independent reasons to believe their testimonial reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=King| first=Peter| author2=Nathan Ballantyne| title=Augustine on Testimony| journal=[[Canadian Journal of Philosophy]]| year=2009| volume=39| issue=2| doi=10.1353/cjp.0.0045| url=http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| page=195| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911164130/http://www.canadianjournalofphilosophy.com/PDFs/cjp39-2--195-214--Ballantyne-King.pdf| archivedate=11 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Just war====
{{See also|Just war theory}}
Augustine asserted that Christians should be [[pacifists]] as a personal, philosophical stance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html &quot;A Time For War?&quot;] ''Christianity Today'' (2001-01-09). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defence of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine coined the phrase in his work ''The City of God''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo].

====Free will====
Included in Augustine's earlier [[theodicy]] is the claim that God created humans and angels as rational beings possessing [[free will]]. Free will was not intended for sin, meaning it is not equally predisposed to both good and evil. A will defiled by sin is not considered as &quot;free&quot; as it once was because it is bound by material things, which could be lost or be difficult to part with, resulting in unhappiness.

The [[Catholic Church]] considers Augustine's teaching to be consistent with free will.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceteach&quot;/&gt; He often said that anyone can be saved if they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceteach&quot;/&gt; While God knows who will and won't be saved, with no possibility for the latter to be saved in their lives, this knowledge represents God's perfect knowledge of how humans will freely choose their destinies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceteach&quot;&gt;Portalié, Eugène.

Retrieved 30 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 412 CE, Augustine exchanged the traditional Christian defense of divine foreknowledge of human free will choices to explain predestination for a more Stoic and Gnostic/Manichaean view of deterministic predestination wherein the will was not free except to sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Augustine's Conversion from Traditional Free Choice to &quot;Non-free Free Will&quot;: A Comprehensive Methodology ''in the series Studien und Texte zu Antike und Christentum 111''|date=2018 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen, Germany |isbn=978-3161557538 |pages=286–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Ken |title=The Foundation of Augustinian–Calvinism |date=2019 |publisher=Regula Fidei Press |pages=5–18, 55–80, 120 |isbn=9781082800351 |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology, morals and ethics===

====Slavery====
Augustine led many clergy under his authority at Hippo to free their slaves &quot;as an act of piety&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, &quot;Of the Work of Monks&quot;, p. 25, Vol. 3, ''Nicene &amp; Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986&lt;/ref&gt; He boldly wrote a letter urging the emperor to set up a new law against slave traders and was very much concerned about the sale of children. Christian emperors of his time for 25 years had permitted sale of children, not because they approved of the practice, but as a way of preventing [[infanticide]] when parents were unable to care for a child. Augustine noted that the tenant farmers in particular were driven to hire out or to sell their children as a means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;The Saints, Pauline Books &amp; Media, Daughters of St. Paul, Editions du Signe (1998), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''The City of God'', he presents the development of slavery as a product of sin and as contrary to God's divine plan. He wrote that God &quot;did not intend that this rational creature, who was made in his image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation – not man over man, but man over the beasts&quot;. Thus he wrote that righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle, not kings over men. &quot;The condition of slavery is the result of sin&quot;, he declared.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''The City of God'', Ch. 15, p. 411, Vol. II, ''Nicene &amp; Post-Nicene Fathers'', Eerdman's, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Reprinted 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The City of God'', Augustine wrote he felt that the existence of slavery was a punishment for the existence of sin, even if an individual enslaved person committed no sin meriting punishment. He wrote: &quot;Slavery is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120119.htm|title=Church Fathers: City of God, Book XIX (St. Augustine)|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that slavery did more harm to the slave owner than the enslaved person himself: &quot;the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Augustine proposes as a solution to sin a type of cognitive reimagining of one's situation, where slaves &quot;may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love,&quot; until the end of the world eradicated slavery for good: &quot;until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

====Jews====
Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely &quot;Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law&quot; (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at &quot;the end of time&quot;, argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33–35, {{ISBN|0752417703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews &quot;survive but not thrive&quot; (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example)&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James (2002) ''Constantine's Sword''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. {{ISBN|978-0618219087}}. p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1864878,00.html Paula Fredriksen, interviewed by David Van Biema, &quot;Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?&quot;]. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexuality====
For Augustine, the evil of sexual immorality was not in the sexual act itself, but rather in the emotions that typically accompany it. In ''On Christian Doctrine'' Augustine contrasts love, which is enjoyment on account of God, and lust, which is not on account of God.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''On Christian Doctrine'', 3.37&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine claims that, following the Fall, sexual passion has become necessary for copulation (as required to stimulate male erection), sexual passion is an evil result of the Fall, and therefore, evil must inevitably accompany sexual intercourse (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.19). Therefore, following the Fall, even marital sex carried out merely to procreate the species inevitably perpetuates evil (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.27; ''A Treatise against Two Letters of the Pelagians'' 2.27). For Augustine, proper love exercises a denial of selfish pleasure and the subjugation of corporeal desire to God. The only way to avoid evil caused by sexual intercourse is to take the &quot;better&quot; way (''Confessions'' 8.2) and abstain from marriage (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 1.31). Sex within marriage is not, however, for Augustine a sin, although necessarily producing the evil of sexual passion. Based on the same logic, Augustine also declared the pious virgins raped during the sack of Rome to be innocent because they did not intend to sin nor enjoy the act.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russel|Russell]], p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book I, Ch. 16, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Fall, Augustine believed that sex was a passionless affair, &quot;just like many a laborious work accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat&quot;; the penis would have been engorged for sexual intercourse &quot;simply by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence&quot; (''On marriage and concupiscence'' 2.29; cf. ''City of God'' 14.23). After the Fall, by contrast, the penis cannot be controlled by mere will, subject instead to both unwanted impotence and involuntary erections: &quot;Sometimes the urge arises unwanted; sometimes, on the other hand, it forsakes the eager lover, and desire grows cold in the body while burning in the mind... It arouses the mind, but it does not follow through what it has begun and arouse the body also&quot; (''City of God'' 14.16).

Augustine believed that Adam and Eve had both already chosen in their hearts to disobey God's command not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge before Eve took the fruit, ate it, and gave it to Adam.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', 14.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, E. ed. (1996) ''St. Augustine on Marriage and Sexuality''. Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Augustine did not believe that Adam was any less guilty of sin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1484/J.RA.5.102318|author=Clark, E.|title='Adam's Only Companion': Augustine and the Early Christian Debate on Marriage|journal=Recherches Augustiniennes|volume=21 |year=1986|pages= 139–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Augustine praises women and their role in society and in the Church. In his ''Tractates on the Gospel of John'', Augustine, commenting on the [[Samaritan]] woman from John 4:1–42, uses the woman as a figure of the Church in agreement with the New Testament teaching that the Church is the bride of Christ. &quot;Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Eph: 5, 25)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pedagogy====
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - St Augustin dans son cabinet de travail.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Augustine in His Cell (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1494, [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]
Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education. A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education. His ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas. In the last years of his life Augustine wrote his ''Retractationes'' (''Retractations''), reviewing his writings and improving specific texts. Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of &quot;retractationes&quot; may be &quot;reconsiderations&quot;. Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Augustine learned. Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding, meaning, and truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development, and change.&lt;ref name=mccloskey/&gt;

Augustine was a strong advocate of [[critical thinking]] skills. Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important. His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others. Augustine believed that dialectic is the best means for learning and that this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students. Augustine's dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners.&lt;ref name=mccloskey&gt;McCloskey, Gary N. (April 2008) [http://www.merrimack.edu/academics/augustinian_pedagogy/documents/encountering_0408.pdf Encounters of Learning: Saint Augustine on Education], Saint Augustine Institute for Learning and Teaching, [[Merrimack College]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:
* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;
* the student who has had no education; and
* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated.

If a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between &quot;having words and having understanding&quot; and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.

Under the influence of [[Bede]], [[Alcuin]], and [[Rabanus Maurus]], ''De catechizandis rudibus'' came to exercise an important role in the education of clergy at the monastic schools, especially from the eighth century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Howie, G. (1969) ''Educational Theory and Practice in St. Augustine'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, pp. 150–153&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience. Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching. He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students. The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying. The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts. Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline.

==Works==
{{main|Augustine of Hippo bibliography}}
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine'' painting by Antonio Rodríguez]]
Augustine was one of the most prolific Latin authors in terms of surviving works, and the list of his works consists of more than one hundred separate titles.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, F.A. and Sinclair, T.A. (1931) ''A History of Later Latin Literature'', Dawsons of Pall Mall, London, pp. 56 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; They include [[apologetics|apologetic]] works against the heresies of the [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Donatists]], [[Manichaeans]] and [[Pelagians]]; texts on Christian [[doctrine]], notably ''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (''On Christian Doctrine''); [[exegesis|exegetical]] works such as commentaries on [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the [[Psalms]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul's]] [[Letter to the Romans]]; many [[sermon]]s and [[Letter (message)|letters]]; and the ''Retractationes'', a review of his earlier works which he wrote near the end of his life.

Apart from those, Augustine is probably best known for his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', which is a personal account of his earlier life, and for ''De civitate Dei'' (''[[The City of God]]'', consisting of 22 books), which he wrote to restore the confidence of his fellow Christians, which was badly shaken by the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Visigoths]] in 410. His ''[[On the Trinity]]'', in which he developed what has become known as the 'psychological analogy' of the [[Trinity]], is also considered to be among his masterpieces, and arguably of more doctrinal importance that the ''Confessions'' or the ''City of God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 43705747|title = St Augustine on the Trinity—I|journal = Life of the Spirit |volume = 15|issue = 180|pages = 540–548|last1 = Hill|first1 = Edmund|year = 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote ''On Free Choice of the Will'' (''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|De libero arbitrio]]''), addressing why God gives humans free will that can be used for evil.

==Influence==
[[File:Vergós Group - Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Saint Augustine Disputing with the Heretics'' painting by Vergós Group]]

In both his philosophical and theological reasoning, Augustine was greatly influenced by [[Stoicism]], [[Platonism]] and [[Neoplatonism]], particularly by the work of [[Plotinus]], author of the ''[[Enneads]]'', probably through the mediation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Gaius Marius Victorinus|Victorinus]] (as [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued). Although he later abandoned Some Neoplatonist Concepts, some ideas are still visible in his early writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russel|Russell]], Book II, Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt; His early and influential writing on the [[Will (philosophy)|human will]], a central topic in [[ethics]], would become a focus for later philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. He was also influenced by the works of [[Virgil]] (known for his teaching on language), and [[Cicero]] (known for his teaching on argument).&lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt;

===In philosophy===
[[Philosopher]] [[Bertrand Russell]] was impressed by Augustine's meditation on the nature of time in the ''Confessions'', comparing it favourably to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s version of the view that time is subjective.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russel|Russell]], pp. 352–353.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic theologians generally subscribe to Augustine's belief that God exists [[eternity|outside of time]] in the &quot;eternal present&quot;; that time only exists within the created universe because only in space is time discernible through motion and change. His meditations on the nature of time are closely linked to his consideration of the human ability of [[memory]]. [[Frances Yates]] in her 1966 study ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' argues that a brief passage of the ''Confessions'', 10.8.12, in which Augustine writes of walking up a flight of stairs and entering the vast fields of memory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/hippo/text10.html#TB10C8S12 Confessiones Liber X: commentary on 10.8.12] ''(in Latin)''&lt;/ref&gt; clearly indicates that the ancient Romans were aware of how to use explicit spatial and architectural metaphors as a [[mnemonic]] technique for organizing large amounts of information.

Augustine's philosophical method, especially demonstrated in his ''Confessions'', had continuing influence on Continental philosophy throughout the 20th century. His descriptive approach to intentionality, memory, and language as these phenomena are experienced within consciousness and time anticipated and inspired the insights of modern [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=de Paulo| first=Craig J.N.| title=The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology| year=2006| publisher=[[The Edwin Mellen Press]] | isbn=978-0773456891}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Husserl]] writes: &quot;The analysis of time-consciousness is an age-old crux of descriptive psychology and theory of knowledge. The first thinker to be deeply sensitive to the immense difficulties to be found here was Augustine, who laboured almost to despair over this problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1964) ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Heidegger]] refers to Augustine's descriptive philosophy at several junctures in his influential work ''[[Being and Time]]''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For example, Heidegger's articulations of how &quot;Being-in-the-world&quot; is described through thinking about ''seeing'': &quot;The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''.&quot; Heidegger then quotes the''Confessions'': &quot;Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing... We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'&quot;. ''Being and Time'', Trs. Macquarrie &amp; Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] began her philosophical writing with a dissertation on Augustine's concept of love, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin'' (1929): &quot;The young Arendt attempted to show that the philosophical basis for ''vita socialis'' in Augustine can be understood as residing in neighbourly love, grounded in his understanding of the common origin of humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Chiba, Shin| title= Hannah Arendt on Love and the Political: Love, Friendship, and Citizenship| journal=The Review of Politics| volume= 57| issue= 3 | year=1995| pages= 505–535 [507]| jstor=1408599| doi=10.1017/S0034670500019720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Bethke Elshtain in ''Augustine and the Limits of Politics'' tried to associate Augustine with Arendt in their concept of evil: &quot;Augustine did not see evil as glamorously demonic but rather as absence of good, something which paradoxically is really nothing. Arendt ... envisioned even the extreme evil which produced [[the Holocaust]] as merely banal [in ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]''].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Tinder, Glenn| journal=[[American Political Science Review]]| volume= 91| issue= 2| year=1997| title=Augustine and the Limits of Politics, by Jean Bethke Elshtain| pages= 432–433| url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmPoliticalScienceRev-1997jun-00432| doi=10.2307/2952372| last2=Elshtain| first2=Jean Bethke| jstor=2952372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine's philosophical legacy continues to influence contemporary critical theory through the contributions and inheritors of these 20th-century figures. Seen from a historical perspective, there are three main perspectives on the political thought of Augustine: first, political Augustinianism; second, Augustinian [[political theology]]; and third, Augustinian political theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Woo, B.

===In theology===
{{Scholastic Philosophy}}
[[Thomas Aquinas]] was influenced heavily by Augustine. On the topic of original sin, Aquinas proposed a more optimistic view of man than that of Augustine in that his conception leaves to the reason, will, and passions of fallen man their natural powers even after the Fall, without &quot;supernatural gifts&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1203}} While in his pre-Pelagian writings Augustine taught that Adam's guilt as transmitted to his descendants much enfeebles, though does not destroy, the freedom of their will, Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin affirmed that Original Sin completely destroyed liberty (see [[total depravity]]).&lt;ref name=Cross/&gt;{{rp|1200–1204}}

According to [[Leo Ruickbie]], Augustine's arguments against [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], differentiating it from miracle, were crucial in the early Church's fight against [[paganism]] and became a central thesis in the later denunciation of witches and [[witchcraft]]. According to Professor Deepak Lal, Augustine's vision of the heavenly city has influenced the secular projects and traditions of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], [[Marxism]], [[Freudianism]] and eco-fundamentalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deepak Lal&quot;&gt;Lal, D. (March 2002) [http://www.econ.ucla.edu/workingpapers/wp812.pdf &quot;Morality and Capitalism: Learning from the Past&quot;]. Working Paper Number 812, Department of Economics, [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt rely heavily on Augustine's thought, particularly ''The City of God'', in their book of political philosophy ''Empire''.

Augustine has influenced many modern-day theologians and authors such as [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]. [[Hannah Arendt]], an influential 20th-century political theorist, wrote her doctoral dissertation in philosophy on Augustine, and continued to rely on his thought throughout her career. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] extensively quotes Augustine in ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' for his approach to language, both admiringly, and as a sparring partner to develop his own ideas, including an extensive opening passage from the ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Contemporary linguists have argued that Augustine has significantly influenced the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did not 'invent' the modern discipline of [[semiotics]], but rather built upon [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and Neoplatonist knowledge from the Middle Ages, via an Augustinian connection: &quot;as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Munteanu, E. (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IWtCAAAAQBAJ &quot;On the Object-Language / Metalanguage Distinction in Saint Augustine's Works. De Dialectica and de Magistro&quot;], p. 65 in Cram, D., Linn, A.R., &amp; Nowak, E. (eds.). ''History of Linguistics: Volume 2: From Classical to Contemporary Linguistics''. [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]. {{ISBN|978-9027283818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiographical book ''Milestones'', [[Pope Benedict XVI]] claims Augustine as one of the deepest influences in his thought.

===Oratorio===
[[File:Jaume Huguet - Consecration of Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Consecration of Saint Augustine]]'' by [[Jaume Huguet]]]]

Much of Augustine's conversion is dramatized in the oratorio ''La conversione di Sant'Agostino'' (1750) composed by [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]. The libretto for this oratorio, written by [[Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria]], draws upon the influence of [[Pietro Metastasio|Metastasio]] (the finished libretto having been edited by him) and is based on an earlier five-act play ''Idea perfectae conversionis dive Augustinus'' written by the Jesuit priest [[Franz Neumayr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7vpR97_-VIC&amp;lpg=PA98|title=A History of the Oratorio|last=Smither|first=Howard E.|date=1977|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0807812747}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the libretto Augustine's mother Monica is presented as a prominent character that is worried that Augustine might not convert to Christianity. As Dr. Andrea Palent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La conversione Di Sant' Agostino|last=Hasse|first=Johann Adolf|publisher=Capriccio Digital|year=1993|isbn=|location=CD Booklet: Marcus Creed's recording of La conversion di Sant' Agostino with the RIAS Kammerchor; 10 389/90.|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; says: {{Quote|text=Maria Antonia Walpurgis revised the five-part Jesuit drama into a two-part oratorio liberty in which she limits the subject to the conversion of Augustine and his submission to the will of God. To this was added the figure of the mother, Monica, so as to let the transformation appear by experience rather than the dramatic artifice of deus ex machina.|sign=|source=}}Throughout the oratorio Augustine shows his willingness to turn to God, but the burden of the act of conversion weighs heavily on him. This is displayed by Hasse through extended recitative passages.
