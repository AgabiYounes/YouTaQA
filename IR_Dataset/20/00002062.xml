Sailing for Portugal around 1501–1502, Vespucci demonstrated that [[Brazil]] and the [[West Indies]] were not Asia's eastern outskirts (as initially conjectured from [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus' voyages]]) but a [[Americas|separate continent]] described as the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;. In 1507, the new continent was [[Naming of the Americas|named America]] after the Latin version of Vespucci's first name.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'' &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; and Room, Adrian (2004), ''Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for over 5000 natural features, countries, capitals, territories, cities and historic sights''; the Americas are believed to have derived their name from the feminized Latin version of his first name.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rival explanations have been proposed; see  Arciniegas, Germán.

== Biography ==
[[File:Birthplace of Amerigo Vespucci · HHWIX645.jpg|alt=Drawing of an old stone building|thumb|Vespucci's birthplace]]

Vespucci was born on March 9, 1454 in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], an Italian city-state and a center of Renaissance art and learning. He was the third son of Nastagio Vespucci, a Florentine [[notary]] for the Money-Changers Guild, and Lisa di Giovanni Mini.&lt;ref name=formisano/&gt; The family resided in the District of Santa Lucia d'Ognissanti along with other families of the Vespucci clan. Earlier generations of Vespucci had funded a family chapel in the Ognissanti church; and the nearby Hospital of San Giovanni di Dio was founded by Simone di Piero Vespucci in 1380. Amerigo's immediate family was not especially prosperous but they were politically well-connected. Amerigo's grandfather, also named Amerigo Vespucci, served a total of 36 years as the chancellor of the Florentine government, known as the ''[[Signoria of Florence| Signoria]]''; and Nastagio also served in the ''Signoria'' and in other guild offices.&lt;ref name=formisano/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pohl&gt;Pohl 1944&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, the Vespucci's had good relations with [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the [[de-facto]] ruler of Florence.&lt;ref name=Armesto&gt;Fernández-Armesto 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amerigo's two older brothers, Antonio and Girolamo, were sent to the [[University of Pisa]] for their education; Antonio followed his father to became a notary, while Girolamo entered the Church and joined the [[Knights Templar]] in Rhodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl&quot; /&gt; Amerigo's career path seemed less certain; instead of following his brothers to the university, he remained in Florence and was tutored by his uncle, Giorgio Antonio Vespucci, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] in [[San Marco, Florence|the monastery of San Marco]]. Fortunately for Amerigo, his uncle was one of the most celebrated humanist scholars in Florence at the time and provided him with a broad education in literature, philosophy, rhetoric and Latin. He was also introduced to geography and astronomy, subjects that played an essential part in his career. Amerigo's later writings demonstrated a familiarity with the work of the classic Greek cosmographers, [[Ptolemy]] and [[Strabo]], and the more recent work of Florentine astronomer [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armesto&quot; /&gt;

In 1478, Guido Antonio Vespucci led a Florentine diplomatic mission to Paris and invited his younger cousin, Amerigo Vespucci, to join him. Amerigo's role is not clear but it was likely as an attache or private secretary. Along the way they had business in Bologna, Milan, and Lyon. Their objective in Paris was to obtain French support for Florence's war with Naples. [[Louis XI]] was noncommittal and the diplomatic mission returned to Florence in 1481 with little to show for their efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armesto&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arciniegas&quot; /&gt;

After his return from Paris, Amerigo worked for a time with his father and continued his studies in science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl&quot; /&gt; In 1482, when his father died, Amerigo went to work for [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], head of a junior branch of the Medici family. Although Amerigo was ten years older, they had been schoolmates under the tutelage of Giorgio Antonio Vespucci. Amerigo served first as a household manager and then gradually took on increasing responsibilities, handling various business dealings for the family both at home and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armesto&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, he continued to show an interest in geography, at one point buying an expensive map made by the master cartographer [[Gabriel de Vallseca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pohl&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arciniegas&quot; /&gt; 

In 1488, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco became dissatisfied with his Seville business agent, Tomasso Capponi. He dispatched Vespucci to investigate the situation and provide an assessment of a suggested replacement, Florentine merchant Gianotto Berardi. Vespucci's findings have been lost but Capponi returned to Florence around this time and Berardi took over the Medici business in Seville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arciniegas&quot; /&gt; In addition to managing Medici's trade in Seville, Berardi had his own business in African slavery and [[ship chandler| ship chandlery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armesto&quot; /&gt;

By 1492, Vespucci had settled permanently in Seville. His motivations for leaving Florence are unclear; he continued to transact some business on behalf of his Medici patrons but more and more he became involved with Berardi's other activities, most notably providing investment and support for Christopher Columbus and his voyages of discovery. Barardi invested half a million ''maravedis'' in Columbus' first voyage and he won another contract to provide Columbus's second fleet. However, profits proved to be elusive. In 1495, Berardi signed a contract with the crown to send 12 resupply ships to Hispaniola but then died unexpectedly in December without completing the terms of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto 2007 pp 47-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brinkbaumer 2004 pp 104-109&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespucci was the executor of Berardi's will, collecting debts and paying outstanding obligations for the firm. Afterwards he was left owing 140,000 ''maravedies''. He continued to provisions ships bound for the West Indies but his opportunities were diminishing; Columbus's expeditions were not providing the hoped-for profits and his patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco Medici, was using other Florentine agents for his business in Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto 2007 pp 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = markham&gt;C.R. Markham (1894) &quot;Introduction&quot;, in ''The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci and other documents illustrative of his career''. London: Hakluyt.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after he settled in Seville, Vespucci married a Spanish woman, Maria Cerezo. Very little is known about her; Vespucci's will refers to her as the daughter of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. Historian Fernández-Armesto speculates that she may have been the illegitimate offspring of celebrated military leader, the [[Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba |&quot;Grand Captain&quot;]], a connection that would have been very useful to Vespucci. She was an active participant in his business and held power of attorney for Vespucci when he was away.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto 2007 pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1490s Vespucci participated in two voyages to the New World that are well-documented in the historical record. Two others have been alleged but they are problematical. In 1499 Vespucci joined an expedition licensed by Spain and led by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] as fleet commander and [[Juan de la Cosa]] as chief navigator. Their intention was to explore the coast of a new landmass found by Columbus on his third voyage and in particular investigate a rich source of pearls that Columbus had reported. Vespucci and his backers financed two of the four ships in the small fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vigneras |first1=Louis-Andre |title=The Discovery of South America and the Andalusian Voyages |date=1976 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pp=47-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role on the voyage is not clear. Writing later about his experience, Vespucci gave the impression that he had a leadership role but that is unlikely because of his inexperience. Years later, Ojeda recalled that Vespucci was one of his pilots on the expedition and he may also have served as a commercial representative on behalf of the fleet's investors.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto 2007 pp 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expeditions ==
[[File:Amerigo Vespucci Uffizzi Florence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Statue in a niche|Statue of Vespucci outside the Uffizi in Florence]]
Vespucci's expeditions became known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him were published between 1502 and 1503.&lt;ref name=S&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-waldseemuller-map-charting-the-new-world-148815355/|title=The Waldseemüller Map: Charting the New World|author=Lester, Toby|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1507, [[Martin Waldseemüller]] produced a world map on which he named the new continent [[Americas|America]] after the feminine Latin version of Vespucci's first name.&lt;ref name=S/&gt; In an accompanying book, Waldseemüller published one of the Vespucci accounts; this led to criticism that Vespucci was trying to usurp [[Christopher Columbus]]' glory. The 18th-century rediscovery of other letters by Vespucci has led to the view that the early published accounts (notably the [[Naming of the Americas#Amerigo Vespucci|Soderini Letter]]) could be fabrications, not by Vespucci but by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roukema|first=E.|date=1962|title=The Mythical &quot;First Voyage&quot; of the &quot;Soderini Letter&quot;|jstor=1150303|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=16|pages=70–75|doi=10.1080/03085696208592202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical role ==
Two letters attributed to Vespucci were published during his lifetime. ''Mundus Novus'' (''New World'') was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter sent from [[Lisbon]] to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici describing a voyage to South America in 1501–1502. It was published in late 1502 or early 1503 and reprinted and distributed in a number of European countries.&lt;ref name=formisano&gt;Formisano, Luciano (Ed.) (1992). ''Letters from a New World: Amerigo Vespucci's Discovery of America''. New York: Marsilio. {{ISBN|0-941419-62-2}}. Pp. xix–xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle isole nuovamente trovate in quattro suoi viaggi'' (''Letter of Amerigo Vespucci concerning the isles newly discovered on his four voyages''), known as ''Lettera al Soderini'' or just ''Lettera'', was a letter in Italian addressed to [[Piero Soderini]], published in 1504 or 1505. It was a purported account of four voyages to the Americas made by Vespucci between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in 1507 in ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'' as ''Quattuor Americi Vespucij navigationes'' (''Four Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci''), a book on cosmography and geography.&lt;ref name=formisano/&gt; 

During the 18th century, three unpublished letters were rediscovered from Vespucci to Pierfrancesco de' Medici. One describes a voyage made in 1499–1500 which corresponds with the second of the four reported voyages. Another was written from [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] in 1501 in the early part of the third voyages, before crossing the Atlantic. The third letter was sent from Lisbon after the completion of that voyage.&lt;ref name=formisano /&gt; 

Several scholars now believe that Vespucci did not write the two published letters in the form in which they circulated during his lifetime. They suggest that the two letters in circulation were fabrications, although based on genuine letters by Vespucci. The publication and widespread circulation of the letters may have led Waldseemüller to name the new continent America on his 1507 world map in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]. Vespucci used a Latinized form of his name (Americus Vespucius) in his Latin writings, which Waldseemüller used as a base for the new name in its feminine form. According to the book accompanying the map, &quot;I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part, after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerige, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women&quot;. Vespucci may not have been aware that Waldseemüller named the continent after him.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The two disputed letters say that Vespucci made four voyages to America; at most, two can be verified by other sources. It is disputed as to when Vespucci first visited the mainland; according to historians such as [[Germán Arciniegas]]&lt;ref name = Arciniegas&gt;Germán Arciniegas, ''Amerigo and the New World : The Life &amp; Times of Amerigo Vespucci'', translated by Harriet de Onís, Octagon (1978) {{ISBN|0-374-90280-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabriel Camargo Pérez, his first voyage was made in June 1497 with Spanish pilot [[Juan de la Cosa]].

On March 22, 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] made Vespucci chief navigator of Spain at a large salary&lt;ref&gt;Ober, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned him to found a school of navigation to standardize and modernize navigation techniques used by Iberian sea captains exploring the world. Vespucci developed a rudimentary but fairly accurate method of determining longitude, which was improved by more accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]].&lt;ref&gt;Vespucci, Amerigo. &quot;Letter from Seville to Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici, 1500.&quot; Pohl, Frederick J. '''Amerigo Vespucci: Pilot Major'''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1945. 76–90. Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespucci's historical importance may rest more in his letters (whether or not he wrote them all) than in his discoveries. From these letters, the European public first learned about the newly discovered continents of the Americas; their existence became generally known throughout Europe within a few years of the letters' publication. According to Vespucci:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning my return from those new regions which we found and explored… we may rightly call a new world. Because our ancestors had no knowledge of them, and it will be a matter wholly new to all those who hear about them, for this transcends the view held by our ancients, inasmuch as most of them hold that there is no continent to the south beyond the equator, but only the sea which they named the Atlantic and if some of them did aver that a continent there was, they denied with abundant argument that it was a habitable land. But that this their opinion is false and utterly opposed to the truth… my last voyage has made manifest; for in those southern parts I have found a continent more densely peopled and abounding in animals than our Europe Asia or Africa, and, in addition, a climate milder and more delightful than in any other region known to us, as you shall learn in the following account.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/mundusnovuslette00vesp Mundus Novus: Letter to Lorenzo Pietro Di Medici], by Amerigo Vespucci; translated by George Tyler Northrup, Princeton University Press, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Vespucci's first and fourth voyages may have been fabricated, his second and third voyages are certain{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}.{{ref label|5th|b|b}}

=== First voyage ===
A letter written to [[Piero Soderini]] and published in 1504, purports to be an account by Vespucci of a visit to the New World on which he left Spain in May 1497 and returned in October 1498. Some modern scholars{{ref label|5th|b|b /}} doubt that the voyage took place, however, and consider the letter a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html|title=Life of Amerigo Vespucci|publisher=Millersville.edu|accessdate=2010-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328011335/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/canaday.html|archivedate=2010-03-28|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whoever wrote the letter makes numerous observations about native customs, including the use of [[hammock]]s and [[sweat lodge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1497vespucci%2Damerica.html|title=Account of alleged 1497 voyage|publisher=Fordham.edu|date=|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second voyage ===
In 1499, Vespucci joined an expedition in the service of Spain with [[Alonso de Ojeda]] as fleet commander and [[Juan de la Cosa]] as chief navigator. Vespucci and his backers financed two of the three ships in the small fleet. Their intention was to explore the coast of a new landmass found by Columbus on his third voyage. Although Columbus still thought he had reached Asia, this landmass would turn out to be a new continent, South America. After reaching the coast of present-day [[Guyana]], Vespucci and Ojeda separated. Vespucci sailed south, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] and reaching 3° south before turning around. Vespucci retraced his route, passing [[Trinidad]] and the [[Orinoco River]] before returning to Spain via [[Hispaniola]]. It is unclear whether he ever rejoined Ojeda after their initial separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vigneras |first1=Louis-Andre |title=The Discovery of South America and the Andalusian Voyages |date=1976 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter, to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, says that Vespucci determined his longitude celestially on August 23, 1499 on this voyage. The claim may be fraudulent, however, which could cast doubt on the letter's credibility.{{cn|date=March 2019}}

=== Third voyage (''Letter to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici'') ===
[[File:Amerigo Vespucci (with turban).jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving of Vespucci with inscription|upright=0.9|Engraving of Vespucci by [[Crispijn van de Passe]] which calls him the &quot;discoverer and conqueror of Brazilian land&quot;]]
Vespucci's last certain voyage was led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] in 1501–1502 in the service of [[Portugal]]. Departing from [[Lisbon]], the fleet sailed first to [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] and met two of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]'s ships returning from [[India]]. In a letter from Cape Verde, Vespucci said that he hoped to visit the same lands that Álvares Cabral had explored (suggesting an intention to sail west to Asia as on the 1499–1500 voyage).&lt;ref name=OGorman&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Gorman | first = Edmundo | authorlink = Edmundo O'Gorman | title = The Invention of America | publisher = Indiana University Press | year = 1961 | pages = 106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching the coast of [[Brazil]], they sailed south along the coast of [[South America]] to the [[Rio de Janeiro]] bay. If Vespucci's account is correct, he reached the latitude of [[Patagonia]] before turning back; this seems doubtful, however, since his account does not mention the broad estuary of the [[Río de la Plata]] which he would have seen if he had reached that far south. Portuguese maps of South America created after Coelho and Vespucci's voyage do not show any land south of present-day [[Cananéia]] (25° S), which may have been the southernmost extent of their voyages.

After the first half of the expedition, Vespucci mapped [[Alpha Centauri]], [[Beta Centauri]], the constellation [[Crux]], and the [[Coalsack Nebula]].&lt;ref&gt;Dekker, Elly (1990), ''Annals of Science'', vol. 47, pp. 535–543.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these stars had been known to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], gradual [[axial precession]] had lowered them beneath the [[Europe]]an horizon and they had been forgotten. Returning to Lisbon, Vespucci [[Amerigo Vespucci Letter from Seville|wrote in a letter from Seville]] to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] that the land masses they explored were much larger than anticipated and different from the Asia described by [[Ptolemy]] or [[Marco Polo]]; therefore, they must be a New World: a previously-unknown fourth continent in addition to Europe, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/amerigo-vespucci|title=Amerigo Vespucci|work=HISTORY|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fourth voyage ===
[[File:&quot;America&quot; (Engraving) Nova reperta (Speculum diuersarum imaginum speculatiuarum 1638).tif|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Engraving of Vespucci awakening a native woman|Vespucci awakens &quot;America&quot; in a 1638 [[Jan Galle]] engraving]]
Vespucci's fourth voyage, another expedition for the Portuguese crown down the east coast of Brazil, set out in May 1503 and returned in June 1504. Like his reported first voyage, Vespucci's fourth (and final) voyage is also disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The only source for this last voyage is the Soderini Letter;&lt;ref&gt;Markham, pp. 52–56&lt;/ref&gt; since several modern scholars dispute Vespucci's authorship of that letter, it is uncertain whether Vespucci undertook this trip.{{ref label|5th|b|b}} Portuguese documents confirm a voyage in 1503–04 by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (probably the same captain as the 1501 mapping expedition, Vespucci's third voyage), so it is possible that Vespucci went on this one as well. It is not independently confirmed that Vespucci was aboard, and there are difficulties with reported dates and details.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández-Armesto (2007: pp. 168–169).&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were controversial after Vespucci's death (particularly among supporters of Columbus, who believed that Columbus' achievement was being denigrated), and damaged Vespucci's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, pp. 96–97; Arciniegas (1955: p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;


== Personal life ==
Vespucci, a cousin of the husband of [[Simonetta Vespucci]], married Maria Cerezo. One of the few references to Maria is in a royal decree in 1512,{{ref label|6th|c|c}} giving her a lifetime pension of ten thousand [[maravedí]]s per year (deducted from the salary of Vespucci's successor).&lt;ref&gt;Ober, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic|wstitle=Amerigo Vespucci |first=Gustavo |last=Uzielli |volume=15 |inline=1 |prescript= |year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years ==
Soon after his return to Spain, Vespucci became a Spanish citizen. On March 22, 1508, he was made the country's [[pilot major]] by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in honor of his discoveries. Vespucci ran a school for navigators in Seville's [[Casa de Contratación]]. He died on February 22, 1512 at his home in [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QvP-m6EuU3UC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=amerigo+vespucci+death|title=Amerigo Vespucci: A Primary Source Biography|last=Hoogenboom|first=Lynn|date=2005-09-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4042-3037-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0eLn3I6iUtkC|title=Amerigo Vespucci|last=Donaldson-Forbes|first=Jeff|date=2002-01-01|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-5833-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
:{{note label|4th|a|a}}Europeans had long conceptualized the [[Afro-Eurasia]]n landmass as divided into the same three continents known today: [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. When [[cosmographer]]s realized that the [[New World]] was not connected to the [[Old World|Old]] (but before it was fully mapped), they considered the Americas a single, fourth continent.

:{{note label|5th|b|b}} The authenticity of Vespucci's authorship of the 1504 ''Mundus Novus'' and the 1505 ''Letter of Soderini'', the only two texts published during his lifetime, was questioned by Magnaghi (1924). He suggested that the Soderini letter was not written by Vespucci, but was cobbled together by unscrupulous Florentine publishers who combined several accounts – some from Vespucci, others from elsewhere. Magnaghi was the first to propose that only the second and third voyages were true (since they are corroborated in Vespucci's other manuscript letters), and the first and fourth voyages (only found in the Soderini letter) were fabricated by publishers. The later (1937) discovery of a corroborating Vespucci manuscript letter for the first voyage – the &quot;Ridolfi fragment&quot; (Formisiano, 1992: pp. 37–44) – means that only the fourth voyage is found in Soderini alone. The Magnaghi thesis has been a divisive factor in Vespucci scholarship.  It was accepted and popularized by Pohl (1944) and rejected by Arciniegas (1955), who posited that all four voyages were truthful.  Formisiano (1992) also rejects the Magnaghi thesis (acknowledging that publishers probably tampered with Vespucci's writings) and declares all four voyages genuine, but differs from Arciniegas in details (particularly the first voyage). Fernández-Armesto (2007: p.&amp;nbsp;128) calls the authenticity question &quot;inconclusive&quot;, and hypothesizes that the first voyage was probably another version of the second; the third is unassailable, and the fourth is probably true.
