'''Crandall University''' is a small Christian [[Liberal Arts]] university located in [[Moncton|Moncton, New Brunswick]], Canada. Crandall is operated by the [[Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada]].

==History==
The school was founded in 1949 under the name '''United Baptist Bible Training School''' (UBBTS), and served as both a [[secondary school]] and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist College''' (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.crandallu.ca/about-crandall/history/ |title=History |accessdate=March 26, 2019 |publisher= Crandall University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of [[Moncton]]'s central business district.

The institution moved to a new campus built on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was changed to '''Atlantic Baptist University''' (ABU), a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. In 2003, the ABU sports teams adopted the name ''The Blue Tide''. The institution was the first, and thus far only, [[English language|English]] university in Moncton.  The ''Atlantic Baptist University Act'' was passed by the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/FILE/56/2/Bill-64-e.htm |title=Atlantic Baptist University Act, 2008|publisher=Government of New Brunswick|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to '''Crandall University''' in honour of Rev. [[Joseph Crandall]], a pioneering Baptist minister in the maritime region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/08/21/nb-atlantic-baptist-university-crandall-557.html |title=Atlantic Baptist University changes name |publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the University name change, Crandall Athletics took on a new identity as &quot;The Crandall Chargers.&quot;

===Controversy===
In 2012, Crandall University came under public scrutiny for receiving municipal funds despite having an anti-gay hiring policy consistent with its denomination's tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=New Brunswick university under fire for anti-gay hiring policy |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/01/new_brunswick_university_under_fire_for_antigay_hiring_policy.html |date=June 1, 2012 |work=thestar.com |publisher=The [[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/05/31/nb-crandall-hiring-policy-205.html|title=Crandall University defends anti-gay hiring policy|date=May 31, 2012|work=cbc.ca|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the controversy erupted, the University opted to not apply for $150,000 in public funding that it had received annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Controversy_1&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/02/05/nb-crandall-university-funding-709.html |title=Crandall University drops request for city funding |newspaper= CBC.ca|date=February 5, 2013|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library and archives==
Crandall University houses the Baptist Heritage Center whose 300 artifacts preserve the material history of Atlantic Baptists, the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches, and its predecessor organizations. The collection and archives includes objects used in worship services, furniture, musical instruments, church building architecture pictures and printed material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crandall University |url=https://www.completeuniversityinfo.com/universities/north-america/canada/new-brunswick/moncton/crandall-university/ |website=completeuniversityinfo.com |accessdate=March 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
