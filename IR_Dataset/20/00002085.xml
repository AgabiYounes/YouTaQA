A largely [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking realm, Assyria was centred on the [[Tigris]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. The Assyrians came to rule powerful empires in several periods. Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian &quot;[[cradle of civilization]]&quot;, which included [[Sumer]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], and [[Babylonia]], Assyria reached the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] of 911 to 609 BC stretched from eastern [[Libya]] and [[Cyprus]] in the [[East Mediterranean]] to [[Iran]], and from present-day [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] in the [[Transcaucasia]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Albert Kirk Grayson 1972 108&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Assyrian Royal Inscriptions: Volume I |author=Albert Kirk Grayson |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz |location=Wiesbaden |year=1972 |page=108}} §716.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Assyria&quot; originates with the Assyrian state's original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur|Aššur]], which dates to c. 2600 BC – originally one of a number of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking city-states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were [[pastoral society|pastoral]] [[leader]]s. From the late 24th century BC, the Assyrians became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the Akkadian- and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from {{circa}} 2334 BC to 2154 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1964|pp=161–191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Assyrian Empire fell from power, the greater remaining part of Assyria formed a geopolitical region and [[province]] of other empires, although between the mid-2nd century BC and late 3rd century AD a patchwork of small independent Assyrian kingdoms arose in the form of [[Assur]], [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]], [[Beth Nuhadra]], [[Beth Garmai]] and [[Hatra]].

The region of Assyria fell under the successive control of the [[Median Empire]] of 678 to 549 BC, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of 550 to 330 BC, the [[Macedonian Empire]] (late 4th century BC), the [[Seleucid Empire]] of 312 to 63 BC, the [[Parthian Empire]] of 247 BC to 224 AD, the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Empire]] (from 116 to 118 AD) and the [[Sasanian Empire]] of 224 to 651 AD. The [[Arab]] [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest]] of the area in the mid-seventh century finally dissolved Assyria ([[Assuristan]]) as a single entity, after which the remnants of the [[Assyrian people]] (by now [[Christians]]) gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the [[Assyrian homeland]], surviving there to this day as an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parpola, Simo 2004&quot;&gt;Compare: {{cite journal |last=Parpola |first=Simo |date=2004 |title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times |journal=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies |url=http://jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |volume=18 |number=2 |quote=Disunited, dispersed in exile, and as dwindling minorities without full civil rights in their homelands, the Assyrians of today are in grave danger of total assimilation and extinction.[...] In order to survive as a nation, they must now unite under the Assyrian identity of their ancestors.

==Etymology==
Assyria was also sometimes known as [[Subartu]] and ''Azuhinum'' prior to the rise of the [[city-state]] of Ashur, after which it was [[Aššūrāyu]], and after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late seventh century AD variously as [[Achaemenid Assyria]], and also referenced as Atouria, [[Ator]], [[Hathor|Athor]], and sometimes as ''Syria'' which etymologically derives from Assyria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Y Odisho|first=George|title=The sound system of modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic)|year=1998|publisher=Harrowitz|isbn=978-3-447-02744-1|page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ON7BEtQvejcC&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=strabo%20atouria&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=strabo%20atouria&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Strabo]], ''Syria'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]), ''Assyria'' ([[Latin]]) and [[Asōristān]] (Middle Persian). &quot;Assyria&quot; can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the [[Assyrian people]] were (and still are) centered.

The [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] modern [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic-speaking]] [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christian ethnic minority in northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]] are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;H.W.F. Saggs&quot;&gt;Saggs notes that: &quot;the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians&quot; {{harv|Saggs|1984|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article |access-date=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Babylonia is called after the city of Babylon, Assyria means &quot;land of [[Assur|Asshur]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Ragozin/&gt;

==Pre-history==
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Official letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu]].]]
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in what will be Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC, the  [[Halaf culture]] c. 6100 BC, and the [[Hassuna culture]] c. 6000 BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the Akkadians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]]) on Akkadian, and vice versa, is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot;/&gt; Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;Woods C. 2006 &quot;Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian&quot;.

The cities of [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]], [[Gasur]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

Greco-Roman classical writers such as [[Julius Africanus]], [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] dated the founding of Assyria to various dates between 2284 BC and 2057 BC,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]]'', [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Antiquity'' by Maximilian Duncker, 1877, pp. 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt; listing the earliest king as [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] or [[Ninus]].

According to the Biblical [[generations of Noah]], which appears to have been largely compiled between the 7th and 5th centuries BC,&lt;ref&gt;^ Jump up to: a b Rogers 2000, p. 1271.&lt;/ref&gt; the city of Aššur was allegedly founded by a biblical [[Ashur (Bible)|Ashur]] the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god. However, the much older attested Assyrian tradition itself lists the first king of Assyria as the 25th century BC [[Tudiya]], and an early urbanised Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] (c. 2050 BC) as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the mid-21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.

The city of [[Assur|Aššur]], together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC. However it is likely that they were initially Sumerian-dominated administrative centres. In the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions &quot;smiting [[Subartu]]&quot; (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in c. the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Eastons|wstitle=Assyria|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. According to [[Georges Roux]] he would have lived in the mid 25th century BC, i.e. {{circa|2450 BC}}. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with &quot;king&quot; Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu).

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu (Assyrian king)|Adamu]], the first known reference to the Semitic name ''Adam''&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Victor (1995). ''The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2521-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and then a further thirteen rulers ([[Yangi]], [[Suhlamu]], [[Harharu]], [[Mandaru]], [[Imsu]], [[Harsu]], [[Didanu]], [[Hanu]], [[Zuabu]], [[Nuabu]], [[Abazu (Assyrian king)|Abazu]], [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] and [[Azarah]]). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Aššur]] in the mid 21st-century BC.{{sfn|Saggs|1984|p=24}}

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC), the Assyrians, like all the Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamians (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city-state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]] claimed to encompass the surrounding &quot;four quarters&quot;. The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=EwBuAAAAMAAJ |page=32}} |title=Prehistory and Protohistory of the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain|work=M.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shendge1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Malati J.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian ''[[Karum (trade post)|karu]]'' in [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name &quot;Hatti&quot; itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in [[Anatolia]].

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to Asia Minor and [[the Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]). However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; &quot;the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malati J. Shendge (1997). ''The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit''. Abhinav Publications. p. 46. {{ISBN|978-81-7017-325-0}}. Retrieved 22 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Map of Ur III.svg|thumb|250px|right|Empire of the Third Dynasty of Ur. West is at top, North at right.]]
The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC. The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named Zāriqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=fhMTRcUm9WsC |page=7}} |title=The Invention of Cuneiform: Writing in Sumer|work=Jean-Jacques Glassner|year=1990|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=BPX0h_wbFtEC |page=11}} |title=Area Handbook for the Persian Gulf States|work=Richard F.

The [[Old Assyrian Empire]] is one of four periods into which the history of Assyria is divided, the other three being: the [[Early Period (Assyria)|Early Assyrian Period]], the [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian Period]] and the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|New Assyrian Period]].

[[Ushpia]] (2080 BC) appears to have been the first fully urbanised independent king of Assyria, and is traditionally held to have dedicated temples to the god [[Ashur]] in the city of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Poebel, Arno (1942). &quot;The Assyrian King List from Khorsabad,&quot; ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' 1/3, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]], of whom little is known aside from Kikkiya conducting various building works in Assur. A number of scholars also place [[Zariqum]], a contemporary of [[Amar-Sin]] (2046 – 2038 BC) of [[Ur]] as an Assyrian ruler, though he does not appear on the Assyrian king list, but is claimed by Amar-Sin to be the 'governor' of Assur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Assyrian Rulers. Volume 1: 1114 – 859 BC |author=Albert Kirk Grayson |publisher=|year=2002 |pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In approximately 2025 BC, a king named [[Puzur-Ashur I]] came to the throne of Assyria, and there is some debate among scholars as to whether he was the founder of a new dynasty or a descendant of Ushpia. He is mentioned as having conducted building projects in Assur, and he and his successors took the title ''Išši’ak Aššur'' (meaning viceroy of Ashur). From this time Assyria began to expand trading colonies called [[Karum (trade post)|Karum]] into [[Hurrian]] and [[Hattians|Hattian]] lands in [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;ref name=&quot;Reallexikon&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Meissner|first=Bruno |title=Reallexikon der Assyriologie |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location=Berlin |year=1990 |volume=6 |pages=101–102 |isbn=3110100517 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OIeiZaIo91IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA101,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Shalim-ahum]] (c. 2000 BC), a king who is attested in a contemporary record of the time, leaving inscriptions in an archaic form of Akkadian.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Brinkman (2001). &quot;Assyria&quot;. In Bruce Manning Metzger, Michael David Coogan (ed.). ''The Oxford Companion to the Bible''. Oxford University Press. p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the expansions into Anatolia [[Ilu-shuma]] (C. 1995-1974 BC) ([[Middle chronology]]) appears to have conducted military campaigns in southern Mesopotamia, either in conquest of the city-states of the south, or in order to protect his fellow Akkadian-speakers from incursions by [[Elamites]] from the east and/or [[Amorites]] from the west - {{ quotation|&quot;The freedom&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Freedom=addurāru.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Akkadians and their children I established.

He was succeeded by another powerful king, the long reigning [[Erishum I]] (1973–1934 BC) who is notable for one of the earliest examples of written [[legal codes]]&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Grayson (1972). ''Assyrian Royal Inscriptions'', Volume 1. Otto Harrassowitz. pp. 8–15, 20, 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; and introducing the [[limmu]] (eponym) lists that were to continue throughout Assyrian history. He is known to have greatly expanded Assyrian trading colonies in Anatolia, with twenty one being listed during his reign. These Karum traded in: tin, textiles, lapis lazuli, iron, antimony, copper, bronze, wool, and grain, in exchange for gold and silver. Erishum also kept numerous written records, and conducted major building works in Assyria, including the building of temples to Ashur, Ishtar and [[Adad]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-assyriologie-2001-2-page-177.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies were continued by [[Ikunum]] (1933–1921), [[Sargon I]] (1920–1881 BC), likely named after his predecessor [[Sargon of Akkad]],&lt;ref&gt;name=Bromiley&gt;{{cite book|last=Bromiley|first=Geoffrey|title=The international standard Bible encyclopedia|publisher=William B Eerdmans|isbn=978-0-8028-3784-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=%22sargon+of+akkad%22+%22sargon+I%22+confused#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sargon%20of%20akkad%22%20%22sargon%20I%22%20confused&amp;f=false|date=31 Dec 1996|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; (during Sargon I's later reign [[Babylon]] was founded as a small city-state), and [[Puzur-Ashur II]] (1880–1873 BC). [[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Sin]] (1872–1828 BC) repelled an attempted usurpation of his throne by the future king [[Shamshi-Adad I]] late in his reign, however his successor [[Erishum II]] was deposed by Shamshi-Adad I in 1809 BC, bringing an end to the dynasty founded either by Ushpia or Puzur-Ashur I.

[[Shamshi-Adad I]] (1808–1776 BC) was already the ruler of [[Terqa]], and although he claimed Assyrian ancestry as a descendant of Ushpia, he is regarded as a foreign [[Amorite]] usurper by later Assyrian tradition. However, he greatly expanded the [[Old Assyrian Empire]], incorporating the northern half of Mesopotamia, swathes of eastern and southern Anatolia and much of the [[Levant]] into his large empire, and campaigned as far west as the eastern shores of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;Roux, Georges (Aug 27, 1992). ''Ancient Iraq''. Penguin Books Limited. {{ISBN|978-0140125238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His son and successor [[Ishme-Dagan I]] (1775–1764 BC) gradually lost territory in southern Mesopotamia and the Levant to the state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Eshnunna]] respectively, and had mixed relations with [[Hammurabi]], the king who had turned the hitherto young and insignificant city-state of [[Babylon]] into a major power and empire.

After Shamsi-Adad I's death Assyria was reduced to vassalage by Hammurabi; [[Mut-Ashkur]] (1763–1753 BC), [[Rimush of Assyria|Rimush]] and [[Asinum]] were subservient to Hammurabi, who also took ownership of Assyrian trading colonies, thus bringing an end to the Old Assyrian Empire.

However, the Babylonian empire proved to be short lived, rapidly collapsing after the death of Hammurabi c. 1750 BC. An Assyrian governor named [[Puzur-Sin]] deposed Asinum who was regarded as a foreign Amorite and a puppet of the new and ineffectual Babylonian king [[Sumuabum]], and the Babylonian and Amorite presence was expunged from Assyria by Puzur-Sin and his successor [[Ashur-dugul]], who reigned for six years. A king called [[Adasi]] (1720–1701 BC) finally restored strength and stability to Assyria, ending the civil unrest that had followed the ejection of the Babylonians and Amorites, founding the new ''Adaside Dynasty''.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Georges Roux,  ''Ancient Iraq''{{page needed|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bel-bani]] (1700–1691 BC) succeeded Adasi and further strengthened Assyria against potential threats,&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Veenhof (2008). ''Mesopotamia: The Old Assyrian Period''. Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a revered figure even in the time of [[Ashurbanipal]] over a thousand years later.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara N. Porter (1994). ''Images, Power, and Politics: Figurative Aspects of Esarhaddon's Babylonian Policy''. Amer Philosophical Society. p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

There followed a long, prosperous and peaceful period in Assyrian history, rulers such as [[Libaya]] (1691–1674 BC), [[Sharma-Adad I]], [[Iptar-Sin]], [[Bazaya]], [[Lullaya]], [[Shu-Ninua]] and [[Sharma-Adad II]] appear to have had peaceful and largely uneventful reigns&lt;ref&gt;A. Leo Oppenheim (1969). &quot;Babylonian and Assyrian Historical Texts&quot;. In J. B. Pritchard (ed.). ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts''. Princeton University Press. p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the [[Hittite Empire]] and subsequently fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]], and [[Erishum III]] (1598–1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers. [[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585–1580 BC), [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (1579–1562 BC) and [[Shamshi-Adad III]] (1562–1548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, [[Ashur-nirari I]] (1547–1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded [[Mitanni]] Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He and his successor [[Puzur-Ashur III]] (1521–1497 BC) are known to have been active kings, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom. [[Enlil-nasir I]], [[Nur-ili]], [[Ashur-shaduni]] and [[Ashur-rabi I]] (who deposed his predecessor) followed.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in the Ancient Near East'', by Gwendolyn Leick{{page needed|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline, 1450–1393 BC====
The emergence of the Hurri-Mitanni Empire and allied Hittite empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic [[Mitannian]]-[[Hurrian]] domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Mitannians (an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] speaking people) are thought to have entered Anatolia from the north, conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The indigenous Hurrians spoke the [[Hurrian language]], a language in the now wholly extinct [[Hurro-Urartian]] language family.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] (1450–1431 BC) was courted by the [[Egyptians]], who were rivals of Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the Near East. [[Amenhotep II]] sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Hurri-Mitannian empire. It is likely that this alliance prompted [[Saushtatar]], the emperor of Mitanni, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state. Ashur-nadin-ahhe I was deposed, either by Shaustatar or by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] (1430–1425 BC) in 1430 BC, who then paid tribute to the Mitanni. [[Ashur-nirari II]] (1424–1418 BC) had an uneventful reign and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitannian influence appears to have been short-lived.

They appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

[[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] (1417–1409 BC) seems to have been independent of Mitannian influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with [[Karaindash]], the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign. [[Ashur-rim-nisheshu]] (1408–1401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital. [[Ashur-nadin-ahhe II]] (1400–1393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against Egypt's Mitannian and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge Mitanni or the Hittites.

[[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392–1366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire, and instead turned the tables, and began to exert Assyrian influence on the Mitanni.

The Middle period (1365 BC–1056 BC) saw reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the empire of the [[Hurri]]-[[Mitanni]] and eclipsed the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Canaan]] and [[Phrygia]] in the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|last=Olmstead|first=A.T.|year=1918|volume=38|pages=209–263|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|doi=10.2307/592609|jstor=592609|hdl=2027/pst.000020023782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]
By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392–1366 BC) [[Mitanni]] influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna III]], who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians.

[[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365–1330 BC) went further, defeating Shuttarna III and bringing an end to the Mitanni empire, the Assyrian king then annexing its territories in Anatolia and the Levant, turning Assyria once more into a major empire.&lt;ref&gt;M. van de Mieroop, ''A History of the Ancient Near East'', 2006, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; The ambitious Assyrian king went further still, attacking and conquering [[Babylonia]], and imposing a puppet ruler loyal to himself upon its throne. Assyria then annexed hitherto Babylonian territory in central Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;J. Oates – ''Babylon'', 2003, pp 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enlil-nirari]] (1330-1319 BC) also defeated Babylonia's Kassite kings.

The Hittites, having failed to save Mitanni, allied with Babylon in an unsuccessful economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to Egyptian and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1964|p=263}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arik-den-ili]] (1318–1307 BC) campaigned further still, entering northern [[Ancient Iran]] and subjugating the 'pre-Iranic' Gutians, Turukku and Nigimhi, before campaigning deeper into the Levant, subjugating the Suteans, Ahlamu and Yauru.&lt;ref&gt;A.

Otto Harrassowitz. pp. 54–57, 58, 67&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Adad-nirari I]] (1307–1275 BC) was another highly successful military leader, he defeated and conquered the Hurro-Mitanni kingdom of [[Hanigalbat]] and the rest of the independent Hurro-Mitanni kingdoms of Anatolia, despite the Hittites attempting to support their allies, and inflicted a series of crushing defeats on Babylonia, annexing large swathes of Babylonian territory. Hittite kings during his reign assumed a placatory attitude towards the Assyrian king.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Bryce (2003).

[[Shalmaneser I]] (1274-1245 BC) conquered eight kingdoms in central Anatolia in his first year, and in the next he defeated a coalition of Hittites, Hurrians, Mitanni and Ahlamu, annexing yet more territory in Anatolia and the Levant, and retaining Assyrian dominion over Babylonia and the northwest of ancient Iran. Shalmaneser also conducted extensive building work in [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]], and founded the city of [[Kalhu]] (the Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]).&lt;ref&gt;One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Sayce, Archibald Henry (1911). &quot;Shalmaneser&quot;.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244–1207 BC), won a major victory against the Hittites and their king [[Tudhaliya IV]] at the [[Battle of Nihriya]] and took thousands of prisoners. Rather than being content to simply subjugate Babylonian kings as his predecessors had, he conquered Babylonia directly, taking [[Kashtiliash IV]] as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; first used by Sargon of Akkad. Tukulti-Ninurta I thus became the first Akkadian speaking native Mesopotamian to rule the state of Babylonia, its founders having been foreign Amorites, succeeded by equally foreign Kassites. Tukulti-Ninurta petitioned the god [[Shamash]] before beginning his counter offensive.&lt;ref name=edwards2&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380–1000 BC |chapter=Assyrian Military Power, 1300–1200 B.C. |author=J.M.

Middle Assyrian texts recovered at ancient [[Dūr-Katlimmu]], include a letter from Tukulti-Ninurta to his ''sukkal rabi'u'', or grand vizier, [[Ashur-iddin]] advising him of the approach of his general [[Shulman-mushabshu]] escorting the captive Kashtiliash, his wife, and his retinue which incorporated a large number of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dūr-Katlimmu 2008 and beyond |chapter=Production and Consumption at Dūr-Katlimmu: A Survey of the Evidence |author=Frederick Mario Fales |editor=Hartmut Kühne |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2010 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his way to exile after his defeat. In the process he defeated the [[Elamites]], who had themselves coveted Babylon. He also wrote an epic poem documenting his victorious wars against Babylon and Elam. He progressed further south into what is today [[Arabia]], conquering the ''pre-Arab'' [[South Semitic]] kingdoms of [[Dilmun]] and [[Meluhha]]. After a Babylonian revolt, he raided and plundered the temples in Babylon, regarded as an act of sacrilege. As relations with the priesthood in Ashur began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1964|pp=26–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of short reigning kings followed, these being [[Ashur-nadin-apli]] (1207–1204 BC), [[Ashur-nirari III]] (1203–1198 BC), [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] (1197–1193 BC) and [[Ninurta-apal-Ekur]] (1192–1190 BC), and there were no significant expansions of the empire during their short tenures, and Babylonia seems to have freed itself from the Assyrian yoke for a time.

[[Ashur-dan I]] (1190–1144 BC) conquered huge swathes of Babylonia, subjugating its king, and taking much booty home to Assyria. However, this led to conflict with the powerful [[Elamites]] of the southwest of ancient Iran, who were themselves preying upon Babylonia. The Elamites managed to actually take the Assyrian city of [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), before being finally defeated and driven from the Assyrian empire.&lt;ref&gt;David Kertai (2008–2009). &quot;The history of the middle Assyrian empire&quot;. Talanta. XL–XLI: 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil unrest ensued in Assyria after Ashur-Dan I's death, and [[Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur]] and [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] followed in quick succession during 1133 BC.

[[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1116 BC) restored the tradition of powerful conquering kings. He campaigned to the east, taking the [[Zagros]] region of ancient Iran, and subjugated the Amorites, Ahlamu and the newly appeared Arameans in the Levant. He also defeated the ambitious [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of Babylonia, annexing Babylonian territory in the process.&lt;ref&gt;A. K. Grayson (1975). ''Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles''. J. J. Augustin. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiglath-pileser I]] (1115–1074 BC) proved to be a long reigning and all conquering ruler, who firmly underlined Assyria's position as the world's leading military power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/8308416|title=Compositional and Editorial Processes of Annalistic and Summary Texts of Tiglath-pileser I|journal=State Archives of Assyria Bulletin|volume=8|pages=67-112|first=Marco De|last=Odorico |via=www.academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first campaign was against the [[Phrygians]] and [[Kaskians]] in 1112 BC, who had attempted to occupy certain Assyrian ruled Hittite districts in the Upper [[Euphrates]]; then he overran [[Commagene]] and eastern [[Cappadocia]], and drove the [[Hittites]] from the Assyrian province of [[Subartu]], northeast of [[Malatia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=968}}

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated into the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] and then turned westward to receive the submission of [[Malatia]] and [[Urartu]]. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser attacked [[Cilicia]] and [[Comana (Cappadocia)|Comana]] in [[Cappadocia]], and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his [[Cilicia]]n conquests.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=968}}

The [[Aramaeans]] of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. ''The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the fall of the Persians Empire'', p.563&lt;/ref&gt; at the junction between the Euphrates and [[Sajur]]; thence he proceeded to conquer the [[Canaan]]ite/[[Phoenicia]]n city-states of [[Byblos]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Berytus]] ([[Beirut]]), [[Aradus]] and finally [[Arvad]] where he embarked onto a ship to sail the [[Mediterranean]], on which he killed a ''nahiru'' or &quot;sea-horse&quot; (which [[A. Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot; /&gt; He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Hadad]] at the Assyrian capital of Assur (Ashur) was one of his initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot; /&gt; He was succeeded by [[Asharid-apal-Ekur]] who reigned for only a short time.

[[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1073–1056 BC) kept the vast empire together, campaigning successfully against [[Urartu]] and [[Phrygia]] to the north and the Arameans to the west. He maintained friendly relations with [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded Babylonia and deposed the new ruler [[Kadašman-Buriaš]], appointing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both [[Zoological Gardens]] and [[Botanical Gardens]] in Ashur, collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from Egypt.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by [[Tukulti-Mer]], a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the [[Khabur (Tigris)|Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Middle Assyrian Empire.

====Society and law in the Middle Assyrian Period====
[[File:C+B-Music-Fig24-AssyrianQuartet.PNG|thumb|220px|Assyrian [[quartet]].]]
The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The Middle Assyrian Period was marked by the long wars fought that helped build Assyria into a [[warrior society]]. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society. Assyria needed less artificial [[irrigation]] than Babylonia, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''[[casus belli]]''.

All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A [[legal code]] was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to [[divorce]] their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed [[adultery]], she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce.

The women of the king's [[harem]] and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as [[Strike (attack)|beatings]], [[mutilation]], and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. [[Execution]]s were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by [[forced labour]]. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture or duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

In the Middle Assyrian Laws, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were [[homosexual]] or [[heterosexual]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nissinen&quot;&gt;''Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective'', by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Homoeroticism%20in%20the%20Biblical%20World%20Nissinen&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 24–28]&lt;/ref&gt; An individual faced no punishment for penetrating a cult prostitute, someone of an equal or lower [[social class]], such as [[slave]]s, or someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine. Such sexual relations were even seen as good [[Luck|fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epistle.us/hbarticles/neareast.html|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt by Bruce Gerig in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt|author=|date=|website=Epistle.us|access-date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, homosexual relationships with royal attendants, between soldiers, or with those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]] were either treated as [[rape]] or seen as bad [[omens]], and punishments applied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nissinen&quot; /&gt;

Furthermore, the article 'Homosexualität' in ''Reallexicon der Assyriologie'' states, &quot;Homosexuality in itself is thus nowhere condemned as licentiousness, as immorality, as social disorder, or as transgressing any human or [[divine law]]. Anyone could practice it freely, just as anyone could visit a [[prostitute]], provided it was done without [[sexual violence|violence]] and without [[Compulsive behavior|compulsion]], and preferably as far as taking the passive role was concerned, with specialists. That there was nothing [[sin|religiously amiss]] with homosexual love [[Men who have sex with men|between men]] is seen by the fact that they prayed for divine blessing on it. It seems clear that the Mesopotamians saw nothing wrong in homosexual acts between consenting adults&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Driver and J.C. Miles, ''The Assyrian Laws'' (Oxford, Clarendon Press [1935]), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reallexicon der Assyriologie 4, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_attitude_wenham.html The Old Testament Attitude to Homosexuality] by Gordon J Wenham, ''Expository Times'' 102.9 (1991): 259–363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyria during the Bronze Age Collapse, 1200–936 BC===
The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not, and in fact thrived for most of the period. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, South Eastern Asia Minor, central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic-speaking]] peoples such as the [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Parthia]]ns moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native [[Kassites]] and [[Gutians]] and pressuring [[Elam]] and [[Mannea]] (all of which ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Ancient Iran), and to the north in [[Asia Minor]] the [[Phrygians]] overran that part of the Hittites not already destroyed by Assyria, and [[Lydia]] emerged, a new [[Hurrian]] state named [[Urartu]] arose in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Cimmerians]], [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and [[Scythians]] around the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caucasus]]. [[Egypt]] was divided and in disarray, and [[Israelites]] were battling with other [[West Asia]]n peoples such as the [[Amalekites]], [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]] and [[Ammon]]ites and the non-Semitic-speaking [[Peleset]]/[[Philistines]] (who have been conjectured to be one of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]])&lt;ref name=&quot;AK2013&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Killebrew|first=Ann E.|title=The Philistines and Other &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; in Text and Archaeology|date=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=Society of Biblical Literature Archaeology and biblical studies|volume=15|page=2|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-721-8}} Quote: &quot;First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from &quot;islands&quot; (tables 1–2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., [[Robert Drews|Drews]] 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation &quot;of the sea&quot; appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Drews48&quot;&gt;Robert Drews, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48 The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C.]'' pp. 48–61. Quote: &quot;The thesis that a great &quot;migration of the Sea Peoples&quot; occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear, &quot;eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun.&quot; Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; for the control of southern [[Canaan]]. [[Dorian Greeks]] usurped the earlier [[Mycenaean Greeks]] in western Asia Minor, and the [[Sea Peoples]] ravaged the [[Eastern Mediterranean]].

Other new peoples, such as the [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Sarmatians]], [[Arabs]], [[Nubians]] and [[Kushites]] were to emerge later, during the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC).

[[File:Assyrian horsemen arabs.png|thumb|270px|[[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] horsemen pursue defeated [[Arabs]].]]
Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt; Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia, Lydia and Media. Kings such as [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose, including campaigning as far as the [[Mediterranean]] and sacking [[Babylonia]].

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] is usually considered to have begun with the ascension of [[Adad-nirari II]], in 911 BC, lasting until the fall of [[Nineveh]] at the hands of the [[Medes|Medes/Persians]] and [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]] in 609 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=nhsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=assur-uballit+ii+failed+attempt+harran+a+companion+to+assyria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gABGmVQIvw&amp;sig=yTRAi8HxE7EW-tdar-jMdB3MpPg&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis8tGI8oDbAhVHOxQKHULSB20Q6AEIODAB#v=onepage&amp;q=assur-uballit%20ii%20failed%20attempt%20harran%20a%20companion%20to%20assyria&amp;f=false/ A Companion to Assyria]: p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyria maintained a large and thriving rural population, combined with a number of well fortified cities, Major Assyrian cities during this period included; [[Nineveh]], [[Assur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]], [[Nimrud]]), [[Erbil|Arbela]] ([[Erbil]]), [[Arrapha]] ([[Karka]], [[Kirkuk]]), [[Dur-Sharrukin]], [[Imgur-Enlil]], [[Carchemish]], [[Harran]], [[Tushhan]], [[Til-Barsip]], [[Ekallatum]], [[Kanesh]], [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]], [[Urhai]] ([[Edessa]]), [[Guzana]], [[Tell Barri|Kahat]], [[Amid]] ([[Diyarbakir]]), [[Mardin|Mérida]] ([[Mardin]], [[Tabitu]], [[Nuhadra]] ([[Dohuk]]), [[Ivah]], [[Sepharvaim]], [[Rachae]], [[Purushanda]], [[Sabata (city)|Sabata]], [[Birtha (Mesopotamia)|Birtha]] ([[Tikrit]]), [[Tell Shemshara]], [[Dur-Katlimmu]] and [[Shekhna]].

Assyria is often noted for its brutality and cruelty during this period, although Assyrian harshness was reserved solely for those who took up arms against the Assyrian king, and none of the Assyrian kings of the Neo-Assyrian Empire or preceding Middle Assyrian Empire conducted [[genocide]]s, [[massacre]]s or [[ethnic cleansing]]s against civilian populations, non-combatant men, or women and children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It must be noted, however, that these atrocities were usually reserved for those local princes and their nobles who had revolted and that in contrast with the Israelites, for instance, who exterminated the Amalekites for purely ethnocultural reasons, the Assyrians never indulged in systematic genocides.&quot; (Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', Third Edition, p. 291)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;They have been maligned. Certainly, they could be rough and tough to maintain order, but they were defenders of civilization, not barbarian destroyers.&quot; (H.W.F. Saggs, The Might That Was Assyria, p. 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion, 911–627 BC====
Assyria once more began to expand with the rise of [[Adad-nirari II]] in 911 BC. He cleared Aramean and other tribal peoples from Assyria's borders and began to expand in all directions into [[Anatolia]], [[Ancient Iran]], [[Levant]] and [[Babylonia]].

[[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC) continued this expansion apace, subjugating much of the Levant to the west, the newly arrived [[Persians]] and [[Medes]] to the east, annexed central Mesopotamia from Babylon to the south, and expanded deep into [[Asia Minor]] to the north. He moved the capital from [[Ashur]] to [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) and undertook impressive building works throughout Assyria. [[Shalmaneser III]] (859–824 BC) projected Assyrian power even further, conquering to the foothills of the [[Caucasus]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Aram-Damascus]], and subjugating [[Persia]] and the [[Arabs]] who dwelt to the south of Mesopotamia, as well as driving the [[Egyptians]] from [[Canaan]]. It was during the reign of Shalmaneser III that the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Chaldaea|Chaldeans]] first enter the pages of recorded history.

Little further expansion took place under [[Shamshi-Adad V]] and his successor, the regent queen [[Semiramis]], however when [[Adad-nirari III]] (811–783 BC) came of age, he took the reins of power from mother and set about a relentless campaign of conquest; subjugated the Arameans, Phoenicians, Philistines, Israelites, Neo-Hittites and Edomites, Persians, Medes and Manneans, penetrating as far as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He invaded and subjugated [[Babylonia]], and then the migrant [[Chaldea]]n and [[Sutean]] tribes settled in south eastern Mesopotamia whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage.

After the reign of Adad-nirari III, Assyria entered a period of instability and decline, losing its hold over most of its vassal and tributary territories by the middle of the 8th century BC, until the reign of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745–727 BC). He created the world's first [[professional army]], introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of Assyria and its vast empire, and reorganised the empire drastically. Tiglath-Pileser III conquered as far as the [[East Mediterranean]], bringing the Greeks of Cyprus, [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Philistia]], [[Samaria]] and the whole of [[Aramea]] under Assyrian control. Not satisfied with merely holding Babylonia in vassalage, Tiglath-Pileser deposed its king and had himself crowned king of Babylon. The imperial, economic, political, military and administrative reforms of Tiglath-Pileser III were to prove a blueprint for future empires, such as those of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians, Byzantines, Arabs and Turks.

[[Shalmaneser V]] reigned only briefly, but once more drove the Egyptians from southern Canaan, where they were fomenting revolt against Assyria. [[Sargon II]] quickly took Samaria, effectively ending the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and carrying 27,000 people away into captivity into the Israelite diaspora. He was forced to fight a war to drive out the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] who had attempted to invade Assyria's vassal states of Persia and [[Media (region)|Media]]. The [[Neo-Hittite]] states of northern Syria were conquered, as well as [[Cilicia]]. [[Lydia]] and [[Commagene]]. King [[Midas]] of [[Phrygia]], fearful of Assyrian power, offered his hand in friendship. [[Elam]] was defeated and [[Babylonia]] and [[Chaldea]] reconquered. He made a new capital city named [[Dur Sharrukin]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Sennacherib]] who moved the capital to [[Nineveh]] and made the deported peoples work on improving Nineveh's system of irrigation canals. Nineveh was transformed into the largest city in the world at the time.

[[Esarhaddon]] had Babylon rebuilt, he imposed a ''vassal treaty'' upon his Persian, Median and Parthian subjects, and he once more defeated the Scythes and Cimmerians. Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] interference in the Assyrian Empire, [[Esarhaddon]] decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC he crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], invaded and took Egypt with surprising ease and speed. He drove its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and Ethiopian rulers out, destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process. Esarhaddon declared himself &quot;king of Egypt, Libya, and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]&quot;. Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; &quot;All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me&quot;. He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), an unusually well educated king for his time who could speak, read and write in Sumerian, Akkadian and Aramaic, Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Nubia]], Egypt, Libya and Arabia in the south, and from the East Mediterranean, Cyprus and [[Antioch]] in the west to Persia, [[Cissia (area)|Cissia]] and the Caspian Sea in the east.

[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|upright|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Elam]] in 647 BC is recorded in this relief.]]

Ultimately, Assyria conquered [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]], and Cyprus, and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimean Peninsula|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], Ethiopia and others. At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

====Downfall, 626–609 BC====
{{Main|Medo-Babylonian war against Assyrian Empire}}
The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]] was severely crippled following the death of [[Ashurbanipal]] in 627 BC, the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Egypt's 26th Dynasty]], which had been installed by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

The [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] colonies, with hordes of horse-borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the [[Scythians]]) and all the way into [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthia]]ns), aided by the previous [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] to coalesce into a powerful Median-dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern[Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the Caspian Sea.

[[Cyaxares]] (technically a vassal of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]]), in an alliance with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], launched a surprise attack on a civil war beleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical [[Nimrud|Calah/Nimrud]]) and [[Battle of Arrapha|taking Arrapha]] (modern Kirkuk) and [[Gasur]]. [[Nabopolassar]], still pinned down in southern [[Mesopotamia]] by Assyrian forces, was completely uninvolved in this major breakthrough against [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]].

Despite the sorely depleted [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|state of Assyria]], bitter fighting ensued; throughout 614 BC the [[Medes]] continued to gradually make hard fought inroads into [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] itself, scoring a decisive and devastating victory over the [[Neo-Assyrian|Assyrian]] forces at the [[Fall of Assur|battle of Assur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A Companion to Assyria&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=nhsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=assur-uballit+ii+failed+attempt+harran+a+companion+to+assyria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gABGmWUGsp&amp;sig=1ycls362t5MljLckRSzhc6_vvy4&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrwLGrpYHbAhWLXhQKHTveAOMQ6AEIODAB#v=onepage&amp;q=assur-uballit%20ii%20failed%20attempt%20harran%20a%20companion%20to%20assyria&amp;f=false/ A Companion to Assyria]: p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; In 613 BC, however, the Assyrians scored a number of counterattacking victories over the [[Medes|Medes-Persians]], [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonians-Chaldeans]] and [[Scythians]]-[[Cimmerians]]. This led to the unification of the forces ranged against Assyria who launched a massive combined attack, finally besieging and [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|entering Nineveh]] in late 612 BC, with [[Sinsharishkun|Sin-shar-ishkun]] being slain in the bitter street by street fighting. Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued under [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612–609 BC), who fought his way out of [[Nineveh]] and coalesced Assyrian forces around [[Harran]] which finally fell in 609 BC. The same year, Ashur-uballit II besieged Harran with the help of the Egyptian army, but this failed too, and this last defeat ended the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A Companion to Assyria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/the-cambridge-ancient-history/the-fall-of-assyria-635609-bc/3D4C90FB7000C5A3E7F3A808FDC8D21D#/ The Cambridge Ancient History] &quot;The fall of Assyria (635–609 B.C.)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cyaxares/ Encyclopaedia Britannica] &quot;The Median army took part in the final defeat of the Assyrians in northern Mesopotamia (612–609); and, when the territory of Assyria was divided between Media and Babylonia, Media took Assyria with Harran.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During the aftermath, Egypt, along with remnants of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] army, suffered a defeat at the [[battle of Carchemish]], in 605 BC, but the Assyrian troops did not participate to this battle as the army of the Assyrian state because certainly by 609 BC at the very latest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nhsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=assur-uballit+ii+failed+attempt+harran+a+companion+to+assyria#v=onepage&amp;q=assur-uballit%20ii%20failed%20attempt%20harran%20a%20companion%20to%20assyria&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to Assyria|last=Frahm|first=Eckart|date=2017-06-12|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444335934|language=en|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Assyria/ Encyclopaedia Britannica] &quot;The last great Assyrian ruler was Ashurbanipal, but his last years and the period following his death, in 627 bce, are obscure.

===Assyria after the empire===

====Achaemenid Assyria, Osroene, Asōristān, Athura and Hatra====
{{Main|Osroene|Asōristān|Athura|Hatra}}
[[File:History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia and Assyria (1903) (14747728556).jpg|thumb|390px|Athura in the Achaemenid period.]]
Assyria was initially ruled by the short-lived [[Median Empire]] (609–549 BC) after its fall. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]], the last king of [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]] (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]), was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]. He had overthrown the short-lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them; conversely, a number of towns and cities, such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]], [[Nohadra]] and [[Harran]], remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this short period in a degree of devastation, following its fall.

====Achaemenid Assyria (549–330 BC)====

}}
After the [[Medes]] were overthrown by the [[Persian people|Persians]] as the dominant force in Ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around [[Tyareh]] was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria |publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |access-date=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520–519 BC.

The [[Persian people|Persians]] had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]] and his successors, having been vassals of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years, and Greek writers such as [[Thucydides]] still referred to it as ''the Assyrian language''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van de Mieroop|2004b|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of [[Assur]] once more became a rich and prosperous entity.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John (November 2003). &quot;The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq&quot;. ''L'archéologie de l'empire achéménide'' (Paris, France): 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in 5th century BC Assyria that the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] evolved. Five centuries later these were later to have a global influence as the liturgical language and written script for [[Syriac Christianity]] and its accompanying [[Syriac literature]] which also emerged in Assyria before spreading throughout the [[Near East]], [[Asia Minor]], The [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and [[China]].

====Macedonian and Seleucid Assyria====
In 332 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor, who called the inhabitants ''Assyrioi''. The [[Macedonian Empire]] (332–312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312 BC). It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name 'Syria' which is a 9th-century BC [[Indo-Anatolian]] derivation of 'Assyria' (see [[Etymology of Syria]]) not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Eber Nari]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but, the north east corner aside, never a part of Assyria proper.

When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria proper, the name ''Syria'' survived but was erroneously applied not only to the land of Assyria itself, but also now to [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed ''Syrians'' (and later also ''Syriacs'') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] and later European culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military, economic and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], effectively bringing an end to ''Babylonia'' as a geo-political entity.

====Parthian Assyria (150 BC – 225 AD)====
{{Main|Adiabene}}
By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]]. The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria, and between the mid 2nd century BC and 4th century AD a number of [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose; these included the ancient capital of [[Assur]] itself, [[Adiabene]] with its capital of [[Irbid|Arbela]] (modern [[Irbil]]), [[Beth Nuhadra]] with its capital of [[Nohadra]] (modern [[Dohuk]]), [[Osroene]], with its capitals of [[Edessa]] and [[Amid]] (modern [[Sanliurfa]] and [[Diyarbakir]]), [[Hatra]], and &quot;ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ&quot; ([[Beth Garmai]]) with its capital at [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&amp;pg=PA135|title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: the origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|last=Mohsen|first=Zakeri|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=1995|isbn=978-3-447-03652-8|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adiabenian rulers converted to [[Second Temple Judaism|Judaism]] from [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|paganism]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gottheil|first=Richard|title=Adiabene |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/801-adiabene|encyclopedia=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 115 AD, there are no historic traces of Jewish royalty in Adiabene.

These freedoms were accompanied by a major Assyrian cultural revival, and temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]], [[Ninurta]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Crone &amp; Cook 1977, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Christianity]] arrived in Assyria soon after the death of Christ and the Assyrians began to gradually convert to Christianity from the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] during the period between the early first and third centuries. Assyria became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]] and [[Syriac Literature]], with the [[Church of the East]] evolving in Assyria, and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] partly also, with Osroene becoming the first independent Christian state in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winkler p. 1&quot; /&gt;

====Roman Assyria (116–118)====
{{Main|Assyria (Roman province)}}
However, in 116, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were briefly taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|province of Assyria]]. The Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king. However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by soldiers have been discovered in [[Northern England]] dating from the second century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall|title=When Syrians, Algerians and Iraqis patrolled Hadrian's Wall|author=Charlotte Higgins|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=16 February 2016|date=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With loose Parthian rule restored, Assyria and its patchwork of states continued much as they had before the Roman interregnum, although Assyria and Mesopotamia as a whole became a front line between the Roman and Parthian empires. Other new religious movements also emerged in the form of [[gnosticism|gnostic sects]] such as [[Mandeanism]], as well as the now extinct [[Manichean]] religion.

===Christian period===

====Sassanid Assyria (226 – c. 650)====
{{Main|Asōristān}}
[[Image:N-Mesopotamia and Syria.svg|thumb|360px|[[Upper Mesopotamia]] and Syria in the [[early Christian]] period, with [[Edessa]] in the left upper quadrant]]
In 226, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sasanian Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about [[annexing]] the independent states within Assyria during the mid- to late 3rd century, the last being Assur itself in the late 250's to early 260's. Christianity continued to spread, and many of the ethnically Assyrian churches that exist today are among the oldest in the world. For example, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] is purported to have been founded by [[St Peter]] himself in 67 AD.

Nevertheless, although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]] until as late as the 10th or 11th century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Parpola |first=Simo |title=Assyrian Identity in Ancient Times and Today |url=http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, 1864, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrians lived in a province known as [[Asuristan]], and the region was on the frontier of the Byzantine and Sassanian empires.

The land was known as [[Asōristān]] (the Sassanid Persian name meaning &quot;Land of the Assyrians&quot;) during this period, and became the birthplace of the distinct [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]) and a centre of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], with a flourishing [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] (as well as other Mesopotamian gods) in his home city, in [[Harran]] and elsewhere during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, indicating the ancient pre-Christian Assyrian identity was still extant to some degree.

During the Sasanian period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria, and in effect the whole of Mesopotamia came to be known as Asōristān. Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] reputedly ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

====Arab Islamic conquest (630–780)====
Centuries of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, which made both of them open to loss in a war against the [[Muslim]] Arab army, under the newfound [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. After the early Islamic conquests, Assyria was dissolved as an official administrative entity by an empire. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of further [[Arabisation]] and the beginning of [[Islamification]], and the region saw a large influx of ''non indigenous'' Arabs, [[Kurds]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Turkic peoples]].

However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia retained their language, religion, culture and identity.

Under the Arab Islamic empires, the Christian Assyrians were classed as ''[[dhimmis]]'', who had certain restrictions imposed upon them. Assyrians were thus excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, they did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters without a Muslim witness, they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]) and they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim-ruled lands. However, personal matters such as marriage and divorce were governed by the cultural laws of the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;H. Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett (2005). ''Muslims and Modernity: An Introduction to the Issues and Debates''. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 163. {{ISBN|0-8264-5481-X}}. Retrieved 7 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

For those reasons, and even during the Sassanian period before Islamic rule, The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] formed a church structure that spread [[East Syrian Rite|Nestorian Christianity]] to as far away as China, in order to proselytize away from Muslim-ruled regions In Iran and their homeland in Mesopotamia, with evidence of their massive church structure being the [[Nestorian Stele]], an artifact found in China which documented over 100 years of Christian history in China from 600 to 781 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Henry, ed (1988). ''Light from the East: A Symposium on the Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches''. Toronto, Canada. pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrian Christians maintained relations with fellow Christians in [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 12th century AD, Assyrian priests interceded on behalf of persecuted Arab Muslims in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastical History of Bar Hebraeus (ii 354)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mongol Empire (1200–1300)====
The first signs of trouble for the Assyrians started in the 13th century, when the Mongols first [[Mongol Empire#Middle East|invaded]] the Near East after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad in 1258]] to [[Hulagu Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|1977|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found|date=February 2020}} Assyrians at first did very well under Mongol rule, as the [[Shamanist]] Mongols were sympathetic to them, with Assyrian priests having traveled to Mongolia centuries before. The Mongols in fact spent most of their time oppressing Muslims and Jews, outlawing the practice of circumcision and [[Halal#Dhabihah: method of slaughter|halal butchery]], as they found them repulsive and violent.&lt;ref&gt;Johan Elverskog (2010).

Retrieved 2010-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, as one of the only groups in the region looked at in a good light, Assyrians were given special privileges and powers, with Hülegü even appointing an [[Assyrian Christian]] governor to [[Erbil]] ([[Erbil|Arbela]]), and allowing the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] to build a church there.&lt;ref name=&quot;novacek261&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nováček|Chabr|Filipský|Janiček|2008|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found|date=February 2020}}

However, the Mongol rulers in the Near East eventually converted to [[Islam]]. Sustained persecutions of Christians throughout the entirety of the [[Ilkhanate]] began in earnest in 1295 under the rule of [[Oïrat]] amir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nauruz]], which affected the indigenous Christians greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of the Ilkhan [[Öljeitü]], the  inhabitants of Erbil seized control of the citadel and much of the city in rebellion against the Muslims. In spring 1310, the Mongol [[Malik]] (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the [[Kurds]] and Arabs, but was defeated. After his defeat he decided to siege the city. The Assyrians held out for three months, but the citadel was at last taken by Ilkhanate troops and Arab, Turkic and Kurdish tribesmen on July 1, 1310. The defenders of the citadel fought to the last man, and many of the inhabitants of the lower town were subsequently massacred.

Regardless of these hardships, the Assyrian people remained numerically dominant in the north of Mesopotamia as late as the 14th century AD, and the city of [[Assur]] functioned as their religious and cultural capital.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The seat of the [[Catholicos]] of the [[Church of the East]] was [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], not Assur. In the mid-14th century the [[Muslim]] Turkish ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of the indigenous Christians, and entirely destroyed the vast Church of the East structure established throughout the [[Far East]] outside what had been the [[Sasanid Empire]], with the exception of the [[St Thomas Christians]] of the [[Malabar Coast]] in India, who numbered 4.2 million in the 2011 census of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://cds.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WP468.pdf|author=K.C.

====Breakup of the Church of the East (1552–1830)====
Around 100 years after the massacres by Timur, a religious schism known as the [[Schism of 1552]] occurred among the Christians of northern Mesopotamia. A large number of followers of the [[Church of the East]] were dissatisfied with the leadership of the Church, at this point based in the [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery]] near [[Alqosh]], and in particular with the system of hereditary succession of the patriarch. Three bishops elected the abbot of the monastery, [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa]], as a rival patriarch. These did not have the rank of [[metropolitan bishop]], which was required for appointing a patriarch and which was granted only to members of the patriarch's family. Sulaqa therefore went to Rome to be made a patriarch, entered into communion with the [[Catholic Church]] and was appointed &quot;Patriarch of [[Mosul]] in Eastern Syria&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Patriarcha de Mozal in Syria orientali'' ([https://archive.org/details/orienschristian04grgoog Anton Baumstark (editor), ''Oriens Christianus'', IV:1, Rome and Leipzig 2004, p. 277])&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Patriarch of the Chaldean church of Mosul&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Chaldaeorum ecclesiae Musal Patriarcha'' ([http://digitale-sammlungen.ulb.uni-bonn.de/content/pageview/33998  Giuseppe Simone Assemani (editor), ''Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana'' (Rome 1725), vol. 3, part 1, p. 661]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Pope Julius III]] in 1553. He won support only in [[Diyarbakır]] (known also as [[Amid]]), where he set up his residence, and in [[Mardin]]. In 1555, he was killed by the Turkish authorities after being denounced by the traditionalist patriarch, but the metropolitans he had ordained elected a successor for him, initiating the Shimun line of patriarchs, all of whom took the name Shimun (Simon). The patriarchs of this line requested and obtained confirmation from Rome only until 1583. In 1672 they clearly broke off communion with Rome, but continued as a line of patriarchs independent from that at Alqosh, with their seat, from then on, at [[Qodchanis]] in the [[Hakkari]] mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peshitta.org/pdf/CoEHistory.pdf|title=Wilhelm Braun, Dietmar W.

Long before 1672, the Shimun line, as it &quot;gradually returned to the traditional worship of the Church of the East, thereby losing the allegiance of the western regions&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jB8ir0ek8bgC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Wilmshurst+losing+allegiance#v=onepage&amp;q=Wilmshurst+losing+allegiance&amp;f=false|title=The Ecclesiastical Organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913|first=David|last=Wilmshurst|date=1 July 2000|publisher=Peeters Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9789042908765}}&lt;/ref&gt; moved from Turkish-controlled Diyarbakır to [[Urmia]] in Persia. The bishopric of Diyarbakır became subject to the Alqosh patriarch. Bishop [[Joseph I (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph]] of Diyarbakır converted to the Catholic faith in 1667 or 1668. In 1677, he obtained recognition from the Turkish authorities as invested with independent power in Diyarbakır and Mardin, and in 1681 he was recognized by Rome as &quot;patriarch of the Chaldean nation deprived of its patriarch&quot;. Thus was instituted the Josephite line, a third line of patriarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peshitta.org/pdf/CoEHistory.pdf|title=Wilhelm Braun, Dietmar W. Winkler, ''The Church of the East: A Concise History'' (Routledge 2000), p. 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Alqosh line, Eliya VII (1591–1617), Eliya VIII (1617–1660) and Eliya IX (1660–1700) contacted Rome at various times but without establishing union.&lt;ref&gt;Braun and Winkler (2000), pp. 117–119)&lt;/ref&gt; Union was achieved in 1771 under Eliya XI, who died in 1778. His successor Eliya XII, after sending his profession of faith to Rome and receiving confirmation as Catholic patriarch, adopted a traditionalist position in 1779. His opponents elected [[Yohannan VIII Hormizd|Yohannan Hormizd]], a young nephew of Eliya XI, whom Eliya XI had intended to be his successor. Although Yohannan Hormizd won the support of most of the followers of the Alqosh patriarchate, Rome considered his election to be irregular and, instead of accepting him as patriarch, merely confirmed him as metropolitan of Mosul and patriarchal administrator. He was thus granted the powers and the insignia of a patriarch, but not the title. It made the same arrangement in Diyarbakır, appointing as patriarchal administrator [[Joseph V Augustine Hindi|Augustine Hindi]], a nephew of [[Joseph IV (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph IV]], whom his uncle wished to be his successor as patriarch. There were thus two traditionalist patriarchates (the Eliya line and the Shimun) and, under administrators, two Catholic patriarchates (Diyarbakır and Alqosh/Mosul).

In 1804, Eliya XI died and had no traditionalist successor. Augustine Hindi died in 1827 and, in 1830, Rome appointed Yohannan Hormizd as [[Patriarch of Babylon|patriarch of all the Catholics]]. The Shimun line, which had been the first to enter union with Rome, remained at the head of the traditionalist church that in 1976 adopted the name [[Assyrian Church of the East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CnSCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22Assyrian+Church%22+1976#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Assyrian+Church%22+1976&amp;f=false|title=The Church of the East: A Concise History|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Baum|first2=Dietmar W.|last2=Winkler|date=8 December 2003|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|isbn=9781134430192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=79wj2hj4wKUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Assyrian+Church%22+1976#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Assyrian%20Church%22%201976&amp;f=false |first=John |last=Joseph|title=The Modern Assyrians of the Middle East|publisher=Brill |date=2000|page=1|isbn=978-90-04-11641-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fredaprim.com/pdfs/2008/20080307a.pdf |first=Fred |last=Aprim|title=Assyria and Assyrians Since the 2003 US Occupation of Iraq|date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that continued to be in the hands of the same family until the death in 1975 of [[Shimun XXI Eshai]].

The Assyrian Genocide ran largely in conjunction with the similarly ethno-religiously motivated [[Armenian Genocide]], [[Greek Genocide]] and [[Great Famine of Mount Lebanon]].

In reaction against Ottoman cruelty, the Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]] which took place in what is today south eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, north western Iran and north eastern Syria. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories against the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups. However, due to the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]]—due to the [[Russian Revolution]]—and the similar collapse of the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Armenian Defense]], the Assyrians were left without allies. As a result, the Assyrians were vastly outnumbered, outgunned, surrounded, cut off, and without supplies. The only option they had was to flee the region into northwest Iran and fight their way, with around 50,000 civilians in tow, to British train lines going to [[Mandatory Iraq]]. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I, and by 1924 many of those who remained were forcibly expelled in a display of [[ethnic cleansing]] by the Turkish government, with many leaving and later founding villages in the [[Sapna valley|Sapna]] and [[Nahla valley]]s in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] of Iraq.

In 1920 the Assyrian settlements in [[Mindan]] and [[Baquba]] were attacked by [[Iraqi Arabs]], but the Assyrian tribesmen displayed their military prowess by successfully defeating and driving off the Arab forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tragedy of the Assyrians|first=Ronald Sempill|last=Stafford|page=59|date=1935|publisher=G. Allen &amp; Unwin, ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrians also sided with the British during the [[Iraqi revolt against the British]].

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1922, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and Turtanu, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs, Kurds and [[Iraqi Turkman|Turcoman]], guard the borders with Iran and Turkey, and protect British military installations. During the 1920s Assyrian levies saw action in effectively defeating Arab and Kurdish forces during anti-British rebellions in Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Modern History of the Kurds''. p. 178 by David MacDowall. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====Simele Massacre and World War II (1930–1950)====
After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. The massacres of civilians followed a clash between armed Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed [[Iraq Levies|Assyrian Levies]] were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians, and the British government then whitewashed the massacres at the [[League of Nations]].

Despite these betrayals, the Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in Greece, Cyprus and Albania. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] and elsewhere in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join World War II on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time, after which they were disarmed and disbanded.

A further persecution of Assyrians took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s when thousands of Assyrians settled in Georgia, Armenia and southern Russia were forcibly deported from their homes in the dead of night by [[Stalin]] without warning or reason to [[Central Asia]], with most being relocated to [[Kazakhstan]], where a small minority still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/12/assyrian-community-kazakhstan-survived-dark-times-now-focuses-education/|title=Assyrian Community in Kazakhstan Survived Dark Times, Now Focuses on Education|work=The Astana Times|accessdate=16 February 2016|date=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 was a period of respite for the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria. The regime of Iraqi President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, a number of Assyrians moved south to cities such as Baghdad, [[Basra]] and [[Nasiriyah]] to enhance their economic prospects, others were well represented in politics, the military, the arts and entertainment, Assyrian towns, villages, farmsteads and Assyrian quarters in major cities flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel and be over-represented in sports such as boxing, football, athletics, wrestling and swimming.

However, in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq, and came to power in Syria the same year. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]], and set about attempting to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the many non-Arab peoples of Iraq and Syria, including the Assyrians. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, together with an attempt to ''Arabize'' the ancient pre-Arab heritage of Mesopotamian civilisation.

The policies of the Baathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose nationalist governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to [[Turkification|Turkify]] the Assyrians by calling them &quot;Semitic Turks&quot; and forcing them to adopt Turkish names and language. In Iran, Assyrians continued to enjoy cultural, religious and ethnic rights, but due to the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 their community has been diminished.

In the aftermath of the [[Iraq War]] of 2003, Assyrians became the targets of Islamist terrorist attacks and intimidation from both Sunni and Shia groups, as well as criminal kidnapping organisations; forcing many in southern and central Iraq to relocate to safer Assyrian regions in the north of the country or north east Syria.

In recent years, Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of attacks amounting to [[genocide]] by Islamist militants like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] and [[Nusra Front]]. In 2014, ISIL attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian homeland]]s of northern Iraq and north east Syria, and Assyrians forced from their homes in cities such as Mosul had their houses and possessions stolen, both by ISIL and also by their own former Arab Muslim neighbours.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorknewsgrio.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorknewsgrio.com/world/117902-isis-destroy-the-oldest-christian-monastery-in-mosul-iraq.html|title=ISIS destroy the oldest Christian monastery in Mosul, Iraq|work=NewyorkNewsgrio.com|accessdate=16 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202173335/http://www.newyorknewsgrio.com/world/117902-isis-destroy-the-oldest-christian-monastery-in-mosul-iraq.html|archive-date=2 February 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Assyrian culture}}
Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century. Assyrian identity; personal, family and tribal names; and both the spoken and written evolution of [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] (which still contains many [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. An [[Assyrian calendar]] has been revived.

Emerging in [[Sumer]] c. 3500 BC, [[cuneiform writing]] began as a system of [[pictograms]]. Around 3000 BC, the pictorial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use grew smaller. The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Syriac language|Assyrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oimp32.pdf ''Visible Language. Inventions of Writing in the Ancient Middle East and Beyond''], Oriental Institute Museum Publications, 32, Chicago: University of Chicago, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-885923-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kültepe texts]], which were written in Old Assyrian, had [[Hittite language|Hittite]] loanwords and names, which constitute the oldest record of any language of the [[Indo-European language family]]. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of [[Anatolia]] rather than of Assyria, but the use of both [[cuneiform]] and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence.&lt;ref&gt;E. Bilgic and S Bayram, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri II, Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1995, {{ISBN|975-16-0246-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.R. Veenhof, Ankara Kultepe Tabletleri V, Turk Tarih Kurumu, 2010, {{ISBN|978-975-16-2235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1700 BC and onward, the [[Sumerian language]] was preserved by the ancient [[Babylonia]]ns and Assyrians only as a [[liturgical language|liturgical]] and [[classical language]] for religious, artistic and scholarly purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot; /&gt;

Assyrian was a dialect of Akkadian, a member of the [[East Semitic languages|eastern branch]] of the [[Semitic language|Semitic]] family and the oldest historically attested of the Semitic languages, which began to appear in written form in the 29th century BC. The first inscriptions in Assyria proper, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1964|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Assyrians also used Sumerian in their literature and liturgy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot; /&gt; although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot; /&gt;

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread [[bilingualism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot; /&gt; The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot; /&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[Sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutscher&quot; /&gt; Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot; /&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In the Neo-Assyrian period, the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roux 1964 308&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1964|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt; more so than Akkadian—this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roux|1964|p=82}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians, and due to the fact that [[Tiglath-pileser II]] made it the [[lingua franca]] of Assyria and its empire in the 8th century BC. The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used distinct Akkadian-influenced [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic varieties]] and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. The [[Syriac language]] also emerged in Assyria during the 5th century BC, and during the Christian era, [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac script]] were to become hugely influential.

However, the descendant Akkadian-influenced Eastern Aramaic dialects from the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal, tribal, family and place names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people]] and are spoken fluently by up to 1,000,000 Assyrians, with a further number having lesser and varying degrees of fluency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot; /&gt; These dialects which contain many Akkadian loan words and grammatical features are very different from the now almost extinct [[Western Aramaic]] of the [[Arameans]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Trans-Jordan]], which does not have any Akkadian grammatical structure or loan words.

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] in 2011 completed an Assyrian dictionary, the style of which is more like an encyclopedia than a dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/science/07dictionary.html|title=After 90 Years, a Dictionary of an Ancient World|date=7 June 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

====Ancient Assyrian religion====
{{Main|Ancient Mesopotamian religion}}
The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], with their national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having the most importance to them during the Assyrian Empire. This religion gradually declined with the advent of [[Syriac Christianity]] between the first and tenth centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;/&gt;

The major deities worshipped in Assyria include;
* [[Adad]] ([[Hadad]]) – storm and rain god
* [[Anu]] or An – god of heaven and the sky, lord of constellations, and father of the gods. The name is derived from Sumero-Akkadian/ana/, which means heaven; He is considered the father of great gods. In stories, he is mentioned as a father, creator, and god; and is believed to be the supreme being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinches&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2069?msg=welcome_stranger |title=The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria |first=Theophilus G. |last=Pinches |author-link=Theophilus G. Pinches|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]] or [[Dagon]] – god of fertility
* [[Enki]] or Ea – god of the [[Abzu]], crafts, water, intelligence, mischief and creation and divine ruler of the Earth and its humans
* [[Ereshkigal]] – goddess of [[Irkalla]], the Underworld
* [[Ishtar]] or [[Inanna]]/[[Astarte]] – goddess of fertility, love, and war
* [[Marduk]] – patron deity of [[Babylon]] who eventually became regarded as the head of the Babylonian pantheon
* [[Nabu]] – god of wisdom and writing
* [[Nanshe]] – goddess of prophecy, fertility and fishing
* [[Nergal]] – god of plague, war, and the sun in its destructive capacity; later husband of Ereshkigal
* [[Ninhursag]] or [[Mami (goddess)|Mami]], [[Belet-Ili]], [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], Ninmah, Nintu, or Aruru – earth and [[mother goddess]]
* [[Ninlil]] – goddess of the air; consort of Enlil
* [[Ninurta]] – champion of the gods, the epitome of youthful vigour, and god of agriculture
* [[Nisroch]] – god of agriculture. Some other religions also consider him the fallen angel or demon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinches&quot; /&gt;
* [[Nusku]] – The messenger for the Gods. “&quot;the offspring of the abyss, the creation of Êa,&quot; and &quot;the likeness of his father, the first-born of Bel.&quot; Nusku was also considered a great commander, counselor of the gods, and protector of gods in heaven. Assyrian kings mention Nusku many times, especially before wars; Nusku was fearless in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinches&quot; /&gt;
* [[Shamash]] or [[Utu]] – god of the sun, arbiter of justice and patron of travellers
* [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] or Nanna – god of the moon. Considered to be the prince of the gods. Described as having a perfect body: everything from beard to horns is perfect. The name is believed to come from &quot;Zu-ena&quot; but was changed at some point. Zu-ena means “knowledge-lord”. Sin is also mentioned in other religions in Babylonia&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinches&quot; /&gt;
* [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] or Dumuzi – god of food and vegetation
* [[Tiamat]]

The original, polytheistic religion of the Assyrians was widely adhered to until around the 4th century, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;/&gt; However, Assyrians today are exclusively Christian, with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]. Assyrians had begun to adopt Christianity (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[gnosticism]]) between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.

====Christianity====
[[File:Asia Minor in the early 1st century AD - general map - provinces, client states and main settlements - bleached - English legend.jpg|thumb|Osroene (Mesopotamia) in the first century]]
The tradition of the [[Church of the East]] is that [[Thomas the Apostle]] and his disciples Addai ([[Thaddeus of Edessa]]) and [[Saint Mari|Mari]] brought Christianity to [[Mesopotamia]], thus attributing to the first century the founding of the [[episcopal see]] of [[Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], which became that Church's primatial see in 410. There is clear evidence of the presence of Christianity in [[Osroene]] in the second century. At that time, Christians were persecuted in the [[Roman Empire]], but were at peace under the expanding [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]]. [[Shapur I]] (241–272), the second ''shahinshah'' (king of kings) of the Sasanian dynasty, occupied Roman territory, advancing as far as [[Antioch]] in 260, and deported eastward much of the population to strengthen the economy of his own empire. One of those deported in 253 was Bishop [[Demetrius of Antioch]], who then became the first bishop of [[Gundeshapur|Beth Lapat]]. After 312, when [[Constantine the Great]] legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire, Christians in Persia came under suspicion of pro-Roman sympathies and were persecuted, especially under [[Shapur II]] (309–379).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peshitta.org/pdf/CoEHistory.pdf|title=Wilhelm Baum, Dietmar W. Winkler, ''The Church of the East: A Concise History'' (Routledge 2003), pp. 7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Yazdegerd I]] (399–421) the situation of the Christian minority improved considerably. In 410, on the recommendation of several Western bishops (the signatories included the bishops of [[Antioch]], [[Aleppo]], [[Edessa]] and [[Amid]]) Yazdegerd called the [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], which organized the Persian Church after the model approved by the [[First Council of Nicea]] for the Church in the Roman Empire. The [[Church of the East]] was arranged as six [[ecclesiastical province]]s, with the bishops in each grouped around a [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], while the bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the [[capital city]], referred to in the acts of the council as the Grand Metropolitan, held authority throughout the Church and for that reason was called (probably only from a later date) the [[Catholicos]].&lt;ref&gt;Canon XXI of the council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler (2003), pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/ChabotSynodiconOrientale|title=Synodicon Orientale|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/compterendudeuxi00cong|title=Compte rendu : Deuxième section, Science Religieuses|first=1894|last=Congrès Scientifique International des Catholiques 3rd : Bruxelles|date=1 July 1895|publisher=Bruxelles : Société Belge de Librairie|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Papa bar Aggai]], who in about 315, almost 100 years before this council, suffered a sudden stroke during a synod held to depose him, is looked on as the first Catholicos of the Church of the East, although this may only mean that he was the first bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.68434|quote=first Catholicos.|title=Nestorian missionary enterprise: the story of a church on fire|first=John|last=Stewart|date=1 July 1928|publisher=T. &amp; T.

In a synod held in Markabta in 424, the participating bishops recalled the circumstances concerning Papa, blaming the opposition to him on the influence of unnamed Western bishops, and declared or reaffirmed that the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon was totally independent. They excluded any right of appeal against him to any patriarch in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler (2003), pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Synodicon orientale'' (1902), pp. 285–298]&lt;/ref&gt; They &quot;defined, by the word of God, that Easterners cannot appeal to Western patriarchs against their patriarch. Any case that cannot be resolved in his presence shall be reserved to the tribunal of Christ [...] There can be no reason for thinking or saying that the Catholicos of the East can be judged by superiors or by another patriarch. He himself is to be the judge of all his subjects, and judgment on himself is reserved to Christ, who has chosen him, raised him up and placed him at the head of his Church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=L'ecclésiologie des nestoriens|first=Martin|last=Jugie|date=1 July 1935|journal=Revue des études byzantines|volume=34|issue=177|pages=5–25|doi=10.3406/rebyz.1935.2817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Synodicon orientale'' (1902), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

This was six years before the 431 [[Council of Ephesus]], the enforcement within the Byzantine Empire of whose condemnation of [[Nestorianism]] is sometimes given as what led to the break between the Church of the East and the Western Churches.

In 484, Catholicos [[Babowai]] wrote to some Western bishops asking them to get the Byzantine emperor to intercede with the Persian king [[Peroz I]] on behalf of persecuted Christians. His letter was intercepted, reportedly by [[Barsauma]], metropolitan of [[Nisibis]], between whom and Babowai there was a heated dispute. It was shown to the king, who then had Babowai executed. Barsauma called the [[Synod of Beth Lapat]], which, as well as condemning some of Babowai's policies, permitted marriage of clergy and of vowed monks and reputedly adopted Nestorian teaching. Under Babowai's successor, [[Acacius of Seleucia-Ctesiphon]], a synod held in the capital in 486 revoked the decrees of the Synod of [[Gundeshapur|Beth Lapat]], whose acts have consequently not been preserved, and in its own name affirmed the teaching of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] against [[Monophysitism]], forbade wandering monks or clergy, and allowed marriage of clergy and monks.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Synodicon orientale'' (1902), pp. 299−309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler (2003), p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m7btCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=babowai#v=onepage&amp;q=babowai&amp;f=false|title=The Religious Roots of the Syrian Conflict: The Remaking of the Fertile Crescent|first=Mark|last=Tomass|date=8 April 2016|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|isbn=9781137525710}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nacsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=babowai#v=onepage&amp;q=babowai&amp;f=false|title=Christians in Asia before 1500|first1=Ian|last1=Gilman|first2=Hans-Joachim|last2=Klimkeit|date=11 January 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|isbn=9781136109706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time [[miaphysitism]] was advancing in the Persian Empire. Its followers were mainly from the &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of Western Syriac Christians whom [[Khosrow I]] (531–579) and [[Khosrow II]] (590 and 591–628) deported to their own territory, as well as descendants of those previously deported, but there were also some defectors from the local Church of the East.&lt;ref name=Varghese/&gt;&lt;ref name=EncRel&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/syriac-orthodox-church-antioch|title=Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, West Syrian opponents of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] sought refuge in Persia from the pro-Chalcedonian policy of Emperors [[Justin I]] and [[Justinian I]] and actively propagated their own theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GYC93sfHXAEC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=sassanid+zeal+justin#v=onepage&amp;q=sassanid+zeal+justin&amp;f=false|title=Christianity in Iraq: Its Origins and Development to the Present Day|first=Suha|last=Rassam|date=1 July 2005|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780852446331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Baradaeus]], who was ordained as Bishop of [[Edessa]] in about 543, set about ordaining bishops and priests throughout the Syriac-speaking areas of West Asia to such an extent that he was even claimed to have ordained over 100,000 clergy and nearly 30 bishops.

An account of the divisions within the Church of the East from the mid-16th to the early 19th century is given [[#Breakup of the Church of the East (1552–1830)|above]]. The separate patriarchates at one stage grew to four, but were reduced in 1830 to two: the now more numerous [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. The latter was further divided in the 20th century, with a split between the Assyrian Church of the East and the [[Ancient Church of the East]] over reforms by [[Shimun XXI Eshai]] in the 1960s.

After the Arab conquest had removed the previously existing frontier between the Byzantine and Persian Empires, the Syriac Orthodox Church no longer needed to maintain a clear distinction between the part under the direct rule of the Patriarch and the part in the care of the Maphrian. From 793 the Maphrian was no longer elected by the Eastern bishops but simply appointed by the Patriarch. The Maphrianate thus became, until abolished in 1860, a mere title for the second in dignity within the Church. The Church itself, like that of the East, underwent divisions. William Taylor states that for 475 years, from 1364 to 1839, there were two rival series of Patriarchs, one in [[Mardin]], the other in [[Tur Abdin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MDlQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22maphrian%22+of+tur+abdin#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maphrian%22+of+tur+abdin&amp;f=false|title=Narratives of Identity: The Syrian Orthodox Church and the Church of England 1895-1914|first=William|last=Taylor|date=16 October 2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781443869461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sor.cua.edu/History/index.html|title=Syriac Orthodox Church History|website=sor.cua.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1665 the Syrian Orthodox Church won the allegiance of about a third of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in southwestern India, whose traditional liturgy had been that of the Church of the East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;dq=Fahlbusch+Muziris&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY7LWVtLjeAhXKKlAKHXYaCBQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fahlbusch%20Muziris&amp;f=false Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley, Jan Milic Lochman, John Mbiti, Jaroslav Pelikan (editors), ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity'' (Eerdmans 2008), p. 285]&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to Anglican influence, they lost many of these in the 19th and 20th centuries through the setting up of the more [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]] and [[St. Thomas Evangelical Church]] and about half of those remaining in the 20th century declared their Church (the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]) [[Autocephaly|autocephalous]], while those remaining in obedience to the Patriarch (the [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]]) have been granted autonomy within the Syrian Orthodox Church such as was once granted to the Maphran-headed part of the Church in Persia.

At about the same time as the Syriac Orthodox Church was expanding into India, where now three quarters of its membership live,&lt;ref name=&quot;pro-oriente.at&quot;&gt;[https://www.pro-oriente.at/Syrisch_Katholische_Kirche/ Pro Oriente: Syrisch-Katholische Kirche]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] and [[Jesuit]] missionaries won to union with Rome the majority of the Syriac Orthodox in [[Aleppo]], including, in 1656, their bishop, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]], who in 1662 was elected Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church. On his death in 1677, two strong factions emerged, each of which elected a Patriarch, one pro-, the other anti-Rome. The Ottoman civil authorities recognized the non-Catholic Patriarch and suppressed the Catholic faction, eventually forcing it underground. In 1782 the newly elected Syriac Orthodox Patriarch declared himself Catholic and moved to Lebanon. He was replaced as Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, but initiated a series of Catholic patriarchs that in 1828 was recognized by the Ottoman authorities as heading a distinct Catholic Syriac Church. In 1850, the Catholic patriarchal seat was moved to [[Mardin]]. Many of its faithful were massacred during the [[First World War]]. The patriarchal seat is now Beirut, where it was moved in the 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gxEONS0FFlsC&amp;pg=PA588&amp;lpg=PA588&amp;dq=%22Syrian+Catholic+Church%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Syrian+Catholic+Church%22&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Catholicism|first=Frank K.|last=Flinn|date=1 July 2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9780816075652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=v2yiyLLOj88C&amp;pg=PA2794&amp;lpg=PA2794&amp;dq=%22Syrian+Catholic+Church%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Syrian+Catholic+Church%22&amp;f=false|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|isbn=978-0816075652|edition=2|volume=1-6|first1=J.

Patriarch [[Ignatius Peter IV]] (1872–1894) made an attempt in 1889 to set up a Latin-rite branch of his Syriac Orthodox Church by having the [[Goa]]n [[Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares]] ordained, with the religious name of Mar Julius I, as Archbishop of Ceylon, Goa and India. In May 1892, Alvares, with the consent of the Patriarch, ordained [[René Vilatte]] as Archbishop of America. In later years Vilatte consecrated &quot;a number of men who are the episcopal ancestors of an enormous variety of descendants&quot; in what is called the [[independent sacramental movement]] or [[independent Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Plummer, ''The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement'' (Apocryphile Press, 2006), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, the seat of the patriarchate of the Syriac Orthodox Church was moved from the &quot;Saffron Monastery&quot; ([[Mor Hananyo Monastery]]) of [[Tur Abdin]], 4 kilometres north of [[Mardin]], Turkey to [[Homs]], Syria and in 1959 to [[Bab Tuma]] (literally meaning &quot;Thomas Gate&quot;), [[Damascus]], capital of Syria; but the Patriarch actually resides at the Mar Aphrem Monastery in [[Maarat Saidnaya]], about 25 kilometres north of Damascus.&lt;ref name=EncRel /&gt;

The Syriac Orthodox Church has today about 2 million followers, three quarters of whom belong to the autonomous Jacobite Syrian Christian Church in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pro-oriente.at/Syrisch_Orthodoxe_Kirche/ Pro Oriente: Syrisch-Orthodoxe Kirche]&lt;/ref&gt; The Syriac Catholic Church has about 160,000 faithful, some 65,000 of them in Syria, 55,000 in Iraq, as well as about 15,000 in Lebanon and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;pro-oriente.at&quot; /&gt;

A 2009 study by Sargon Donabed and Shamiran Mako cites the remark made by [[Horatio Southgate]], on learning that the Armenians called the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrians]] ''Assouri'' (not ''Asorestants’i'', the Armenian word for Assyrian), that the Syrians call themselves sons of Asshur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.rwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=fcas_fp|title=Sargon Donabed, Shamiran Mako, &quot;Ethno-cultural and Religious Identity of Syrian-Orthodox Christians&quot; in ''Chronos.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}
Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from [[Mittani]]) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour.

The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

[[File:Assyrian Winged Bull.jpg|thumb|275px|A ''[[Lamassu]]'', from the entrance into the kings private apartments; 865–860 BC; [[British Museum]] (London)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull [[lamassu]] or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C.W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that lamassi were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern Iraq. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.&lt;ref name = &quot;Muſeum&quot;&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 Lens], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers and siege engines.

[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (539–330 BC) retained a separate identity, official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under Seleucid rule, however, Aramaic gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the Arab period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the Romans until coming under the rule of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 226–651, where it was known as [[Asōristān]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in the ''[[Canon of Kings]]'', beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD; however, [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] was still alive and well into the fourth century and pockets survived into the 10th century and possibly as late as the 17th century in [[Mardin]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/faq.html|title=Assyrians: Frequently Asked Questions|website=www.aina.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the religion is now dead, and the Assyrian people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of the [[cuneiform script]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological rediscovery of ancient Assyria, [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], who have come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.
