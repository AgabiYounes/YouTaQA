'''Arbor Day''' (or '''Arbour''' in some countries) is a [[secular holiday|holiday]] in which individuals and groups are encouraged to plant [[tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=David|title='Plant trees': the foundations of Arbor Day in Australia|journal=Studies in the History of Gardens &amp; Designed Landscapes|volume=30|issue=1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1080/14601170903010200|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many countries observe such a holiday. Though usually observed in the spring, the date varies, depending on [[climate]] and suitable planting season.

== Origins and history ==
[[File:Fiesta del arbol.jpg|thumb|The naturalist [[Miguel Herrero Uceda]] at the monument to the first Arbor Day in the world, [[Villanueva de la Sierra]] ([[Spain]]) 1805]]

=== First Arbor Day in the world ===
The Spanish village of Mondoñedo held the first documented arbor plantation festival in the world organized by its mayor in 1594. The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse-chestnut]] trees. A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event. Additionally, the small Spanish village of Villanueva de la Sierra held the first modern Arbor Day, an initiative launched in 1805 by the local priest with the enthusiastic support of the entire population.

{{Quote|While Napoleon was ravaging Europe with his ambition in this village in the Sierra de Gata lived a priest, don Juan Abern Samtrés, which, according to the chronicles, &quot;convinced of the importance of trees for health, hygiene, decoration, nature, environment and customs, decides to plant trees and give a festive air. The festival began on Carnival Tuesday with the ringing of two bells of the church, and the Middle and the Big. After the Mass, and even coated with church ornaments, don Juan, accompanied by clergies, teachers and a large number of neighbours, planted the first tree, a poplar, in the place known as Valley of the Ejido. Tree plantations continued by Arroyada and Fuente de la Mora. Afterwards, there was a feast, and did not miss the dance. The party and plantations lasted three days. He drafted a manifesto in defence of the trees that was sent to surrounding towns to spread the love and respect for nature, and also he advised to make tree plantations in their localities.|[[Miguel Herrero Uceda]]|Arbor Day}}

=== First American Arbor Day ===
[[File:Birdsey Northrop.jpg|thumb|Birdsey Northrop]]
The first American Arbor Day was originated in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska]] by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=Sterling J.|date=|title=Arbor Day|url=|journal=Academic Search Complete|volume=|pages=|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted in [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

Birdsey Northrop of [[Connecticut]] was responsible for globalizing the idea when he visited [[Japan]] in 1883 and delivered his Arbor Day and Village Improvement message. In that same year, the [[American Forestry Association]] made Northrop the Chairman of the committee to campaign for Arbor Day nationwide. He also brought his enthusiasm for Arbor Day to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arbor Day&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Birdsey Grant Northrop|url=http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/forestry/urban_forestry/arborday.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711040119/http://ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/forestry/urban_forestry/arborday.pdf|archive-date=2009-07-11|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== McCreight and Theodore Roosevelt ===
Beginning in 1906, [[Pennsylvania]] conservationist [[Major Israel McCreight]] of [[DuBois, Pennsylvania]], argued that President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]’s conservation speeches were limited to businessmen in the lumber industry and recommended a campaign of youth education and a national policy on conservation education.&lt;ref&gt;M.I. McCreight, Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why: A Thirty-Four Year Moratorium on Unpublished Records (1940), Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, at p.12, Hereinafter cited &quot;Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; McCreight urged Roosevelt to make a public statement to school children about trees and the destruction of American forests.  Conservationist [[Gifford Pinchot]], Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]], embraced McCreight’s recommendations and asked the President to speak to the public school children of the United States about conservation. On April 15, 1907, Roosevelt issued an &quot;Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWgjAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=theodore%20roosevelt%20proclamation%20to%20school%20children%201906%201907&amp;pg=RA4-PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Arbor Day Proclamation to the School Children of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; about the importance of trees and that forestry deserves to be taught in U.S. schools. Pinchot wrote McCreight, &quot;we shall all be indebted to you for having made the suggestion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation Why&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Arbor Day has been observed in Australia since 20 June 1889. National Schools Tree Day is held on the last Friday of July for schools and National Tree Day the last Sunday in July throughout Australia. Many states have Arbor Day, although [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] has an Arbor Week, which was suggested by [[Premier of Victoria|Premier]] [[Dick Hamer|Rupert (Dick) Hamer]] in the 1980s.

=== Belgium ===

=== Canada ===
The day was founded by Sir George W. Ross, later the Premier of Ontario, when he was Minister of Education in Ontario (1883-1899). According to the Ontario Teachers' Manuals &quot;History of Education&quot; (1915), Ross established both Arbour Day and Empire Day - &quot;the former to give the school children an interest in making and keeping the school grounds attractive, and the latter to inspire the children with a spirit of patriotism&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;222). This predates the claimed founding of the day by Don Clark of Schomberg, Ontario for his wife Margret Clark in 1906. In Canada, [[National forest week|National Forest Week]] is the last full week of September, and National Tree Day (Maple Leaf Day) falls on the Wednesday of that week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianforestry.com/wp/national-forest-week/.

=== China ===
The Arbor Day ({{zh|t=植樹節|s=植树节}}) in China was founded by the famous forestry scientist Ling Dao-yang in 1915. From 1916 to 1928, Arbor Day was celebrated on the Chinese [[Qingming Festival]], which is on the first day of the fifth solar term of the traditional Chinese [[lunisolar calendar]]. In 1929, the date for Arbor Day was changed to March 12 to commemorate [[Sun Yat-sen]]. In 1979, the fourth session of the Fifth [[National People's Congress]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] adopted the Resolution on the Unfolding of a Nationwide Voluntary Tree-planting Campaign. This resolution established the Arbor Day and stipulated that every able-bodied citizen between the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equivalent amount of work in seedling, cultivation, tree tending, or other services. Supporting documentation instructs all units to report population statistics to the local afforestation committees for workload allocation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taishangeopark.com/10144.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
Since conference and of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]'s publication ''[https://anydayguide.com/calendar/507 World Festival of Trees]'', and a resolution of the [[United Nations]] in 1954: &quot;The Conference, recognising the need of arousing mass consciousness of the aesthetic, physical and economic value of trees, recommends a World Festival of Trees to be celebrated annually in each member country on a date suited to local conditions&quot;; it has been adopted by the [[Netherlands]]. In 1957, the National Committee Day of Planting Trees/Foundation of National Festival of Trees (''Nationale Boomplantdag''/''Nationale Boomfeestdag'') was created.

On the third Wednesday in March each year (near the spring equinox), three quarters of Dutch schoolchildren aged 10/11 and Dutch celebrities plant trees. Stichting Nationale Boomfeestdag organizes all the activities in the Netherlands for this day. Some municipalities however plant the trees around 21 September because of the planting season.&lt;ref&gt;Boomfeestdag http://www.boomfeestdag.nl/ the organisations address is Spoorlaan 444 5038 CH TILBURG&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the 50th anniversary was celebrated with special golden jubilee activities.

=== New Zealand ===
[[New Zealand]]’s first Arbor Day planting was on 3 July 1890 at Greytown, in the Wairarapa.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzarb.org.nz/Events/Conferences++Workshops/Arbor+Day+Planting.html|title=Arbor Day Planting {{!}} NZ Arb|website=www.nzarb.org.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201235742/http://www.nzarb.org.nz/Events/Conferences++Workshops/Arbor+Day+Planting.html|archive-date=2017-02-01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official celebration was scheduled to take place in [[Wellington]] in August 2012, with the planting of [[pohutukawa]] and [[Norfolk pines]] along Thorndon Esplanade.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Prominent New Zealand botanist Dr [[Leonard Cockayne]] worked extensively on native plants throughout New Zealand and wrote many notable botanical texts. As early as the 1920s he held a vision for school students of New Zealand to be involved in planting native trees and plants in their school grounds. This vision bore fruit and schools in New Zealand have long planted native trees on Arbor Day.

Since 1977, New Zealand has celebrated Arbor Day on June 5, which is also [[World Environment Day]]. Prior to then, Arbor Day was celebrated on August 4, which is rather late in the year for tree planting in New Zealand, hence the date change.

Many of the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]]'s Arbor Day activities focus on ecological restoration projects using native plants to restore habitats that have been damaged or destroyed by humans or invasive pests and weeds. There are great restoration projects underway around New Zealand and many organisations including community groups, landowners, conservation organisations, [[iwi]], volunteers, schools, local businesses, nurseries and councils are involved in them. These projects are part of a vision to protect and restore the indigenous biodiversity.

=== Niger ===
Since 1975, [[Niger]] has celebrated Arbor Day as part of its [[Independence Day (Niger)|Independence Day]]: 3 August. On this day, aiding the fight against [[desertification]], each Nigerien plants a tree.

=== North Macedonia ===
Having in mind the bad condition of the forest fund, and in particular the catastrophic [[wildfire]]s which occurred in the summer of 2007, a citizens' initiative for afforestation was started in [[North Macedonia]]. The campaign by the name 'Tree Day-Plant Your Future' was first organized on 12 March 2008, when an official non-working day was declared and more than 150,000 Macedonians planted 2 million trees in one day (symbolically, one for each citizen). Six million more were planted in November the same year, and another 12,5 million trees in 2009. This has been established as a tradition and takes place every year.

In Spain there was an [[International Forest Day]] on 21 March, but a decree in 1915 also brought in an Arbor Day throughout Spain. Each municipality or collective decides the date for its Arbor Day, usually between February and May. In [[Villanueva de la Sierra]] ([[Extremadura]]), where the first Arbor Day in the world was held in 1805, it is celebrated, as on that occasion, on Tuesday Carnaval. It is a great day in the local festive calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sierradegatadigital.es/articulo/cultura/villanueva-celebra-fiesta-medioambientalista-mas-antigua-mundo/20140225131113012653.html The oldest environmentalist festival in the world was celebrated in Villanueva].

=== Sri Lanka ===
National Tree Planting Day is on November 15.

=== Taiwan ===
Arbor Day (植樹節) has been a traditional [[Holidays in Taiwan|holiday]] in the [[Republic of China]] since 1927. In 1914, the founder of the [[Nanjing Agricultural University|agricultural college at Nanking University]] suggested to the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry that China should imitate the practice in the United States of Arbor Day. The holiday would be held the same day as the [[Qingming Festival]]. However, for unknown reasons, the suggestion was not made through the formal process, so nothing came from this original request. After the successful conclusion of the [[Northern Expedition]], the now-defunct Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals formally petitioned the [[Executive Yuan]] to establish Arbor Day to commemorate the passing of [[Sun Yat-sen|Dr. Sun Yat-sen]], the Father of Modern China. He had been a major advocate of afforestation in his life, because it would increase [[Three Principles of the People|people's livelihoods]]. The Executive Yuan approved Arbor Day in the spirit of Dr. Sun that year and has since been celebrated on March 12 for this purpose.

Arbor Day was founded in 1872 by [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]] in [[Nebraska City]], [[Nebraska]]. By the 1920s, each state in the [[United States]] had passed public laws that stipulated a certain day to be Arbor Day or ''Arbor and Bird Day'' observance.

National Arbor Day is celebrated every year on the last Friday in April; it is a [[civic holiday]] in [[Nebraska]]. Other [[U.S. state|states]] have selected their own dates for Arbor Day.

The customary observance is to plant a tree. On the first Arbor Day, April 10, 1872, an estimated one million trees were planted.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.arborday.org/arborday/history.cfm &quot;The History of Arbor Day&quot;] at the Arbor Day Foundation.
