They patented an improved [[cinematograph]], which in contrast to [[Thomas Edison]]'s &quot;peepshow&quot; [[kinetoscope]] allowed simultaneous viewing by multiple parties.{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==History==
The Lumière brothers were born in [[Besançon]], [[France]], to Charles-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911)&lt;ref name=&quot;vc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/antoinelumiere|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière, who were married in 1861 and moved to Besançon, setting up a small photographic portrait studio where Auguste and Louis were born. They moved to [[Lyon]] in 1870, where son Edouard and three daughters were born. Auguste and Louis both attended [[La Martiniere Lyon|La Martiniere]], the largest technical school in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motion Pictures | author = Gina De Angelis | publisher = The Oliver Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-881508-78-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=daHmkclqERYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Lumi%C3%A8re+Besan%C3%A7on+Lyon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=eqdfSaiYK4PAlQTF4tj7BQ#PPA34,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father Charles-Antoine set up a small factory producing photographic plates, but even with Louis and a young sister working from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. it teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and by 1882 it looked as if they would fail, but when Auguste returned from military service the boys designed the machines necessary to automate their father's plate production and devised a very successful new photo plate, 'etiquettes bleue', and by 1884 the factory employed a dozen workers.

When their father retired in 1892 the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented several significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably [[film perforations]] (originally implemented by [[Emile Reynaud]]) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original [[cinématographe]] had been patented by [[Léon Guillaume Bouly]] on 12 February 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematographes.free.fr/bouly-219350.html &quot;Brevet FR 219.350&quot;]. Cinematographes. Retrieved 13 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematographes.free.fr/lumiere-245032.html &quot;Brevet FR 245.032&quot;]. Cinematographes. Retrieved 12 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on 19 March 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

The Lumière brothers saw film as a novelty and had withdrawn from the film business in 1905. They went on to develop the first practical photographic colour process, the Lumière Autochrome.

Louis died on 6 June 1948 and Auguste on 10 April 1954. They are buried in a family tomb in the [[Guillotière Cemetery|New Guillotière Cemetery]] in Lyon.

==First film screenings==
The Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895. This first screening on 22 March 1895 took place in Paris, at the &quot;Society for the Development of the National Industry&quot;, in front of an audience of 200 people, one of whom was [[Léon Gaumont]], then director of the company the Comptoir géneral de la photographie. The main focus of the conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (colour photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the coloured stills photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Chardère 1985, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Woodville Latham]] screened works of film 2 months later on 20 May 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Paul. [http://precinemahistory.net/1895.htm &quot;1895 Major Woodville Latham (1838–1911)&quot;]. precinemahistory.net, October 1999. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The first public screening of films at which admission was charged was a program by the Skladanowsky brothers that was held on 1 November 1895 in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/skladanowsky|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lumières gave their first paid public screening on 28 December 1895, at [[Salon Indien du Grand Café]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ 28 December 1895.]&lt;/ref&gt; This history-making presentation featured 10 short films, including their first film, ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon]]'' (''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html &quot;La première séance publique payante&quot;, Institut Lumière] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912104656/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html |date=12 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.

[[File:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''[[L'Arroseur arrosé]]'']] It is believed their first film was recorded that same year (1895) with [[Léon Bouly]]'s [[cinematographe|cinématographe]] device, which was patented the previous year. The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded 19 March 1895, and then publicly projected 22 March at the [[Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale]] in Paris. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project [[film|motion picture]]s — was further developed by the Lumières.&lt;ref&gt;Chardère 1987, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following 10 short films (in order of presentation):&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050912104656/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html &quot;Bienvenue sur Adobe GoLive 4&quot;].

The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting [[Brussels]] (the first place a film was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on 1 March 1896), [[Bombay]], [[London]], [[Montreal]], [[New York City]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Buenos Aires]].

In 1896, only a few months after the initial screenings in Europe, films by the Lumiere Brothers were shown in [[Egypt]], first in the Tousson stock exchange in [[Alexandria]] on 5 November 1896 and then in the Hamam Schneider (Schneider Bath) in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmSFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=lumiere+brothers+in+alexandria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1-aFCap4s-&amp;sig=KEupQRN89byuwiqyXDGbYXi_N6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJrJnZ-dnWAhVLL8AKHW4kCOwQ6AEIUDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=lumiere%20brothers%20in%20alexandria&amp;f=false|title=Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134662524|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bibalex.org/alexcinema/historical/beginnings.html|title=Alexandria, Why?

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat]]'' (literally, &quot;the arrival of a train at La Ciotat&quot;, but more commonly known as ''Arrival of a Train at a Station'') and ''[[Carmaux, défournage du coke]]'' (Drawing out the coke). Their [[actuality film]]s, or ''actualités'', are often cited as the first, primitive [[Documentary film|documentaries]]. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]''.

==Early colour photography==
[[File:LumiereAlgerijnen.jpg|thumb|Autochrome colour picture by [[Jean-Baptiste Tournassoud]] of North-African soldiers, Oise, France, 1917.]]

The brothers stated that &quot;the [[film|cinema]] is an [[invention]] without any future&quot; and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as [[Georges Méliès]]. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. In parallel with their cinema work they experimented with colour photography. They worked on a number of colour photographic processes in the 1890s including the Lippmann process (interference heliochromy) and their own 'bichromated glue' process,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignomini.com/photographica/stereophotovintage/Trichrome/Lumiere_Trichrome.html &quot;Lumiere Trichrome&quot;]. ignomini.com. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; a subtractive colour process, examples of which were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. This last process was commercialised by the Lumieres but commercial success had to wait for their next colour process. In 1903 they patented a colour photographic process, the ''[[Autochrome Lumière]]'', which was launched on the market in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Lavédrine and Gandolfo 2013, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following merger with [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdx.rhonealpes.fr/sdx/sribzh/main.xsp?execute=show_document&amp;id=MERIMEEIA69000030 &quot;City of Lyon Document&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130213145224/http://sdx.rhonealpes.fr/sdx/sribzh/main.xsp?execute=show_document&amp;id=MERIMEEIA69000030 |date=13 February 2013 }}. sdx.rhonealpes.fr. Retrieved 2 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Other early cinematographers==
The Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific [[chronophotography]] devices developed by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, and [[William Friese-Greene]]'s &quot;machine camera&quot;, patented in 1889, did so on a strip of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/friesegreene|title=William Friese-Greene|last=|first=|date=|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]] (developed by [[William Kennedy Dickson]]), premiered publicly in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/when_chrono|title=Chronology of Film Shows pre-1896|last=|first=|date=|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1892, the projected drawings of [[Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] were attracting Paris crowds to the Musée Grévin. [[Louis Le Prince]] and [[Claude Mechant]] had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, [[Kazimierz Prószyński]] had built his camera and projecting device, called [[Pleograph]], in 1894. [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]], inventors of the [[Bioscop]], had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (1 November 1895, in [[Berlin]]). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.&lt;ref&gt;Cook 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.
