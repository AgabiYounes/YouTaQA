AA was founded in [[Akron, Ohio]] when in 1935 one alcoholic, [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]], talked to another alcoholic, [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Bob Smith]], about the nature of alcoholism and a possible solution. With the help of other early members, the book ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism]]'' was written in 1939. Its title became the name of the organization and is now usually referred to as &quot;The Big Book&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Data&quot;&gt;{{cite |author=AA|title=Historical Data: The Birth of A.A. and Its Growth in the U.S./Canada|url=https://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/historical-data-the-birth-of-aa-and-its-growth-in-the-uscanada|website= aa.org | access-date = 18 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; AA's initial [[Twelve Traditions]] were introduced in 1946 to help the fellowship be stable and unified while disengaged from &quot;outside issues&quot; and influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Data&quot; /&gt;

The Traditions recommend that members remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics, and that AA groups avoid official affiliations with other organizations. They also advise against [[dogma]] and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]] have adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The AA Grapevine |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous |date=November 1949 |volume=6 |issue=6 |title=The Twelve Traditions |issn=0362-2584 |oclc=50379271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Twelve-Step and Mutual-Help Programs for Addictive Disorders|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=22 |issue=2 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70085-X |pmid=10385942 |last1=Chappel |first1=JN |last2=Dupont |first2=RL |pages=425–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main| History of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

AA sprang from [[The Oxford Group]], a non-denominational movement modeled after [[first-century Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cheever, Susan |title=My name is Bill: Bill Wilson: his life and the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=2004 |page= 129|isbn=978-0-7432-0154-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members founded the Group to help in maintaining sobriety. &quot;Grouper&quot; [[Ebby Thacher]] was Wilson's former drinking buddy who approached Wilson saying that he had &quot;got religion&quot;, was sober, and that Wilson could do the same if he set aside objections to religion and instead formed a personal idea of God, &quot;another power&quot; or &quot;higher power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pass It On, p 117&quot;&gt;''[[#pass-it-on|Pass It On]]'', 1984, p 117.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=17}}

Feeling a &quot;kinship of common suffering&quot; and, though drunk, Wilson attended his first Group gathering.  Within days, Wilson admitted himself to the [[Charles B. Towns|Charles B. Towns Hospital]] after drinking four beers on the way—the last alcohol he ever drank. Under the care of [[William Duncan Silkworth]] (an early benefactor of AA), Wilson's detox included the [[deliriant]] [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]].&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, Bill &quot;AA the Way it Began&quot;  1988, Glenn Abbey Books&lt;/ref&gt; At the hospital, a despairing Wilson experienced a bright flash of light, which he felt to be God revealing himself.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=19–20}} Following his hospital discharge, Wilson joined the Oxford Group and recruited other alcoholics to the Group.  Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on &quot;the science&quot; of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on 10 June 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=33}}

The first female member Florence Rankin joined AA in March 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anonymous|title=Alcoholics Anonymous|year=1939|publisher=Works Publishing Company|location=New York|page=Original Manuscript p. 217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bamuhigire|first=Oscar Bamwebaze|title=Healing power of self love: enhance your chances of recovery from addiction through the..|year=2009|publisher=Iuniverse Inc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-44010-137-3|page=x|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F1oJ4v82nx8C&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=A+Feminine+Victory+florence+rankin#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Feminine%20Victory%20florence%20rankin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first non-Protestant member, a [[Roman Catholic]], joined in 1939.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=47}} The first Black AA group was established in 1945 in Washington DC by Jim S., an African-American physician from Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alcoholics Anonymous|publisher=AA World Services|year=1976|location=3rd. ed., New York|pages=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1233131|title=First black AA group to celebrate 70th anniversary today in Washington DC|last=Mustikhan|first=Ahmar|date=13 April 2015|work=CNN iReport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Big Book, the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions==
To share their method, Wilson and other members wrote the initially-titled book, ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsowatch.aamo.info/1939/uslaw.htm GSOwatch.aamo.info]&lt;/ref&gt; from which AA drew its name. Informally known as &quot;The Big Book&quot; (with its first 164 pages virtually unchanged since the 1939 edition), it suggests a twelve-step program in which members admit that they are powerless over alcohol and need help from a &quot;higher power&quot;. They seek guidance and strength through prayer and meditation from God or a [[Higher Power]] of their own understanding; take a moral inventory with care to include resentments; list and become ready to remove character defects; list and make amends to those harmed; continue to take a moral inventory, pray, meditate, and try to help other alcoholics recover. The second half of the book, &quot;Personal Stories&quot; (subject to additions, removal and retitling in subsequent editions), is made of AA members' redemptive autobiographical sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anonymous|first1=Alcoholics|title=AA Big Book, preface|url=http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_bigbook_preface.pdf|website=Alcoholics Anonymous|publisher=Anonymous Press|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, interviews on American radio and favorable articles in US magazines, including a piece by Jack Alexander in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', led to increased book sales and membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-12_theJackAlexArticle1.pdf |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |date=1 March 1941 |author=Jack Alexander |journal=Saturday Evening Post |edition=Reprinted in booklet form |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |accessdate=12 December 2009 |archivedate=2 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202003927/http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-12_theJackAlexArticle1.pdf |isbn=978-0-89638-199-5 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1946, as the growing fellowship quarreled over structure, purpose, and authority, as well as finances and publicity, Wilson began to form and promote what became known as AA's &quot;Twelve Traditions,&quot; which are guidelines for an altruistic, unaffiliated, non-coercive, and non-hierarchical structure that limited AA's purpose to only helping alcoholics on a non-professional level while shunning publicity. Eventually, he gained formal adoption and inclusion of the Twelve Traditions in all future editions of the Big Book.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt; At the 1955 conference in St. Louis, Missouri, Wilson relinquished stewardship of AA to the General Service Conference,&lt;ref&gt;''[[#pass-it-on|Pass It On]]'', 1984, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; as AA grew to millions of members internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;/&gt;

==Organization and finances==
{{Main|Twelve Traditions }}
[[File:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|A regional service center for Alcoholics Anonymous]]

AA says it is &quot;not organized in the formal or political sense&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=AA Fact File|url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-24_aafactfile.pdf |publisher=General Service Office of Alcoholics Anonymous |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bill Wilson, borrowing the phrase from anarchist theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]], called it a &quot;benign [[anarchy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bill W. | title=Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age: A Brief History of A.A | year=1957 |publisher=Harper and Brothers |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wm06AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=&quot;benign+anarchy&quot; |p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, Shane Butler said that AA &quot;looks like it couldn’t survive as there’s no leadership or top-level telling local [[cumann]]s what to do, but it has worked and proved itself extremely robust&quot;. Butler explained that &quot;AA’s 'inverted pyramid' style of governance has helped it to avoid many of the pitfalls that political and religious institutions have encountered since it was established here in 1946.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Steven | last=Carroll | title=Group avoids politics of alcohol | date= 26 March 2010| url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/group-avoids-politics-of-alcohol-author-1.643753 | work=The Irish Times | accessdate = 17 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, AA counted 2,087,840 members and 120,300 AA groups worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot; /&gt; The Twelve Traditions informally guide how individual AA groups function, and the Twelve Concepts for World Service guide how the organization is structured globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The A.A.

A member who accepts a service position or an organizing role is a &quot;trusted servant&quot; with terms rotating and limited, typically lasting three months to two years and determined by group vote and the nature of the position. Each group is a self-governing entity with AA World Services acting only in an advisory capacity. AA is served entirely by alcoholics, except for seven &quot;nonalcoholic friends of the fellowship&quot; of the 21-member AA Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;/&gt;

AA groups are self-supporting, relying on voluntary donations from members to cover expenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAFACTFILE&quot;/&gt; The AA General Service Office (GSO) limits contributions to US$3,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A.A. GSO Guidelines: Finances |url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/en_pdfs/mg-15_finance.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2009 |archivedate=18 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618122252/http://www.aa.org/lang/en/en_pdfs/mg-15_finance.pdf |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Service Office |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the group level, AA may hire outside professionals for services that require specialized expertise or full-time responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt;

Like individual groups, the GSO is self-supporting. AA receives proceeds from books and literature that constitute more than 50% of the income for its General Service Office.&lt;ref name=GSO2005OPS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aa.org/pics_gen/en_gso07_operresults.jpg |title=GSO 2007 Operating Results |quote=Gross Profit from Literature ≈8,6M (57%), Contributions ~$6.5M (43%) |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Services Office |accessdate=12 December 2009 |archivedate=27 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127204320/http://www.aa.org/pics_gen/en_gso07_operresults.jpg |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with AA's Seventh Tradition, the Central Office is fully self-supporting through the sale of literature and related products, and through the voluntary donations of AA members and groups. It does not accept donations from people or organizations outside of AA.

In keeping with AA's Eighth Tradition, the Central Office employs special workers who are compensated financially for their services, but their services do not include traditional &quot;12th Step&quot; work of working with alcoholics in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fortworthaa.org/?page_id=219 |title=Frequently Asked Financial Questions |website=Fort Worth central office of Alcoholics Anonymous |access-date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 12th Step calls that come to the Central Office are handed to sober AA members who have volunteered to handle these calls. It also maintains service centers, which coordinate activities such as printing literature, responding to public inquiries, and organizing conferences. Other International General Service Offices (Australia, Costa Rica, Russia, etc.) are independent of AA World Services in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/aa_international.cfm?origpage=31 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous : International General Service Offices |work=Alcoholics Anonymous website |accessdate=8 October 2009 |archivedate=10 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010050316/http://www.aa.org/lang/en/aa_international.cfm?origpage=31 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AA's program is an inheritor of [[Counter-Enlightenment]] philosophy. AA shares the view that acceptance of one's inherent limitations is critical to finding one's proper place among other humans and God. Such ideas are described as &quot;Counter-Enlightenment&quot; because they are contrary to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideal that humans have the capacity to make their lives and societies a heaven on earth using their own power and reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUMPHREYS1995&quot;/&gt;
After evaluating AA's literature and observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view|worldview]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a ''quasi-religious organization''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RUDY1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rudy |first1=David R. |last2=Greil |first2=Arthur L. |title=Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Religious Organization?: Meditations on Marginality |volume=50 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.2307/3710917 |jstor=3710917 |journal=Sociological Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meetings===
AA meetings are &quot;quasi-ritualized therapeutic sessions run by and for, alcoholics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dimensions of Alcoholics Anonymous: 1935–1965|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=509 |year=1969 |doi=10.3109/10826086909062033 |last1=Leach |first1=Barry |last2=Norris |first2=John L. |last3=Dancey |first3=Travis |last4=Bissell |first4=Leclair}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually informal and often feature discussions with voluntary donations collected during meetings. (AA's 7th tradition encourages groups to be self-supporting, declining outside contributions).&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt; Local AA directories list weekly meetings. Those listed as &quot;closed&quot; are available to those with a self-professed &quot;desire to stop drinking,&quot; which cannot be challenged by another member on any grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRADITIONS1949&quot;/&gt; &quot;Open&quot; meetings are available to anyone (nonalcoholics can attend as observers).{{sfn|''The A.A. Group''|2016|p=13}} At '''speaker meetings''' (also known as gratitude meetings), one or more members who typically come in from a neighboring town's meeting tell their stories.   At '''Big Book meetings''', the group in attendance will take turns reading a passage from the AA Big Book and then discuss how they relate to it after.  At '''twelve step meetings''', the group will typically break out into subgroups depending on where they are in their program and start working on the twelve steps outlined in the program.  In addition to those three most common types of meetings, there are also other kinds of discussion meetings which tend to allocate the most time for general discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anonymous|first1=Alcoholics|title=SMF-177: Information on Alcoholics Anonymous|url=http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/f-2_InfoonAA.pdf|website=Alcoholics Anonymous|publisher=AA World Services Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirituality==
A study found an association between an increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use.  The research also found that AA was effective at helping [[agnostic]]s and [[atheist]]s become sober. The authors concluded that though spirituality was an important mechanism of behavioral change for some alcoholics, it was not the only effective mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John F.  et al. Spirituality in Recovery: A Lagged Mediational Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous' Principal Theoretical Mechanism of Behavior Change Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research Vol. 35, No. 3 March 2011 pp.&amp;nbsp;1–10&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1970s, a number of 'agnostic' or 'no-prayer' AA groups have begun across the U.S., Canada, and other parts of the world, which hold meetings that adhere to a tradition allowing alcoholics to freely express their doubts or disbelief that spirituality will help their recovery, and these meetings forgo use of opening or closing prayers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HNN2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=C. |first=Roger |publisher=Humanist Network News |date=Nov 2011 |title=A History of Agnsotic Groups in Alcoholics Anonymous: Part 1 |url=http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-11-a-history-of-agnostic-groups-in-alcoholics-anonymous |accessdate=12 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221225510/http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-11-a-history-of-agnostic-groups-in-alcoholics-anonymous |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2014&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Samuel |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 February 2014 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous, Without the Religion |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/alcoholics-anonymous-without-the-religion.html |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are online resources listing AA meetings for atheists and agnostics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agnosticaanyc.org/worldwide.html for example is a directory of agnostic AA meetings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease concept of alcoholism==
{{Main|Disease theory of alcoholism}}

More informally than not AA's membership has helped popularize the disease concept of alcoholism which had appeared in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Rush|title=Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind|publisher=Bartam|location=Philadelphia|year=1805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though AA usually avoids the term &quot;disease&quot;, 1973 conference-approved literature said &quot;we had the disease of alcoholism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Is A.A. for You? |date=11 January 2017 |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |location=New York |url=http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-3_isaaforyou.pdf |access-date=14 May 2017}}{{better source|reason=original 1973 version needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of official positions, since AA's inception, most members have believed alcoholism to be a disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhrm.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kurtz |first=Ernest |title=Alcoholics Anonymous and the disease concept of alcoholism |journal=Alcoholism Treatment Quarterly |volume=20 |issue=3–4 |pages=5–39 |date=2002 |url=http://www.bhrm.org/media/pdf/pub/AAandDiseaseConcept.pdf |access-date=13 May 2017 |doi=10.1300/j020v20n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AA's Big Book calls alcoholism &quot;an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.&quot; Ernest Kurtz says this is &quot;The closest the book Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bhrm.org&quot;/&gt; Somewhat divergently in his introduction to The Big Book, non-member and early benefactor [[William Duncan Silkworth|William Silkworth]] said those unable to moderate their drinking suffer from an [[allergy]]. In presenting the doctor's postulate AA said  &quot;The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little.  But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense.  It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous page xxvi&quot;&gt;''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page xxx&lt;/ref&gt; AA later acknowledged that &quot;alcoholism is not a true allergy, the experts now inform us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Living Sober |year=1975 |p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson explained in 1960 why AA had refrained from using the term &quot;disease&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We AAs have never called alcoholism a disease because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gately |first=Iain |date=2008 |title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol |publisher=Penguin Group |page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/417 417] |isbn=9781592403035 |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since then medical and scientific communities have generally concluded that alcoholism is an &quot;addictive disease&quot; (aka [[Alcohol Use Disorder]], Severe, Moderate, or Mild).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.epocrates.com/diseases/19836/Alcohol-use-disorder/Diagnostic-Criteria | title=Alcohol use disorder Diagnostic Criteria – Epocrates Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ten criteria are: alcoholism is a Primary Illness not caused by other illnesses nor by personality or character defects; second, an addiction gene is part of its etiology; third, alcoholism has predictable symptoms; fourth, it is progressive, becoming more severe even after long periods of abstinence; fifth, it is chronic and incurable; sixth, alcoholic drinking or other drug use persists in spite of negative consequences and efforts to quit; seventh, brain chemistry and neural functions change so alcohol is perceived as necessary for survival; eighth, it produces physical dependence and life-threatening withdrawal; ninth, it is a terminal illness; tenth, alcoholism can be treated and can be kept in remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2891917|year=2009|last1=Heilig|first1=M.|title=Translating the neuroscience of alcoholism into clinical treatments: From blocking the buzz to curing the blues|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|volume=35|issue=2|pages=334–344|last2=Thorsell|first2=A.|last3=Sommer|first3=W.

==Canadian and United States demographics==
AA's New York General Service Office regularly surveys AA members in North America. Its 2014 survey of over 6,000 members in Canada and the United States concluded that, in North America, AA members who responded to the survey were 62% male and 38% female.&lt;ref name=&quot;MembershipSurvey&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alcoholics Anonymous 2014 Membership Survey |publisher=AA World Services |date=2014 |url=http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-48_membershipsurvey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average member sobriety is slightly under 10 years with 36% sober more than ten years, 13% sober from five to ten years, 24% sober from one to five years, and 27% sober less than one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;MembershipSurvey&quot; /&gt; Before coming to AA, 63% of members received some type of treatment or counseling, such as medical, psychological, or spiritual. After coming to AA, 59% received outside treatment or counseling. Of those members, 84% said that outside help played an important part in their recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;MembershipSurvey&quot; /&gt;

The same survey showed that AA received 32% of its membership from other members, another 32% from treatment facilities, 30% were self-motivated to attend AA, 12% of its membership from court–ordered attendance, and only 1% of AA members decided to join based on information obtained from the Internet.  People taking the survey were allowed to select multiple answers for what motivated them to join AA.&lt;ref name=&quot;MembershipSurvey&quot; /&gt;

==Relationship with institutions==

===Hospitals===
Many AA meetings take place in treatment facilities. Carrying the message of AA into hospitals was how the co-founders of AA first remained sober. They discovered great value in working with alcoholics who are still suffering, and that even if the alcoholic they were working with did not stay sober, they did.&lt;ref name=cheever&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Cheever|first=Susan|title=Bill W.: The Healer|magazine=Time Magazine|date=14 June 1999|page=201|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991266,00.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|quote=by helping another alcoholic, he could save himself}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dickb&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=B. |first=Dick |title=Turning Point: A History of Early A.A.'s Spiritual Roots and Successes |year=1997 |publisher=Good Book Publishing Company |isbn=9781885803078 |page=[https://archive.org/details/turningpointhist00bdic/page/110 110] |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTAuj7PsApMC&amp;pg=PA110 |edition=Volume 10 |accessdate=13 May 2017 |chapter=Turning point |quote=Bill went back to Towns constantly to work on alcoholics there, simply trying to help others had kept him from even thinking of drinking |url=https://archive.org/details/turningpointhist00bdic/page/110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lois&gt;{{cite book|author=Lois|title=Lois remembers: memoirs of the co-founder of Al-Anon and wife of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous|year=1979|publisher=Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters|isbn=9780910034234|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdMPAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=lois+remembers&amp;dq=lois+remembers|edition=illustrated, reprint|accessdate=12 June 2013|quote=simply trying to help other had kept him from even thinking of drinking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Wilson wrote, &quot;Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |year=1976 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |edition=3rd |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Wilson visited Towns Hospital in New York City in an attempt to help the alcoholics who were patients there in 1934. At [[St. Thomas Hospital (Akron, Ohio)|St. Thomas Hospital]] in Akron, Ohio, Smith worked with still more alcoholics. In 1939, a New York mental institution, Rockland State Hospital, was one of the first institutions to allow AA hospital groups. Service to corrections and treatment facilities used to be combined until the General Service Conference, in 1977, voted to dissolve its Institutions Committee and form two separate committees, one for treatment facilities, and one for correctional facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.area62.org/committees/index.php?id=13 |title=Treatment Committee |date=n.d.|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=AA Area 62 (South Carolina) |accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisons===
In the United States and Canada, AA meetings are held in hundreds of correctional facilities. The AA General Service Office has published a workbook with detailed recommendations for methods of approaching correctional-facility officials with the intent of developing an in-prison AA program.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORRECTIONS1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Corrections Workbook |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous Word Services, Inc |year=1995 |location=New York |url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/m-45i_corrections.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2009 |archivedate=25 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025130526/http://aa.org/pdf/products/m-45i_corrections.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, AA publishes a variety of pamphlets specifically for the incarcerated alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORRECTIONS2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrections Catalog |url=http://www.aa.org/subpage.cfm?page=249 |accessdate=12 December 2009 |archivedate=28 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128044300/http://www.aa.org/subpage.cfm?page=249 |quote=The titles include: ''Carrying the Message into Correctional Facilities, Where Do I Go From Here?, A.A. in Prison: Inmate to Inmate, A.A. in Correctional Facilities, It Sure Beats Sitting in a Cell, Memo to an Inmate Who May be an Alcoholic, A Message to Corrections Administrators'' |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the AA General Service Office provides a pamphlet with guidelines for members working with incarcerated alcoholics.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUIDELINES&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=AA Guidelines from GSO: Cooperating with Court, DWI and Similar Programs |url=http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/mg-05_coopwithcourt.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128045635/http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/mg-05_coopwithcourt.pdf |accessdate=12 December 2009 |archivedate=28 November 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States court rulings===
{{see also|Rational Recovery#Court-mandated 12-step program attendance}}

United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained ''enough'' religious components (variously described in ''Griffin v. Coughlin'' below as, inter alia, &quot;religion&quot;, &quot;religious activity&quot;, &quot;religious exercise&quot;) to make coerced attendance at AA meetings a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCTAP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I96_0137.htm |title=IN THE MATTER OF DAVID GRIFFIN, APPELLANT, v.

===American treatment industry===
In 1939, [[High Watch Recovery Center]] in Kent, Connecticut was founded by Bill Wilson and Marty Mann.  Sister Francis who owned the farm tried to gift the spiritual retreat for alcoholics to Alcoholics Anonymous, however citing the sixth tradition Bill W. turned down the gift but agreed to have a separate non-profit board run the facility composed of AA members.  Bill Wilson and Marty Mann served on the High Watch board of directors for many years.  High Watch was the first and therefore the oldest 12-step-based treatment center in the world still operating today.

In 1949, the [[Hazelden]] treatment center was founded and staffed by AA members, and since then many alcoholic rehabilitation clinics have incorporated AA's precepts into their treatment programs.{{sfn|Robertson|1988|p=220}} 32% of AA's membership was introduced to it through a treatment facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;MembershipSurvey&quot; /&gt;

===United Kingdom treatment industry===
A cross-sectional survey of substance-misuse treatment providers in the West Midlands found fewer than 10% integrated twelve-step methods in their practice and only a third felt their consumers were suited for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous membership. Less than half were likely to recommend self-help groups to their clients. Providers with nursing qualifications were more likely to make such referrals than those without them. A statistically significant correlation was found between providers' self-reported level of spirituality and their likelihood of recommending AA or NA.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAY2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2005 |title=United Kingdom substance misuse treatment workers' attitudes toward 12-step self-help groups |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |volume=29 |issue=4  |pages=321–327 |doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2005.08.009 |pmid=16311185 |last1=Day |first1=E |last2=Gaston |first2=RL |last3=Furlong |first3=E |last4=Murali |first4=V |last5=Copello |first5=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thirteenth-stepping===
&lt;!-- &quot;Thirteenth Stepping&quot; redirects to this section --&gt;
&quot;Thirteenth-stepping&quot; is a pejorative term for AA members approaching new members for dates.  A study in the ''Journal of Addiction Nursing'' sampled 55 women in AA and found that 35% of these women had experienced a &quot;[[wikt:make a pass at|pass]]&quot; and 29% had felt seduced at least once in AA settings. This has also happened with new male members who received guidance from older female AA members, in pursuit of sexual company. The authors suggest that both men and women need to be prepared for this behavior or find male-only or female-only groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOGART2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Addictions Nursing: A Journal for the Prevention and Management of Addictions |title='13th-Stepping:' Why Alcoholics Anonymous Is Not Always a Safe Place for Women |last=Bogart |first=Cathy J. |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=43–47 |doi=10.1080/10884600305373 |issn=1548-7148 |oclc=34618968 |last2=Bogart |first2=Cathy J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women report feeling safe in AA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/07/no-alcoholics-anonymous-is-not-ill-suited-to-women/277738/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|title=No, Alcoholics Anonymous Is Not 'Ill-Suited to Women'|author=Amy Gutman|date=12 July 2013}} The author describes her &quot;profound uneasiness&quot; with the characterization that Alcoholics Anonymous is a place &quot;for vulnerable women to be preyed upon by men&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; women-only meetings are a very prevalent part of AA culture, and AA has become more welcoming for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15560350903543766|title=Acknowledging Gender in Women-Only Meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous|journal=Journal of Groups in Addiction &amp; Recovery|volume=5|pages=17–33|year=2010|last1=Sanders|first1=Jolene M.|quote=AA has evolved in a dialectical fashion to become more accommodating to women}}&lt;/ref&gt; AA's pamphlet on sponsorship suggests that men be sponsored by men and women be sponsored by women.&lt;ref&gt;Questions and Answers on Sponsorship, page 10. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderation or abstinence===
{{see also|Alcoholism#Management}}

[[Stanton Peele]] argued that some AA groups apply the [[Disease model of addiction|disease model]] to all problem drinkers, whether or not they are &quot;full-blown&quot; alcoholics.{{sfn|Peele|1989}} Along with Nancy Shute, Peele has advocated that besides AA, other options should be readily available to those problem drinkers who are able to manage their drinking with the right treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;SHUTE1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shute | first = Nancy | title = The drinking dilemma: by calling abstinence the only cure, we ensure that the nation's $100 billion alcohol problem won't be solved | journal = [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | volume = 123 | issue = 9 |date=September 1997 | pages = 54–64 |url=http://silkworth.net/magazine_newspaper/us_news_world_report_sep_8_1997.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Book says &quot;moderate drinkers&quot; and &quot;a certain type of hard drinker&quot; are able to stop or moderate their drinking. The Big Book suggests no program for these drinkers, but instead seeks to help drinkers without &quot;power of choice in drink.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page 20-1,24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural identity===
One review of AA warned of detrimental [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] effects of twelve-step philosophy and concluded that AA uses many methods that are also used by cults.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALEXANDER1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Francesa |first2=Michele |last2=Rollins |year=1985 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous: the unseen cult |journal=California Sociologist |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=33–48 |issn=0162-8712 |oclc=4025459 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[California State University]] |url=http://www.silkworth.net/sociology/Soc63OCR.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201224839/http://silkworth.net/sociology/Soc63OCR.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study concluded, however, that AA's program bore little resemblance to religious cults because the techniques used appeared beneficial.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shared Ideology in Alcoholics Anonymous: A Grounded Theory Approach |doi=10.1080/108107397127806 |year=1997 |last1=Right |first1=Kevin B.
