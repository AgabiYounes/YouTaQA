'''Aphasia''' is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific [[brain]] regions.&lt;ref name = &quot;Damasio 1992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Damasio AR | title = Aphasia | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 326 | issue = 8 | pages = 531–9 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1732792 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199202203260806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The major causes are a cerebral vascular accident ([[stroke]]), or head trauma, but aphasia can also be the result of brain tumors, brain infections, or neurodegenerative diseases such as [[dementia]]. However, the latter are far less common and so not as often mentioned when discussing aphasia.&lt;ref name = &quot;ASHA Aphasia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Aphasia/ |title=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA):- Aphasia |format= |work=asha.org |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's speech or language must be significantly impaired in one (or more) of the four aspects of communication following acquired brain injury, or have significant decline over a short time period (progressive aphasia). The four aspects of communication are auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading and writing, and functional communication.

The difficulties of people with aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words, to losing the ability to speak, read, or write; intelligence, however, is unaffected.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASHA Aphasia&quot;/&gt; Expressive language and receptive language can both be affected as well. Aphasia also affects [[visual language]] such as [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Damasio 1992&quot; /&gt; In contrast, the use of [[formulaic language|formulaic expressions]] in everyday communication is often preserved.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sidtis 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stahl B, Van Lancker Sidtis D | title = Tapping into neural resources of communication: formulaic language in aphasia therapy | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 1526 | pages = 1526 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26539131 | pmc = 4611089 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while a person with aphasia, particularly [[expressive aphasia|Broca's aphasia]], may not be able to ask a loved one when their birthday is, they may still be able to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. One prevalent deficit in the aphasias is [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]], which is a difficulty in finding the correct word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M. Hunter | name-list-format = vanc |title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|date=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-1-4496-5244-9 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSRjCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=aphasia&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With aphasia, one or more modes of communication in the brain have been damaged and are therefore functioning incorrectly. Aphasia is not caused by damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits, which produces [[dysarthria|abnormal speech]]; that is, aphasia is not related to the mechanics of [[speech]] but rather the individual's language cognition (although a person can have both problems, particularly if they suffered a hemorrhage that damaged a large area of the brain). An individual's &quot;language&quot; is the socially shared set of rules, as well as the thought processes that go behind verbalized speech. It is not a result of a more peripheral motor or sensory difficulty, such as [[paralysis]] affecting the speech muscles or a general hearing impairment.

Aphasia affects about 2 million people in the US and 250,000 people in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/aphasia-statistics/ | title=Aphasia Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 180,000 people acquire the disorder every year in the US alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aphasia Fact sheet - National Aphasia Association |url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-resources/aphasia-factsheet/ |website=National Aphasia Association|access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person of any age can develop aphasia, given that it is often caused by a traumatic injury. However, people who are middle aged and older are the most likely to experience the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5502-aphasia | title=Aphasia: Who is at risk for aphasia? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older individuals have the highest risk of developing aphasia because the danger of stroke increases with age: approximately 75% of all strokes occur in individuals over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.strokecenter.org/patients/about-stroke/stroke-statistics/ | title=Stroke Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strokes account for most documented cases of aphasia:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-faqs/ | title=Aphasia FAQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25% - 40% of people who survive a stroke develop aphasia as a result of damage to the language-processing regions of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/brain/aphasia-causes-symptoms-types-treatments#1 | title= An overview of aphasia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
People with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury, although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems, such as [[dysarthria]] or [[apraxia]], and not primarily due to aphasia. Aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain. Signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication.&lt;ref&gt;American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (1997-2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like ''thing''. So when asked to name a pencil they may say it is a thing used to write.&lt;ref&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2014). Neurodevelopmental and Neurocognitive Disorders. In ''Abnormal Psychology'' (6th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related behaviors===
Given the previously stated signs and symptoms the following behaviors are often seen in people with aphasia as a result of attempted compensation for incurred speech and language deficits:
* Self-repairs: Further disruptions in fluent speech as a result of mis-attempts to repair erred speech production.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
* Speech disfluencies: Include previously mentioned disfluencies including repetitions and prolongations at the phonemic, syllable and word level presenting in pathological/ severe levels of frequency.
* Struggle in non-fluent aphasias: A severe increase in expelled effort to speak after a life where talking and communicating was an ability that came so easily can cause visible frustration.
* Preserved and automatic language: A behavior in which some language or language sequences that were used so frequently, prior to onset, they still possess the ability to produce them with more ease than other language post onset.
* Poor eyesight (Oral Dysmorphia) usually characterized by tingling in the arms and legs, and sometimes heart disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M. Hunter|title=Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders|date=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|location=Burlington, MA|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subcortical====
* Subcortical aphasias characteristics and symptoms depend upon the site and size of subcortical lesion. Possible sites of lesions include the [[thalamus]], internal capsule, and basal ganglia.

==Causes==
[[File:Aphasia.png|thumb|Regions of the left hemisphere that can give rise to aphasia when damaged&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesion correlates of patholinguisti&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henseler I, Regenbrecht F, Obrig H | title = Lesion correlates of patholinguistic profiles in chronic aphasia: comparisons of syndrome-, modality- and symptom-level assessment | journal = Brain | volume = 137 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 918–30 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24525451 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awt374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Aphasia is most often caused by stroke, but any disease or damage to the parts   of the brain that control language can cause aphasia. Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and progressive neurological disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, aphasia may also result from [[herpesviral encephalitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soares-Ishigaki EC, Cera ML, Pieri A, Ortiz KZ | title = Aphasia and herpes virus encephalitis: a case study | journal =   Sao Paulo Medical Journal| volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 336–41 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23174874 | doi = 10.1590/S1516-31802012000500011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[herpes simplex virus]] affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naudé H, Pretorius E | title = Can herpes simplex virus encephalitis cause aphasia? | journal = Early Child Development and Care | date =  3 Jun 2010 | volume = 173 | issue = 6 | pages = 669–679 | doi = 10.1080/0300443032000088285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In acute disorders, such as head injury or stroke, aphasia usually develops quickly. When caused by brain tumor, [[infection]], or [[dementia]], it develops more slowly.&lt;ref name = &quot;ASHA Aphasia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;medicinenet.com&quot; &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medicinenet.com/aphasia/article.htm | title = Aphasia | access-date = 2011-05-23 | work = MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial damage to tissue anywhere within the region shown in blue on the figure which is shown at the right can potentially result in aphasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lesion correlates of patholinguisti&quot;/&gt; Aphasia can also sometimes be caused by damage to subcortical structures deep within the left hemisphere, including the [[thalamus]], the [[Internal capsule|internal]] and [[external capsule]]s, and the [[caudate nucleus]] of the basal ganglia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuljic-Obradovic DC | title = Subcortical aphasia: three different language disorder syndromes? | journal = European Journal of Neurology | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 445–8 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12823499 | doi = 10.1046/j.1468-1331.2003.00604.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kreisler A, Godefroy O, Delmaire C, Debachy B, Leclercq M, Pruvo JP, Leys D | title = The anatomy of aphasia revisited | journal = Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 1117–23 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10720284 | doi = 10.1212/wnl.54.5.1117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area and extent of brain damage or [[atrophy]] will determine the type of aphasia and its symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASHA Aphasia&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;medicinenet.com&quot; /&gt; A very small number of people can experience aphasia after damage to the [[right hemisphere]] only. It has been suggested that these individuals may have had an unusual brain organization prior to their illness or injury, with perhaps greater overall reliance on the right hemisphere for language skills than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coppens P, Hungerford S, Yamaguchi S, Yamadori A | title = Crossed aphasia: an analysis of the symptoms, their frequency, and a comparison with left-hemisphere aphasia symptomatology | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 425–63 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12468397 | doi = 10.1016/s0093-934x(02)00510-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mariën P, Paghera B, De Deyn PP, Vignolo LA | title = Adult crossed aphasia in dextrals revisited | journal = Cortex; A Journal Devoted to the Study of the Nervous System and Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–74 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 15070002 | doi = 10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70920-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary progressive aphasia]] (PPA), while its name can be misleading, is actually a form of dementia that has some symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It is characterized by a gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Primary Progressive Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/Glossary/Primary-Progressive-Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epilepsy]] can also include transient aphasia as a [[prodromal]] or episodic symptom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blumenfeld H, Meador KJ | title = Consciousness as a useful concept in epilepsy classification | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 55 | issue = 8 | pages = 1145–50 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24981294 | pmc = 4149314 | doi = 10.1111/epi.12588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aphasia is also listed as a rare side-effect of the [[fentanyl]] patch, an opioid used to control chronic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/pro/fentanyl-transdermal.html#A02A9CB6-35CF-4F01-A980-C3733E0F861A |title=Fentanyl Transdermal Official FDA information, side effects and uses |format= |work=Drug Information Online |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Aphasia is best thought of as a collection of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of just one or two words at a time).

However, no such broad-based grouping has proven fully adequate. There is wide variation among people even within the same broad grouping, and aphasias can be highly selective. For instance, people with naming deficits (anomic aphasia) might show an inability only for naming buildings, or people, or colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kolb, Bryan |author2=Whishaw, Ian Q. |title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology |publisher=Worth |location=[New York] |year=2003 |pages= 502, 505, 511|isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1 |oclc=464808209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that there are typical difficulties with speech and language that come with normal aging as well.  As we age language can become more difficult to process resulting in a slowing of verbal comprehension, reading abilities and more likely word finding difficulties. With each of these though, unlike some aphasias, functionality within daily life remains intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M.

*Individuals with Wernicke's' aphasia, also referred to as receptive or fluent aphasia, may speak in long sentences that have no meaning, add unnecessary words, and even create new &quot;words&quot; ([[neologism]]s). For example, someone with receptive aphasia may say, &quot;delicious taco&quot;, meaning &quot;The dog needs to go out so I will take him for a walk&quot;. They have poor auditory and reading comprehension, and fluent, but nonsensical, oral and written expression. Individuals with receptive aphasia usually have great difficulty understanding the speech of both themselves and others and are, therefore, often unaware of their mistakes. Receptive language deficits usually arise from lesions in the posterior portion of the left hemisphere at or near Wernicke's area.&lt;ref&gt;Manasco, M. H. (2014).

*Individuals with Broca's aphasia frequently speak short, meaningful phrases that are produced with great effort. It is thus characterized as a nonfluent aphasia. Affected people often omit small words such as &quot;is&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, and &quot;the&quot;. For example, a person with expressive aphasia may say, &quot;walk dog&quot;, which could mean &quot;I will take the dog for a walk&quot;, &quot;you take the dog for a walk&quot; or even &quot;the dog walked out of the yard&quot;. Individuals with expressive aphasia are able to understand the speech of others to varying degrees. Because of this, they are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated by their speaking problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookshire 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brookshire R |title=Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders (7th edition). St. Louis, MO: Mosby}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Broca's aphasia may appear to be solely an issue with language production, evidence suggests that Broca's aphasia may be rooted in an inability to process syntactical information.&lt;ref&gt;Embick, D., Marantz, A., Miyashita, Y., O'Neil, W., &amp; Sakai, K. L. (2000). A syntactic specialization for Broca's area. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 97(11), 6150-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with Broca's aphasia may have a speech automatism (also called recurring or recurrent utterance. These speech automatisms can be repeated lexical speech automatisms; e.g., modalisations ('I can't..., I can't...'), expletives/swearwords, numbers ('one two, one two') or non-lexical utterances made up of repeated, legal but meaningless, consonant-vowel syllables (e.g.., /tan tan/, /bi bi/). In severe cases the individual may be able to utter only the same speech automatism each time they attempt speech. (examples taken from [Reference for this addition] Code, C. (1982) Neurolinguistic analysis of recurrent utterances in aphasia. Cortex, 18, 141‑152.)
*Individuals with anomic aphasia have difficulty with naming. People with this aphasia may have difficulties naming certain words, linked by their grammatical type (e.g., difficulty naming verbs and not nouns) or by their [[semantic]] category (e.g., difficulty naming words relating to photography but nothing else) or a more general naming difficulty. People tend to produce grammatic, yet empty, speech.

*Individuals with conduction aphasia have deficits in the connections between the speech-comprehension and speech-production areas. This might be caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, the structure that transmits information between Wernicke's area and Broca's area. Similar symptoms, however, can be present after damage to the [[insular cortex|insula]] or to the [[auditory cortex]]. Auditory comprehension is near normal, and oral expression is fluent with occasional paraphasic errors. Paraphasic errors include phonemic/literal or semantic/verbal. Repetition ability is poor.   Conduction and transcortical aphasias are caused by damage to the white matter tracts. These aphasias spare the cortex of the [[language center]]s but instead create a disconnection between them. Conduction aphasia is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca's and Wernicke's areas. People with conduction aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. People with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors.&lt;ref name = &quot;Brookshire 2007&quot;/&gt; Two forms of conduction aphasia have been described: ''reproduction conduction aphasia'' (repetition of a single relatively unfamiliar multisyllabic word) and ''repetition conduction aphasia'' (repetition of unconnected short familiar words &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shallice|first=Tim|last2=Warrington|first2=Elizabeth K.|date=October 1977|title=Auditory-verbal short-term memory impairment and conduction aphasia|journal=Brain and Language|volume=4|issue=4|pages=479–491|doi=10.1016/0093-934x(77)90040-2|pmid=922463|issn=0093-934X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical-localizationist approaches===
[[Image:BrocasAreaSmall.png|thumb|Cortex]]
Localizationist approaches aim to classify the aphasias according to their major presenting characteristics and the regions of the brain that most probably gave rise to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodglass, H. 2001&quot;&gt;Goodglass, H., Kaplan, E., &amp; Barresi, B. (2001). The assessment of aphasia and related disorders. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kertesz, A. (2006). Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R). Austin, TX: Pro-Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the early work of nineteenth-century neurologists [[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]], these approaches identify two major subtypes of aphasia and several more minor subtypes:

* [[Expressive aphasia]] (also known as &quot;motor aphasia&quot; or &quot;Broca's aphasia&quot;), which is characterized by halted, fragmented, effortful speech, but well-preserved comprehension ''relative to expression''. Damage is typically in the anterior portion of the left hemisphere,&lt;ref name=&quot;Common Classifications of Aphasia&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Common Classifications of Aphasia|url = http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Clinical-Topics/Aphasia/Common-Classifications-of-Aphasia/|website = www.asha.org|access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably [[Broca's area]]. Individuals with Broca's aphasia often have [[hemiplegia|right-sided weakness]] or paralysis of the arm and leg, because the left frontal lobe is also important for body movement, particularly on the right side.
* [[Receptive aphasia]] (also known as &quot;sensory aphasia&quot; or &quot;Wernicke's aphasia&quot;), which is characterized by fluent speech, but marked difficulties understanding words and sentences. Although fluent, the speech may lack in key substantive words (nouns, verbs, adjectives), and may contain incorrect words or even nonsense words. This subtype has been associated with damage to the posterior left temporal cortex, most notably Wernicke's area. These individuals usually have no body weakness, because their brain injury is not near the parts of the brain that control movement.
* [[Conduction aphasia]], where speech remains fluent, and comprehension is preserved, but the person may have disproportionate difficulty where repeating words or sentences. Damage typically involves the [[arcuate fasciculus]] and the left parietal region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Common Classifications of Aphasia&quot;/&gt;
* [[Transcortical motor aphasia]] and [[transcortical sensory aphasia]], which are similar to Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia respectively, but the ability to repeat words and sentences is disproportionately preserved.

Recent classification schemes adopting this approach, such as the &quot;Boston-Neoclassical Model&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodglass, H. 2001&quot;/&gt; also group these classical aphasia subtypes into two larger classes: the nonfluent aphasias (which encompasses Broca's aphasia and transcortical motor aphasia) and the fluent aphasias (which encompasses Wernicke's aphasia, conduction aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia). These schemes also identify several further aphasia subtypes, including: [[anomic aphasia]], which is characterized by a selective difficulty finding the names for things; and [[global aphasia]], where both expression and comprehension of speech are severely compromised.

Many localizationist approaches also recognize the existence of additional, more &quot;pure&quot; forms of language disorder that may affect only a single language skill.&lt;ref name=&quot;KolbWhishaw1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of human neuropsychology|author1=Kolb, Bryan|author2=Whishaw, Ian Q.|publisher=Worth|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7167-5300-1|location=[New York]|pages=502–504|oclc=464808209}}&lt;!-- The whole paragraph &quot;fluent, non-fluent and pure aphasias&quot; is written with help of this reference.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[pure alexia]], a person may be able to write but not read, and in [[pure word deafness]], they may be able to produce speech and to read, but not understand speech when it is spoken to them.

===Cognitive neuropsychological approaches===
Although localizationist approaches provide a useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, one problem is that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Godefroy O, Dubois C, Debachy B, Leclerc M, Kreisler A | title = Vascular aphasias: main characteristics of patients hospitalized in acute stroke units | journal = Stroke | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 702–5 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11872891 | doi = 10.1161/hs0302.103653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ross K.B. |author2=Wertz R.T. | year = 2001 | title = Type and severity of aphasia during the first seven months poststroke | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 31–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is that the categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience.

Instead of categorizing every individual into a specific subtype, cognitive neuropsychological approaches aim to identify the key language skills or &quot;modules&quot; that are not functioning properly in each individual. A person could potentially have difficulty with just one module, or with a number of modules. This type of approach requires a framework or theory as to what skills/modules are needed to perform different kinds of language tasks. For example, the model of [[Max Coltheart]] identifies a module that recognizes [[phonemes]] as they are spoken, which is essential for any task involving recognition of words. Similarly, there is a module that stores phonemes that the person is planning to produce in speech, and this module is critical for any task involving the production of long words or long strings of speech. Once a theoretical framework has been established, the functioning of each module can then be assessed using a specific test or set of tests. In the clinical setting, use of this model usually involves conducting a battery of assessments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Coltheart, Max |author2=Kay, Janice |author3=Lesser, Ruth |title=PALPA psycholinguistic assessments of language processing in aphasia |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=978-0-86377-166-8 |oclc= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, G., &amp; Howard, D. (2004). CAT: comprehensive aphasia test. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; each of which tests one or a number of these modules. Once a diagnosis is reached as to the skills/modules where the most significant impairment lies, therapy can proceed to treat these skills.

===Progressive aphasias===
[[Primary progressive aphasia]] (PPA) is a neurodegenerative focal dementia that can be associated with progressive illnesses or dementia, such as 
[[frontotemporal dementia]] / [[Pick's disease|Pick Complex]] [[Motor neuron disease]], [[Progressive supranuclear palsy]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]], which is the gradual process of progressively losing the ability to think. Gradual loss of language function occurs in the context of relatively well-preserved memory, visual processing, and personality until the advanced stages. Symptoms usually begin with word-finding problems (naming) and progress to impaired grammar (syntax) and comprehension (sentence processing and semantics).&lt;American Speech-Language-Hearing Association&gt; The loss of language before the loss of memory differentiates PPA from typical dementias. People suffering from PPA may have difficulties comprehending what others are saying. They can also have difficulty trying to find the right words to make a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mesulam MM | title = Primary progressive aphasia | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–32 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11310619 | doi = 10.1002/ana.91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson SM, Henry ML, Besbris M, Ogar JM, Dronkers NF, Jarrold W, Miller BL, Gorno-Tempini ML | display-authors = 6 | title = Connected speech production in three variants of primary progressive aphasia | journal = Brain | volume = 133 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 2069–88 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20542982 | pmc = 2892940 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awq129 | url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/133/7/2069.long#xref-ref-18-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harciarek Kertesz 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harciarek M, Kertesz A | title = Primary progressive aphasias and their contribution to the contemporary knowledge about the brain-language relationship | journal = Neuropsychology Review | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–87 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21809067 | pmc = 3158975 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-011-9175-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classifications of Primary Progressive Aphasia : [[Progressive nonfluent aphasia]] (PNFA), [[Semantic Dementia]] (SD), and [[Logopenic progressive aphasia]] (LPA)&lt;ref name=&quot;Harciarek Kertesz 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorno-Tempini 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gorno-Tempini ML, Hillis AE, Weintraub S, Kertesz A, Mendez M, Cappa SF, Ogar JM, Rohrer JD, Black S, Boeve BF, Manes F, Dronkers NF, Vandenberghe R, Rascovsky K, Patterson K, Miller BL, Knopman DS, Hodges JR, Mesulam MM, Grossman M | display-authors = 6 | title = Classification of primary progressive aphasia and its variants | journal = Neurology | volume = 76 | issue = 11 | pages = 1006–14 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21325651 | pmc = 3059138 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31821103e6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jargon aphasia|Progressive Jargon Aphasia]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  is a fluent or receptive aphasia in which the person's [[Speech communication|speech]] is incomprehensible, but appears to make sense to them. Speech is fluent and effortless with intact [[syntax]] and [[grammar]], but the person has problems with the selection of [[noun]]s. Either they will replace the desired word with another that sounds or looks like the original one or has some other connection or they will replace it with [[sound]]s. As such, people with jargon aphasia often use [[neologism]]s, and may [[perseveration|perseverate]] if they try to replace the words they cannot find with sounds. Substitutions commonly involve picking another (actual) word starting with the same sound (e.g., clocktower - colander), picking another semantically related to the first (e.g., letter - scroll), or picking one phonetically similar to the intended one (e.g., lane - late).

===Deaf aphasia===
There have been many instances showing that there is a form of aphasia among deaf individuals. Sign languages are, after all, forms of language that have been shown to use the same areas of the brain as verbal forms of language. Mirror neurons become activated when an animal is acting in a particular way or watching another individual act in the same manner. These mirror neurons are important in giving an individual the ability to mimic movements of hands. Broca's area of speech production has been shown to contain several of these mirror neurons resulting in significant similarities of brain activity between sign language and vocal speech communication. Facial communication is a significant portion of how animals interact with each other. Humans use facial movements to create, what other humans perceive, to be faces of emotions. While combining these facial movements with speech, a more full form of language is created which enables the species to interact with a much more complex and detailed form of communication. Sign language also uses these facial movements and emotions along with the primary hand movement way of communicating. These facial movement forms of communication come from the same areas of the brain. When dealing with damages to certain areas of the brain, vocal forms of communication are in jeopardy of severe forms of aphasia. Since these same areas of the brain are being used for sign language, these same, at least very similar, forms of aphasia can show in the Deaf community. Individuals can show a form of Wernicke's aphasia with sign language and they show deficits in their abilities in being able to produce any form of expressions. Broca's aphasia shows up in some people, as well. These individuals find tremendous difficulty in being able to actually sign the linguistic concepts they are trying to express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil| name-list-format = vanc |title=Physiology of Behavior |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson |location=New York |pages=494–496 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Severity ===
The severity of the type of aphasia varies depending on the size of the stroke. However, there is much variance between how often one type of severity occurs in certain types of aphasia. &amp;nbsp;For instance, any type of aphasia can range from mild to profound. Regardless of the severity of aphasia, people can make improvements due to spontaneous recovery and treatment in the acute stages of recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Additionally, while most studies propose that the greatest outcomes occur in people with severe aphasia when treatment is provided in the acute stages of recovery, Robey (1998) also found that those with severe aphasia are capable of making strong language gains in the chronic stage of recovery as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; This finding implies that persons with aphasia have the potential to have functional outcomes regardless of how severe their aphasia may be.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; While there is no distinct pattern of the outcomes of aphasia based on severity alone, global aphasia typically makes functional language gains, but may be gradual since global aphasia affects many language areas.

==Cognitive Deficits in Aphasia==
While aphasia has traditionally been described in terms of language deficits, there is increasing evidence that many people with aphasia commonly experience co-occurring non-linguistic cognitive deficits.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Laura L. | name-list-format = vanc |date=May 2012|title=Attention and Other Cognitive Deficits in Aphasia: Presence and Relation to Language and Communication Measures|journal=American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=S51-64 |doi=10.1044/1058-0360(2012/11-0067)|pmid=22230179 |issn=1058-0360|url=http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/2222/1/38-45-1-RV.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, cognitive deficits, such as attention and working memory constitute the underlying cause of language impairment in people with aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hula WD, McNeil MR | title = Models of attention and dual-task performance as explanatory constructs in aphasia | journal = Seminars in Speech and Language | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–87; quiz C 3–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18720315 | doi = 10.1055/s-0028-1082882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that cognitive deficits often co-occur but are comparable to cognitive deficits in stroke patients without aphasia and reflect general brain dysfunction following injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonseca J, Raposo A, Martins IP | title = Cognitive performance and aphasia recovery | journal = Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–136 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29072540 | doi = 10.1080/10749357.2017.1390904 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which deficits in attention and other cognitive domains underlie language deficits in aphasia is still unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Villard |first=Sarah |last2=Kira n|first2=Swathi | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-10-03 |title=To what extent does attention underlie language in aphasia? |journal=Aphasiology |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1226–1245 |doi=10.1080/02687038.2016.1242711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the severity of cognitive deficits in people with aphasia has been associated with lower quality of life, even more so than the severity of language deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Nicholas M, Hunsaker E, Guarino AJ |date=2017-06-03|title=The relation between language, non-verbal cognition and quality of life in people with aphasia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=688–702 |doi=10.1080/02687038.2015.1076927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, cognitive deficits may influence language treatment outcomes in aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dignam J, Copland D, O'Brien K, Burfein P, Khan A, Rodriguez AD | title = Influence of Cognitive Ability on Therapy Outcomes for Anomia in Adults With Chronic Poststroke Aphasia | journal = Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 406–421 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28199471 | doi = 10.1044/2016_JSLHR-L-15-0384 | url = https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:505087/UQ505087_OA.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambon Ralph MA, Snell C, Fillingham JK, Conroy P, Sage K | title = Predicting the outcome of anomia therapy for people with aphasia post CVA: both language and cognitive status are key predictors | journal = Neuropsychological Rehabilitation | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 289–305 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20077315 | doi = 10.1080/09602010903237875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-linguistic cognitive deficits have also been the target of interventions directed at improving language ability, though outcomes are not definitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray LL, Keeton RJ, Karcher L | title = Treating attention in mild aphasia: evaluation of attention process training-II | journal = Journal of Communication Disorders | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–61 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16039661 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcomdis.2005.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some studies have demonstrated language improvement secondary to cognitively-focused treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peach RK, Beck KM, Gorman M, Fisher C | title = Clinical Outcomes Following Language-Specific Attention Treatment Versus Direct Attention Training for Aphasia: A Comparative Effectiveness Study | journal = Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research | volume = 62 | issue = 8 | pages = 2785–2811 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31348732 | doi = 10.1044/2019_JSLHR-L-18-0504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others have found little evidence that the treatment of cognitive deficits in people with aphasia has an influence on language outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nouwens F, de Lau LM, Visch-Brink EG, van de Sandt-Koenderman WM, Lingsma HF, Goosen S, Blom DM, Koudstaal PJ, Dippel DW | display-authors = 6 | title = Efficacy of early cognitive-linguistic treatment for aphasia due to stroke: A randomised controlled trial (Rotterdam Aphasia Therapy Study-3) | journal = European Stroke Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–136 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 29900407 | pmc = 5992741 | doi = 10.1177/2396987317698327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important caveat in the measurement and treatment of cognitive deficits in people with aphasia is the degree to which assessments of cognition rely on language abilities for successful performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mayer JF, Murray LL | title = Measuring working memory deficits in aphasia | journal = Journal of Communication Disorders | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 325–39 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22771135 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcomdis.2012.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies have attempted to circumvent this challenge by utilizing non-verbal cognitive assessments to evaluate cognitive ability in people with aphasia. However, the degree to which these tasks are truly ‘non-verbal’ and not mediated by language in unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; For instance, Wall et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; found that language and non-linguistic performance was related, except when non-linguistic performance was measured by ‘real life’ cognitive tasks.

==Prevention of Aphasia==
Aphasia is largely caused by unavoidable instances. However, some precautions can be taken to decrease risk for experiencing one of the two major causes of aphasia: stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). To decrease the probability of having an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, one should take the following precautions:
* Exercising regularly
* Eating a healthy diet, avoiding cholesterol in particular
* Keeping alcohol consumption low and avoiding tobacco use
* Controlling blood pressure&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
* Going to the emergency room immediately if you begin to experience unilateral extremity (especially leg) swelling, warmth, redness, and/or tenderness as these are symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis which can lead to a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.emedicinehealth.com/blood_clot_in_the_legs/article_em.htm | title=DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis Blood Clot in the Leg) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent aphasia due to traumatic injury, one sure take precautionary measures when engaging in dangerous activities such as:
* Wearing a helmet when operating a bicycle, motor cycle, ATV, or any other moving vehicle that could potential be involved in an accident.
* Wearing a seatbelt when driving or riding in a car.
* Wearing proper protective gear when playing contact sports, especially American football, rugby, and hockey, or refraining from such activities.
* Minimizing anticoagulant use (including aspirin) if at all possible as they increase the risk of hemorrhage after a head injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.2534 |pmid=24915005 |pmc=4527047 |title=Benefits and Risks of Anticoagulation Resumption Following Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine |volume=174 |issue=8 |pages=1244–51 |year=2014 |last1=Albrecht |first1=Jennifer S. |last2=Liu |first2=Xinggang |last3=Baumgarten |first3=Mona |last4=Langenberg |first4=Patricia |last5=Rattinger |first5=Gail B. |last6=Smith |first6=Gordon S. |last7=Gambert |first7=Steven R. |last8=Gottlieb |first8=Stephen S. |last9=Zuckerman |first9=Ilene H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, one should always seek medical attention after sustaining head trauma due to a fall or accident. The sooner that one receives medical attention for a traumatic brain injury, the less likely one is to experience long-term or severe effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/179837.php#diagnosis | title=Causes and effects of traumatic brain injuries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

When addressing Wernicke's aphasia, according to Bakheit et al. (2007), the lack of awareness of the language impairments, a common characteristic of Wernicke's aphasia, may affect the rate and extent of therapy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakheit AM, Shaw S, Carrington S, Griffiths S | title = The rate and extent of improvement with therapy from the different types of aphasia in the first year after stroke | journal = Clinical Rehabilitation | volume = 21 | issue = 10 | pages = 941–9 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17981853 | doi = 10.1177/0269215507078452 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robey (1998) determined that at least 2 hours of treatment per week is recommended for making significant language gains.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robey RR | title = A meta-analysis of clinical outcomes in the treatment of aphasia | journal = Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 172–87 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9493743 | doi = 10.1044/jslhr.4101.172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spontaneous recovery may cause some language gains, but without speech-language therapy, the outcomes can be half as strong as those with therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

When addressing Broca's aphasia, better outcomes occur when the person participates in therapy, and treatment is more effective than no treatment for people in the acute period.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Two or more hours of therapy per week in acute and post-acute stages produced the greatest results.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; High-intensity therapy was most effective, and low-intensity therapy was almost equivalent to no therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

People with global aphasia are sometimes referred to as having irreversible aphasic syndrome, often making limited gains in auditory comprehension, and recovering no functional language modality with therapy. With this said, people with global aphasia may retain gestural communication skills that may enable success when communicating with conversational partners within familiar conditions. Process-oriented treatment options are limited, and people may not become competent language users as readers, listeners, writers, or speakers no matter how extensive therapy is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookshire 2007&quot; /&gt; However, people's daily routines and quality of life can be enhanced with reasonable and modest goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookshire 2007&quot; /&gt;  After the first month, there is limited to no healing to language abilities of most people. There is a grim prognosis leaving 83% who were globally aphasic after the first month they will remain globally aphasic at the first year. Some people are so severely impaired that their existing process-oriented treatment approaches offer signs of progress, and therefore cannot justify the cost of therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookshire 2007&quot; /&gt;

Perhaps due to the relative rareness of conduction aphasia, few studies have specifically studied the effectiveness of therapy for people with this type of aphasia. From the studies performed, results showed that therapy can help to improve specific language outcomes. One intervention that has had positive results is auditory repetition training. Kohn et al. (1990) reported that drilled auditory repetition training related to improvements in spontaneous speech, Francis et al. (2003) reported improvements in sentence comprehension, and Kalinyak-Fliszar et al. (2011) reported improvements in auditory-visual short-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalinyak-Fliszar M, Kohen F, Martin N | title = Remediation of language processing in aphasia: Improving activation and maintenance of linguistic representations in (verbal) short-term memory | journal = Aphasiology | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1095–1131 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 22791930 | pmc = 3393127 | doi = 10.1080/02687038.2011.577284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02687030344000201 |title=The treatment of an auditory working memory deficit and the implications for sentence comprehension abilities in mild 'receptive' aphasia |journal=Aphasiology |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=723–50 |year=2003 |last1=Francis |first1=Dawn |last2=Clark |first2=Nina |last3=Humphreys |first3=Glyn | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohn SE, Smith KL, Arsenault JK | title = The remediation of conduction aphasia via sentence repetition: a case study | journal = The British Journal of Disorders of Communication | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–60 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 1695853 | doi = 10.3109/13682829009011962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most acute cases of aphasia recover some or most skills by working with a speech-language pathologist. Recovery and improvement can continue for years after the stroke. After the onset of Aphasia, there is approximately a six-month period of spontaneous recovery; during this time, the brain is attempting to recover and repair the damaged neurons. Improvement varies widely, depending on the aphasia's cause, type, and severity. Recovery also depends on the person's age, health, motivation, [[handedness]], and educational level.&lt;ref name = &quot;medicinenet.com&quot; /&gt;

There is no one treatment proven to be effective for all types of aphasias. The reason that there is no universal treatment for aphasia is because of the nature of the disorder and the various ways it is presented, as explained in the above sections. Aphasia is rarely exhibited identically, implying that treatment needs to be catered specifically to the individual. Studies have shown that, although there is no consistency on treatment methodology in literature, there is a strong indication that treatment, in general, has positive outcomes.&lt;ref name= &quot;Schmitz O'Sullivan 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schmitz, Thomas J. |author2=O'Sullivan, Susan B. |title=Physical rehabilitation |publisher=F.A.

It can also help increase confidence and social skills in a comfortable setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manasco|first1=M.

Evidence does not support the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia after stroke.  Moderate quality evidence does indicate naming performance improvements for nouns but not verbs using tDCS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsner|first=Bernhard|last2=Kugler|first2=Joachim|last3=Pohl|first3=Marcus|last4=Mehrholz|first4=Jan|date=21 May 2019|title=Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia in adults with aphasia after stroke|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD009760|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009760.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6528187|pmid=31111960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific treatment techniques include the following:
*Copy and recall therapy (CART) - repetition and recall of targeted words within therapy may strengthen orthographic representations and improve single word reading, writing, and naming&lt;ref&gt;Beeson, P. M., Egnor, H. (2007), Combining treatment for written and spoken naming, Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 12(6); 816-827.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Visual communication therapy (VIC) - the use of index cards with symbols to represent various components of speech
*Visual action therapy (VAT) - typically treats individuals with global aphasia to train the use of hand gestures for specific items&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aphasia&quot;. American Speech Language Hearing Association. Retrieved from http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934663&amp;section=Treatment&lt;/ref&gt;
*Functional communication treatment (FCT) - focuses on improving activities specific to functional tasks, social interaction, and self-expression
*Promoting aphasic's communicative effectiveness (PACE) - a means of encouraging normal interaction between people with aphasia and clinicians. In this kind of therapy, the focus is on pragmatic communication rather than treatment itself. People are asked to communicate a given message to their therapists by means of drawing, making hand gestures or even pointing to an object&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Alexander MT, Hillis AE | title = Neuropsychology and Behavioral Neurology: Handbook of Clinical Neurology | chapter = Aphasia | volume = 88 | veditors = Goldenberg G, Miller BL, Aminoff MJ, Boller F, Swaab DF | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2008 | pages = 287–310 | isbn = 978-0-444-51897-2 | oclc= 733092630}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Melodic intonation therapy (MIT) - aims to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere to help cue retrieval of words and expressive language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Manasco  | first1 = Hunter | name-list-format = vanc |  title = Introduction to Neurogenic Communication Disorders | chapter = The Aphasias | pages = 93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Other - i.e. drawing as a way of communicating, trained conversation partners&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz O'Sullivan 2007&quot;/&gt;

Semantic feature analysis (SFA) -a type of aphasia treatment that targets word-finding deficits. It is based on the theory that neural connections can be strengthened by using related words and phrases that are similar to the target word, to eventually activate the target word in the brain.  SFA can be implemented in multiple forms such as verbally, written, using picture cards, etc.  The SLP provides prompting questions to the individual with aphasia in order for the person to name the picture provided.&lt;ref&gt;Davis &amp; Stanton, 2005.  Semantic Feature Analysis as a Functional Therapy Tool. ''Contemporary Issues In Communication Science and Disorders.&quot; 35, 85-92.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that SFA is an effective intervention for improving confrontational naming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maddy KM, Capilouto GJ, McComas KL | title = The effectiveness of semantic feature analysis: an evidence-based systematic review | journal = Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 254–67 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24797214 | doi = 10.1016/j.rehab.2014.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MIT is used to help people with aphasia vocalize themselves through speech song, which is then transferred as a spoken word. Good candidates for this therapy include people who have had left hemisphere strokes, non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's, good auditory comprehension, poor repetition and articulation, and good emotional stability and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Meulen I, van de Sandt-Koenderman ME, Ribbers GM | title = Melodic Intonation Therapy: present controversies and future opportunities | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 93 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S46-52 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22202191 | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2011.05.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation is that the efficacy of MIT depends on neural circuits involved in the processing of rhythmicity and [[formulaic language|formulaic expressions]] (examples taken from the MIT manual: “I am fine,” “how are you?” or “thank you”); while rhythmic features associated with melodic intonation may engage primarily left-hemisphere subcortical areas of the brain, the use of formulaic expressions is known to be supported by right-hemisphere cortical and bilateral subcortical neural networks.&lt;ref name = &quot;Sidtis 2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stahl B, Kotz SA | title = Facing the music: three issues in current research on singing and aphasia | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 1033 | pages = 1033 | year = 2013 | pmid = 25295017 | pmc = 4172097 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person's speech is insufficient, different kinds of [[augmentative and alternative communication]] could be considered such as alphabet boards, pictorial communication books, specialized software for computers or apps for tablets or smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russo|first=Maria Julieta| name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|title=High-technology Augmentative Communication for adults with post-stroke aphasia: a systematic review|url=|journal=Expert Review of Medical Devices|volume=April 26|pages=|pmid=28446056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensity of treatment===
The intensity of aphasia therapy is determined by the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what &quot;intense&quot; aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. A 2016 Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brady2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brady MC, Kelly H, Godwin J, Enderby P, Campbell P | title = Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2016 | issue = 6 | pages = CD000425 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27245310 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4 | hdl = 1893/26112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intensity of therapy is also dependent on the recency of stroke. People with aphasia react differently to intense treatment in the acute phase (0–3 months post stroke), sub-acute phase (3–6 months post stroke), or chronic phase (6+ months post stroke). Intensive therapy has been found to be effective for people with nonfluent and fluent chronic aphasia, but less effective for people with acute aphasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherney 2011&quot; /&gt;&gt; People with sub-acute aphasia also respond well to intensive therapy of 100 hours over 62 weeks.  This suggests people in the sub-acute phase can improve greatly in language and functional communication measures with intensive therapy compared to regular therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherney 2011&quot; /&gt;

===Individualized service delivery===

Intensity of treatment should be individualized based on the recency of stroke, therapy goals, and other specific characteristics such as age, size of lesion, overall health status, and motivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherney 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cherney LR, Patterson JP, Raymer AM | title = Intensity of aphasia therapy: evidence and efficacy | journal = Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 560–9 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21960063 | doi = 10.1007/s11910-011-0227-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sage 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sage K, Snell C, Lambon Ralph MA | title = How intensive does anomia therapy for people with aphasia need to be? | journal = Neuropsychological Rehabilitation | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–41 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21181603 | doi = 10.1080/09602011.2010.528966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual reacts differently to treatment intensity and is able to tolerate treatment at different times post-stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sage 2011&quot; /&gt;  Intensity of treatment after a stroke should be dependent on the person's motivation, stamina, and tolerance for therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palmer R|year=2015|title=Innovations in aphasia treatment after stroke: Technology to the rescue|journal=British Journal of Neuroscience Nursing|volume=38|pages=38–42|doi=10.12968/bjnn.2015.11.sup2.38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

If the symptoms of aphasia last longer than two or three months after a stroke, a complete recovery is unlikely. However, it is important to note that some people continue to improve over a period of years and even decades. Improvement is a slow process that usually involves both helping the individual and family understand the nature of aphasia and learning compensatory strategies for communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-faqs/ |title=Aphasia FAQs |website=National Aphasia Association |access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a traumatic brain injury (TBI) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), the brain undergoes several healing and re-organization processes, which may result in improved language function. This is referred to as spontaneous recovery. Spontaneous recovery is the natural recovery the brain makes without treatment, and the brain begins to reorganize and change in order to recover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookshire 2007&quot; /&gt; There are several factors that contribute to a person's chance of recovery caused by stroke, including stroke size and location.&lt;ref name=M2015/&gt; Age, sex, and education have not been found to be very predictive.&lt;ref name=M2015/&gt;

Specific to aphasia, spontaneous recovery varies among affected people and may not look the same in everyone, making it difficult to predict recovery.&lt;ref name=M2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Watila MM, Balarabe SA | title = Factors predicting post-stroke aphasia recovery | journal = Journal of the Neurological Sciences | volume = 352 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 12–8 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25888529 | doi = 10.1016/j.jns.2015.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though some cases of Wernicke's aphasia have shown greater improvements than more mild forms of aphasia, people with Wernicke's aphasia may not reach as high a level of speech abilities as those with mild forms of aphasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laska 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laska AC, Hellblom A, Murray V, Kahan T, Von Arbin M | title = Aphasia in acute stroke and relation to outcome | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 249 | issue = 5 | pages = 413–22 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11350565 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2796.2001.00812.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian [[papyrus]], the [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]], which details speech problems in a person with a [[traumatic brain injury]] to the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name=McCrory&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCrory PR, Berkovic SF | title = Concussion: the history of clinical and pathophysiological concepts and misconceptions | journal = Neurology | volume = 57 | issue = 12 | pages = 2283–9 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11756611 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.57.12.2283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, aphasia was a major focus for scientists and philosophers who were working in the beginning stages of the field of psychology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Damasio 1992&quot;/&gt;
In medical research, speechlessness was described as an incorrect prognosis, and there was no assumption that underlying language complications existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0072-9752(08)02136-2 |pmid=19892139 |chapter=Chapter 36 History of aphasia |title=History of Neurology |volume=95 |pages=571–82 |series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology |year=2009 |last1=Eling |first1=Paul |last2=Whitaker |first2=Harry | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-444-52009-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Broca and his colleagues were some of the first to write about aphasia, but Wernicke was the first credited to have written extensively about aphasia being a disorder that contained comprehension difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boller F | title = Johann Baptist Schmidt. A pioneer in the history of aphasia | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 306–7 | date = May 1977 | pmid = 324450 | doi = 10.1001/archneur.1977.00500170060011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite claims of who reported on aphasia first, it was F.J. Gall that gave the first full description of aphasia after studying wounds to the brain, as well as his observation of speech difficulties resulting from vascular lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Riese W | title = The early history of aphasia | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 322–34 | date = 1947-05-01 | pmid = 20257374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent book on the entire history of aphasia is available (Reference: Tesak, J. &amp; Code, C. (2008) Milestones in the History of Aphasia: Theories and Protagonists. Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press.)

===Etymology===
''Aphasia'' is from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Privative a|''a-'']] (&quot;without&quot;) + ''phásis'' (''φάσις'', &quot;speech&quot;).

The word ''aphasia'' comes from the word ἀφασία ''aphasia'', in [[Ancient Greek]], which means&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/217487.php|title=What is aphasia? What causes aphasia?|work=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;speechlessness&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29fa%29si%2Fa ἀφασία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; derived from ἄφατος ''aphatos'', &quot;speechless&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Da)%2Ffatos ἄφατος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; from ἀ- ''a-'', &quot;not, un&quot; and φημί ''phemi'', &quot;I speak&quot;.

==Further research==

Research is currently being done using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to witness the difference in how language is processed in normal brains vs aphasic brains. This will help researchers to understand exactly what the brain must go through in order to recover from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and how different areas of the brain respond after such an injury.

Another intriguing approach being tested is that of drug therapy. Research is in progress that will hopefully uncover whether or not certain drugs might be used in addition to speech-language therapy in order to facilitate recovery of proper language function. It's possible that the best treatment for Aphasia might involve combining drug treatment with therapy, instead of relying on one over the other.

One other method being researched as a potential therapeutic combination with speech-language therapy is brain stimulation. One particular method, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), alters brain activity in whatever area it happens to stimulate, which has recently led scientists to wonder if this shift in brain function caused by TMS might help people re-learn languages.

The research being put into Aphasia has only just begun. Researchers appear to have multiple ideas on how Aphasia could be more effectively treated in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia |title=Aphasia |website=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders |access-date=December 16, 2017|date=2015-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
