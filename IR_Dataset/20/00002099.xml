'''Andrew''' &quot;'''Tridge'''&quot; '''Tridgell''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|OAM}} (born 28 February 1967) is an Australian [[computer programmer]].  He is the author of and a contributor to the [[Samba (software)|Samba]] [[file server]], and co-inventor of the [[rsync]] algorithm.

He has analysed complex [[proprietary protocol]]s and algorithms, to allow compatible [[free and open source software]] implementations.

==Projects==
Tridgell was a major developer of the Samba software, analyzing the [[Server Message Block]] protocol used for [[Workgroup (computer networking)|workgroup]] and network file sharing by [[Microsoft Windows]] products. He developed the [[talloc]] hierarchical memory allocator, originally as part of Samba.

For his PhD dissertation, he co-developed [[rsync]], including the rsync algorithm, a highly efficient [[file transfer]] and [[File synchronization|synchronisation]] tool. He also was the original author of [[rzip]], which uses a similar algorithm to rsync. He developed spamsum,{{clarify|and what would that be?|date=June 2016}} based on [[locality-sensitive hashing]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jesse Kornblum|title=Identifying almost identical files using context triggered piecewise hashing|url=http://dfrws.org/2006/proceedings/12-Kornblum.pdf|journal=DFRWS|year=2006|accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of [[KnightCap]], a [[reinforcement learning|reinforcement-learning]] based [[chess engine]].

Tridgell was also a leader in [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacking]] the [[TiVo]] to make it work in Australia, which uses the [[PAL]] video format.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samba.org/~tridge/tivo-ethernet/&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2005, Tridgell tried to produce free software (now known as [[SourcePuller]]) that interoperated with the [[BitKeeper]] source code repository. This was cited as the reason that BitMover revoked a license allowing [[Linux]] developers free use of their BitKeeper product.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/169178/ git [LWN.net&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linus Torvalds]], the creator of the Linux kernel, and Tridgell were thus involved in a public debate about the events, in which Tridgell stated that, not having bought or owned BitKeeper – and thus having never agreed to its license – he could not violate it, and was analyzing the protocol ethically, as he had done with Samba. Tridgell's involvement in the project resulted in Torvalds accusing him of playing dirty tricks with BitKeeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/14/torvalds_attacks_tridgell/ |title=Torvalds knifes Tridgell: Kernel source row turns nasty |first= Andrew |last=Orlowski |date=14 April 2005 |work=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tridgell claimed his analysis started with simply [[telnet]]ing to a BitKeeper server and typing &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20050421023821174 Groklaw – Tridge Speaks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Tridgell got involved with the software development of ArduPilot Mega,&lt;ref&gt;[http://diydrones.com/profile/AndrewTridgell Andrew Tridgell's Page]. DIY Drones. Retrieved on 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; an open source Arduino-based UAV controller board, working on an entry for the [[UAV Outback Challenge|UAV Challenge Outback Rescue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/ UAV Challenge – Outback Rescue 2013 – Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210145124/http://www.uavoutbackchallenge.com.au/ |date=10 February 2012 }}. Retrieved on 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic achievements==
Tridgell completed a PhD at the Computer Sciences Laboratory of the [[Australian National University]]. His original doctorate work was in the area of [[speech recognition]] but was never completed. His submitted dissertation 'Efficient Algorithms for Sorting and Synchronization' was based on his work on the [[rsync]] algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=59310|title=Andrew Tridgell - The Mathematics Genealogy Project|website=www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
* In October 2003, [[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]] magazine judged Tridgell to be Australia's smartest [[Information and Communications Technology]] person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.ninemsn.com.au/smart100/default.asp The Bulletin Smart 100&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318022419/http://sites.ninemsn.com.au/smart100/default.asp |date=18 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=135066 The Bulletin publishes for the last time&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509095038/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=135066 |date=9 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2008, Tridgell was named &quot;Best Interoperator&quot; at the [[Google–O'Reilly Open Source Awards]], for his work on [[Samba (software)|Samba]] and [[Rsync]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/07/and-winners-of-2008-google-oreilly-open.html Google Open Source Blog: ... and the winners of the 2008 Google-O'Reilly Open Source Awards are&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tridgell (along with [[Jeremy Allison]] and Volker Lendecke) has been called a &quot;[[guru]] in its traditional Indian meaning&quot; by IT writer, Sam Varghese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/open-sauce/15896-foss-folk-who-make-us-proud FOSS folk who make us proud], Sam Varghese, [[iTWire]], 2007-12-25, accessed 27 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 11 December 2018, Tridgell was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science ([[Honoris Causa]]) by the Australian National University, for authoring Samba, co-inventing rsync; and contributions to free and open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/reedgrad/111218AN2/videos/184628443|title=ANU Graduation Ceremony 1 - from ANU Graduation Ceremony 2|website=Livestream|access-date=2018-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/honorary-degree-dr-andrew-tridgell|title=ANU Honorary degree: Dr Andrew Tridgell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 26 January 2020, Tridgell was awarded the Medal (OAM) of the [[Order of Australia]] in the General Division for service to Information Technology. The biographical notes for the award noted his contributions to software development and education including his work on [[rsync]], [[Samba (software)|Samba]], [[ArduPilot]], MAVProxy as well as teaching at the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gg.gov.au/australian-honours-and-awardsaustralian-honours-lists/australia-day-2020-honours-list|title=Australia Day 2020 Honours List}}&lt;/ref&gt;
