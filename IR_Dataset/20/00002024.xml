The '''Amber Road''' was an ancient [[trade route]] for the transfer of [[amber]] from coastal areas of the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/241848/Amber_in_the_Ancient_Near_East Graciela Gestoso Singer, &quot;Amber in the Ancient Near East&quot;, ''i-Medjat'' No. 2 (December 2008).  Papyrus Electronique des Ankou.]&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistoric [[trade route]]s between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade.  As an important commodity, sometimes dubbed &quot;the gold of the north&quot;, amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the [[Vistula]] and [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] rivers to [[Italy]], [[Greece]], the [[Black Sea]], [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] over a period of thousands of years.

==Antiquity==
From at least the 16th century BC, amber was moved from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1783003 J. M. de Navarro, &quot;Prehistoric Routes between Northern Europe and Italy Defined by the Amber Trade&quot;, ''The Geographical Journal,'' Vol. 66, No. 6 (December 1925), pp. 481–503.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NAwGLzAfyhEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Anthony F. Harding, &quot;Reformation and Barbarism in Europe, 1300–600 BC&quot;, in Barry W. Cunliffe, ed., ''Oxford Illustrated History of Prehistoric Europe,'' Oxford, Oxford U. Press, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The breast ornament of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Tutankhamen]] (c. 1333–1324 BC) contains large Baltic amber beads.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N. ''The Complete Tutankhamun: the king, the tomb, the Royal Treasure.'' London, [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serpico, M. and White, R. &quot;Resins, amber and bitumen&quot;.

Beck, Gretchen C. Southard, Audrey B. Adams, &quot;Analysis and Provenience of Minoan and Mycenaean Amber, IV. Mycenae&quot;, pp. 359–85.]&lt;/ref&gt; The quantity of amber in the Royal Tomb of [[Qatna]], Syria, is unparalleled for known second millennium BC sites in the Levant and the Ancient Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/propylaeumdok/892/1/Pfaelzner_Qatna_lion_2008.pdf Anna J. Mukherjee, et al., &quot;The Qatna lion: scientific confirmation of Baltic amber in late Bronze Age Syria&quot; ''Antiquity'' 82 (2008), pp. 49–59.]&lt;/ref&gt; Amber was sent from the North Sea to the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] as an offering. From the [[Black Sea]], trade could continue to Asia along the [[Silk Road]], another ancient trade route.

In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, a main route ran south from the Baltic coast (modern [[Lithuania]]), the entire north-south length of modern day Poland (likely through the Iron Age settlement of [[Biskupin]]), through the land of the [[Boii]] (modern [[Czechia]] and [[Slovakia]]) to the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]] ([[Aquileia]] by the modern [[Gulf of Venice]]).

The [[Old Prussians|Old Prussian]] towns of [[Mokhovoye, Kaliningrad_Oblast |Kaup]] and [[Truso]] on the Baltic were the starting points of the route to the south. In [[Scandinavia]] the amber road probably gave rise to the thriving [[Nordic Bronze Age]] culture, bringing influences from the Mediterranean Sea to the northernmost countries of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Kaliningrad Oblast]] is occasionally referred to in Russian as {{lang|ru|Янтарный край}}, which means &quot;the amber region&quot; (see [[Kaliningrad Regional Amber Museum]]).

Amber roads connect [[amber finding locations]] to customer sites in Europe, in the Middle East regions and in the Far East.

===Poland===
The shortest (and possibly oldest) road avoids [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas and led from the Baltic coastline (nowadays [[Palanga Amber Museum|Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]), through [[Biskupin]], [[Milicz]], [[Wrocław]], passed the [[Moravian Gate]], followed the river [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]], crossed the [[Danube]] near [[Carnuntum]] in the [[Noricum Province]], headed southwest past [[Poetovio]], [[Celeia]], [[Emona]], [[Nauportus]], and reached [[Padua|Patavium]] and [[Aquileia]] at the [[Adriatic]] coast. One of the oldest directions of the last stage of the Amber Road to the south of the Danube, noted in the myth about the [[Argonauts]], used the [[Sava]] and [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] rivers, ending with a short continental road from Nauportus to ''Tarsatica'' (Trsat, [[Rijeka]]) on the coast of the [[Adriatic]].

===Germany===
[[Image:German Amber Roads.gif|thumb|right|250px|Amber Roads in Germany]]
Several roads connected the North Sea and Baltic Sea, especially the city of [[Hamburg]] to the [[Brenner Pass]], proceeding southwards to [[Brindisi]] (nowadays Italy) and Ambracia (nowadays Greece).

===Switzerland===
The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] region indicates a number of alpine roads, concentrating around the capital city [[Bern]] and probably originating from the borders of the [[Rhône River]] and the [[Rhine]].

===The Netherlands===
A small section, including [[Baarn]], [[Barneveld (town)|Barneveld]], [[Amersfoort]] and [[Amerongen]], connected the North Sea with the Lower Rhine.

===Belgium===
A small section led southwards from [[Antwerp]] and [[Bruges]] to the towns Braine-l’Alleud and Braine-le-Comte, both originally named &quot;Brennia-Brenna&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Northrup |display-authors=etal |first1=Cynthia |title=Encyclopedia of World Trade: From Ancient Times to the Present |volume=1 |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route continued by following the [[Meuse River]] towards [[Bern]] in Switzerland.

===France===
Three routes may be identified leading from an amber finding region or delta at the mouth of the River Openia towards Bresse and Bern, crossing the Alps to Switzerland and Italy.

===Southern France and Spain===
Routes connected amber finding locations at Ambares (near [[Bordeaux]]), leading to [[Béarn]] and the Pyrenees. Routes connecting the amber finding locations in northern Spain and in the Pyrenees were a trading route to the Mediterranean Sea.

==Modern use of &quot;Amber Road&quot;==
There is a tourist route stretching along the Baltic coast from [[Kaliningrad]] to [[Latvia]] called &quot;Amber Road&quot;.

&quot;Amber Road&quot; sites are:
* Mizgiris Amber Gallery-Museum in [[Nida, Lithuania|Nida]];
* Amber Bay in [[Juodkrante]];
* [[Lithuania]] Minor History Museum;
* Amber collection place in Karkle, Lithuania;
* [[Palanga Amber Museum]] in [[Palanga]];
* Open amber workshop in [[Palanga]];
* Amber museum in [[Gdańsk]];
* Samogitian Alka in [[Šventoji, Lithuania|Sventoji]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lithuania.travel/en-gb/attractions/-amber-road-objects/17126&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Poland]]  a north–south motorway [[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]] is officially named [[A1 autostrada (Poland)|Amber Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.msport.gov.pl/article/950-Autostrada-Bursztynowa-A1 |title=Autostrada Bursztynowa A1 |access-date=2015-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903140745/http://www.msport.gov.pl/article/950-Autostrada-Bursztynowa-A1 |archive-date=2014-09-03 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;
