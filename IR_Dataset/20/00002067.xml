'''Ann Arbor''' is a [[city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/resource_tab/bibliographies_of_clarke_library_material/michigan_local_history/county_material/washtenaw.html |publisher=[[Charles V.

It is the principal city of the Ann Arbor [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which encompasses all of Washtenaw County.  Ann Arbor is also included in the larger [[Southeast Michigan]] [[Combined statistical area|Combined Statistical Area]].

Ann Arbor is home to the [[University of Michigan]]. The university significantly shapes Ann Arbor's economy as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the [[University of Michigan Health System|medical center]]. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | title=Ann Arbor: Introduction | publisher=Advameg, Inc. | year=2008 | accessdate=August 4, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610084107/http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders, both named Ann, and the stands of [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur oak]] trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, pp. 1-2&quot;&gt;Marwil, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Michigan moved from [[Detroit]] to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism, such as [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] and [[Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|support for the legalization of cannabis]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
{{see also|History of the University of Michigan}}
In about 1774, the [[Potawatomi]] founded two villages in the area of what is now Ann Arbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last=Edmonds|first= R. David |year=1978 |title=The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire |publisher= University of Oklahoma |page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators [[John Allen (pioneer)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Walker Rumsey]]. On May 25, 1824, the town [[plat]] was registered with Wayne County as &quot;Annarbour&quot;, the earliest known use of the town's name.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[Quercus macrocarpa#Cultural|bur oak]] in the {{convert|640|acre|ha}} of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, pp. 1-2&quot;/&gt; The local [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwa]] named the settlement ''kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's [[sawmill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society, Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society|title=Michigan History Magazine|year=1964|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and was incorporated as a village in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved from Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1824-1859pg3 | title=1824–1859: Education.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing 15 years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;aadl2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1940-1974pg3 | title=1940–1974: From Protest to Outer Space.

In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, [[gentrification]], and [[urban sprawl]] stretching into outlying countryside. On November 4, 2003, voters approved a [[green belt|greenbelt]] plan under which the city government bought development rights on agricultural parcels of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenbelt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a2openspace.org/ |title=Ann Arbor Parks and Greenbelt Proposal |date=March 2, 2004 |publisher=Friends of Ann Arbor Open Space |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723184116/http://www.a2openspace.org/ |archivedate=July 23, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/ann_arbor_seeks_grants_for_gre.html |title=Ann Arbor seeks grants for greenbelt land |author=McGovern, Judy |date=May 18, 2009 |journal=The Ann Arbor News |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131110213245/http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/ann_arbor_seeks_grants_for_gre.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the &quot;top places to live&quot; lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year.

Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], the large number of [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from [[Michigan Stadium]] until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual [[Hash Bash]]: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/40-years-of-hash-bash-marijuana-festival-that-started-in-early-1970s-still-going-strong-in-ann-arbor/#.UB0h48gSRbM | title=40 years of Hash Bash: Marijuana festival started in 1972 in Ann Arbor stands test of time | publisher=Ann Arbor.com | date=March 31, 2011 | accessdate=August 4, 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231055000/http://www.annarbor.com/news/40-years-of-hash-bash-marijuana-festival-that-started-in-early-1970s-still-going-strong-in-ann-arbor/ | archivedate=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and government==
{{See also|List of mayors of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
Ann Arbor has a [[Council–manager government|council-manager]] form of government. The City Council has 11 voting members: the mayor and 10 city council members. Two city council members are elected from each of the city's five wards. The mayor and council serve four-year terms. The mayor and one council member from each ward are elected in Presidential election years, and the other five council members are elected in the alternate even-numbered years. The mayor is elected citywide. The mayor is the presiding officer of the City Council and has the power to appoint all Council committee members as well as board and commission members, with the approval of the City Council. The current mayor of Ann Arbor is [[Christopher Taylor (politician)|Christopher Taylor]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who was elected as mayor in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-council/Pages/Mayor-Christopher-Taylor.aspx | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513001747/http://www.a2gov.org/citycouncil/index.html | archivedate=May 13, 2007 | title=Government | year=2007 | publisher=Ann Arbor City Council | accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day-to-day city operations are managed by a [[City manager|city administrator]] chosen by the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/City_Clerk/Documents/charter.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003030858/http://www.a2gov.org/government/city_administration/City_Clerk/Documents/charter.pdf| archivedate=October 3, 2011| title=Charter for the City of Ann Arbor, Michigan | publisher=Ann Arbor City Government | date=April 9, 1956 | accessdate=March 5, 2013 | format=PDF | pages=9, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor holds mayoral elections to 2-year terms in even years.&lt;ref name=a2cc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.a2gov.org/departments/city-council/Pages/Home.aspx |title=City Council |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=www.a2gov.org |publisher=City if Ann Arbor |access-date=September 19, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2017, City Council held annual elections in which half of the seats (one from each ward) were elected to 2-year terms. These elections were staggered, with each ward having one of their seats up for election in odd years and their other seat up for election in even years.&lt;ref name=a2cc/&gt; Beginning in 2018 the City Council has had staggered elections to 4-year terms in even years. This means that half of the members (one from each ward) are elected in presidential election years, while the other half are elected in mid-term election years.&lt;ref name=a2cc/&gt; To facilitate this change in scheduling, the 2017 election elected members to terms that lasted 3-years.&lt;ref name=a2cc/&gt;

In 1960, Ann Arbor voters approved a $2.3 million [[Bond (finance)|bond issue]] to build the current city hall, which was designed by architect [[Alden B. Dow]]. The City Hall opened in 1963.
