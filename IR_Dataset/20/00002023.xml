'''Aeschylus''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|iː|s|k|ɪ|l|ə|s}},&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Daniel; Roach, Peter, James Hartman and Jane Setter, eds. ''Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary''. 17th edition. Cambridge UP, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɛ|s|k|ɪ|l|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/aeschylus &quot;Aeschylus&quot;]. ''[[Webster's New World College Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Αἰσχύλος}} ''Aiskhylos'', {{IPA-el|ai̯s.kʰý.los|pron}}; c. 525/524 – c. 456/455 BC) was an [[Greek tragedy|ancient Greek tragedian]]. He is often described as the father of [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;F243&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1999|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[August Wilhelm von Schlegel|Schlegel, August Wilhelm von]] |page=121 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7148 |title=Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature|date=December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics' knowledge of the genre begins with his work,&lt;ref&gt;R. Lattimore, ''Aeschylus I: Oresteia'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences from his surviving plays.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cropp, 'Lost Tragedies: A Survey'; ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], he expanded the number of characters in the theatre and allowed conflict among them; characters previously had interacted only with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The remnant of a commemorative inscription, dated to the 3rd century BC, lists four, possibly eight, dramatic poets (probably including Choerilus, Phrynichus, and Pratinas) who had won tragic victories at the Dionysia before Aeschylus had. [[Thespis]] was traditionally regarded the inventor of tragedy. According to another tradition, tragedy was established in Athens in the late 530s BC, but that may simply reflect an absence of records. Major innovations in dramatic form, credited to Aeschylus by Aristotle and the anonymous source ''The Life of Aeschylus'', may be exaggerations and should be viewed with caution (Martin Cropp (2006), &quot;Lost Tragedies: A Survey&quot; in ''A Companion to Greek Tragedy'', pp. 272–74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Only seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived, and there is a long-standing [[Prometheus Bound#Debate over authenticity|debate regarding his authorship of one of these plays]], ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', which some believe his son [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] actually wrote. Fragments of some other plays have survived in quotations and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian [[papyrus]], often giving further insights into his work.&lt;ref&gt;P. Levi, ''Greek Drama'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a [[trilogy]]; his ''[[Oresteia]]'' is the only ancient example of the form to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;S. Saïd, ''Aeschylean Tragedy'', 215&lt;/ref&gt; At least one of his plays was influenced by the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persians' second invasion of Greece]] (480–479 BC). This work, ''[[The Persians]]'', is one of very few classical Greek tragedies concerned with contemporary events and the only one to survive to the present,&lt;ref&gt;S. Saïd, ''Aeschylean Tragedy'', 221&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a useful source of information about its period. The significance of the war against Persia was so great to Aeschylus and the Greeks that Aeschylus' epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] while making no mention of his success as a playwright. Despite this, Aeschylus's work – particularly the ''Oresteia'' ''–'' is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars.

==Life==
[[File:Aeschylus Bust.jpg|thumb|Bust of Aeschylus at [[North Carolina Museum of Art]]]]

Aeschylus was born in c.&amp;nbsp;525 BC in [[Eleusis]], a small town about 27&amp;nbsp;kilometers northwest of [[Athens]], which is nestled in the fertile valleys of western [[Attica]],&lt;ref name=&quot;S33&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Sommerstein | first=Alan | title=Aeschylean tragedy | publisher=Duckworth | publication-place=London | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-7156-3824-8 | oclc=645674252 | language=de | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date is most likely based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia. His family was wealthy and well established; his father, Euphorion, was a member of the [[Eupatridae]], the ancient nobility of Attica,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bates&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Bates |1906 |pp=53–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this might be a fiction that the ancients invented to account for the grandeur of his plays.&lt;ref&gt;S. Saïd, ''Eschylean tragedy'', 217&lt;/ref&gt;

As a youth, he worked at a vineyard until, according to the 2nd-century AD geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the god [[Dionysus]] visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; As soon as he woke from the dream, the young Aeschylus began to write a tragedy, and his first performance took place in 499&amp;nbsp;BC, when he was only 26 years old.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt; He won his first victory at the [[City Dionysia]] in 484&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Bates/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;F241&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 510 BC, when Aeschylus was 15 years old, [[Cleomenes I]] expelled the sons of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]] from Athens, and [[Cleisthenes]] came to power. Cleisthenes' reforms included a system of registration that emphasized the importance of the [[deme]] over family tradition. In the last decade of the 6th century, Aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of [[Eleusis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;&gt;Kopff 1997 pp. 1–472&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Persian Wars]] played a large role in the playwright's life and career. In 490&amp;nbsp;BC, Aeschylus and his brother [[Cynegeirus]] fought to defend Athens against the invading army of [[Darius I of Persia]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]].&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; The Athenians emerged triumphant, a victory celebrated across the city-states of Greece.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; Cynegeirus, however, died in the battle, receiving a mortal wound while trying to prevent a Persian ship retreating from the shore, for which his countrymen extolled him as a hero.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

In 480 BC, Aeschylus was called into military service again, this time against [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes&amp;nbsp;I]]'s invading forces at the [[Battle of Salamis]] together with his younger brother [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]]; he also fought, later, at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://topostext.org/work/229#4 ANONYMOUS LIFE OF AESCHYLUS, § 4] &quot;They say that he was noble and that he participated in the battle of Marathon together with his brother, Cynegirus, and in the naval battle at Salamis with the youngest of his brothers, Ameinias, and in the infantry battle at Plataea.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ion of Chios]] was a witness for Aeschylus's war record and his contribution in Salamis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot; /&gt; Salamis holds a prominent place in ''The Persians'', his oldest surviving [[Play (theatre)|play]], which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize at the [[Dionysia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;S34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996 |p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who were initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], an ancient cult of [[Demeter]] based in his home town of Eleusis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Martin |2000 |loc=§10.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiates gained secret knowledge through these rites, likely concerning the afterlife. Firm details of specific rites are sparse, as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the Mysteries to non-initiates. Nevertheless, according to [[Aristotle]], Aeschylus was accused of revealing some of the cult's secrets on stage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' 1111a8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot, but he fled the scene. [[Heracleides of Pontus]] asserts that the audience tried to stone Aeschylus. He then took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the Theater of Dionysus. At his trial, he pleaded ignorance. He was acquitted, with the jury sympathetic to the military service of Aeschylus and his brothers during the Persian Wars. According to the 2nd-century AD author Aelian, Aeschylus's younger brother Ameinias helped to acquit Aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand that he lost at Salamis, where he was voted bravest warrior. The truth is that the award for bravery at Salamis went not to Aeschylus' brother but to Ameinias of Pallene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot; /&gt;

Aeschylus travelled to [[Sicily]] once or twice in the 470s&amp;nbsp;BC, having been invited by [[Hiero&amp;nbsp;I of Syracuse]], a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island; during one of these trips he produced ''The Women of Aetna'' (in honor of the city founded by Hieron) and restaged his ''Persians''.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; By 473&amp;nbsp;BC, after the death of [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]], one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt; In 472&amp;nbsp;BC, Aeschylus staged the production that included the ''Persians'', with [[Pericles]] serving as ''[[choregos]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Death of Aeschylus in Florentine Picture Chronicle.jpg|thumb|The death of Aeschylus illustrated in the 15th century ''Florentine Picture Chronicle'' by [[Maso Finiguerra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Meditation in Solitude |author=Ursula Hoff |journal=Journal of the Warburg Institute |volume=1 |year=1938 |pages=292–294 |jstor=749994 |issue=44 |doi=10.2307/749994}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 458 BC, he returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of [[Gela]] where he died in 456 or 455&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Valerius Maximus]] wrote that he was killed outside the city by a [[tortoise]] dropped by an eagle (possibly a [[lammergeier]] or [[Cinereous vulture]], which do feed on tortoises by dropping them on hard objects&lt;ref&gt;del Hoyo, J.; Elliott, A.; Sargatal, J., eds. (1994). Handbook of the Birds of the World. 2.

According to Castoriadis, the inscription on his grave signifies the primary importance of &quot;belonging to the City&quot; ([[polis]]), of the solidarity that existed within the collective body of citizen-soldiers.

==Personal life==
Aeschylus married and had two sons, [[Euphorion (playwright)|Euphorion]] and Euaeon, both of whom became tragic poets. Euphorion won first prize in 431 BC in competition against both [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The complete idiot's guide to classical mythology|author1=Osborn, K.  |author2=Burges, D.|page=|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-02-862385-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His nephew, [[Philocles]] (his sister's son), was also a tragic poet, and won first prize in the competition against [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Smith |2005 |p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus had at least two brothers, [[Cynegeirus]] and [[Ameinias of Athens|Ameinias]].

==Works==
[[Image:Athen Theatre of Dionysus BW 2017-10-09 14-29-49.jpg|thumb|250px|Modern picture of the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], where many of Aeschylus's plays were performed]]
[[File:Tragediae septem.tif|thumb|''Tragoediae septem'' (1552)]]
The roots of Greek drama are in religious festivals for the gods, chiefly [[Dionysus]], the god of wine.&lt;ref name=F241/&gt; During Aeschylus's lifetime, dramatic competitions became part of the [[City Dionysia]] in the spring.&lt;ref name=F241/&gt; The festival opened with a procession, followed with a competition of boys singing [[dithyramb]]s and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;F242&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first competition Aeschylus would have participated in, consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic [[satyr play]].&lt;ref name=F242/&gt; Such format is called a continuous tragic [[tetralogy]]. It allowed Aeschylus to explore the human, theological, and cosmic dimensions of one or another mythic sequence, developing it in successive phases. &lt;ref&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M. (2010). {{Google books|tOgWfjNIxoMC|Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman mythology.|page=29}} &lt;/ref&gt; A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed, and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.&lt;ref name=F242/&gt;

Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime, and various ancient sources attribute between seventy and ninety plays to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;F243&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;P222&quot;/&gt; Only seven tragedies have survived intact: ''[[The Persians]]'', ''[[Seven against Thebes]]'', ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]'', the trilogy known as ''[[The Oresteia]]'', consisting of the three tragedies ''[[Agamemnon (play)#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' and ''[[The Eumenides#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', together with ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (whose authorship is disputed). With the exception of this last play&amp;nbsp;– the success of which is uncertain&amp;nbsp;– all of Aeschylus's [[Extant literature|extant]] tragedies are known to have won first prize at the City Dionysia.

The Alexandrian ''Life of Aeschylus'' claims that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times. This compares favorably with Sophocles' reported eighteen victories (with a substantially larger catalogue, at an estimated 120 plays), and dwarfs the five victories of Euripides, who is thought to have written roughly 90 plays.

===Trilogies===
One hallmark of Aeschylean [[dramaturgy]] appears to have been his tendency to write connected trilogies, in which each play serves as a chapter in a continuous dramatic narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Sommerstein |1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Oresteia]]'' is the only extant example of this type of connected trilogy, but there is evidence that Aeschylus often wrote such trilogies. The comic satyr plays that follow his trilogies also drew upon stories derived from myths.

For example, the ''Oresteia''{{'}}s satyr play ''[[Proteus]]'' treated the story of Menelaus'  detour in Egypt on his way home from the [[Trojan War]]. Based on the evidence provided by a catalogue of Aeschylean play titles, [[scholia]], and play fragments recorded by later authors, it is assumed that three other of his extant plays were components of connected trilogies: ''Seven against Thebes'' being the final play in an Oedipus trilogy, and ''The Suppliants'' and ''Prometheus Bound'' each being the first play in a Danaid trilogy and Prometheus trilogy, respectively (see below). Scholars have moreover suggested several completely lost trilogies derived from known play titles. A number of these trilogies treated myths surrounding the Trojan War. One, collectively called the ''[[Achilleis (trilogy)|Achilleis]]'', comprised the titles ''Myrmidons'', ''Nereids'' and ''Phrygians'' (alternately, ''The Ransoming of Hector'').

Another trilogy apparently recounts the entry of the Trojan ally [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] into the war, and his death at the hands of Achilles (''Memnon'' and ''The Weighing of Souls'' being two components of the trilogy); ''The Award of the Arms'', ''The Phrygian Women'', and ''The Salaminian Women'' suggest a trilogy about the madness and subsequent suicide of the Greek hero [[Ajax the great|Ajax]]; Aeschylus also seems to have written about [[Odysseus]]' return to Ithaca after the war (including his killing of his wife [[Penelope]]'s suitors and its consequences) in a trilogy consisting of ''The Soul-raisers'', ''Penelope'' and ''The Bone-gatherers''. Other suggested trilogies touched on the myth of Jason and the Argonauts (''Argô'', ''Lemnian Women'', ''Hypsipylê''); the life of Perseus (''The Net-draggers'', ''Polydektês'', ''Phorkides''); the birth and exploits of Dionysus (''Semele'', ''Bacchae'', ''Pentheus''); and the aftermath of the war portrayed in ''Seven against Thebes'' (''Eleusinians'', ''Argives'' (or ''Argive Women''), ''Sons of the Seven'').&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving plays==
===''The Persians''===
{{Main|The Persians}}
[[File:Dariuslarge.jpg|thumb|right|''The Ghost of Darius Appearing to Atossa'', drawing by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].]]
The earliest of his plays to survive is ''The Persians'' (''Persai''), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus's own life, specifically the [[Battle of Salamis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;F244&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unique among surviving Greek tragedies in that it describes a recent historical event.&lt;ref name=F243/&gt; ''The Persians'' focuses on the popular Greek theme of ''[[hubris]]'' by blaming Persia's loss on the pride of its king.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt;

It opens with the arrival of a messenger in [[Susa]], the Persian capital, bearing news of the catastrophic Persian defeat at Salamis to [[Atossa]], the mother of the Persian King [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Atossa then travels to the tomb of Darius, her husband, where his ghost appears to explain the cause of the defeat. It is, he says, the result of Xerxes' hubris in building a bridge across the [[Hellespont]], an action which angered the gods. Xerxes appears at the end of the play, not realizing the cause of his defeat, and the play closes to lamentations by Xerxes and the chorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vellacott&quot;&gt;Vellacott: 7–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Seven against Thebes''===
{{Main|Seven against Thebes}}
''Seven against Thebes'' (''Hepta epi Thebas''), which was performed in 467 BC, has the contrasting theme of the interference of the gods in human affairs.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt; It also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus's work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the [[polis]] (the city) being a key development of human civilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;F244246&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |pp=244–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play tells the story of [[Eteocles]] and [[Polynices]], the sons of the shamed King of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Oedipus]]. The sons agree to alternate in the throne of the city, but after the first year Eteocles refuses to step down, and Polynices wages war to claim his crown. The brothers kill each other in single combat, and the original ending of the play consisted of lamentations for the dead brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aeschylus pp.7–19&quot;&gt;Aeschylus. &quot;Prometheus Bound, The Suppliants, Seven Against Thebes, The Persians.&quot; Philip Vellacott's Introduction, pp. 7–19. Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ending was added to the play some fifty years later: Antigone and Ismene mourn their dead brothers, a messenger enters announcing an edict prohibiting the burial of Polynices; and finally, Antigone declares her intention to defy this edict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aeschylus pp.7–19&quot;/&gt; The play was the third in a connected Oedipus trilogy; the first two plays were ''Laius'' and ''Oedipus''. The concluding [[satyr play]] was ''The Sphinx''.&lt;ref&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Suppliants''===
{{Main|The Suppliants (Aeschylus)}}
[[Image:Danaïdes tuant leurs maris BnF Français 874 fol. 170v.jpg|thumb|left|Miniature by [[Robinet Testard]] showing the [[Danaïdes|Danaids]] murdering their husbands]]
Aeschylus continued his emphasis on the polis with ''The Suppliants'' in 463 BC (''Hiketides''), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens in advance of the establishment of a democratic government in 461. In the play, the [[Danaïdes|Danaids]], the fifty daughters of [[Danaus]], founder of [[Argos]], flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King [[Pelasgus]] of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move on the part of the king. The people decide that the Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;F246&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Freeman |1999 |p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1952 publication of Oxyrhynchus Papyrus 2256 fr. 3 confirmed a long-assumed (because of ''The Suppliants''' cliffhanger ending) Danaid trilogy, whose constituent plays are generally agreed to be ''The Suppliants'', ''The Egyptians'' and ''The Danaids''. A plausible reconstruction of the trilogy's last two-thirds runs thus:&lt;ref&gt;See (e.g.) Sommerstein 1996, 141–51; Turner 2001, 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Egyptians'', the Argive-Egyptian war threatened in the first play has transpired. During the course of the war, King Pelasgus has been killed, and Danaus rules Argos. He negotiates a peace settlement with Aegyptus, as a condition of which, his fifty daughters will marry the fifty sons of Aegyptus. Danaus secretly informs his daughters of an oracle predicting that one of his sons-in-law would kill him; he therefore orders the Danaids to murder their husbands on their wedding night. His daughters agree. ''The Danaids'' would open the day after the wedding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerstein 2002, 89&quot;&gt;Sommerstein 2002, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In short order, it is revealed that forty-nine of the Danaids killed their husbands as ordered; Hypermnestra, however, loved her husband Lynceus, and thus spared his life and helped him to escape. Angered by his daughter's disobedience, Danaus orders her imprisonment and, possibly, her execution. In the trilogy's climax and dénouement, Lynceus reveals himself to Danaus, and kills him (thus fulfilling the oracle). He and Hypermnestra will establish a ruling dynasty in Argos. The other forty-nine Danaids are absolved of their murderous crime, and married off to unspecified Argive men. The satyr play following this trilogy was titled ''Amymone'', after one of the Danaids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sommerstein 2002, 89&quot;/&gt;

===''The Oresteia''===
{{Main|Oresteia}}
The only complete [[trilogy]] of Greek plays by any playwright still extant (save a few missing lines in several spots) is the ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BC), although the satyr play that originally followed it, ''[[Proteus]]'', is lost except for some fragments.&lt;ref name=F244/&gt; The trilogy consists of ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephoroi''), and ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]''.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; Together, these plays tell the bloody story of the family of [[Agamemnon]], King of [[Argos]].

====''Agamemnon''====
[[Image:Gérin Clytemnestre hésitant avant de frapper Agamemnon endormi Louvre 5185.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Murder of Agamemnon'' by [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]] (1817)]]

Aeschylus begins in Greece describing the return of King [[Agamemnon]] from his victory in the [[Trojan War]], from the perspective of the towns people (the Chorus) and his wife, [[Clytemnestra]]. However, dark foreshadowings build to the death of the king at the hands of his wife, who was angry at his sacrifice of their daughter [[Iphigenia]], who was killed so that the gods would restore the winds and allow the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. She was also unhappy at his keeping of the Trojan prophetess [[Cassandra]] as a concubine. Cassandra foretells of the murder of Agamemnon, and of herself, to the assembled townsfolk, who are horrified. She then enters the palace knowing that she cannot avoid her fate. The ending of the play includes a prediction of the return of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], son of Agamemnon, who will seek to avenge his father.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;''

====''The Libation Bearers''====
''The Libation Bearers'' continues the tale, opening with Orestes's arrival at Agamemnon's tomb. At the tomb, Electra meets [[Orestes]], who has returned from exile in [[Phocis]], and they plan revenge upon Clytemnestra and her lover [[Aegisthus]].  Clytemnestra's account of a nightmare in which she gives birth to a snake is recounted by the chorus; and this leads her to order [[Electra]], her daughter, to pour libations on Agamemnon's tomb (with the assistance of libation bearers) in hope of making amends. Orestes enters the palace pretending to bear news of his own death, and when Clytemnestra calls in Aegisthus to share in the news, Orestes kills them both. Orestes is then beset by the [[Erinyes|Furies]], who avenge the murders of kin in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt;

====''The Eumenides''====
The final play of ''The Oresteia'' addresses the question of Orestes' guilt.&lt;ref name=F244246/&gt; The Furies drive Orestes from Argos and into the wilderness. He makes his way to the temple of Apollo and begs him to drive the Furies away. Apollo had encouraged Orestes to kill Clytemnestra, and so bears some of the guilt for the murder. The Furies are a more ancient race of the gods, and Apollo sends Orestes to the temple of Athena, with Hermes as a guide.&lt;ref name=F246/&gt;

The Furies track him down, and the goddess [[Athena]], patron of Athens, steps in and declares that a trial is necessary. Apollo argues Orestes' case, and after the judges (including Athena) deliver a tie vote, Athena announces that Orestes is acquitted. She renames the Furies  ''The Eumenides'' (The Good-spirited, or Kindly Ones), and extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and, as in ''The Suppliants'', the ideals of a democratic Athens are praised.&lt;ref name=F246/&gt;

===''Prometheus Bound''===
{{Main|Prometheus Bound}}
[[File:Dirck van Baburen - Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan Rijksmuseum SK-A-1606.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Prometheus Being Chained by Vulcan]]'' by [[Dirck van Baburen]] (1623)]]

In addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, ''Prometheus Bound'', is attributed to Aeschylus by ancient authorities. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have increasingly doubted this ascription, largely on stylistic grounds. Its production date is also in dispute, with theories ranging from the 480s BC to as late as the 410s.&lt;ref name=S33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Griffith |1983 |pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play consists mostly of static dialogue, as throughout the play the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] is bound to a rock as punishment from the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]] [[Zeus]] for providing fire to humans. The god [[Hephaestus]], the Titan [[Oceanus]], and the [[greek chorus|chorus]] of [[Oceanids]] all express sympathy for Prometheus' plight. Prometheus meets [[Io (mythology)|Io]], a fellow victim of Zeus' cruelty; and prophesies her future travels, revealing that one of her descendants will free Prometheus. The play closes with Zeus sending Prometheus into the abyss because Prometheus refuses to divulge the secret of a potential marriage that could prove Zeus' downfall.&lt;ref name=Vellacott/&gt;

''Prometheus Bound'' appears to have been the first play in a trilogy called the ''[[Prometheia]]''. In the second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]'', Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat Prometheus' perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned at the conclusion of the [[Titanomachy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;For a discussion of the trilogy's reconstruction, see (e.g.) Conacher 1980, 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the trilogy's conclusion, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'', it appears that the Titan finally warns Zeus not to sleep with the sea nymph [[Thetis]], for she is fated to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus marries Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union is Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. After reconciling with Prometheus, Zeus probably inaugurates a festival in his honor at Athens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Lost plays==
Only the titles and assorted fragments of Aeschylus's other plays have come down to us.  We have enough fragments of some plays (along with comments made by later authors and scholiasts) to produce rough synopses of their plots.

===''Myrmidons''===
This play was based on books 9 and 16 in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. Achilles sits in silent indignation over his humiliation at Agamemnon's hands for most of the play. Envoys from the Greek army attempt to reconcile him to [[Agamemnon]], but he yields only to his friend [[Patroclus]], who then battles the Trojans in Achilles' armour. The bravery and death of Patroclus are reported in a messenger's speech, which is followed by mourning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

===''Nereids''===
This play was based on books 18, 19, and 22 of the ''Iliad''; it follows the Daughters of Nereus, the sea god, who lament Patroclus' death. In the play, a messenger tells how Achilles, perhaps reconciled to Agamemnon and the Greeks, slew [[Hector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

===''Phrygians'', or ''Hector's Ransom''===
In this play, Achilles sits in silent mourning over Patroclus, after a brief discussion with [[Hermes]]. Hermes then brings in [[Priam|King Priam of Troy]], who wins over Achilles and ransoms his son's body in a spectacular [[wikt:coup de théâtre|coup de théâtre]]. A scale is brought on stage and Hector's body is placed in one scale and gold in the other. The dynamic dancing of the chorus of Trojans when they enter with Priam is reported by [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

===''Niobe''===
The children of [[Niobe]], the heroine, have been slain by [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]] because Niobe had gloated that she had more children than their mother, [[Leto]]. Niobe sits in silent mourning on stage during most of the play. In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Plato]] quotes the line &quot;God plants a fault in mortals when he wills to destroy a house utterly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kopff 1997 pp.1-472&quot;/&gt;

==Influence==
===Influence on Greek drama and culture===
[[Image:Mosaic Orestes Iphigenia Musei Capitolini MC4948.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], main character in Aeschylus's only surviving trilogy, ''[[The Oresteia]]'']]
When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like [[Thespis]] had already expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;P222&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role.&lt;ref name=P222/&gt; He is sometimes credited with introducing ''skenographia'', or scene-decoration,&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Vitruvius]]. See Summers 2007, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (''cothurni'') to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as they walked on stage in the first performance of the ''Eumenides'', the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aeschylus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His plays were written in verse. No violence is performed on stage, and the plays have a remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'', in far-away locales.&lt;ref name=&quot;P223&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aeschylus's work has a strong moral and religious emphasis.&lt;ref name=P223/&gt; The ''Oresteia'' trilogy concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pomeroy|1999|pp=224–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeschylus's popularity is evident in the praise the comic playwright [[Aristophanes]] gives him in ''[[The Frogs]]'', produced some half-century after Aeschylus's death. Appearing as a character in the play, Aeschylus claims at line 1022 that his ''Seven against Thebes'' &quot;made everyone watching it to love being warlike&quot;; with his ''Persians'', Aeschylus claims at lines 1026–7 that he &quot;taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies.&quot; Aeschylus goes on to say at lines 1039ff. that his plays inspired the Athenians to be brave and virtuous.

===Influence outside Greek culture===
Aeschylus's works were influential beyond his own time. [[Hugh Lloyd-Jones]] draws attention to [[Richard Wagner]]'s reverence of Aeschylus. Michael Ewans argues in his ''Wagner and Aeschylus. The Ring and the Oresteia'' (London: Faber. 1982) that the influence was so great as to merit a direct character by character comparison between Wagner's ''Ring'' and Aeschylus's ''Oresteia''. A critic of his book however, while not denying that Wagner read and respected Aeschylus, has described his arguments as unreasonable and forced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Furness, Raymond |title=The Modern Language Review |journal=The Modern Language Review |volume=79 |issue=1 |date=January 1984 |pages= 239–40 |jstor=3730399 |ref=harv |doi=10.2307/3730399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[J. T. Sheppard]] argues in the second half of his ''Aeschylus and Sophocles: Their Work and Influence'' that Aeschylus, along with [[Sophocles]], have played a major part in the formation of dramatic literature from the [[Renaissance]] to the present, specifically in French and Elizabethan drama. He also claims that their influence went beyond just drama and applies to literature in general, citing Milton and the Romantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aeschylus and Sophocles: their Work and Influence |journal=[[The Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=265 |year=1927 |doi=10.2307/625177 |last=Sheppard |first=J. T. |authorlink=J. T. Sheppard |jstor=625177 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931), a trilogy of three plays set in America after the Civil War, is modeled after the ''Oresteia''. Prior to writing his acclaimed trilogy, O'Neill had been developing a play about Aeschylus himself, and he noted that Aeschylus &quot;so changed the system of the tragic stage that he has more claim than anyone else to be regarded as the founder (Father) of Tragedy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, Virginia, ed. ''Eugene O'Neill at Work''. New York: Frederick Ungar, 1981, p. 213. {{ISBN|0-8044-2205-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his presidential campaign in 1968, Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] quoted the [[Edith Hamilton]] translation of Aeschylus on the night of the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Kennedy was notified of King's murder before a campaign stop in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] and was warned not to attend the event due to fears of [[riot]]ing from the mostly [[African-American]] crowd. Kennedy insisted on attending and delivered an [[Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|impromptu speech]] that delivered news of King's death to the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/3645184605/ Virginia&amp;nbsp;– Arlington National Cemetery: Robert F. Kennedy Gravesite]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}

Acknowledging the audience's emotions, Kennedy referred to his own grief at the murder of Martin Luther King and, quoting a passage from the play ''Agamemnon'' (in translation), said: &quot;My favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote: 'Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.' What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black&amp;nbsp;... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.&quot; The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr.com&quot;/&gt;{{better source|date=February 2017}}
