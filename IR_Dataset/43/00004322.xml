{{Short description|Measure defined on all open sets of a topological space}}
In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], a '''Borel measure''' on  a [[topological space]] is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all [[Borel sets]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Fremlin, 2000. ''[http://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm Measure Theory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101220236/http://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm# |date=2010-11-01 }}''. Torres Fremlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Sigma-algebra#Generated .CF.83-algebra|smallest σ-algebra]] that contains the [[open set]]s of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; this is known as the σ-algebra of [[Borel set]]s.  A '''Borel measure''' is any measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Alan J. Weir | title=General integration and measure | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1974 | isbn=0-521-29715-X | pages=158–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors require in addition that &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is locally compact, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mu(C)&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; for every [[compact set]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. If a Borel measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is both [[inner regular]] and [[Regular_measure#Definition|outer regular]], it is called a [[Borel regular measure|'''regular Borel measure''']]. If &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is both inner regular and [[Locally finite measure|locally finite]], it is called a [[Radon measure]].

==On the real line==
The [[real line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; with its [[Real line#As a topological space|usual topology]] is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. While there are many Borel measures ''μ'', the choice of Borel measure that assigns &lt;math&gt;\mu((a,b])=b-a&lt;/math&gt; for every half-open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called &quot;the&quot; Borel measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. This measure turns out to be the restriction to the Borel σ-algebra of the [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, which is a [[complete measure]] and is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra. The Lebesgue σ-algebra is actually the ''completion'' of the Borel σ-algebra, which means that it is the smallest σ-algebra that contains all the Borel sets and has a [[complete measure]] on it. Also, the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lambda(E)=\mu(E)&lt;/math&gt; for every Borel measurable set, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the Borel measure described above).

==Product spaces==

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[second-countable]], [[Hausdorff topological space|Hausdorff topological spaces]], then the set of Borel subsets &lt;math&gt;B(X\times Y)&lt;/math&gt; of their product coincides with the product of the sets &lt;math&gt;B(X)\times B(Y)&lt;/math&gt; of Borel subsets of ''X'' and ''Y''.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir I. Bogachev. Measure Theory, Volume 1. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Jan 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Borel [[functor]] 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Bor}\colon\mathbf{Top}_{2CHaus}\to\mathbf{Meas}&lt;/math&gt; 
from the category of second-countable Hausdorff spaces to the category of [[Measurable space|measurable spaces]] preserves finite [[Product (category theory)|products]].

==Applications==

===Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral===
{{main|Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral}}
The [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]] is the ordinary [[Lebesgue integral]] with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of [[bounded variation]] on the real line.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a [[regular Borel measure]], and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Halmos|first1=Paul R.|author1-link=Paul R. Halmos|title=Measure Theory|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|location=Berlin, New York|isbn=978-0-387-90088-9|year=1974|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/measuretheory00halm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laplace transform===
{{main|Laplace transform}}
One can define the [[Laplace transform]] of a finite Borel measure μ on the [[real line]] by the [[Lebesgue integral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=§XIII.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}\mu)(s) = \int_{[0,\infty)} e^{-st}\,d\mu(t).&lt;/math&gt;

An important special case is where μ is a [[probability measure]] or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a [[Cumulative distribution function|distribution function]] ''f''.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}f)(s) = \int_{0^-}^\infty e^{-st}f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

where the lower limit of 0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is shorthand notation for

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\int_{-\varepsilon}^\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform.  Although with the [[Lebesgue integral]], it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].

===Hausdorff dimension and Frostman's lemma===
{{main|Hausdorff dimension|Frostman's lemma}}

Given a Borel measure μ on a metric space ''X'' such that μ(''X'') &gt; 0 and μ(''B''(''x'', ''r'')) ≤ ''r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' holds for some constant ''s'' &gt; 0 and for every ball ''B''(''x'', ''r'') in ''X'', then the [[Hausdorff dimension]] dim&lt;sub&gt;Haus&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') ≥ ''s''. A partial converse is provided by [[Frostman's lemma]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Lemma:''' Let ''A'' be a [[Borel measurable|Borel]] subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Then the following are equivalent:
*''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''s''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]].
*There is an (unsigned) Borel measure ''&amp;mu;'' satisfying ''&amp;mu;''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and such that 
::&lt;math&gt;\mu(B(x,r))\le r^s&lt;/math&gt; 
:holds for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

===Cramér–Wold theorem===
{{main|Cramér–Wold theorem}}
The [[Cramér–Wold theorem]] in [[measure theory]] states that a Borel [[probability measure]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^k&lt;/math&gt; is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections.&lt;ref&gt;K. Stromberg, 1994. ''Probability Theory for Analysts''. Chapman and Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after [[Harald Cramér]] and [[Herman Ole Andreas Wold]].
