'''British Railways''' ('''BR'''), which from 1965 traded as '''British Rail''', was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground [[rail transport in Great Britain]] between 1948 and 1997. It was formed from the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|&quot;Big Four&quot; British railway companies]] and lasted until the gradual [[privatisation of British Rail]], in stages between 1994 and 1997. Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the [[British Transport Commission]], it became an independent [[statutory corporation]] in 1962 designated as the [[British Railways Board]].&lt;ref&gt;s.1 Transport Act 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network. A process of [[dieselisation]] and [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]] took place, and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction, except for the [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]] (a [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] tourist line). [[Passenger train|Passengers]] replaced [[freight train|freight]] as the main source of business, and one third of the network was closed by the [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s in an effort to reduce [[rail subsidies]].

On privatisation, responsibility for track, signalling and stations was transferred to [[Railtrack]] (which was later brought under public control as [[Network Rail]]) and that for trains to the [[train operating company|train operating companies]].

The British Rail &quot;double arrow&quot; logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a [[double track]] railway and was nicknamed &quot;the arrow of indecision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://madebysix.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/the-arrow-of-indecision/ |title=The Arrow of Indecision |website=madebysix.wordpress.com |access-date=26 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427102214/https://madebysix.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/the-arrow-of-indecision/ |archive-date=27 April 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shannon |first=Paul |title=Blue Diesel Days |work=&lt;!--This webpage is actually a publisher's advert for the book (ISBN 978-0-7110-3225-5), but shows online the usage of the phrase referenced.

[[File:70013 Oliver Cromwell Carlisle Kingmoor.jpg|thumb|BR steam locomotive: number 70013 ''[[BR Standard Class 7 70013 Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell]]'']]
The rail transport system in Great Britain developed during the 19th century. After the grouping of 1923 under the [[Railways Act 1921]], there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR). During [[World War I]] the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete [[nationalisation]] had been considered, and the [[Railways Act 1921]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=The State and the Railways |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1920/aug/03/the-state-and-the-railways |publisher=[[Hansard]] |house=[[House of Lords]] |date=3 August 1920 |accessdate=14 March 2019 |column_start=711 |column_end=713 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719130758/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1920/aug/03/the-state-and-the-railways |archive-date=19 July 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected. Nationalisation was subsequently carried out after [[World War II]], under the [[Transport Act 1947]]. This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, as part of a policy of nationalising public services by [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government. British Railways came into existence as the [[business name]] of the [[Railway Executive]] of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=67 |title=Transport Act 1947 |author=Her Majesty's Government |year=1947 |work=The Railways Archive |publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office) |accessdate=25 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325224406/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=67 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also [[joint railway]]s between the Big Four and a few light railways to consider (see [[list of constituents of British Railways]]). Excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the [[Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway]]. The [[London Underground]] – publicly owned since 1933 – was also nationalised, becoming the [[London Transport Executive]] of the British Transport Commission. The [[Bicester Military Railway]] was already run by the government. The electric [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] was also excluded from nationalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citymetric.com/transport/liverpool-overhead-railway-was-legendary-it-worth-rebuilding-3575|title=The Liverpool Overhead Railway was legendary – but is it worth rebuilding? {{!}} CityMetric|website=www.citymetric.com|access-date=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426080003/https://www.citymetric.com/transport/liverpool-overhead-railway-was-legendary-it-worth-rebuilding-3575|archive-date=26 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

The Railway Executive was conscious that some lines on the (then very dense) network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially, and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation. However, the general financial position of BR became gradually poorer, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955. The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred to the parent Commission. Other changes to the British Transport Commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector.

==== Regions ====
British Railways was divided into regions which were initially based on the areas the former Big Four operated in; later, several lines were transferred between regions. Notably, these included the former [[Great Central Railway|Great Central]] lines from the Eastern Region to the London Midland Region, and the [[West of England Main Line]] from the Southern Region to Western Region
* [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]]: former Southern Railway lines.
* [[Western Region of British Railways|Western Region]]: former Great Western Railway lines.
* [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]]: former London Midland and Scottish Railway lines in England and Wales.
* [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]]: former London and North Eastern Railway lines south of York.
* [[North Eastern Region of British Railways|North Eastern Region]]: former London and North Eastern Railway lines in England north of York.
* [[Scottish Region of British Railways|Scottish Region]]: all lines, regardless of original company, in Scotland.

The North Eastern Region was merged with the Eastern Region in 1967. In 1982, the regions were abolished and replaced by &quot;business sectors&quot;, a process known as [[sectorisation]].

The Anglia Region was created in late 1987, its first General Manager being John Edmonds, who began his appointment on 19 October 1987. Full separation from the Eastern Region – apart from engineering design needs – occurred on 29 April 1988. It handled the services from {{stnlnk|Fenchurch Street}} and {{stn|Liverpool Street}}, its western boundary being {{stnlnk|Hertford East}}, {{stnlnk|Meldreth}} and {{stnlnk|Whittlesea}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 1987 |editor-last=Slater |editor-first=John |title=Anglia Region created |magazine=[[Railway Magazine]] |location=Cheam |publisher=Prospect Magazines |volume=133 |issue=1040 |page=758 |issn=0033-8923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 1988 |editor1-last=Slater |editor1-first=John |title=Anglia takes over |magazine=[[Railway Magazine]] |location=Cheam |publisher=Prospect Magazines |volume=134 |issue=1047 |page=426 |issn=0033-8923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1955 Modernisation Plan ===
{{Main|1955 Modernisation Plan}}
[[File:Bristol Pullman (8226781197).jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class 251|Blue Pullman]] at [[Bristol Bath Road depot]]]]
The report, latterly known as the &quot;Modernisation Plan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=23 |title=Modernisation and Re-Equipment of British Rail |author=British Transport Commission |publisher=(Originally published by the British Transport Commission) |year=1954 |work=The Railways Archive |accessdate=25 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031102337/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=23 |archive-date=31 October 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in January 1955. It was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century. A government [[White Paper]] produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962, but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;last trains&quot;&gt;Loft, Charles (2013) Last Trains – Dr Beeching and the Death of Rural England {{ISBN|9781849545006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety, and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic lost to the roads. Important areas included:
* [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] of principal main lines, in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]], [[Kent]], Birmingham to Liverpool/Manchester and Central [[Scotland]]
* Large-scale [[dieselisation]] to replace [[steam locomotives of British Railways|steam locomotives]]
* New passenger and freight [[rolling stock]]
* [[Railway signalling|Resignalling]] and track renewals
* Modern [[marshalling yard]]s
* The closure of an unspecified, but relatively small, number of lines

The government appeared to endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2&amp;nbsp;billion), but did so largely for political reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;last trains&quot; /&gt; This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs. The dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification; this resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, and a lack of standardisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;b4873&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=British Railways, 1948–73: a business history |author=Terence Richard Gourvish |author2=N. Blake |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |pages=286–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Containerization|containerised]] freight was being developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;b4873&quot; /&gt; The marshalling yard building programme was a failure, being based on a belief in the continued viability of [[wagon-load]] traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition, and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight.&lt;ref name=&quot;b4873&quot; /&gt; A 2002 documentary broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|BBC Radio Four]] blamed the 1950s decisions for the &quot;beleaguered&quot; condition of the railway system at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1989357.stm|title=Bad railways?

=== The Beeching reports ===

{{Main|Beeching cuts}}
During the late 1950s, railway finances continued to worsen, whilst passenger numbers grew after restoring many services reduced during the war, and in 1959 the government stepped in, limiting the amount the BTC could spend without ministerial authority. A White Paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year, and a new structure was brought into effect by the Transport Act 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=116 |title=Transport Act 1962 |author=Her Majesty's Government |year=1962 |work=The Railways Archive |publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office) |accessdate=25 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819224356/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=116 |archive-date=19 August 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This abolished the Commission and replaced it by several separate Boards. These included a British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1093 |title=''nationalarchives.gov.uk'' |access-date=17 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317104642/http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1093 |archive-date=17 March 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following semi-secret discussions on railway finances by the government-appointed Stedeford Committee in 1961, one of its members, [[Richard Beeching, Baron Beeching|Dr Richard Beeching]], was offered the post of chairing the BTC while it lasted, and then becoming the first Chairman of the British Railways Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/beeching_prog1.shtml &quot;Back to Beeching&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003010237/http://www0.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/beeching_prog1.shtml |date=3 October 2009 }}, BBC Radio 4, 27 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A major traffic census in April 1961, which lasted one week, was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network. This report—''The Reshaping of British Railways''—was published by the BRB in March 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=13 |title=The Reshaping of British Railways – Part 1: Report |author=British Transport Commission |year=1963 |work=The Railways Archive |publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office) |accessdate=25 November 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20101019045735/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=13 |archive-date=19 October 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=35 |title=The Reshaping of British Railways—Part 2: Maps |author=British Transport Commission |year=1963 |work=The Railways Archive |publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office) |accessdate=25 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026155439/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=35 |archive-date=26 October 2006 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals, which became known as the &quot;[[Beeching Axe]]&quot;, were dramatic. A third of all passenger services and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would close. Beeching, who is thought to have been the author of most of the report, set out some dire figures. One third of the network was carrying just 1% of the traffic. Of the 18,000 passenger coaches, 6,000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less. Although maintaining them cost between £3m and £4m a year, they earned only about £0.5m.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Beeching &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the closures were carried out between 1963 and 1970 (including some which were not listed in the report) while other suggested closures were not carried out. The closures were heavily criticised at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=236 &quot;The Economics and Social Aspects of the Beeching Plan&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021806/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=236 |date=5 June 2011 }}—Lord Stoneham, House of Lords, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to be controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/06/can-beeching-be-undone.html |title=Can Beeching be undone? |year=2009 |access-date=29 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619234000/http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/06/can-beeching-be-undone.html |archive-date=19 June 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of stations and lines closed under the Beeching programme have been reopened, with further reopenings proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8099912.stm &quot;Move to reinstate lost rail lines&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617194906/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/8099912.stm |date=17 June 2009 }}, BBC, 15 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A second Beeching report, &quot;The Development of the Major Trunk Routes&quot;, followed in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=14 |title=The Development Of The Major Railway Trunk Routes |work=The Railways Archive |publisher=British Railways Board |date=February 1965 |access-date=27 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418212554/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docsummary.php?docID=14 |archive-date=18 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not recommend closures as such, but outlined a &quot;network for development&quot;. The fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report.

=== Post-Beeching ===
The basis for calculating passenger fares changed in 1964. In future, fares on some routes—such as rural, holiday and commuter services—would be set at a higher level than on other routes; previously, fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled, which at the time was 3[[Penny#Name|d]] per mile second class, and 4½d per mile first class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-first=B.W.C. |editor-last=Cooke |date=July 1964 |title=Notes and News: New fares structure |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=110 |issue=759 |page=592 |publisher=Tothill Press |location=Westminster}}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|{{#expr: 3 / 240}}|1964|r=2}}}} and £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|{{#expr: 4.5 / 240}}|1964|r=2}}}} respectively, in {{Inflation-year|UK}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).

The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of some railways which had survived the Beeching Axe a generation earlier, but which had seen passenger services withdrawn. This included the bulk of the [[Chester and Connah's Quay Railway]] in 1992, the [[Brierley Hill]] to [[Walsall]] section of the [[South Staffordshire Line]] in 1993, while the [[Birmingham]] to [[Wolverhampton]] section of the Great Western Railway was closed in three phases between 1972 and 1992.

A further British Rail report, from a committee chaired by Sir David Serpell, was published in 1983. The [[Serpell Report]] made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km. This report was not welcomed, and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf. Meanwhile, BR was gradually reorganised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} This process, known as &quot;sectorisation&quot;, led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.

Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]], operating principal express services; London &amp; South East (renamed [[Network SouthEast]] in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed [[Regional Railways]] in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; In the [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] local services were managed by the [[Passenger Transport Executive]]s.

Because British Railways was such a large operation, running not just railways but also ferries, steamships and hotels, it has been considered difficult to analyse the effects of nationalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boocokc |first=Colin |title=Spotlight on BR: British Railways 1948–1998 Success or Disaster? |isbn=978-0-906899-98-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branding ==
{{Main|British Rail corporate liveries}}

=== Pre-1960s ===

Following nationalisation in 1948, British Railways began to adapt the corporate liveries on the rolling stock it had inherited from its predecessor railway companies. Initially, an express blue (followed by [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]-style [[Brunswick green]] in 1952) was used on passenger locomotives, and [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]]-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives, but later green was more widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Haresnape ''Railway Liveries. BR Steam 1948–1968''&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Height|Cresswell|1979}}

Development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the [[British Transport Commission]] and the [[Railway Executive]]. The Executive attempted to introduce a modern, curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems. Due to its similarity to a [[hot dog]], it became known as the &quot;flying sausage&quot;. BR eventually adopted the common branding of the BTC as its first corporate logo, an [[Art Deco]]-style motif of a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] astride a spoked wheel, designed for the BTC by [[Cecil Thomas (sculptor)|Cecil Thomas]]; on the bar overlaid across the wheel, the BTC's name was replaced with the words &quot;British Railways&quot;. This logo, nicknamed the &quot;Cycling Lion&quot;, was applied from 1948 to 1956 to the sides of locomotives, while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across Great Britain, each coloured according to the appropriate BR region.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}

In 1956, the BTC was granted a [[Achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] by the [[College of Arms]] and the [[Lord Lyon]], and then BTC chairman [[Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge|Brian Robertson]] wanted a grander logo for the railways. BR's second corporate logo (1956–1965), designed in consultation with [[Charles Franklyn]], adapted the original, depicting a rampant lion emerging from a [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] and holding a spoked wheel, all enclosed in a roundel with the &quot;British Railways&quot; name displayed across a bar on either side. This emblem soon acquired the nickname of the &quot;Ferret and Dartboard&quot;. A variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}

=== 1960s ===
[[File:British Rail - colour reversed logo.svg|thumb|The British Rail &quot;Double Arrow&quot; designed by Gerald Barney (1965)]]
The zeal for modernisation in the Beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise, and BR management wished to divest the organisation of anachronistic, heraldic motifs and develop a corporate identity to rival that of [[London Transport Board|London Transport]]. BR's design panel set up a working party led by [[Milner Gray (designer)|Milner Gray]] of the [[Design Research Unit]]. They drew up [[British Rail Corporate Identity Manual|a Corporate Identity Manual]] which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying [[Rail Blue]] and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock; [[Rail Alphabet]] as the standard corporate typeface, designed by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]]; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the &quot;Double Arrow&quot; logo. Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway. It was likened to a bolt of [[lightning]] or [[barbed wire]], and also acquired a nickname: &quot;the arrow of indecision&quot;. A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the [[port side]] of BR-owned [[Sealink]] ferry funnels.  The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to &quot;British Rail&quot;.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}{{sfn|Height|Cresswell|1979}}

=== Post-1960s ===

The uniformity of BR branding continued until the process of [[sectorisation]] was introduced in the 1980s. Certain BR operations such as [[InterCity (British Rail)|Inter-City]], [[Network SouthEast]], [[Regional Railways]] or [[Railfreight]] began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand. Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a [[generic trademark]] to denote railway services across Great Britain.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}} The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted as a piece of British [[design history]] and there are plans for it to be re-published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is the British Rail logo a design icon? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |work=BBC News |accessdate=20 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220132046/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |archivedate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|British Rail Investment}}Investment ===
In 1979 the incoming [[Conservative Government 1979-1983|Conservative Government]] led by Margaret Thatcher was viewed as anti-railway, and did not want to commit public money to the railways. However, British Rail was allowed to spend its own money with government approval. This led to a number of electrification projects being given the go-ahead, including the [[East Coast Main Line]], the spur from Doncaster to Leeds, and the lines in East Anglia out of London Liverpool Street to Norwich and [[King's Lynn railway station|King's Lynn]]. The list with approximate completion dates includes: 
*St Pancras – Bedford 1981–83
*Rock Ferry – Hooton 1985
*Hitchin – Leeds 1985–88
*Colchester – Norwich 1986
*Bishops Stortford – Cambridge 1987

== Preserved lines ==
The narrow-gauge [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]] in Ceredigion, Wales became part of British Railways at nationalisation. Although built as a working railway, in 1948 the line was principally a [[tourist attraction]]. British Rail operated the line using steam locomotives, long after the withdrawal of standard-gauge steam. The line's three steam locomotives were the only ones to receive [[TOPS]] serial numbers and be painted in BR Rail Blue livery with the double arrow logo. The Vale of Rheidol Railway was privatised in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway.

Other preserved lines, or [[heritage railways]], have reopened  lines previously closed by British Rail. These range from picturesque rural branch lines like the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]] to sections of mainline such as the [[Great Central Railway]]. Many have links to the National Rail network, both at station interchanges, for example the [[Severn Valley Railway]] between {{stnlnk|Kidderminster}} and [[Kidderminster Town]], and physical rail connections like the [[Watercress Line]] at {{stnlnk|Alton}}.

Although most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources, and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the nationalised industry.

[[File:Gb~brail.png|thumb|Sealink house flag]]
British Railways operated ships from its formation in 1948 on several routes. Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, [[Sealink]]. Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under TOPS as [[British Rail Class 99|Class 99]].

=== Sealink ===
{{Main|Sealink}}
[[File:Larne harbour (1984) - geograph.org.uk - 1158519.jpg|thumb|[[Sealink]] MV ''St David'' berthed in [[Larne]], [[Northern Ireland]]]]
Sealink was originally the brand name for the ferry services of British Rail in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Services to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were run by Sealink UK as part of the Sealink consortium which also used ferries owned by French national railways ([[SNCF]]), the Belgian Maritime Transport Authority [[Regie voor Maritiem Transport]]/Regie des transports maritimes (RMT/RTM) and the Dutch [[Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland]] (Zeeland Steamship Company).

Historically, the shipping services were exclusively an extension of the railways across the [[English Channel]] and the [[Irish Sea]] in order to provide through, integrated services to Europe and Ireland. As international travel became more popular in the late 1960s and before air travel became generally affordable, the responsibility for shipping services was taken away from the British Rail Regions and in 1969 centralised in a new division – British Rail Shipping and International Services Division.

With the advent of car ferry services, the old passenger-only ferries were gradually replaced by [[roll-on/roll-off]] ships, catering for motorists and rail passengers as well as road freight. However, given that there was now competition in the form of other ferry companies offering crossings to motorists, it became necessary to market the services in a normal business fashion (as opposed to the previous almost monopolistic situation).

In the late 1960s, as demand for international rail travel declined and the shipping business became almost exclusively dependent on passenger and freight vehicle traffic, the ferry business was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as Sealink UK Limited on 1 January 1979,&lt;ref name=company1402237&gt;[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/01402237 Companies House extract company no 1402237] Stena Line Limited formerly Stena Sealink Line Limited formerly Sealink Stena Line Limited formerly Sealink UK Limited&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sealink UK Limited formed ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 935 March 1979 page 111&lt;/ref&gt; a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[British Railways Board]], but still part of the Sealink consortium. In 1979, Sealink acquired [[Manx Line]] which offered services to the Isle of Man from Heysham.

Incorporated on 31 October 1969, British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) was a wholly-owned [[railway systems engineering]] subsidiary of the British Railways Board. Created through the [[Transport Act 1968]], to manage BR's thirteen workshops, it replaced the [[British Rail Workshops Division]] which had existed since 1948. The works managed by BREL were Ashford, Crewe, Derby Locomotive Works, Derby Litchurch Lane, Doncaster, Eastleigh, Glasgow (formerly St Rollox), Horwich Foundry, Shildon, Swindon, Temple Mills, Wolverton, and [[Holgate Road carriage works, York|York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/people/ap96/british-rail-engineering-ltd|title=British Rail Engineering Ltd|last=|first=|date=|website=Science Museum Group Collection|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; BREL began trading in 1970 under managing director A.E.

=== Advanced Passenger Train ===

[[File:Apt 370004 - euston - 13-02-1980.jpg|thumb|An [[Advanced Passenger Train|APT]] departs Euston for Glasgow]]
In the 1970s, British Rail developed [[tilting train]] technology in the [[Advanced Passenger Train]]; there had been earlier experiments and prototypes in other countries, notably Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/tilting/|title=Tilting Trains|website=Railway Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425142333/https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/tilting/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the tilt was to minimise the discomfort to passengers caused by taking the curves of the [[West Coast Main Line]] at high speed. The APT also had [[hydrokinetic brake]]s, which enabled the train to stop from 150&amp;nbsp;mph within existing signal spacings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=87| title=Tomorrow's Train, Today| author=British Railways Board| year=1980| work=The Railways Archive| publisher=(Originally published by the British Railways Board)| pages=18| accessdate=25 November 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820044056/http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=87| archive-date=20 August 2007| url-status=live}} (Promotional leaflet)&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction into service of the Advanced Passenger Train was to be a three-stage project. Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT ([[British Rail APT-E|APT-E]]), was completed. This used a [[gas turbine-electric locomotive]], the only [[multiple unit]] so powered that was used by British Rail. It was formed of two [[power car]]s (numbers PC1 and PC2), initially with nothing between them and later, two trailer cars (TC1 and TC2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.old-dalby.com/apt-e.htm |title=E Train |work=The Old Dalby Test Track |access-date=26 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829065627/http://www.old-dalby.com/apt-e.htm |archive-date=29 August 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cars were made of aluminium to reduce the weight of the unit and were articulated. The [[gas turbine]] was dropped from development, due to excessive noise and the high fuel costs of the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northeast.railfan.net/pro_faq2.html#turbine |title=Diesel-Electric Engine Operation – NE Rails |accessdate=26 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106163915/http://www.northeast.railfan.net/pro_faq2.html#turbine |archive-date=6 January 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The APT-E first ran on 25 July 1971. The train drivers' union, [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]], black-listed the train due to its use of a single driver. The train was moved to [[Derby]] (with the aid of a locomotive inspector). This triggered a one-day strike by ASLEF that cost BR more than the research budget for the entire year.&lt;ref name=&quot;APTP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apt-p.com/APTWithHindsight.htm|title= APT – With Hindsight|accessdate=26 November 2006|author=Alan Wickens|work=Prototype Advanced Passenger Train (APT-P.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase 2, the introduction of three prototype trains (APT-P) into revenue service on the [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow]] – [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] route, did occur. Originally, there were to have been eight APT-P sets running, with minimal differences between them and the main fleet. However, financial constraints lead to only three being authorised, after two years of discussion by the British Railways Board. The cost was split equally between the Board and the [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]]. After these delays, considerable pressure grew to put the APT-P into revenue-service before they were fully ready. This inevitably lead to high-profile failures as a result of technical problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;APTP&quot;/&gt;

These failures led to the trains being withdrawn from service while the problems were ironed out. However, by this time, managerial and political support had evaporated. Consequently, phase 3, the introduction of the Squadron fleet (APT-S), did not occur, and the project was ended in 1982.

Although the APT never properly entered service, the experience gained enabled the construction of other [[High-speed rail|high-speed trains]]. The APT powercar technology was imported without the tilt into the design of the [[British Rail Class 91|Class 91]] locomotives, and the tilting technology was incorporated into [[Ferrovie dello Stato|Italian State Railway]]'s [[Pendolino]] trains, which first entered service in 1987.

== Successor companies ==
{{See also|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date|Privatisation of British Rail|Impact of the privatisation of British Rail}}
Under the process of British Rail's privatisation, operations were split into more than 100 companies.{{when|date=November 2019}} The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by Railtrack. The Telecomms infrastructure and [[British Rail Telecommunications]] was sold to [[Racal]], which in turn was sold to [[Global Crossing]] and merged with [[Thales Group]]. The rolling stock was transferred to three private [[rolling stock company|rolling stock companies]] (ROSCOs). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off.

British Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of [[ScotRail (British Rail)|ScotRail]]; the final train that the company operated was a [[Railfreight Distribution]] goods train in autumn 1997. The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the [[Strategic Rail Authority]].

Since privatisation, the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re-let and the areas covered by franchises restructured. Franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include:

*[[Midland Mainline]]—superseded in 2007 by [[East Midlands Trains]]
*[[Great North Eastern Railway]]—superseded in 2007 by [[National Express East Coast]], brought back into public ownership with the creation of the new government-controlled [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast]] operator; the East Coast franchise was transferred to [[Virgin Trains East Coast]] in 2015 who had their franchise terminated five years early in 2018, and the East Coast Mainline was brought back into public ownership with the creation of the new government-controlled [[London North Eastern Railway]]
*[[Virgin Trains West Coast]]—superseded in 2019 by [[Avanti West Coast]]
*[[Virgin CrossCountry]]—superseded in 2007 by [[CrossCountry]]
*[[ScotRail (National Express)|ScotRail]]—operated by National Express, superseded in 2004 by [[First ScotRail]]; control of the franchise has since passed to [[Abellio ScotRail]]
*Great Western Trains—became First Great Western in 2008, renamed to [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] in 2015
*[[Wales &amp; West]]—became [[Wessex Trains]] and [[Wales &amp; Borders]] (including the [[Valley Lines (train operating company)|Cardiff Railway Company]] services operated as Valley Lines) in 2001, after being split into two separate franchises, and now run by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] and [[Transport for Wales (train operating company)|Transport for Wales]]
*[[Arriva Trains Northern]]—originally Northern Spirit, succeeded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail (Serco-Abellio)|Northern Rail]]
*[[First North Western]]—originally North Western Trains, succeeded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail (Serco-Abellio)|Northern Rail]]
*[[Anglia Railways]], Great Eastern (later [[First Great Eastern]]), and the West Anglia section of [[West Anglia Great Northern|WAGN]] were merged to become One, later renamed [[National Express East Anglia]], superseded in 2012 by [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Abellio Greater Anglia]], now known as Greater Anglia
*[[Thameslink (train operating company 1997–2006)|Thameslink]]—succeeded by [[First Capital Connect]] in 2006, combined at the same time with [[West Anglia Great Northern]] to form the Thameslink Great Northern franchise; succeeded by [[Govia Thameslink Railway]] in 2014, augmented by [[South Central rail franchise|South Central]] and [[Gatwick Express]] to form the [[Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise|Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern]] franchise in 2015
*LTS (London, Tilbury &amp; Southend)—rebranded as [[c2c]] in 2000
*[[Connex South Eastern]] became [[South Eastern Trains]], then [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]
*[[Connex South Central]] became South Central and later renamed [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]]
*Merseyrail Electrics superseded by [[Arriva Trains Merseyside]] and now [[Merseyrail]]
*[[South West Trains]] then South Western Railway operated by FirstGroup and MTR Corporation, in 2017
*[[Central Trains]]—divided in 2007 between [[London Midland]], [[CrossCountry]] and [[East Midlands Trains]]
*[[London Underground]] for the short underground [[Waterloo &amp; City line]]
*[[Silverlink]]—divided in 2007 between [[London Overground]] and [[London Midland]]

Since privatisation, many groups have campaigned for the renationalisation of British Rail, most notably '[[Campaign to Bring Back British Rail|Bring Back British Rail]]'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ellieharrison.com/jeremyvine/&lt;/ref&gt; Various interested parties also have views on the [[privatisation of British Rail]].

[[File:Bring Back British Rail logo.jpg|thumb|upright|Bring Back British Rail logo]]
The renationalisation of the railways of Britain continues to have popular support. Polls in 2012 and 2013 showed 70% and 66% support for renationalisation, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.globalrailnews.com/2012/09/13/70-want-end-to-rail-privatisation/ |title=70% want end to rail privatisation |date=13 September 2012 |work=www.globalrailnews.com |access-date=5 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716203326/http://www.globalrailnews.com/2012/09/13/70-want-end-to-rail-privatisation/ |archive-date=16 July 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Merrick |first1=Jane |title=Jeremy Corbyn reveals first official policy: To renationalise the railways |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-first-official-policy-to-renationalise-the-railways-10509504.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=5 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424075329/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-first-official-policy-to-renationalise-the-railways-10509504.html |archive-date=24 April 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[Rail franchising in Great Britain|rail franchises]] lasting sometimes over a decade, full renationalisation would take years unless compensation was paid to terminate contracts early.

When the infrastructure-owning company [[Railtrack]] ceased trading in 2002, the [[Blair ministry|Labour government]] set up the not-for-dividend company [[Network Rail]] to take over the duties rather than renationalise this part of the network. However, in September 2014, Network Rail was reclassified as a central government body, adding around £34 billion to public sector net debt. This reclassification had been requested by the [[Office for Budget Responsibility]] to comply with [[European System of Accounts|pan-European accounting standard]] ESA10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/10709868/Budget-2014-fears-of-more-austerity-in-spite-of-growth.html#source=refresh |title=Budget 2014: fears of more austerity in spite of growth |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 March 2014 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621005742/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/10709868/Budget-2014-fears-of-more-austerity-in-spite-of-growth.html#source=refresh |archive-date=21 June 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green party]] has committed to bringing the railways 'back into public ownership' and has maintained this impetus when other parties argued to maintain the status quo. In 2016, Green MP, [[Caroline Lucas]], put forward a [[Private Members Bill|Bill]] that would have seen the rail network fall back into public ownership step by step, as franchises come up for expiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/2016/01/22/caroline-lucas-mp-brings-railway-bill-to-parliament/|title=Caroline Lucas MP brings Railway Bill to Parliament|last=|first=|date=22 January 2016|website=The Green Party|access-date=2019-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Jeremy Corbyn]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] pledged to gradually renationalise British Rail franchises if elected, as and when their private contracts expire, creating a &quot;People's Railway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Elgot |first1=Jessica |title=Corbyn to launch transport campaign with rail pledges |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-to-launch-transport-campaign-with-rail-pledges |work=The Guardian |accessdate=5 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705224321/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/corbyn-to-launch-transport-campaign-with-rail-pledges |archive-date=5 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
