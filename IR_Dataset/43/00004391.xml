'''''Big Brother''''' is a Dutch reality competition television franchise created by [[John de Mol Jr.]], first broadcast in the Netherlands in 1999, and subsequently syndicated internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordicom 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/sites/default/files/kapitel-pdf/42_011-022.pdf|title=New Media, New Options, New Communities?|author=Drotner, Kirsten|website=|publisher=Nordicom|type=PDF|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show features contestants called &quot;housemates&quot; or &quot;House Guests&quot; who live together in a specially constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. The name is inspired by ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'' from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', and the housemates are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, they are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize.

{{As of|2019|9|21}}, there have been 448 seasons of ''Big Brother'' in over 54 franchise countries and regions. English-language editions of the program are often referred to by its initials &quot;BB&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706http:/www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706|title=Celebrity Big Brother|publisher=Channel 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of many Spanish-language editions of the program is translated as ''Gran Hermano'' (GH).

== Premise ==
[[File:International Logo of Big Brother.png|thumb|250px|The international ''Big Brother'' logo used from 1999 to 2018.]]
At regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endemol.com/programme/big-brother|title=Big Brother|website=|publisher=[[Endemol]]|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for the nominee they wish to be evicted or saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner.

Some more recent editions have since included additional methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. Occasionally, non-standard votes occur, where two houseguests are evicted at once or no one is voted out. In the earlier series of ''Big Brother'', there were 10 contestants with evictions every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced a larger number of contestants with weekly evictions. Most versions of ''Big Brother'' follow the weekly eviction format, broadcast over approximately three months for 16 contestants.

The contestants are required to do housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as &quot;Big Brother&quot;). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit. In some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance (to buy food and other essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.

== History ==

=== Name ===
The term ''Big Brother'' originates from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' with its theme of continuous oppressive surveillance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordicom 1&quot; /&gt; The program also relies on other techniques, such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'', and the &quot;Diary Room&quot; (or &quot;Confession Room&quot;) where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction.

=== Creation ===
The first version of ''Big Brother'' was broadcast in 1999 on [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]] in the [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]. In the first season of ''Big Brother'', the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture, and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, [[loft]], and other luxuries.

=== International expansion ===
The format has become an international TV franchise. While each country or region has its own variation, the common theme is that the contestants are confined to the house and have their every action recorded by cameras and microphones and that no contact with the outside world is permitted.

Most international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other: their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]] observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants usually are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. In 2001, the [[Big Brother (American TV series)|US version]] adopted a different format during its second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategize to advance in the game; in this format, the contestants themselves vote to evict each other. ''[[Big Brother Canada]]'', introduced in 2013, also follows the US format.  In 2011, the [[Big Brother (UK TV series)|UK version]] controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reversing this rule after a poll by ''Big Brother'' broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb13/features/0608/poll-big-brother-2012-housemates-discuss-nominations|title=POLL: Should housemates be able to talk nominations?|author=Scott, Matt|date=8 June 2012|website=|publisher=BBSpy|url-status=live|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cancellation of the UK edition in 2018, ''[[Big Brother Naija]]'' (Nigeria) is the only English-speaking edition in the franchise that follows the original international format.

== Reception ==

=== Overview ===
From a sociological and demographic perspective, ''Big Brother'' allows an analysis of how people react&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/psychologist-behind-big-brother/news-story/e193d00b9cc9a23be9917232d1a2e20c|title=Meet the psychologist behind Big Brother|website=news.com.au|access-date=19 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; when forced into close confinement with people outside of their [[comfort zone]] (having different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).

The show is notable for involving the Internet. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized by viewers and former contestants for heavy editing by producers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb110/issue110.pdf | title=Complaint by Ms Dawn Blake | author=Blake, Dawn | journal=[[Ofcom]] Broadcast Bulletin | date=27 May 2008 | issue=110 | type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and SMS. The house is shown live on satellite television, although in some countries there is a 10–15 minutes delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to have personal information broadcast) to be removed.

Contestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed varies according to the country's broadcasting standards.

=== Isolation ===
''Big Brother'' contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio, or the Internet. They are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the Bible, [[Tanakh]] or the [[Qur'an]]. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.

Contestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day, the program's producer, in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counseling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.

== Format changes and twists ==

Due to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of ''Big Brother''. All of these follow the normal ''Big Brother'' rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs: ''[[Big Brother (Albanian TV series)|Big Brother Albania]]'' of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], ''[[Big Brother Angola &amp; Mozambique|Big Brother Angola e Moçambique]]'' of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' of Africa (includes Angola, [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], Mozambique, [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Sierra Leone]], South Africa, [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Big Brother: The Boss|''Big Brother:'' الرئيس]] of the Middle East (includes [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]), ''[[Gran Hermano (Pacific)|Gran Hermano del Pacífico]]'' of South America (includes Chile, [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]), ''[[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Big Brother]]'' of Scandinavia (includes [[Norway]] and Sweden) and ''[[Veliki brat 2011|Veliki brat]]'' of the Balkans (includes [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[North Macedonia]]). The British version of the show accepts Irish applicants and was available between 2000 and 2010 as Channel 4 was available; {{as of|2015|lc=yes}} the show returned to Irish screens as TV3 bought the rights from UK broadcaster Channel 5 to air the show.

On the other hand, some countries have multiple franchises based on language. India has the most regional-based versions Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam language versions; Canada has French- and English-language versions; and the United States has English- and Spanish-language versions of the show.

=== Twists involving single franchises ===

==== Multiple areas and houses ====
In 2001, ''[[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)#Season 3|Big Brother 3]]'' of the Netherlands introduced the &quot;Rich and Poor&quot; concept, wherein the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates compete for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept until its [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 4|fourth season]]. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: [[Big Brother Africa|Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 5)|2010]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 6)|2011]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 7)|2012]] and [[Big Brother Africa (season 8)|2013]]), [[Big Brother (Albania)|Albania]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Australia]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Australia)|2003]] and [[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|2013]]), [[Veliki Brat|Balkan States]] (in [[Veliki Brat VIP 4|VIP 2010]] and [[Veliki brat 2011|2011]]), [[Big Brother Brasil|Brazil]] (from [[Big Brother Brasil 9|2009]] to [[Big Brother Brasil 20|2020]]), [[Big Brother (Canada)|Canada]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|2013]]–present), [[Big Brother (Denmark)|Denmark]] (in [[Big Brother (Denmark)#Big Brother 3|2003]]), [[Big Brother (Finland)|Finland]] (in [[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|2009]] and [[Big Brother 2014 (Finland)|2014]]), France (in [[Secret Story 3 (France)|2009]], [[Secret Story 5 (France)|2011]]–present), [[Big Brother Germany|Germany]] (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 4)|2003]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 5)|2004–05]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005–06]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 8)|2008]] and [[Big Brother Germany (Season 9)|2008–09]]), [[Big Brother (Greece)|Greece]] (in [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 3|2003]]), [[Bigg Boss|India]] (in [[Bigg Boss 6|2012]] and [[Bigg Boss 7|2013]]), [[HaAh HaGadol|Israel]] (in [[HaAh HaGadol 2|2009]]), [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] (in [[Grande Fratello Season 6|2006]] and [[Grande Fratello Season 7|2007]]), [[Big Brother Norway|Norway]] (in [[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 3 - Next Generation|2003]]), [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippines]] (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 3|Teen 2010]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|2011]]), [[Big Brother (Poland)|Poland]] (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 3|2002]]), [[Big Brother (Portugal)|Portugal]] (in [[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|VIP 2013]] and [[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|Slovakia]] (in [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|2005]]), [[Big Brother (Slovenia)|Slovenia]] (in [[Big Brother Slovenia Season 2|2008]], [[Big Brother 3 (Slovenia)|2015]] and [[Big Brother 4 (Slovenia)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Scandinavia]] (in [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season one|2005]]), [[Big Brother (South Africa)|South Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|2014]]), [[Gran Hermano (Spain)|Spain]] (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 1)|VIP 2004]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 10)|2008]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 11)|2009–10]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 12)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (UK)|United Kingdom]] (in [[Big Brother (UK series 3)|2002]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 5)|Celebrity 2007]], [[Big Brother (UK series 9)|2008]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 11)|Celebrity 2013]] and [[Big Brother (UK series 17)|2016]]) and [[Big Brother (U.S.)|United States]] ([[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|2009]]–present).

In 2011–12, the [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh Argentine series]] added ''La Casa de al Lado'' (&quot;The House Next Door&quot;), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such a playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to accommodate contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP--&gt;

The [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the &quot;Bubble&quot;: a glass house in a shopping mall in Rio de Janeiro where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season, a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled. The Glass House was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 11|eleventh season]], featuring five evicted housemates competing for a chance to join the house again, and in the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth season]], with six potential housemates competing for two places in the main house. A dividing wall from the ninth season was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 14|fourteenth Brazilian season]], when mothers and aunts of the housemates entered for [[International Women's Day]] and stayed in the house for 6 days, though they could not be seen by the housemates. Every season brings back the glass house. Some editions also featured a all white panic room, where contestants where held until one of them decided to quit the show.

In the [[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|fourth English-Canadian season]], two house guests were evicted and moved into a special suite where they were able to watch the remaining house guests. A week later, the houseguests were required to unanimously decide which of them to bring back into the house.

==== Evil Big Brother ====
In 2004, the [[Big Brother (British series 5)|fifth UK series]] introduced a villainous Big Brother with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in Australia, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], Germany, [[Greece]], Italy, the [[Netherlands]], South America,{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Scandinavia]],{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Serbia]], Spain, [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and Mexico.

==== Twin or triplet housemates ====
In 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (American season)|fifth US season]] introduced twins who were tasked with secretly switching back and forth in the house; they were allowed to play the game as individual house guests after succeeding at the deception for five weeks. This twist was reused in the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|seventeenth US season]] with an easier task of successfully changing places for five weeks without being ''evicted''.

This twin or triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications to this twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy. The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in [[Big Brother (Australian season 5)|2005]]), Germany (in [[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|2005–06]]), Bulgaria (in [[Big Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|2006]], [[Big Brother All Stars 2012 (Bulgaria)|2012]] and [[VIP Brother 9|VIP 2017]]), United Kingdom (in [[Big Brother (UK series 8)|2007]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 8)|Celebrity 2011]], [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 9)|Celebrity 2012]], [[Big Brother (UK series 14)|2013]], [[Big Brother (UK series 16)|2015]], [[Big Brother (UK series 17)|2016]] and [[Celebrity Big Brother (UK series 19)|Celebrity 2017]]), France (in [[Secret Story 2007 (France)|2007]], [[Secret Story 2011 (France)|2011]], [[Secret Story 7 (France)|2013]], [[Secret Story 9 (France)|2015]] and [[Secret Story 10 (France)|2016]]), Spain (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|2007]] and [[Gran Hermano 14 (Spain)|2013]]), Poland (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 4|2007]] and [[Big Brother (Polish season 7)|2019]]), India (in [[Bigg Boss (Season 2)#Sana Wadiwala|2008]]), Africa (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|2009]]), Balkan Region (in [[Veliki brat 2009|2009]] and [[Veliki Brat VIP 5|2013]]), Philippines (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 4|Teen 2012]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|2014]]), Portugal (in [[Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)|2010]] and [[Secret Story 3 (Portugal)|2012]]), Israel (in [[HaAh HaGadol 3|2011]]), Ukraine (in [[Big Brother (Ukraine)|2011]]), Argentina (in [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|2011]] and [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 9)|2016]]) and Albania (in [[Big Brother 6 (Albania)|2013]] and [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|2017]]).

==== Pairs competitions ====
Several versions of the program feature variations of the housemates competing in pairs:

* In [[Big Brother 6 (American season)|sixth American season]], each HouseGuest had a secret partner with whom had a pre-existing relationship. While each player was nominated and evicted as an individual, each pair had the goal of reaching being the Final 2 HouseGuests remaining. Should a secret pair succeed in this goal, the prize money awarded to the winner and runner-up would jackpot – the winner's prize doubling from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and the runner-up's prize quintupling from $50,000 to $250,000. 
* During the tenth week of the [[Big Brother (British series 7)|seventh UK series]], the housemates were paired with their &quot;best friend&quot; in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. 
** The [[Big Brother 9 (American season)|ninth American season]] added a romantic theme by pairing up the HouseGuests with their &quot;Soulmate&quot; and having them compete as couples. This twist was active for the first 3 weeks of the season. 
** The [[Big Brother 13 (American season)|13th American season]] featured a further twist to the pairs format by introducing the &quot;Dynamic Duos&quot; twist, where contestants formed pairs that would be nominated together but evicted separately. The nominee not evicted would be immune from further nomination until there were 10 HouseGuests remaining, at which point the pairs were dissolved.
*  The second season of the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|Philippine teen edition]] also featured the parents or guardians of the teens staying in the house; if a teen housemate was evicted, the coinciding parent or guardian would also be evicted.  A similar twist was used on the [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 4 (2005)|fourth Greek season]] was dubbed &quot;Big Mother&quot;, and featured housemates accompanied by their mothers.
* In the ninth season of Indian ''Big Brother'', &quot;Big Boss: Double Trouble&quot;, contestants entered the house tied up in pairs by the waist. They had joint chairs, beds, spoons, and even mugs. The twelfth season of Indian Big Brother &quot;Bigg Boss 12&quot; also featured pairs 'jodis' who were Teacher-Student, Policeman-Lawyer, sister-sister, etc.
* In the [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|ninth Albania season]] all the housemates wherever were in couples and for the first time in the history of ''Big Brother'', the winner was a couple (Danjel Dedndreaj and Fotini Derxho).

==== Secret missions ====
Secret missions are a common element of the show since their introduction during the [[Big Brother (UK series 6)|sixth UK series]]. During these missions, one or more housemates are set a task from Big Brother with the reward of luxuries for the household and/or a personal reward if the task is successful. Some versions of Big Brother have secret tasks presented by another character who lives in plain sight of the housemate. Such characters include Marsha the Moose (from BB Canada) and Surly the Fish (from BB Australia).

The [[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|eighth US season]] introduced &quot;America's Player&quot;, where a selected house guest must complete various tasks (determined by public vote) in secret for the duration of their stay in the house in exchange for a cash reward. It was repeated in the [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|tenth US season]] for a week. The [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|eleventh US season]] featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted to open a box, with [[unintended consequences]] for the house. The [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|twelfth US season]] featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. The [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|sixteenth US season]] featured &quot;Team America&quot;, in which 3 houseguests were selected to work as a team to complete tasks (determined by public voting) for a cash reward; this continued for the entire season despite the eviction of a team member.

The [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|fourth Argentine series]] added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and the person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear). The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in nomination for eviction. If nobody picked up the call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP--&gt;

==== Opening night twists ====
Since ''[[Big Brother (British series 2)|Big Brother 2]]'', the [[Big Brother (British TV series)|UK series]] has opened with a twist. This has included having three finalists (''Big Brother 2''); public voting for least-favourite housemates, with the housemates choosing between two nominees to evict (''Big Brother 3''); first-night nominations (''[[Big Brother (British series 4)|Big Brother 4]]''); suitcase nominations (''Big Brother 5''); Unlucky Housemate 13 (''Big Brother 6''); Big Brother Hood (''[[Big Brother (British series 7)|Big Brother 7]]''); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (''[[Big Brother (British series 8)|Big Brother 8]]''); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (''[[Big Brother (British series 9)|Big Brother 9]]''); housemates having to earn housemate status (''[[Big Brother (British series 10)|Big Brother 10]]''); a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] entering the house with an impossible task (''[[Big Brother (British series 11)|Big Brother 11]]''); [[Pamela Anderson]] entering as a guest for 5 days ([[Big Brother (British series 12)|Big Brother 12]]); first-night nominations and a public vote for a wildcard to become a housemate ([[Big Brother (British series 13)|Big Brother 13]]); a professional actor posing as a housemate and a mother and daughter as contestants ([[Big Brother (British series 14)|Big Brother 14]]); one contestant gets a pass to the final ([[Big Brother (British series 15)|Big Brother 15]]); first night eviction ([[Big Brother (British series 16)|Big Brother 16]]); two houses with &quot;the other house&quot; featuring enemies from the main house housemates past ([[Big Brother (British series 17)|Big Brother 17]]); [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife [[Brigitte Nielsen]] (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 3)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 4)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]''); a visit from [[Jade Goody]]'s family (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 5)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]'') and unlocked bedrooms allowing housemates to immediately claim beds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/ | title=Celebrity Big Brother exclusive: La Toya Jackson's diva demands – 3am &amp; Mirror Online | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | date=25 January 2009 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | author=Bryant, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last housemate becoming the Head of House (''[[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 6)|Celebrity Big Brother 6]]'').

A common opening twist is to only introduce a cast of a single-sex on the premiere of the show while having members of the opposite sex introduced over the next few days. The [[Big Brother (UK series 8)|eighth UK series]] first used this twist with an initial all-female house, adding a male housemate two days later. The same twist was used in the ([[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|fourth Bulgarian series]]), and an all-male premiere was used on ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|Big Brother Africa 4]]''.

==== Fake evictions ====
The fifth UK series introduced fake evictions, where Big Brother misleads housemates that eviction has taken place, only for the &quot;evicted&quot; housemate to reenter the house sometime later.

In the eighth UK series, one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.

In the [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|fifth Philippine edition]], four housemates were fake-evicted and stayed in a place called ''bodega''.

In the [[Big Brother (Australian season 10)|tenth Australian season]], Benjamin Zabel was fake-evicted for 24 hours before being returned to the house with immunity from eviction for that week. In the [[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|eleventh Australian season]] Travis Lunardi was fake-evicted and received advice from Benjamin Zabel for 24 hours; Travis returned to the house after a 3-day absence with immunity from eviction for that week.

In the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth Brazilian series]], Anamara Barreira was fake-evicted. She was removed and put into a small private apartment without the other housemates knowing she was still in the house. After 24 hours, she returned to the house as Head of Household and with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 16|sixteenth Brazilian series]], Ana Paula Renault was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 48 hours with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 18|eighteen Brazilian series]], [[Gleici Damasceno]] was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 72 hours with immunity from eviction and with the power to put someone to eviction.

In the [[Big Brother Türkiye|first Turkish series]], there is a fake eviction in week 10.

The Indian version ''[[Bigg Boss (franchise)|Bigg Boss]]'' sees frequent fake evictions. In Kannada Bigg Boss season 4, winner Pratham and co-contestant Malavika were kept in secret room after fake eviction for one week and they were both allowed in the Bigg Boss house.

Similarly in Kannada Bigg Boss season 5, firstly Jaya Srinivasan and Sameer Acharya were put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week and then Sameer Acharya was allowed into the house but Jaya Srinivasan was evicted from the secret room itself. In the same season, the runner up Divakar was put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week.

==== Coaches ====
[[Big Brother 14 (American season)|The fourteenth US season]] had four house guests from past seasons return to coach twelve new house guests, playing for a separate prize of $100,000. However, in a reset twist, they opted to join the normal game alongside the other house guests.

==== Red button ====
The seventh Argentine series incorporated a red button into the Confession Room, which would sound an alarm throughout the house. This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Anexo:Séptima temporada de Gran Hermano (Argentina)|date=2018-06-15|url=https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anexo:S%C3%A9ptima_temporada_de_Gran_Hermano_(Argentina)&amp;oldid=108714582|work=Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre|language=es|access-date=2019-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A red button is also used in ''[[Secret Story (France)|Secret Story]]'' series, however in this case whoever presses the button will try to guess someone's secret.

==== Legacy rewards or penalties ====
In ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]]'', evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a &quot;ninja&quot; delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year, the [[Big Brother 8 (Australia)|eighth Australian series]] introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which remaining housemate received a penalty. A similar punishment used on ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' was called the Molotov Cocktail, Dagger or Fuse.

==== Most valuable player ====
The [[Big Brother 15 (American season)|fifteenth US season]] allowed viewers to vote for a house guest to be made M.V.P., who then secretly nominates a third houseguest for eviction (in addition to the two selected by the Head of Household).

In a further twist introduced part-way through the MVP twist, the viewers themselves decided who the third nominee would be, with the HouseGuests still thinking one of their own is the MVP. Like many such twists, this was ended halfway into the season as the pool of contestants shrank.

==== Multiple heads of household ====
The [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|sixteenth]] and [[Big Brother 17 (American season)|seventeenth]] US seasons featured two Heads of Household every week and had four houseguests nominated for eviction. There was also a &quot;Battle of the Block&quot; competition where the two sets of nominees competed to save themselves; the winning pair not only saved themselves but dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them, who was then vulnerable as a replacement nominee if a veto was used. It is also used in specific weeks in Brazil since [[Big Brother Brasil 16]] where the HOH's have to choose which HoH will get 10 thousand [[Brazilian real|reals]] and who is the one that will win immunity.

==== Multiple winners ====
In 2011, ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 6)]]'' was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting US$200,000. In 2015, the [[Pinoy Big Brother: 737|sixth Philippine season]], also had two winners; one from the teens and one from the regular adults. Each of which received PHP1,000,000.

''[[Bigg Boss 8]]'' (India) ended with a twist, where the top five contestants were crowned 'champions'. The season was extended by 35 days (total 135) as a spin-off called ''Bigg Boss: Halla Bol'', where ex-contestants from previous seasons entered the house to compete with the five champions.

==== Reserve housemates ====
The [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|fourth Philippine season]] introduced the concept of having reserved housemates, those of whom are short-listed auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother. It was eventually done also in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|eighth Philippine season]] where the reserved housemates were placed in a camp (a separate House but is just adjacent to the Main House) and a that reserved housemate must compete amongst other reserved housemates while gaining points by participating in various tasks, including those that required the participation of doing such tasks outside of the Big Brother House premises. As the eviction was done weekly, once an official housemate is evicted from the Main House, the housemate(s) with the most points earned for that particular week crossovers to the Main House and becomes an official housemate.

This reserved housemates twist was also used in Argentina's [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh season]] and Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth season]].

=== Twists involving multiple franchises ===

==== Housemate exchanges ====
In 2002, the [[Big Brother México|Mexican]] and Spanish editions ([[Big Brother México#Big Brother 1|BBM1]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 3)|GH3]]) made temporary housemate exchanges. Mexico's Eduardo Orozco swapped with Spain's Andrés Barreiro for 7 days. In 2010, the first 2-housemate exchange was held by Spain and [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 11)|GH11]] and [[Grande Fratello (season 10)|GF10]]). Gerardo Prager and Saray Pereira from Spain were swapped with Carmela Gualtieri and Massimo Scattarella of Italy for 7 days.

In later years, several housemate exchanges were done around the world: [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 3|GH3]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 4)|GH4]]), [[Ecuador]] ([[Gran Hermano (Ecuadorian TV series)|GH1]]) and Mexico ([[Big Brother México#Big Brother 2|BBM2]]), and Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 1)|BBA1]]) and United Kingdom ([[Big Brother (UK series 4)|BB4]]) in 2003; [[Scandinavia]] ([[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season two|BB2]]) and [[Thailand]] ([[Big Brother Thailand (season 2)|BBT2]]) in 2006; [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother (season 2)|PBB2]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Slovenia)|BB1]]), and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 5|GH5]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) in 2007; Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) and [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|BB4]]) in 2008; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|BB5]]) and [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]) in 2009; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2010 (Finland)|BB6]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother Slavnih|BBS1]]) in 2010; Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 12)|GH12]]) and Israel ([[HaAh HaGadol 3|HH3]]) in 2010–11; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2011 (Finland)|BB7]]) and [[Norway]] ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 7|GH7]]) and Israel ([[HaAh HaGadol 4|HH4]]) in 2012; and Mexico ([[Big Brother México 2015 (Season 4)|BB4]]) and Spain ([[Gran Hermano 16 (Spain)|GH16]]) in 2015; Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 5)|GHVIP5]]) and Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]]) in 2017.

In 2012, four contestants from Denmark's [[Big Brother 4 (Denmark)|BB4]] visited Sweden's [[Big Brother 2012 (Sweden)|BB6]] and competed in a Viking-themed challenge. The Danish team won and 'kidnapped' Swedish contestant Annica Englund to the Denmark house for the following week.

In 2012, evicted housemate Laisa Portella of Brazil (from [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) was a guest on Spain's ''[[Gran Hermano 13 (Spain)|Gran Hermano 13]]'' for a week; the following week, non-evicted Noemí Merino of GH13 stayed in the Brazilian Big Brother house for 5 days.

In 2016, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Nikki Grahame]] and ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother Australia]]'' housemate Tim Dormer were voted in by Canada to be houseguests on the 4th season of ''[[Big Brother Canada]]''. Similarly, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Jade Goody]] appeared as a housemate on [[Bigg Boss]] India.

''Big Brother Australia'' (2015) contestant Priya Malik joined ''Bigg Boss 9'' (India) the same year as a wild card.

In 2017, [[Gran Hermano VIP (season 5)|GHVIP5]] contestant Elettra Lamborghini visited Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]].

In 2019, the winner of Italy's [[Grande Fratello (season 15)|GF15]], Alberto Mezzetti visited Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 19|BBB19]].

==== Evicted housemate visits ====
Anouska Golebiewski, an evicted housemate from the United Kingdom (housemate from [[Big Brother (British series 4)|BB4]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother (Australian season 3)|BB3]]) in 2003. In 2005, United Kingdom (Nadia Almada of [[Big Brother (British series 5)|BB5]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother (Australian season 5)|BB5]]) again. In 2006, United Kingdom ([[Chantelle Houghton]] of [[Celebrity Big Brother (British series 4)|CBB4]]) visited Germany ([[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|BBG6]]).

=== ''Celebrity'' and ''VIP'' Big Brother ===
{{Main|Celebrity Big Brother}}

The ''Big Brother'' format has been adopted in some countries; the housemates are local celebrities, and the shows are called ''[[Celebrity Big Brother]]'' or ''[[Big Brother VIP]]''. In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version.

==== Variations ====
The 2006 Netherlands series was entitled ''Hotel Big Brother''. This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.

Another variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''. Instead of being housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers &quot;Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary&quot; 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was £50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;celebhijack&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561|title=BB Celebrity Hijack |website=|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621073443/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561|archivedate=21 June 2007|access-date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[VIP Brother 3]] Bulgaria'' introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, which changed each week. Housemates were sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity. Ten out of Thirteen seasons of ''[[Bigg Boss]]'' (the Indian version of ''Big Brother'') have been celebrity-only seasons. The 10th season of ''Big Boss'' had celebrities put up against commoners, where a commoner ultimately won.

=== American format===
{{Details|topic=these Big Brother versions|Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother Canada}} 
The US and Canadian versions of ''Big Brother'' differ from most global versions of the series. The US series began in 2000 with the original Dutch format—i.e., housemates, or HouseGuests, as they are styled in the US, nominating each other for eviction and the public voting on evictions and the eventual winner. But due to both poor ratings and the concurrent popularity of ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'', a gameplay-oriented format was introduced in the [[Survivor (American TV series)|second season]], with HouseGuests allowed to strategize, politic and form alliances to survive eviction, with evictions being determined by a house vote.

In this format, HouseGuests vote each other out and choose the winner. Each week, one HouseGuest is chosen (usually by competition) as the Head of Household (HoH), who sleeps in a luxurious bedroom and nominates two fellow HouseGuests for eviction in a formal Nomination Ceremony. HoH also chooses Haves, who enjoy luxury foods and other special privileges, and Have-Nots, who must eat &quot;slop&quot; (a fortified oatmeal), sleep in designated uncomfortable beds and take cold showers. Before the sixteenth US season, HouseGuests competed in a Have/Have-Not challenge similar to the shopping tasks on ''Big Brother UK'' and other international editions.

In addition, US and Canadian ''Big Brother'' do not air a live launch show, as is customary in international editions—by the time the network show and live online feeds begin airing, it is not uncommon for at least one HouseGuest to already have been evicted. Also, the North American editions currently air only three times a week, compared with daily or six days a week for the recently canceled UK franchise. As a result, the TV episodes focus primarily on gameplay versus the day-to-day goings-on in the house; to see the latter, watching the live feeds is necessary.

The winner of the Power of Veto (PoV), introduced in the third US season, has the option to save one nominee (including him/herself) from eviction, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest in the former nominee's place. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees. When only two contestants remain, a jury formed of the most recently evicted HouseGuests (generally seven or nine) votes which of the two finalists wins the grand prize. Beginning in the fourth (2003) US season, jury members were sequestered off-site so that they would not be privy to the day-to-day goings-on in the house. (''Celebrity Big Brother US'' does not currently sequester its jury members—all evicted celebrity HouseGuests vote on the winner.)

In 2013, English-speaking Canada introduced its own version of the show on the cable channel [[Slice (TV channel)|Slice]]; the series moved to [[Global TV]] for its third (2015) season. The show followed the US format, but with more elaborate twists and greater viewer participation in the game. Secret tasks were introduced, usually presented by the show's mascot, &quot;Marsha the Moose&quot;; also, as in most global franchises, Big Brother was a distinct character who interacted with the HouseGuests. The [[Big Brother (Quebecer TV series)|French Canadian version]] mostly followed the US/Anglophone Canadian format, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions and decided the winner.

''[[Big Brother Brasil]]'' combines the US/Canada and international formats. Brazil votes on evictions and the winner, but housemates compete for HoH, Power of Immunity, and Power of Veto; there is also a weekly Estaleca (shopping) competition. HoH nominates one housemate for eviction, while the rest of the house nominates a second housemate. The winner of the Power of Immunity competition gets to choose someone to be safe from nomination, while the winner of Power of Veto can cancel a Power of Immunity decision or an HoH nomination.

The pilot for ''[[Big Brother China: Pilot Season|Big Brother China]]'', which premiered exclusively online in 2015, had housemates voting on evictions but the public voting for the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/cbb16/news/1121/big-brother-china-pilot-season-premieres-online-youku-tudou-housemates-lets-stay-together-india-house-bigg-boss|title=Big Brother China launches with twelve-day 'pilot series'|last=bbspy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same format was used for ''[[Big Brother: Over the Top]]'', an online-only spinoff of the US series that ran in 2016.

The 2020 revival of the Australia series is also rumoured to adapt the American format – having previously used the international format.

The ''Big Brother'' format has been otherwise modified in some countries:
* ''Big Brother: All-Stars'' (Belgium, 21 days; [[Bulgaria]]: Season 1–5, 27–29 days; United States, 72 days; United Kingdom, 18 days; [[Loft Story (Canadian TV series)#Season 6|French Canada]], 64 days; Africa, 91 days; Spain, 56 days; [[Portugal]] ''Secret Story'': Season 1–4, 22–50 days): Previous housemates from previous seasons compete. Belgium was the first country to have an All-Stars season (2003). Bulgaria was the first country to complete 3 All-Stars seasons (2014). Portugal was the first country to complete 4 All-Stars seasons (2015). Portugal was the first country to complete 5 All-Stars seasons (2017). Portugal was the first country to complete 6 All-Stars seasons (2018).
* ''Big Brother: Reality All-Stars'' (Sweden, 6 days; [[Denmark]], 32 days; Spain, 56 days): Contestants from different reality shows, including ''Big Brother'', compete.
* ''Big Brother: You Decide / Big Brother: Back in the House / Big Brother: Try Out'' ([[Poland]]: Season 1–2, 7–13 days; [[Norway]], 9 days; [[Serbia]], 7 days): Housemates, new or old, compete for a spot in the next regular season without nominations or evictions.
* ''[[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment|Teen Big Brother]]'' (United Kingdom, 10 days; [[Philippines]]: Season 1–4, 42–91 days): Teenagers 13 and older compete.
* ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|Big Brother: All In]]'' (Philippines: Season 11,13): A mix of teenagers, regular adults, and celebrities compete in one season. A variation, ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7|Big Brother: Lucky 7]]'' and ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|Big Brother: Otso]]'', has three to four batch of housemates stay inside until a number for each batch is left, and is joined by other members of other batches to form one new batch.
* ''[[Secret Story (disambiguation)#Television|Secret Story]]'' (France, [[Lithuania]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[Peru]] and [[Albania]]): Each housemate has a secret.
* ''[[Big Brother Panto (UK)|Big Brother Panto]]'' (United Kingdom, 11 days): Housemates from the previous series spent time in the Big Brother House to perform a [[pantomime]] at the series' end.
* ''[[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|Big Brother – The Village]]'' (Germany: Season 6, 363 days): The village had a class system of bosses, assistants and servants, living in separate houses, who competed in mixed teams; winning bosses could promote employees, while losing bosses became servants. Cash prizes were awarded weekly in an ongoing contest.
* ''[[Big Brother Family]]'' (Bulgaria: 81 days): Whole families entered the house with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family received a cash prize, a car and an apartment.

There are also &quot;test runs&quot;, with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in [[Argentina]], Bulgaria, the [[Czech Republic]], Germany, Mexico, the Pacific region, the Philippines and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the US edition, it is used as a promotional tool.

== Controversies ==

=== Legal ===
In April 2000, Castaway, an independent production company, filed a lawsuit against John de Mol and Endemol for stealing the concepts of their own show called ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survive!]]'', a reality television show where contestants are placed on a deserted island and have to take care of themselves alone. These contestants were also filmed by cameras around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/720966.stm | title=Geldof's Big Brother battle | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=20 April 2000 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court later dismissed the lawsuit filed by Castaway against de Mol and Endemol. The ''Survive!'' reality television format was later turned into ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/893180.stm | title=Blow for mogul's Big Brother claim | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=24 August 2000 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the estate of George Orwell sued CBS Television and Endemol for copyright and trademark infringement, claiming that the program infringed on the Orwell novel ''1984'' and its trademarks. After a series of court rulings adverse to the defendants (CBS and Endemol), the case was settled for an undisclosed amount of money on the evening of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Estate of George Orwell v. CBS, et al. 00-C-5034 (N.D. Ill.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', &quot;Orwellian Suit Socks 'Brother&quot;, 5 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times of London'', &quot;US Big Brother Is Sued over 1984 Link&quot;, 6 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Post'', &quot;CBS Loses 'Bro Battle', January 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, &quot;CBS, Orwell Estate Settle 'Big Brother' Lawsuit&quot;, 28 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual assault ===
There have been two documented occurrences of possible rape happening during the show. In ''Big Brother South Africa'', a male housemate was accused of assaulting a fellow housemate while she was asleep. The pair were filmed kissing and cuddling in bed before the cameras moved away and the male housemate reportedly claimed to housemates the next day that he had intercourse with the contestant. However, the female housemate was apparently shocked by the claims and informed female housemates that she had not consented to have sex with him. (Under South African law, this act would be constituted as rape.)&lt;ref name=africarape&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paterson|first1=Mark|title=Big Brother's South African rape horror show|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/tv-radio/big-brother/28073/big-brother%E2%80%99s-south-african-rape-horror-show|website=The Week|publisher=Dennis Publishing|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This male housemate was expelled immediately after the allegations surfaced, while the female housemate was removed from the house for her own protection and counselling.

In ''Big Brother Brasil'', many viewers reported that they watched a male housemate allegedly force himself on a female housemate while she was passed-out drunk after a &quot;boozy party&quot;.&lt;ref name=brazilrape&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/big-brother-brazil-alleged-rape|title=Big Brother Brazil contestant questioned over alleged rape|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=17 January 2012|accessdate=7 January 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, an incident of sexual assault occurred in the Australian Big Brother house in 2006, during the show's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Australian_season_6)|sixth season]]. Contestant Michael &quot;John&quot; Bric held down fellow contestant Camilla Severi in her bed while a second man, Michael &quot;Ashley&quot; Cox, &quot;slapped&quot; her in the face with his penis. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pedestrian.tv/film-tv/alcohol-reality-tv-big-brother-turkey-slap/&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was shown on the 'adults-only' late-night segment, ''Big Brother: Adults Only'', leading to the show's cancellation. Both men involved in the incident were removed from the house.
