'''Bioterrorism''' is [[terrorism]] involving the intentional release or dissemination of [[biological agent]]s. These agents are [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, insects, fungi, or [[toxin]]s, and may be in a naturally occurring or a human-modified form, in much the same way in [[biological warfare]]. Further, modern [[agribusiness]] is vulnerable to [[:Category:Anti-agriculture_weapons|anti-agricultural]] attacks by terrorists, and such attacks can seriously damage economy as well as [[consumer confidence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;croodybook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Croddy |first1=Eric |last2=Perez-Armendariz |first2=Clarissa |last3=Hart |first3=John |title=Chemical and biological warfare : a comprehensive survey for the concerned citizen |date=2002 |publisher=Copernicus Books |isbn=0387950761 |pages=78-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The later destructive activity is called '''agrobioterrorism''' and is subtype of [[agro-terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roberge |first1=Lawrence F. |title=Agrobioterrorism |journal=Defense Against Biological Attacks: Volume II |date=2019 |pages=359–383 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-03071-1_16 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03071-1_16 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Bioterrorism is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, toxins or other harmful agents to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioterrorism {{!}} Anthrax {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/bioterrorism/index.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=25 October 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agents are typically found in nature, but could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Biological agents are attractive to [[Terrorism|terrorists]] because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the [[smallpox virus]], can be spread from person to person and some, like [[anthrax]], cannot.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDCBioterrorismOverview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioterrorism Overview|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/bioterrorism/overview.asp|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2008-02-12|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184927/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/bioterrorism/overview.asp|archivedate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Richard (2002). ''The Demon in the Freezer'', Ballantine Books, New York. {{ISBN|9780345466631}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioterrorism may be favored because biological agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, can be easily disseminated, and can cause widespread fear and panic beyond the actual physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;Advantages of Biologics as Weapons Bioterrorism: A Threat to National Security or Public Health Defining Issue? MM&amp;I 554 University of Wisconsin–Madison and Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, September 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Military leaders, however, have learned that, as a military asset, bioterrorism has some important limitations; it is difficult to use a bioweapon in a way that only affects the enemy and not friendly forces. A biological weapon is useful to terrorists mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country. However, technologists such as [[Bill Joy]] have warned of the potential power which genetic engineering might place in the hands of future bio-terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Joy|first=Bill|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us: How 21st Century Technologies Threaten to Make Humans an Endangered Species|date=2007-03-31|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-553-52835-0|title-link=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of agents that do not cause harm to humans, but disrupt the economy, have also been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agpolicy.org/weekpdf/116.pdf|title=&quot;Bioterrorism - the high economic costs of an attack&quot;|date=October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such pathogen is the [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD) virus, which is capable of causing widespread economic damage and public concern (as witnessed in the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|2001]] and [[2007 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|2007]] FMD outbreaks in the UK), while having almost no capacity to infect humans.

==History==
{{see also|History of biological warfare}}

By the time [[World War I]] began, attempts to use anthrax were directed at animal populations. This generally proved to be ineffective.

Shortly after the start of World War I, Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in the United States, Russia, Romania, and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;GregoryBWaggDMilitaryMedicine&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Gregory|first=B|author2=Waag, D.|title=Military Medicine: Medical aspects of biological warfare|url=http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/biological_warfare/BW-ch06.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-22|year=1997|publisher=Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army|id=Library of Congress 97-22242|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612003248/http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/biological_warfare/BW-ch06.pdf|archive-date=2009-06-12|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[Anton Dilger]] lived in Germany, but in 1915 he was sent to the United States carrying cultures of [[glanders]], a virulent disease of horses and mules. Dilger set up a laboratory in his home in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland|Chevy Chase]], Maryland. He used [[stevedore]]s working the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with [[glanders]] while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain. Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent, but was never arrested. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the [[1918 flu pandemic|Influenza Pandemic of 1918]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Experts Q &amp; A|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weapon/sfeature/qa.html|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2006-12-15|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions. Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia's mules and horses on the Eastern Front. These actions hindered artillery and troop movements, as well as supply convoys.&lt;ref name=&quot;GregoryBWaggDMilitaryMedicine&quot; /&gt;
 	
In 1972, police in [[Chicago]] arrested two college students, Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera, who had planned to poison the city's water supply with [[typhoid]] and other bacteria. Schwander had founded a terrorist group, &quot;R.I.S.E.&quot;, while Pera collected and grew cultures from the hospital where he worked. The two men fled to [[Cuba]] after being released on bail. Schwander died of natural causes in 1974, while Pera returned to the U.S. in 1975 and was put on probation.&lt;ref&gt;W. Seth Carus, &quot;R.I.S.E.&quot;, in ''Toxic Terror: Assessing Terrorist Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons'' (MIT Press, 2000), p.55, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) announced the eradication of smallpox, a highly contagious and incurable disease. Although the disease has been eliminated in the wild, frozen stocks of smallpox virus are still maintained by the governments of the United States and Russia. Disastrous consequences are feared if rogue politicians or terrorists were to get hold of the smallpox strains. Since vaccination programs are now terminated, the world population is more susceptible to smallpox than ever before.

In [[Oregon]] in 1984, followers of the [[Rajneesh|Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]] attempted to control a local [[election]] by [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack|incapacitating the local population]]. This was done by infecting [[salad]] bars in 11 restaurants, produce in grocery stores, doorknobs, and other public domains with ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' bacteria in the city of [[The Dalles]], [[Oregon]]. The attack infected 751 people with severe [[food poisoning]]. There were no fatalities. This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/undergraduate/courses/554/ppt/BT-PHproblem081030.ppt#363,15, Past U.S. Incidents of Food Bioterrorism.

In June 1993, the religious group [[Aum Shinrikyo]] released anthrax in Tokyo. Eyewitnesses reported a foul odor. The attack was a failure, as it did not infect a single person. The reason for this is that the group used the vaccine strain of the bacterium. The spores recovered from the attack showed that they were identical to an anthrax vaccine strain given to animals at the time. These vaccine strains are missing the genes that cause a symptomatic response.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;&gt;[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/1/03-0238_article CDC-'''Bacillus anthracis''' Incident, Kameido, Tokyo, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September and October 2001, several cases of [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax broke out]] in the [[United States]], apparently caused deliberately. Letters laced with infectious anthrax were concurrently delivered to news media offices and the U.S Congress, alongside an [[2001 anthrax attacks#Anthrax letter to Chile|ambiguously related case]] in [[Chile]]. The letters killed 5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/06/anthrax.case/index.html CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of agents==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2012}}
Under current [[United States law]], [[bio-agents]] which have been declared by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] or the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] to have the &quot;potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety&quot; are officially defined as &quot;[[select agents]].&quot; The CDC categorizes these agents (A, B or C) and administers the [[Select Agent Program]], which regulates the laboratories which may possess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States. As with US attempts to categorize harmful recreational drugs, designer viruses are not yet categorized and avian H5N1 has been shown to achieve high mortality and human-communication in a laboratory setting.

===Category A===
These high-priority agents pose a risk to national security, can be easily transmitted and disseminated, result in high mortality, have potential major public health impact, may cause public panic, or require special action for public health preparedness.

* Tularemia or &quot;rabbit fever&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/|title=CDC Tularemia - Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response|publisher=|date=2019-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tularemia has a very low fatality rate if treated, but can severely incapacitate. The disease is caused by the ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' bacterium, and can be contracted through contact with [[fur]], inhalation, ingestion of contaminated water or insect bites. ''Francisella tularensis'' is very infectious. A small number of organisms (10–50 or so) can cause disease. If ''F. tularensis'' were used as a weapon, the bacteria would likely be made airborne for exposure by inhalation. People who inhale an infectious aerosol would generally experience severe respiratory illness, including life-threatening pneumonia and systemic infection, if they are not treated. The bacteria that cause tularemia occur widely in nature and could be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory, although manufacturing an effective aerosol weapon would require considerable sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/facts.asp|title=CDC Tularemia - Key Facts About Tularemia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619165524/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/facts.asp|archivedate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anthrax disease|Anthrax]]: Anthrax is a non-contagious disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium ''Bacillus anthracis''. The ability of Anthrax to produce within small spores, or bacilli bacterium, makes it readily permeable to porous skin and can cause abrupt symptoms within 24 hours of exposure. The dispersal of this pathogen among densely populated areas is said to carry less than one percent mortality rate, for cutaneous exposure, to a ninety percent or higher mortality for untreated inhalational infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adalja|first=Amesh A.|last2=Toner|first2=Eric|last3=Inglesby|first3=Thomas V.|date=2015-03-05|title=Clinical Management of Potential Bioterrorism-Related Conditions|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=10|pages=954–962|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1409755|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25738671}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[anthrax vaccines|anthrax vaccine]] does exist but requires many injections for stable use. When discovered early, anthrax can be cured by administering [[antibiotic]]s (such as [[ciprofloxacin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

* [[Smallpox]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/|title=CDC Smallpox Home|publisher=|date=2019-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox is a highly contagious [[virus]]. It is transmitted easily through the atmosphere and has a high [[mortality rate]] (20–40%). Smallpox was [[smallpox#Eradication|eradicated]] in the world in the 1970s, thanks to a worldwide vaccination program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/prep/cdc-prep.asp|title=CDC Smallpox - What CDC Is Doing to Protect the Public From Smallpox|access-date=2018-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504090748/https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/prep/cdc-prep.asp|archive-date=2018-05-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some virus samples are still available in Russian and American laboratories. Some believe that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, cultures of smallpox have become available in other countries. Although people born pre-1970 will have been vaccinated for smallpox under the WHO program, the effectiveness of vaccination is limited since the vaccine provides high level of immunity for only 3 to 5 years. Revaccination's protection lasts longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallpox.mil/messageMap/messageMapAll.asp?cID=57|title=IHB - The DoD Immunization Information and Training Portal|access-date=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814032533/http://smallpox.mil/messageMap/messageMapAll.asp?cID=57|archive-date=2009-08-14|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a biological weapon smallpox is dangerous because of the highly contagious nature of both the infected and their pox. Also, the infrequency with which vaccines are administered among the general population since the eradication of the disease would leave most people unprotected in the event of an outbreak. Smallpox occurs only in humans, and has no external hosts or vectors.

[[Ebola virus disease]], in particular, has caused high [[fatality rate]]s ranging from 25–90% with a 50% average. No cure currently exists, although vaccines are in development. The Soviet Union investigated the use of filoviruses for biological warfare, and the [[Aum Shinrikyo]] group unsuccessfully attempted to obtain cultures of Ebola virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/4/99-0409_article|title=Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat? |publisher=|date=1999-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death from Ebola virus disease is commonly due to [[multiple organ failure]] and [[hypovolemic shock]]. Marburg virus was first discovered in [[Marburg]], Germany. No treatments currently exist aside from supportive care. The arenaviruses have a somewhat reduced case-fatality rate compared to disease caused by filoviruses, but are more widely distributed, chiefly in central [[Africa]] and [[South America]].

==Scenarios==

There are multiple considerable scenarios, how terrorists might employ biological agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;croodybook&quot;/&gt; In 2000, tests conducted by various US agencies showed that indoor attacks in densely populated spaces are much more serious than outdoor attacks. Such enclosed spaces are large buildings, trains, indoor arenas, theaters, malls, tunnels and similar. Contra-measures against such scenarios are building architecture and ventilation systems engineering. In 1993, sewage was spilled out into a river, subsequently drawn into the water system and affected [[1993_Milwaukee_Cryptosporidiosis_outbreak|400,000 people in Milwaukee]], Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Carolyn |title=Cryptosporidium and the food supply |journal=The Lancet |date=May 1995 |volume=345 |issue=8958 |pages=1128–1129 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(95)90972-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease-causing organism was [[cryptosporidium parvum]]. This man-made disaster can be a template for a terrorist scenario.&lt;ref name=&quot;croodybook&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, terrorist scenarios are considered more likely near the points of delivery than at the water sources before the [[water treatment]].&lt;ref name=croodybook/&gt; Release of biological agents is more likely for a single building or a neighborhood. Contra-measures against this scenario is the further limitation of access to the water supply systems, tunnels, and infrastructure. Agricultural [[crop-duster]] flights might be misused as delivery devices for biological agents as well.&lt;ref name=croodybook/&gt; Contra-measures against this scenario are background checks of employees of crop-dusting companies and surveillance procedures. 

In the most common hoax scenario, no biological agents are employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lathrop |first1=Peggy |last2=Mann |first2=Linda M. |title=Preparing for bioterrorism |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1305820/ |website=Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center) |pages=219–223 |date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, an envelope with powder in it that says, “You've just been exposed to anthrax.” Such hoaxes already showed to produce a large [[psychological warfare|psychological impact on the population]].&lt;ref name=wheelis&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wheelis |first1=Mark |last2=Casagrande |first2=Rocco |last3=Madden |first3=Laurence V. |title=Biological Attack on Agriculture: Low-Tech, High-Impact BioterrorismBecause bioterrorist attack requires relatively little specialized expertise and technology, it is a serious threat to US agriculture and can have very large economic repercussions |journal=BioScience |date=1 July 2002 |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=569–576 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0569:BAOALT]2.0.CO;2 |url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/52/7/569/247956#126036035 |language=en |issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-agriculture attacks are considered to require relatively little expertise and technology.&lt;ref name=wheelis/&gt; Biological agents against livestock, fish, vegetation, and crops are mostly not contagious to humans and therefore easier to handle by the attackers. Even a few cases of infections can disrupt a country's agricultural production and export for months like in the case with [[Foot-and-mouth_disease|FMD]].

==Planning and response==
{{main|Biodefense}}
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2012}}
Planning may involve the development of biological identification systems. Until recently in the United States, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities. Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks. Some outbreaks, such as food poisoning due to ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' or ''[[Salmonella]]'', could be of either natural or deliberate origin.

=== Preparedness ===
Biological agents are relatively easy to obtain by terrorists and are becoming more threatening in the U.S., and laboratories are working on advanced detection systems to provide early warning, identify [[contamination|contaminated areas]] and populations at risk, and to facilitate prompt treatment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} Methods for predicting the use of biological agents in urban areas as well as assessing the area for the hazards associated with a biological attack are being established in major cities. In addition, [[forensic]] technologies are working on identifying biological agents, their geographical origins and/or their initial source. Efforts include decontamination technologies to restore facilities without causing additional environmental concerns.

Early detection and rapid response to bioterrorism depend on close cooperation between [[public health]] authorities and law enforcement; however, such cooperation is lacking. National detection assets and vaccine stockpiles are not useful if local and state officials do not have access to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bernett|first=Brian C.|title=US Biodefense and Homeland Security: Toward Detection and Attribution|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-24|date=December 2006|publisher=Naval Postgraduate School|location=Monterey, California, United States|page=21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229164557/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/bernett06.pdf|archivedate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of protection against bioterrorism in the United States include:
*Detection and resilience strategies in combating bioterrorism. This occurs primarily through the efforts of the [[DHS Office of Health Affairs|Office of Health Affairs]] (OHA), a part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), whose role is to prepare for an emergency situation that impacts the health of the American populace. Detection has two primary technological factors. First there is OHA's BioWatch program in which collection devices are disseminated to thirty high risk areas throughout the country to detect the presence of aerosolized biological agents before symptoms present in patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepX&quot;&gt;United States. Cong. House. Committee on Homeland Security. Ensuring Effective Preparedness Responses and Recovery for Events Impacting Health Security Hearing before the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications of the Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, First Session, March 17, 2011. 112th Cong., 1st sess. HR 397. Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is significant primarily because it allows a more proactive response to a disease outbreak rather than the more passive treatment of the past.
*Implementation of the Generation-3 automated detection system. This advancement is significant simply because it enables action to be taken in four to six hours due to its automatic response system, whereas the previous system required aerosol detectors to be manually transported to laboratories.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepX&quot;/&gt; Resilience is a multifaceted issue as well, as addressed by OHA. One way in which this is ensured is through exercises that establish preparedness; programs like the Anthrax Response Exercise Series exist to ensure that, regardless of the incident, all emergency personnel will be aware of the role they must fill.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepX&quot;/&gt; Moreover, by providing information and education to public leaders, emergency medical services and all employees of the DHS, OHS suggests it can significantly decrease the impact of bioterrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepX&quot;/&gt;
*Enhancing the technological capabilities of first responders is accomplished through numerous strategies. The first of these strategies was developed by the Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) of DHS to ensure that the danger of suspicious powders could be effectively assessed, (as many dangerous biological agents such as anthrax exist as a white powder). By testing the accuracy and specificity of commercially available systems used by first responders, the hope is that all biologically harmful powders can be rendered ineffective.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepY&quot;&gt;United States. Cong. House. Committee on Homeland Security. First Responder Technologies: Ensuring a Prioritized Approach for Homeland Security Research and Development : Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications and the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies of the Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, May 9, 2012. 112th Cong., 2nd sess. HR 397. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enhanced equipment for first responders. One recent advancement is the commercialization of a new form of Tyvex™ armor which protects first responders and patients from chemical and biological contaminants. There has also been a new generation of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBA) which has been recently made more robust against bioterrorism agents. All of these technologies combine to form what seems like a relatively strong deterrent to bioterrorism. However, New York City as an entity has numerous organizations and strategies that effectively serve to deter and respond to bioterrorism as it comes. From here the logical progression is into the realm of New York City's specific strategies to prevent bioterrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepY&quot;/&gt;
*Excelsior Challenge. In the second week of September 2016, the state of New York held a large emergency response training exercise called the Excelsior Challenge, with over 100 emergency responders participating. According to [[WKTV]], &quot;This is the fourth year of the Excelsior Challenge, a training exercise designed for police and first responders to become familiar with techniques and practices should a real incident occur.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wktv.com/news/A_new_challenge_for_police_and_EMS_personnel.html|title=WKTV.com {{!}} A new Challenge for police and EMS personnel|date=2016-09-15|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005104757/http://www.wktv.com/news/A_new_challenge_for_police_and_EMS_personnel.html#|archive-date=2016-10-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was held over three days and hosted by the State Preparedness Training Center in [[Oriskany, New York|Oriskany]], New York. Participants included [[Bomb disposal|bomb squad]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, canine handlers, tactical team officers and emergency medical services.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/19747-first-responders-train-new-technology-n-y-s-largest-emergency-response-exercise/|title=First responders train with new technology at N.Y.'s largest emergency response exercise - Homeland Preparedness News|date=2016-09-19|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Homeland Preparedness News'', Bob Stallman, assistant director at the New York State Preparedness Training Center, said, &quot;We're constantly seeing what’s happening around the world and we tailor our training courses and events for those types of real-world events.&quot; For the first time, the 2016 training program implemented New York's new electronic system. The system, called NY Responds, electronically connects every county in New York to aid in disaster response and recovery. As a result, &quot;counties have access to a new technology known as Mutualink, which improves [[interoperability]] by integrating telephone, radio, video, and file-sharing into one application to allow local emergency staff to share real-time information with the state and other counties.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The State Preparedness Training Center in Oriskany was designed by the State Division of Homeland Security, and Emergency Services (DHSES) in 2006. It cost $42 million to construct on over 1100 acres and is available for training 360 days a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/2016/09/ny_police_train_for_terrorist_attacks_bombs_active_shooters_videos.html|title=Watch NY police train for terrorist attacks, bombs, active shooters (videos)|access-date=2016-10-03|date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from SUNY Albany's College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity, were able to participate in this year's exercise and learn how &quot;DHSES supports law enforcement specialty teams.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
* Project BioShield. The accrual of vaccines and treatments for potential biological threats, also known as medical countermeasures has been an important aspect in preparing for a potential bioterrorist attack; this took the form of a program beginning in 2004, referred to as [[Project Bioshield Act|Project BioShield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylton&quot;&gt;[[Wil S. Hylton|Hylton, Wil S.]] &quot;How Ready Are We for Bioterrorism?&quot; The New York Times. The New York Times Company, 26 Oct. 2011. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of this program should not be overlooked as “there is currently enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate every United States citizen… and a variety of therapeutic drugs to treat the infected.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Hylton&quot;/&gt; The Department of Defense also has a variety of laboratories currently working to increase the quantity and efficacy of countermeasures that comprise the national stockpile.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepXYZ&quot;/&gt; Efforts have also been taken to ensure that these medical countermeasures can be disseminated effectively in the event of a bioterrorist attack. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores championed this cause by encouraging the participation of the private sector in improving the distribution of such countermeasures if required.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrepXYZ&quot;&gt;United States. Cong. House. Committee on Homeland Security. Taking Measure of Countermeasures. Hearing before the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications of the Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, First Session, April 13, 2011 and May 12, 2011. 112 Cong., 1st sess. HR 397. Washington: U.S. G.P.O., 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a CNN news broadcast in 2011, the CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, weighed in on the American government's recent approach to bioterrorist threats. He explains how, even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago, the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease. Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities &quot;wouldn’t be able to distribute vaccines as well&quot; and &quot;wouldn't be able to track viruses.&quot; He also said that film portrayals of global pandemics, such as Contagion, were actually quite possible and may occur in the United States under the right conditions.&lt;ref&gt;John King, USA. CNNW. San Francisco. 20 Dec. 2011. Television.&lt;/ref&gt;

A news broadcast by [[MSNBC]] in 2010 also stressed the low levels of bioterrorism preparedness in the United States.  The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how &quot;biological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse.&quot; Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places. The broadcast suggested that the nation was not ready for something more serious.&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC News Live. MSNBC. New York City. 26 Jan. 2010. Television&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2016 interview conducted by Homeland Preparedness News, Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher for the RAND Corporation, stresses the importance in preparing for potential bioterrorist attacks on the nation. He implored the U.S. government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion. He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks, thereby further endangering the lives of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/19645-rands-gerstein-u-s-needs-biodefense-strategy-protect-terror-threats/|title=RAND's Gerstein: U.S. needs biodefense strategy to protect against terror threats|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-09-02|website=Homeland Preparedness News|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014. He claims there has not been a serious plan of action since 2004 during George W. Bush's presidency, in which he issued a Homeland Security directive delegating responsibilities among various federal agencies. He also stated that the blatant mishandling of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014 attested to the government's lack of preparation. This past May, legislation that would create a national defense strategy was introduced in the Senate, coinciding with the timing of ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups get closer to weaponizing biological agents. In May, 2016, Kenyan officials apprehended two members of an Islamic extremist group in motion to set off a biological bomb containing anthrax. Mohammed Abdi Ali, the believed leader of the group, who was a medical intern, was arrested along with his wife, a medical student. The two were caught just before carrying out their plan.&lt;ref&gt;https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/04/foiled-kenya-anthrax-plot-hints-at-islamic-states-scramble-for-africa/&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, which comprises a group of experts on national security and government officials, in which Gerstein had previously testified to, submitted its National Blueprint for Biodefense to Congress in October 2015 listing their recommendations for devising an effective plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Bill Gates said in a February 18, 2017 ''Business Insider'' op-ed (published near the time of his Munich Security Conference speech) that it is possible for an airborne pathogen to kill at least 30 million people over the course of a year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-op-ed-bio-terrorism-epidemic-world-threat-2017-2&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''New York Times'' report, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Gates Foundation]] predicted that a modern outbreak similar to the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Influenza pandemic]] (which killed between 50 million and 100 million people) could end up killing more than 360 million people worldwide, even considering widespread availability of vaccines and other healthcare tools. The report cited increased [[globalization]], rapid international air travel, and [[urbanization]] as increased reasons for concern.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hstoday.us/industry-news/general/single-article/exclusive-pandemic-crossroads/17c710beb467f48ccf7609188a8feb7a.html|title=Homeland Security Today: EXCLUSIVE: Pandemic Crossroads|last=Hutchinson|first=Robert C.|date=2017-07-09|website=www.hstoday.us|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 9, 2017 interview with CNBC, former U.S. Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], who was co-chair of the bipartisan [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]], said a worldwide pandemic could end the lives of more people than a nuclear war. Lieberman also expressed worry that a terrorist group like ISIS could develop a synthetic influenza strain and introduce it to the world to kill civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; In July 2017, Robert C. Hutchinson, former agent at the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], called for a &quot;whole-of-government&quot; response to the next global health threat, which he described as including strict security procedures at our borders and proper execution of government preparedness plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

===Biosurveillance===
In 1999, the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s Center for [[Biomedical]] Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called [[Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance|RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance)]]. RODS is designed to collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|author2=Espino, Jeremy|title=Healthcare Information Management Systems|chapter-url=|edition=3|year=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|pages=513–539|chapter=The role of clinical information systems in public health surveillance|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Wagner|first=Michael M.|author2=Aryel, Ron|title=Availability and Comparative Value of Data Elements Required for an Effective Bioterrorism Detection System|url=http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2001-11-28|publisher=Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance Laboratory|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303223152/http://rods.health.pitt.edu/LIBRARY/dato2AHRQInterimRpt112801.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Michael Wagner, the codirector of the RODS laboratory, and [[Ron Aryel]], a subcontractor, conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from &quot;non-traditional&quot; (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMRoleOfClinicalInformationSystems&quot; /&gt;

On February 5, 2002, [[George W. Bush]] visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a [[USD|$]]300 million spending proposal to equip all 50 states with biosurveillance systems. In a speech delivered at the nearby [[Masonic temple]], Bush compared the RODS system to a modern &quot;[[DEW]]&quot; line (referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Togyer|first=Jason|title=Pitt Magazine: Airborne Defense|url=http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=June 2002|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616101219/http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/june2002/feature1.html|archive-date=2010-06-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles and practices of biosurveillance, a new interdisciplinary science, were defined and described in the ''Handbook of Biosurveillance'', edited by Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, and published in 2006. Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).

Data which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, [[electronic health record]] systems, medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by [[ranching]] and [[feedlot]] operations, food processors, [[drinking water]] systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData&quot; /&gt;

In [[Europe]], disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency. The system not only monitors infected persons, but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak.

Researchers have experimented with devices to detect the existence of a threat:

* Tiny [[integrated circuit|electronic chips]] that would contain living [[neuron|nerve cells]] to warn of the presence of bacterial toxins (identification of broad range toxins)
* [[Fiber-optic]] tubes lined with [[antibody|antibodies]] coupled to light-emitting molecules (identification of specific pathogens, such as anthrax, botulinum, ricin)

Some research shows that ultraviolet [[avalanche photodiodes]] offer the high gain, reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air. The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the 50th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June 25, 2008. Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February 14, 2008 issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November 2007 issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541788/ Avalanche Photodiodes Target Bioterrorism Agents] Newswise, Retrieved on June 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Department of Defense conducts global biosurveillance through several programs, including the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System.&lt;ref&gt;Pellerin, Cheryl. [http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65852 &quot;Global Nature of Terrorism Drives Biosurveillance.&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112191814/http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65852 |date=January 12, 2013 }} ''American Forces Press Service'', 27 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another powerful tool developed within New York City for use in countering bioterrorism is the development of the New York City [[Syndromic Surveillance]] System. This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City, and was developed by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] (NYC DOHMH) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department—based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address—and assessing any patterns in symptoms. These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales; maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, H, D Zeng, and Y Pan. &quot;Infectious Disease Informatics: Syndromic Surveillance for Public Health and Bio-Defense.&quot; 20120, XXII, 209p. 68 illus.., Hardcover.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.

==Response to bioterrorism incident or threat==
{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2012}}
Government agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials and decontamination units, and emergency medical units, if available.

The US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[Chemical Biological Incident Response Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[20th Support Command (CBRNE)]], which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and [[decontamination|decontaminate]] victims exposed to bioterror agents. US response would include the [[Center for Disease Control]].

Historically, governments and authorities have relied on quarantines to protect their populations. International bodies such as the [[World Health Organization]] already devote some of their resources to monitoring epidemics and have served clearing-house roles in historical epidemics.

Media attention toward the seriousness of biological attacks increased in 2013 to 2014. In July 2013, ''Forbes'' published an article with the title &quot;Bioterrorism: A Dirty Little Threat With Huge Potential Consequences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Larry.

''Forbes''. 2013-07-21 (Retrieved 2014-02-17)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Fox News reported on a new strain of botulism, saying that the Centers for Disease and Control lists botulism as one of two agents that have &quot;the highest risks of mortality and morbidity&quot;, noting that there is no antidote for botulism.&lt;ref&gt;Heitz, David.

''New York Times''. 2014-02-13 (Retrieved 2014-02-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Gates]] has warned that bioterrorism could kill more people than nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bioterrorism could kill more people than nuclear war, Bill Gates to warn world leaders|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/17/biological-terrorism-could-kill-people-nuclear-attacks-bill/|accessdate=19 February 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, a [[CNN]] employee discovered on an airplane a &quot;sensitive, top-secret document in the seatback pouch explaining how the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] would respond to a bioterrorism attack at the [[Super Bowl]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900009991/jays-jokes-did-you-forget-your-bioterrorism-report-on-the-plane.html|title=Jay's Jokes: Did you forget your bioterrorism report on the plane?|last=Evensen|first=Jay|date=2018-02-12|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 U.S. budget proposal affecting bioterrorism programs ===
President Donald Trump promoted his first budget around keeping America safe. However, one aspect of defense would receive less money: &quot;protecting the nation from deadly pathogens, man-made or natural,&quot; according to ''The New York Times''. Agencies tasked with biosecurity get a decrease in funding under the Administration's budget proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/28/us/politics/biosecurity-trump-budget-defense.html|title=Trump's Proposed Budget Cuts Trouble Bioterrorism Experts|last=Baumgaertner|first=Emily|date=2017-05-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-30|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;
* The Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response would be cut by $136 million, or 9.7 percent. The office tracks outbreaks of disease.
* The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases would be cut by $65 million, or 11 percent. The center is a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that fights threats like anthrax and the [[Ebola virus]], and additionally towards research on HIV/AIDS vaccines.
* Within the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID) would lose 18 percent of its budget. NIAID oversees responses to Zika, Ebola and [[HIV/AIDS]] vaccine research.
&quot;The next [[weapon of mass destruction]] may not be a bomb,&quot; Lawrence O. Gostin, the director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights, told ''The New York Times''. &quot;It may be a tiny pathogen that you can't see, smell or taste, and by the time we discover it, it'll be too late.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

=== Lack of international standards on public health experiments ===
Tom Inglesy, the CEO and director of the Center for Health Security at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] and an internationally recognized expert on public health preparedness, pandemic and emerging infectious disease said in 2017 that the lack of an internationally standardized approval process that could be used to guide countries in conducting public health experiments for resurrecting a disease that has already been eradicated increases the risk that the disease could be used in bioterrorism. This was in reference to the lab synthesis of [[Orthopoxvirus|horsepox]] in 2017 by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]]. The researchers recreated horsepox, an extinct cousin of the [[Smallpox|smallpox virus]], in order to research new ways to treat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/23673-bioterrorism-threats-require-common-global-experimentation-oversight-expert-says/|title=Bioterrorism threats require common global experimentation oversight, expert says|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-08-10|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
