The earliest known mention of Bethlehem was in the [[Amarna letters|Amarna correspondence]] of 1350–1330 BCE when the town was inhabited by the [[Canaan]]ites. The [[Hebrew Bible]], which says that the city of Bethlehem was built up as a fortified city by [[Rehoboam]],&lt;ref&gt;'''2 Chronicles 11:5–6''' (Note: Though v. 6 is frequently translated to say simply that Rehoboam ''built'' the city, the Hebrew phrase in v. 5, just prior, וַיִּ֧בֶן עָרִ֛ים לְמָצ֖וֹר ''wayyiḇen ‘ārîm l&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;māṣôr'' means &quot;(and) he built cities into fortresses&quot;. Verse 5 is cited by at least one prominent Hebrew lexicon in illustration of this fact. See Koehler, L., Baumgartner, W., Richardson, M. E. J., &amp; Stamm, J. J., ''The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament'' (electronic edition; Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1994–2000), entry for the pertinent root בנה ''bnh'', p. 139. Def. 3 reads as follows: &quot;—3. with לְ to develop buildings: עָרִים לְמָצוֹר cities into fortresses 2C[hronicles] 11:5&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; identifies it as the city [[David]] was from and where he was crowned as the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king of Israel]]. The [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] identify Bethlehem as the birthplace of [[Jesus]]. Bethlehem was destroyed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] during the second-century [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]; its rebuilding was promoted by Empress [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], mother of [[Constantine the Great]], who commissioned the building of its great [[Church of the Nativity]] in 327 CE. The church was badly damaged by the [[Samaritans]], who sacked it during a [[Samaritan Revolts|revolt]] in 529, but was rebuilt a century later by Emperor [[Justinian I]].

Bethlehem became part of [[Jund Filastin]] following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Muslim conquest]] in 637. Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by a [[Crusades|crusading army]], who replaced the town's [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy with a [[Catholic Church|Latin]] one. In the mid-13th century, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control of Bethlehem passed from the Ottomans to the British at the end of [[World War I]]. Bethlehem came under Jordanian rule during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and was later captured by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Since the 1995 [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Oslo Accords]], Bethlehem has been administered by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

Following an influx of refugees as a result of Israeli advances in the 1967 war, Bethlehem has a [[Muslim]] majority, but is still home to a significant [[Palestinian Christians|Palestinian Christian]] community. It is now encircled and encroached upon by dozens of [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlements]] and the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], which separates both Muslim and Christian communities from their land and livelihoods, and sees a steady exodus of those from both communities being driven out.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== History ==

=== Canaanite period ===
The earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the [[Amarna letters|Amarna correspondence]] (c. 1400&amp;nbsp;BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, [[Abdi-Heba]], the Egyptian-appointed governor of Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking ''Bit-Laḫmi'' in the wake of disturbances by [[Habiru|Apiru]] mercenaries:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Oxford Archeological Guides: The Holy Land''&quot;, [[Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]], pp. 198–199, Oxford University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-19-288013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy ... Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!&quot;

It is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that it was originally a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDHP4&quot;&gt;&quot;''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Vol 4, Middle East and Africa''&quot;, Trudy Ring, K.A Berney, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Boda, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger, p. 133, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-884964-03-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lahmu|Laḫmu]]'' was the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Akkadian]] god of fertility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Uttermost Part of the Earth: A Guide to Places in the Bible |publisher=Wm. A. Eerdmans |author=Losch, Richard R. |year=2005 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; worshipped by the [[Canaan#Canaan in the Bible|Canaanites]] as ''Leḥem''. Some time in the third millennium BCE, Canaanites erected a temple on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity, probably dedicated to Lehem. The temple, and subsequently the town that formed around it, would then have been known as ''Beyt Leḥem'', &quot;House (Temple) of Lehem&quot;. The [[Philistines]] later established a garrison there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loschp51&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S5GJaakRvPgC&amp;pg=PA51|title=The uttermost part of the earth: a guide to places in the Bible|author=Richard R. Losch|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8028-2805-7|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical scholar [[William F. Albright]] noted that the pronunciation of the name remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, but has meant different things: &quot;'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], 'House of Meat' in Arabic.&quot;{{Full citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian-Palestinian team  found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 B.C. and 650 B.C. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/53939-ancient-burial-ground-found-near-bethlehem.html|title=Ancient Burial Ground with 100 Tombs Found Near Biblical Bethlehem|website=LiveScience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israelite and Judean period ===
Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the [[City of David]] in the form of a ''[[Bulla (seal)|bulla]]'' (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads &quot;From the town of Bethlehem to the King,&quot; indicating{{According to whom|date=June 2019}} that it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1938&amp;module_id=#as|title=Israel Antiquities Authority|website=antiquities.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the &quot;hill country&quot; of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], may be the same as the Biblical [[Ephrath]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Gen.|35:16}}, {{bibleverse||Gen.|48:7}}, {{bibleverse||Ruth|4:11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means &quot;fertile&quot;, as there is a reference to it in the [[Book of Micah]] as Bethlehem Ephratah.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Sam|17:12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New Testament describes it as the &quot;City of David&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;qjukjz&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|2:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is first mentioned in the [[Tanakh]] and the Bible as the place where the matriarch [[Rachel]] died and was buried &quot;by the wayside&quot; (Gen. 48:7). [[Rachel's Tomb]], the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the [[Book of Ruth]], the valley to the east is where [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] of [[Moab]] gleaned the fields and returned to town with [[Naomi (biblical figure)|Naomi]]. It was the home of [[Jesse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||1Sam|16:1}}&lt;/ref&gt; father of King [[David]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]], and the site of David's anointment by the prophet [[Samuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||1Sam|16:4–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of [[Adullam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||2Sam|23:13–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 4th century, the [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Pilgrim of Bordeaux]] reported that the sepulchers of [[David]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Asaph (biblical figure)|Asaph]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], [[Jesse]], and [[Solomon]] were located near Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centuryone.com/bordeaux.html |title=The Bordeaux Pilgrim @ |publisher=Centuryone.com|accessdate=2012-08-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224014259/http://www.centuryone.com/bordeaux.html |archivedate=2012-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no corroboration of this.{{According to whom|date=June 2019}}

The [[Gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb|Matthew|1:18–2:23|9}} and the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb|Luke|2:1–39|9}} represent [[Jesus]] as having been born in Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanders1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey2010&quot;/&gt; Modern scholars, however, regard the two accounts as contradictory&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanders1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey2010&quot;/&gt; and the [[Gospel of Mark]], the earliest gospel, mentions nothing about Jesus having been born in Bethlehem, saying only that he came from [[Nazareth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey2010&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, the tradition that Jesus was born in Bethlehem was prominent in the early church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt; In around 155, the apologist [[Justin Martyr]] recommended that those who doubted Jesus was really born in Bethlehem could go there and visit the very cave where he was supposed to have been born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt; The same cave is also referenced by the apocryphal [[Gospel of James]] and the fourth-century church historian [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt; After the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] ({{circa}} 132–136 CE) was crushed, the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] god [[Adonis]], to honour his favourite, the Greek youth [[Antinous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giuseppe Ricciotti 1948 p. 276&quot;&gt;Giuseppe Ricciotti, ''Vita di Gesù Cristo,'' Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana (1948) p. 276 n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Paul L., &quot;The First Christmas:  The True and Unfamiliar Story.&quot; 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In around 395 CE, the [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] wrote in a letter: &quot;Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of [[Dumuzid|Tammuz]], that is to say, [[Adonis]], and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was lamented.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Joan E.|date=1993|title=Christians and the Holy Places: The Myth of Jewish-Christian Origins|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KWAXbCNxH6YC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;q=Church%20of%20the%20nativity%20Tammuz|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-814785-5|pages=96–97|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have taken this letter as evidence that the cave of the nativity over which the [[Church of the Nativity]] was later built had at one point been a shrine to the ancient Near Eastern fertility god Tammuz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcello Craveri, ''The Life of Jesus'', Grove Press (1967) pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius, however, mentions nothing about the cave having been associated with Tammuz&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;/&gt; and there are no other Patristic sources that suggest Tammuz had a shrine in Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;/&gt; Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;/&gt; and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;/&gt; Joan E. Taylor has countered this contention by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor1993&quot;/&gt;

In 326–328, the empress [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], [[queen consort|consort]] of the emperor [[Constantius Chlorus]], and mother of the emperor [[Constantine the Great]], made a pilgrimage to Syra-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt; The [[Church of the Nativity]] was built at her initiative over the cave where Jesus was purported to have been born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt; During the [[Samaritan Revolts|Samaritan revolt]] of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brownrigg2002&quot;/&gt; In 614, the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Sassanid Empire]], supported by [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Jewish rebels]], invaded [[Palaestina Prima|Palestina Prima]] and captured Bethlehem.{{sfn|Klein|2018|page=234}} A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the [[magi]] depicted in [[Persian art|Persian]] clothing in a mosaic.{{sfn|Russell|1991|pages=523–528}}&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

In 637, shortly after [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|Jerusalem was captured]] by the [[Rashidun army|Muslim armies]], [[Umar|'Umar ibn al-Khattāb]], the second [[Caliphate|Caliph]], promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; A [[Mosque of Omar (Bethlehem)|mosque]] dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATT&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] in the 8th century, then the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the 9th century. A [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the [[Arabs|Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the &quot;Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;le Strange, 1890, pp.  [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/298/mode/1up 298]–300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]], who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] clergy were removed from their [[Episcopal see|sees]] and replaced with [[Catholic Church|Latin]] clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], first king of the Frankish [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

In 1187, [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] who led the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Muslim Ayyubids]], captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims.&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; [[William IV, Count of Nevers]] had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of [[Clamecy, Nièvre|Clamecy]] in present-day [[Burgundy]], France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '[[Titular see|in partibus infidelium]]' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;de Sivry, L: &quot;Dictionnaire de Geographie Ecclesiastique&quot;, p. 375., 1852 ed, from ecclesiastical record of letters between the Bishops of Bethlehem 'in partibus' to the bishops of Auxerre.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem, along with Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]], and [[Sidon]], was briefly ceded to the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] by a treaty between [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and Ayyubid Sultan [[al-Kamil]] in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reed, 2000, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1250, with the coming to power of the [[Mamluk]]s under [[Baibars|Rukn al-Din Baibars]], tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt;

=== Ottoman era ===

[[File:Bethlehem 1898.jpg|thumb|right|View of Bethlehem, Christmas Day 1898]]

From 1517, during the years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;/&gt; The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1994, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mrsAw_mk1d0C&amp;pg=PA33 33]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 [[Akçe|akce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Petersen141&quot;&gt;Petersen, 2005, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, 1994, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mrsAw_mk1d0C&amp;pg=PA84 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] of [[Egypt]]. During this period, the town suffered [[Galilee earthquake of 1837|an earthquake]] as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1860, p. 647.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to [[South America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMH&quot;/&gt; An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water crippled the town's growth.&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Thomson, p. 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Socin|Socin]] found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870  that  Bethlehem  had  a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 &quot;Latins&quot; in 256 houses, 824 &quot;Greeks&quot; in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count only included men.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/146/mode/1up 146]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Hartmann|Hartmann]]  found that  Bethlehem had 520  houses.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p.

=== Modern era ===

Jordan retained control of the city until the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the [[West Bank]]. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city.

According to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and [[Muslim]] population became equal by the mid-16th century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male tax-payers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the [[jizya]] tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer&quot;&gt;Singer, 1994, p.

In the [[New Testament]], the [[Gospel of Luke]] says that [[Jesus]]' parents traveled from [[Nazareth]] to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;qjukjz&quot;/&gt; The [[Gospel of Matthew]]  mentions Bethlehem as the place of birth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''[[Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium]]'', Oxford University Press 1999, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and adds that King Herod was told that a 'King of the Jews' had been born in the town, prompting Herod to order the killing of all the boys who were two years old or under in the town and surrounding area. [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], warned of Herod's impending action by an [[angel of the Lord]], decided to flee to Egypt with his family and then later settled in Nazareth after Herod's death.

Early Christian traditions describe [[Jesus]] as being born in Bethlehem: in one account, a verse in the [[Book of Micah]] is interpreted as a prophecy that the [[Messiah]] would be born there.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, 2004, p. 77. (citing {{bibleverse||Micah|5:2|KJV}})&lt;/ref&gt; The second century [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Justin Martyr]] stated in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'' (written c. 155–161) that the [[Holy Family]] had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town and then placed Jesus in a manger.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–100. &quot;Joseph&amp;nbsp;... took up his quarters in a certain cave near the village; and while they were there Mary brought forth the Christ and placed him in a manger, and here the Magi who came from Arabia found him.&quot;(Justin Martyr, ''Dialogue with Trypho'', chapter LXXVIII).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Origen]] of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;In Bethlehem the cave is pointed out where he was born, and the manger in the cave where he was wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the rumor is in those places, and among foreigners of the Faith, that indeed Jesus was born in this cave who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians. (Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'', book I, chapter LI).&lt;/ref&gt; This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1993, pp. 96–104./ref&gt; 

Many modern scholars question the idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply a connection to the lineage of King David.ref&gt;Vermes, 2006, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1993, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossan and Watts, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;344–345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus J.

=== Christmas celebrations ===
[[File:Bethlehem Christmas pilgrims enter town 1890.jpg|thumb|right|Christmas pilgrims, 1890]]

Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, but Greek, [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Orthodox]] Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]] Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the [[Church of the Nativity|Basilica of the Nativity]]. Roman Catholic services take place in [[Church of Saint Catherine, Bethlehem|St. Catherine's Church]] and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas.htm |title=Christmas in Bethlehem |publisher=Sacred Destinations |accessdate=2008-01-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924080353/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/bethlehem-christmas.htm |archivedate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other religious festivals ===

=== Embroidery ===
{{See also|Palestinian costumes}}
[[File:Bethlehem woman edited.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Woman in traditional Bethlehem costume]]

The women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCA2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-01-28 |url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020913101705/http%3A//www%2Epalestinecostumearchive%2Eorg/regional%2Ehtm |archivedate= September 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its &quot;strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stillman |first=Yedida Kalfon |title=Palestinian costume and jewelry |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |year=1979 |location=Albuquerque |pages=&amp;nbsp;46 |isbn=978-0-8263-0490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat (''bisht'') from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short ''taqsireh'' jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of [[velvet]] or [[broadcloth]], usually with heavy embroidery.&lt;ref name=PCA2/&gt;

Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for &quot;royal&quot; [[wedding dress]]es (''thob malak''), taqsirehs and the ''shatwehs'' worn by married women. It has been traced by some to [[Byzantium]], and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.&lt;ref name=PCA2/&gt;

=== Mother-of-pearl carving ===
{{main|Mother-of-pearl carving in Bethlehem}}
The art of mother-of-pearl carving is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s from [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&amp;cid=498&amp;did=2502&amp;pageflip=1 |title=Tourist Products|publisher=Palestine-Family.net |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2012-02-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206210408/http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&amp;cid=498&amp;did=2502&amp;pageflip=1|archivedate=2013-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constant stream of [[pilgrim]]s generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 128, 280, n.30&lt;/ref&gt; The industry was noted by [[Richard Pococke]], who visited Bethlehem in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wY4qAAAAMAAJ ''A Description of the East and Some other Countries''], p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural centers and museums ===
[[File:Workers in mother-of-pearl2.jpg|thumb|Craftsmen working with [[Mother-of-Pearl carving in Bethlehem|mother-of-pearl]] in the early 20th century]]
Bethlehem is home to the [[Palestinian Heritage Center]], established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, [[Palestinian art|art]] and folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestinianheritagecenter.com/objectives.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112225031/http://www.palestinianheritagecenter.com/objectives.htm|archivedate=2007-11-12|title=Palestinian Heritage Center: Objectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]] displays, and training.&lt;ref name=&quot;BH&quot;/&gt;

The Bethlehem branch of [[the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music]] has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncm.birzeit.edu/new/page.php?page=branches+ |title=The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music |accessdate=2008-01-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214165615/http://ncm.birzeit.edu/new/page.php?page=branches |archivedate=2008-02-14 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local government ==
[[File:Bethlehem-hamasrally.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Hamas]] rally in Bethlehem]]
Bethlehem is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) or district capital of the [[Bethlehem Governorate]].

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the ''mukhtars'' (&quot;heads&quot;) of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A [[Basic law|Basic Law]] was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.&lt;ref name=&quot;BME&quot;/&gt;

Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah [[Bedouin]]s and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;BME&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080813060937/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6 Municipal Council Elections during the British and Jordanian Periods] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813060937/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/TempVewMenuSub.php?Mid=6 |date=August 13, 2008 }} Bethlehem Municipal Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including [[Communism|Communist]], [[Islamism|Islamist]], and secular. The leftist factions of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) such as the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) and the [[Palestinian People's Party]] (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. [[Hamas]] gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 [[Palestinian local elections, 2004–2005|Palestinian municipal elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |title=Bethlehem Municipality(Site Under Construction) |accessdate=2008-01-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118135922/http://www.bethlehem-city.org/English/Counil/index.php |archivedate=January 18, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
