'''Brian Charles Lara''', {{post-nominals|list=[[Trinity Cross|TC]], [[Order of the Caribbean Community|OCC]], [[Honorary Member of the Order of Australia|AM]]}}  (born 2 May 1969) is a [[Trinidadian]] former international [[cricket]]er,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/52337.html|title=Player Profile: Brian Lara|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/serialisations/article3694486.ece |title= Genius of Brian Lara hailed by Wisden |work=The Times |location=UK  | date=7 April 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Mike | last=Atherton}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4472818.stm |title=Lara the best ever? | publisher=BBC News | first=Martin | last=Gough | date=26 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/268732.html |title=Lara the greatest among his peers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Cricket/CricketFeatures/501-reasons-why-Lara-was-the-best/Article1-1071627.aspx |title=501 reasons why Lara the best |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028083745/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Cricket/CricketFeatures/501-reasons-why-Lara-was-the-best/Article1-1071627.aspx |archivedate=28 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He topped the [[Test cricket|Test]] batting [[LG ICC cricket ratings|rankings]] on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in [[first-class cricket]], with 501 not out for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/44632651 |title=Brian Lara's 501 not out: The day Warwickshire's West Indies legend rewrote cricket records |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=7 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the only quintuple hundred in first-class cricket history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/04/brian-lara-unbeaten-501-25-years-on-cricket-the-spin|title=The Spin &amp;#124; Brian Lara's unbeaten 501, 25 years on, still looks unconquerable|first=Ali|last=Martin|date=4 June 2019|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara's match-winning performance of 153 not out against Australia in [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]] in 1999 has been rated by [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]] as the second best batting performance in the history of Test cricket, next only to the 270 runs scored by Sir [[Donald Bradman]] in [[The Ashes]] Test match of 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindujobs.com/thehindu/2001/07/28/stories/07280281.htm | title=Wisden 100 hails Laxman, ignores Tendulkar | work=The Hindu | location=India | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125130652/http://www.thehindujobs.com/thehindu/2001/07/28/stories/07280281.htm | archivedate=25 January 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muttiah Muralitharan]], rated as the greatest [[Test cricket|Test match]] [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]] ever by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-12/13/02&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/2572069.stm |title=Murali 'best bowler ever' |work=BBC Sport  |date=13 December 2002 |accessdate=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the highest wicket-taker in both [[Test cricket]]&lt;ref name=testlist&gt;''Cricinfo'', [http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/93276.html Highest Test Wicket-takers]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[One Day Internationals]] (ODIs),&lt;ref name=odilist&gt;''Cricinfo'', [http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/283193.html Highest ODI Wicket-takers]&lt;/ref&gt; has hailed Lara as his toughest opponent among all batsmen in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://in.rediff.com/wc2003/2003/feb/28muth.htm |title= Lara a tougher opponent than Tendulkar: Murali |publisher=Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lara was awarded the [[Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World]] awards in 1994 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;[[Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also one of only three cricketers to receive the prestigious [[BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year]], the other two being [[Sir Garfield Sobers]] and [[Shane Warne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7772192.stm |title= Sports Personality |publisher=BBC  | date=14 December 2008 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brian is one of eleven siblings. His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to [[Fatima College]] where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.

== Cricket career ==

===Early first-class career===
[[File:Brian Lara (4610977063).jpg|thumb|right|Lara batting for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] in 1994]]
1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by [[Carl Hooper]] set the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html ''The Coming Foretold''] [[The Independent]]. Retrieved 30 July 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811094615/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html |date=11 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He captained the tournament-winning Trinidad and Tobago, who profited from a match-winning 116 from Lara.

In January 1988, Lara made his first-class debut for [[Trinidad and Tobago cricket team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[Red Stripe Cup]] against [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leeward Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FC-debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149734.html |title=Brief but brutal |accessdate=23 January 2017 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second first-class match he made 92 against a [[Barbados cricket team|Barbados]] attack containing [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]], two greats of [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;FC-debut&quot;/&gt; Later in the same year, he captained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bicentennial Youth World Cup where the West Indies reached the semi-finals. Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under-23s against the [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 1988–89|touring Indian team]] further elevated his reputation.

His first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in [[Zimbabwe]] and scored 145.

In 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day [[Geddes Grant Shield]]. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11.

===International career===
{{see also|List of batsmen who have scored over 10000 One Day International cricket runs}}

In January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in Sydney. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2–1. Lara went on to name his daughter Sydney after scoring 277 at SCG.

Lara holds several world records for high scoring. He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were [[Roger Twose]] (115 partnership – 2nd wicket), [[Trevor Penney]] (314 – 3rd), [[Paul Smith (cricketer, born 1964)|Paul Smith]] (51 – 4th) and [[Keith John Piper|Keith Piper]] (322 unbroken – 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.

[[File:BrianLaraUkexpatCropped.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Lara batting for the West Indies against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, in 2002.]]

He is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player (after [[Donald Bradman]]) to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second (after [[Bill Ponsford]]) to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, third after Bradman's twelve and [[Kumar Sangakkara]]'s eleven. As a captain, he scored five double centuries, which is the highest by any one who is in charge. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2–2. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in an innings of 226 played at [[Adelaide Oval]], Australia in November 2005. This was later broken by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[India]] on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] 2008.

Lara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Following this they played [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] in a four-Test series which was drawn 2–2, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.

The [[Wisden 100]] rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998–99 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936–37.

In 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty – including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever bowled to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/133274.html |title=Murali: 'Lara's still No. 1' |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1–0 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy. For his performances in 2004, he was named both in the World Test XI and ODI XI by ICC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/143090.html|title=Rahul Dravid is the ICC's player of the year|publisher=ESPNcricinfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal [[Cable &amp; Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable &amp; Wireless]] sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, [[Digicel]]. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars [[Chris Gayle]], [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and [[Dwayne Bravo]]. Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/146390.html |title='I'm ready to play if best team is selected' – Lara |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring [[South African cricket team|South African team]].

Lara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly appointed [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]]. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one-day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados which the West Indies eventually won.

Three innings by Lara were placed in the top 15 (the most for any batsman in that range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/30bat100.htm |work=Cricket channel |publisher=Rediff.com |title=Top 100 Batsmen of all time}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 153 not out in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]], during West Indies' 2–2 home series draw against Australia in *1998–1999 was deemed the second greatest Test innings ever played, behind Bradman's 270 against England in the Third Test of the 1936–1937 series at [[Melbourne cricket ground|Melbourne]].
* He was voted as 2nd scariest batsman to face in the &quot;World's Scariest Batsman&quot; poll of international bowlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
