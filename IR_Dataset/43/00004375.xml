'''Barry Lamar Bonds''' (born July 24, 1964) is an American former [[professional baseball]] [[left fielder]] who played 22 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freeagent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4730658|title=Barry Bonds' agent says slugger's career is over|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=December 10, 2009|accessdate=December 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218023717/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4730658|archivedate=December 18, 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a record seven [[National League|NL]] [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, eight [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] awards, a record 12 [[Silver Slugger Award|Silver Slugger]] awards, and 14 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] selections.

Bonds was regarded as an exceptional [[hit (baseball)|hitter]]: he led MLB in [[on-base plus slugging]] six times, and placed within the top five hitters in 12 of his 17 [[Batting average (baseball)#Qualifications for the batting title|qualifying]] seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/onbase_plus_slugging_top_ten.shtml|title=Year-by-Year Top-Tens Leaders &amp;Records for On-Base Plus Slugging {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1109&amp;position=OF|title=Barry Bonds » Statistics » Batting {{!}} FanGraphs Baseball|website=www.fangraphs.com|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds many MLB hitting records, including most career [[home run]]s (762), most home runs in a single season (73, set in 2001) and most career walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bondsba01.shtml#all_leaderboard|title=Barry Bonds Stats {{!}} Baseball-Reference.com|website=Baseball-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonds was also known as a talented all-around baseball player. He won eight [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] awards for his defensive play in the outfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bondsba01.shtml|title = Barry Bonds; Appearances on Leader Boards, Awards, and Honors|date = |accessdate = November 25, 2014|website = Baseball-Reference.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stole 514 bases with his baserunning speed, becoming the first and only MLB player to date with at least 500 home runs and 500 [[stolen base]]s (no other player has even 400 of each).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/992458/Bonds-charters-500-500-club.html|title=Bonds charters 500-500 club|date=2003-06-25|website=DeseretNews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CespedesBBQ/status/1087789138949165056|title=My favorite Barry Bonds stat is still that he's the only member of the 400 homer/400 steal club and the only member of the 500 homer/500 steal club|last=BBQ|first=Cespedes Family|date=2019-01-22|website=@CespedesBBQ|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is ranked second in career [[Wins Above Replacement]] among all major league [[position player]]s by both [[Fangraphs]] and [[Baseball-Reference.com]], behind only [[Babe Ruth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2014&amp;month=0&amp;season1=1871&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;players=0|title = Batting Leaders; Career|date = |accessdate = November 22, 2014|website = Fangraphs.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/WAR_career.shtml|title = Career Leaders &amp; Records for Wins Above Replacement|date = |accessdate = November 22, 2014|website = baseball-reference.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Bonds led a controversial career, notably as a central figure in baseball's [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States|steroids scandal]]. In 2007, he was indicted on charges of [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] for allegedly lying to the grand jury during the federal government's investigation of [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]].

==Early life==
Bonds was born in [[Riverside, California]] to Patricia (née Howard) and former major leaguer [[Bobby Bonds]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BBEB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9384072/Barry-Bonds#759273.hook|accessdate=September 25, 2007|title=Barry Bonds|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up in [[San Carlos, California|San Carlos]] and attended [[Junípero Serra High School (San Mateo, California)|Junípero Serra High School]] in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], where he excelled in [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[American football|football]]. He played on the [[junior varsity team]] during his freshman year and the remainder of his high school career on the [[varsity team]]. He garnered a .467&amp;nbsp;[[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] his senior year, and was named prep [[All-America]]n.&lt;ref name=MLB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188|accessdate=September 8, 2007|year=2007|title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25|work=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants drafted Bonds in the second round of the [[1982 Major League Baseball draft|1982 MLB draft]] as a high school senior,&lt;ref name=br-stats&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bondsba01.shtml |title=Barry Bonds Statistics| work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=November 3, 2007|date=October 28, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030141637/http://www.baseball-reference.com/b/bondsba01.shtml|archivedate=October 30, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Giants and Bonds were unable to agree on contract terms when [[Tom Haller]]'s maximum offer was $70,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|70000|1982|r=0}}}} today) and Bonds’ minimum to go pro was $75,000, so Bonds instead decided to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/284885-the-san-francisco-giants-drafting-barry-bonds-in-1982 |title=The San Francisco Giants Drafting Barry Bonds In 1982 |last=Christensen |first=Arne |date=November 5, 2009 |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |access-date=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Bonds attended [[Arizona State University]], hitting .347 with 45&amp;nbsp;home runs and 175&amp;nbsp;[[runs batted in]] (RBI).&lt;ref name=MLB/&gt; In 1984 he batted .360 and had 30&amp;nbsp;[[stolen base]]s. In 1985, he hit 23&amp;nbsp;home runs with 66&amp;nbsp;RBIs and a .368&amp;nbsp;batting average. He was a [[Sporting News]] All-American selection that year. He tied the [[NCAA]] record with seven consecutive hits in the [[College World Series]] as sophomore and was named to All-Time College World Series Team in 1996.&lt;ref name=MLB/&gt;

Bonds was not well liked by his Sun Devil teammates, in part because in the words of longtime coach [[Jim Brock]], he was &quot;rude, inconsiderate and self-centered.&quot; For instance, when he was suspended for breaking curfew, the other players initially voted against his return even though he was easily the best player on the team.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite book |title=Tangled Webs: How False Statements are Undermining America: From Martha Stewart to Bernie Madoff |last=Stewart |first=James |authorlink=James B.

He graduated from Arizona State in 1986 with a degree in [[criminology]]. He was named ASU On Deck Circle Most Valuable Player; other winners include [[Dustin Pedroia]], [[Willie Bloomquist]], [[Paul Lo Duca]], and [[Ike Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-basebl/stories/052808aaa.html|title=#1 in College Sports|publisher=CSTV.com|date=May 27, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During college, he played part of one summer in the amateur [[Alaska Baseball League]] with the [[Alaska Goldpanners]].&lt;ref name=TAGoF/&gt;

====1993 season====
In 1993, Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative [[free agent]] contract worth a then-record $43.75 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|43.75|1993|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) over six years with the Giants, with whom his father had spent the first seven years of his career, and with whom his godfather [[Willie Mays]] played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of both total value and average annual salary.&lt;ref name=43million&gt;{{cite news |author=Chass, Murray |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/06/sports/baseball-giants-make-investment-43-million-in-bonds.html |title=Giants Make Investment: $43 Million in Bonds |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 6, 1992 |accessdate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once he signed with the Giants, Bonds had intended to wear 24, his number during most of his stay with the Pirates, and after receiving Mays's blessing the Giants were willing to unretire it until the public commotion from fans and media became too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-09-23/news/17263404_1_giants-uniform-willie-mays-number-performance-enhancing-drugs |title=Did Giants' special treatment of Bonds contribute to messy end?: Pampered slugger delivered, but there was a big downside |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |date=September 23, 2007 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author=Shea, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QIv7agRgVjEC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22bobby+bonds%22+%22number+25%22+barry |title=Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Antihero |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |publisher=HarperCollins |author=Pearlman, Jeff |isbn=978-0-06-079752-2|date=April 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25, as it had been Bobby's number in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/bondsba01.php |title=Barry Bonds |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |publisher=The Baseball Page |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510144452/http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/bondsba01.php |archivedate=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1996 season====
[[File:Barrybonds1.JPG|right|thumb|Bonds on the field]]
In 1996, Bonds became the first National League player and second (of the current list of four) major league player(s) to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/rare_feats/index.jsp?feature=40_40 |title=The 40–40 Club: (Recorded 40 HRs and 40 SBs in a single season) |work=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=September 11, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825094135/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/rare_feats/index.jsp?feature=40_40|archivedate=August 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other members of the [[40–40 club]] are [[José Canseco]]–1988, [[Alex Rodriguez]]–1998, and [[Alfonso Soriano]]–2006; his father Bobby Bonds was one home run short in 1973 when he hit 39 home runs and stole 43 bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/16/AR2006091600674.html|title=Soriano Reaches 40–40 Mark  |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |date=September 17, 2006 |author=Goff, Steven |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1997 season====
In 1997, Bonds hit .291, his lowest average since 1989. He hit 40 home runs for the second straight year and drove in 101 runs, leading the league in walks again with 145.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; He tied his father in 1997 for having the most 30/30 seasons, and he again placed fifth in the MVP balloting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1997.shtml#NLmvp|title=1997 National League Most Valuable Player Award |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409140334/http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1997.shtml|archivedate=April 9, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1998 season====
With two outs in the 9th inning of a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in baseball history to be given an [[intentional walk]] with the bases loaded. [[Nap Lajoie]] (1901), [[Del Bissonette]] (1928) and [[Bill Nicholson (baseball)|Bill Nicholson]] (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was [[Abner Dalrymple]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_wk3.shtml |title=Intentional bases on balls records |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |work=[[Baseball Almanac]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413105030/http://www.baseball-almanac.com/recbooks/rb_wk3.shtml |archivedate=April 13, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 23, Bonds hit his 400th career home run. By doing so, he became the first player ever to enter the 400–400 club by having career totals of 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases; he is still the only player to have achieved this feat. The milestone home run came off [[Kirt Ojala]], who, like Burkett, was pitching for the Marlins.&lt;ref name=1Bbrih&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/history/sf_history_timeline_article.jsp?article=35 |title=1996: Bonds bashes, runs into history |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |work=[[MLB.com]] |series=Giants timeline |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515213301/http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/history/sf_history_timeline_article.jsp?article=35 |archivedate=May 15, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the season, he hit .303 with 37 home runs and drove in 122 runs, winning his eighth Gold Glove,&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;  He finished 8th in the MVP voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1998.shtml#NLmvp|title=1998 National League Most Valuable Player Award |accessdate=April 16, 2008 |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414172557/http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1998.shtml |archivedate=April 14, 2008  |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1999 season====
[[File:BarryLamar Bonds.jpg|thumb|right|Bonds at the plate with the Giants]]
1999 marked a career low, up to that point, for Bonds in terms of playing time. Bonds started off the 1999 season hitting well by batting .366 in the month of April with 4 home runs and 12 RBIs in the Giants first 12 games of the season. But on April 18 he was placed on the 15-day disabled list for only the 2nd time in his career up to that point. Bonds had suffered a torn tendon in his bicep as well as bone spurs in his elbow, both of which required surgery and cost him the rest of April and all of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/21/sports/baseball-bonds-joins-the-long-list-of-stars-who-are-injured.html|title=BASEBALL; Bonds Joins the Long List Of Stars Who Are Injured|last=Chass|first=Murray|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/card/436/barry-bonds|title=Barry Bonds {{!}} Baseball Prospectus|last=Brady|first=Todd|work=Baseball Prospectus|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to action on June 9, Bonds struggled somewhat at the plate for the remainder of the 1999 season. A series of nagging injuries including elbow pain, knee inflammation and groin issues hampered his play. Only hitting .248 after his return from the disabled list, he still managed to slug 34 home runs, drive in 83 runs as well as hit for a .617 slugging percentage, despite missing nearly two full months with injuries and only playing in 102 games.

[[Bill James]] ranked Bonds as the best player of the 1990s. He added that the decade's second-best player, [[Craig Biggio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statisticianmagician.mlblogs.com/archives/2008/02/james_on_biggio.html |title=James on Biggio, Me on James |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |date=February 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415165349/http://statisticianmagician.mlblogs.com/archives/2008/02/james_on_biggio.html |archivedate=April 15, 2008  |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been closer in production to the decade's 10th-best player than to Bonds. In 1999, with statistics through 1997 being considered, Bonds ranked Number 34 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, making him the highest-ranking active player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |work=[[Baseball Almanac]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512031751/http://baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml |archivedate=May 12, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Sporting News list was redone in 2005, Bonds was ranked 6th behind Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, [[Ty Cobb]], [[Walter Johnson]], and [[Hank Aaron]]. Bonds was omitted from 1999's Major League Baseball All-Century Team, to which [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] was elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/limc100.shtml |title=All Century Team |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |work=[[Baseball Almanac]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513145608/http://baseball-almanac.com/legendary/limc100.shtml |archivedate=May 13, 2008  |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; James wrote of Bonds, &quot;Certainly the most unappreciated superstar of my lifetime. ... Griffey has always been more popular, but Bonds has been a far, far greater player.&quot; In 1999, he rated Bonds as the 16th-best player of all time. &quot;When people begin to take in all of his accomplishments&quot;, he predicted, &quot;Bonds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game.&quot;&lt;ref name=TNBJHBA-FBfaDI&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=2003 |author=James, Bill |isbn=0-7432-2722-0}} as cited at {{cite web|url=http://www.efqreview.com/NewFiles/v21n1/books-fivebooks.html |title=Five Books for a Deserted Island |author=Christensen, Chris |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |year=2006 |work=Elysian Fields Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000 season====
In 2000, the following year, Bonds hit .306 with career bests through that time in both slugging percentage (.688) and home runs (49) in just 143 games. He also drew a league-leading 117 walks.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

====2001 season====
The next year, Bonds's offensive production reached even higher levels, breaking not only his own personal records but several major league records. In the Giants' first 50 games in 2001, he hit 28 home runs, including 17 in May—a career high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/bondstracker/bondslog |title=Bonds career HR log |accessdate=September 25, 2007 |work=[[CBS Sports]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923104248/http://sportsline.com/mlb/bondstracker/bondslog |archivedate=September 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This early stretch included his 500th home run hit on April 17 against [[Terry Adams (baseball)|Terry Adams]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN200104170.shtml |title=Apr 17, 2001, Dodgers at Giants play by play and box score |date=April 17, 2001|accessdate=August 6, 2010|work=Baseball Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bh77haGge&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2001/10/05/bonds_71_ap/ |title=Bonds hits 71st, 72nd homers as Giants get eliminated |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=October 5, 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110000839/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2001/10/05/bonds_71_ap/ |archivedate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also hit 39 home runs by the All-star break (a major league record), drew a major league record 177 walks, and had a .515 on-base average, a feat not seen since Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams over forty years earlier.

On October 4, by homering off [[Wilfredo Rodríguez]] in the 159th game of the season, Bonds tied the previous record of 70 set by [[Mark McGwire]] – which McGwire set in the 162nd game in 1998.&lt;ref name=2HRT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/mlb/events/mlb_bonds_hr_info.jsp |title=2001 Home Run Tracker |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |publisher=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then hit numbers 71 and 72 the following night off [[Chan Ho Park]].

====2002 season====
Bonds re-signed with the Giants for a five-year, $90 million contract in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-49533870.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523071937/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-49533870.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 23, 2009 |title=Bonds agrees to dlrs 90 million, five-year contract with Giants |date=January 15, 2002 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit five home runs in the Giants' first four games of the season, tying [[Lou Brock]]'s 35-year record for most home runs after four games. He won the NL batting title with a career-high .370 average and struck out only 47 times.&lt;ref name=2002stats&gt;{{cite web |url=http://barrybonds.mlb.com/team/player_career.jsp?player_id=111188&amp;y=2002 |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |year=2007 |title=Player Profile: Barry Bonds 25 (2002) |work=[[MLB.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hit 46 home runs in 403 at-bats.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

Despite playing in nine fewer games than the previous season, he drew 198 walks, a major-league record; 68 of them were intentional walks, surpassing [[Willie McCovey]]'s 45 in 1969 for another Major League record. He slugged .799, then the fourth-highest total all time. Bonds broke Ted Williams' major league record for on-base average with .582. Bonds also hit his 600th home run, less than a year and a half after hitting his 500th.&lt;ref name=2002stats/&gt;  The home run came on August 9 at home against [[Kip Wells]] of the Pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=220809126 |title=Pittsburgh Pirates at San Francisco Giants (box score) |date=August 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=220809126 |title=Bonds' 600th blast not enough to beat Bucs |date=August 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2002 postseason====
Bonds batted .322 with 8 home runs, 16 RBI, and 27 walks in the postseason en route to the [[2002 World Series]], which the Giants lost 4–3 to the [[Anaheim Angels]].

====2003 season====
In 2003, Bonds played in just 130 games. He hit 45 home runs in just 390 at-bats, along with a .341 batting average. He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an on-base average well over .500 (.529) for the third straight year.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt; He also became the only member of the career 500 home run/500 stolen base club by stealing second base on June 23 off of pitcher [[Éric Gagné]] in the 11th inning of a tied ball game against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (against whom Bonds had tallied his 500th home run). Bonds scored the game-winning run later that inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=230623126|title=Bonds' big night steals win for Giants|accessdate=April 17, 2008|date=June 23, 2003|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004 season====
In 2004, Bonds had perhaps his best season. He hit .362 en route to his second National League batting title, and broke his own record by walking 232 times. He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average. Bonds passed Mays on the career home run list by hitting his 661st off of [[Ben Ford (baseball)|Ben Ford]] on April 13.&lt;ref name=BhssisoF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240413126|title=Bonds hits solo shot in seventh off Ford|date=April 13, 2004|accessdate=August 6, 2010|publisher=ESPN }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=240413126|title=Milwaukee Brewers at San Francisco Giants (box score)|date=April 13, 2004|accessdate=August 6, 2010|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then hit his 700th off of [[Jake Peavy]] on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=240917126|title=San Diego Padres at San Francisco Giants (box score)|date=September 17, 2004|accessdate=August 6, 2010|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240917126|title=Giants hold half-game lead on Cubs|date=September 17, 2004|accessdate=August 6, 2010|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season.

In addition, no other player from either league has been awarded the MVP four times in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=bonds_barry011003 |title=Bonds: The Unpopular Home Run Champ |accessdate=April 17, 2008 |date=August 8, 2007 |author=Carter, Bob |publisher=ESPN.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103080923/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=bonds_barry011003 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The MVP award was first given in 1931). The 40-year-old Bonds also broke [[Willie Stargell]]'s 25-year record as the oldest player to win a Most Valuable Player Award (Stargell, at 39 years, 8 months, was National League co-MVP with [[Keith Hernandez]] in 1979). On July 4, he tied and passed [[Rickey Henderson]]'s career bases on balls record with his 2190th and 2191st career walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240704126|accessdate=July 19, 2007|date=July 4, 2004|publisher=ESPN.com|title=Bradford, Mulder both walk slugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron was called on for his opinion of Bonds. He clarified that he was a fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/07/sports/sports-of-the-times-aaron-will-let-the-fans-judge-bonds.html|title=Sports of The Times; Aaron Will Let the Fans Judge Bonds|accessdate=May 27, 2008|date=April 7, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Anderson, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with [[Pete Rose]] could be emphasized less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1939208|title=HOF and asterisks not up to Aaron|accessdate=May 27, 2008|date=December 6, 2004|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2879440|title=If Bonds breaks HR record, Aaron 'won't be there'|accessdate=May 27, 2008|date=May 22, 2007|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-08-08-bonds-756_N.htm|title=Bonds blasts No. 756 to take over top spot|accessdate=May 27, 2008|date=August 7, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Nightengale, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005 season====
Bonds's salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]' [[Alex Rodriguez]] earned the highest, $25.2 million).&lt;ref name=BRSalaries&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_salaries.shtml|title=Highest Career Total and Single-Season Salaries|accessdate=September 29, 2007|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|date=September 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929153252/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_salaries.shtml|archivedate=September 29, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bonds endured a knee injury, multiple surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12 and started in left field. In his return against the [[San Diego Padres]], he nearly hit a home run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=250912126|title=Giant comeback: Bonds 1-for-4 in winning return|accessdate=April 17, 2008|date=September 12, 2005|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

====2006 season====
[[File:Barry Bonds3.jpg|thumb|Bonds batting against the Chicago Cubs in 2006]]
In 2006, Bonds earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $172 million during his then 21-year career, making him baseball's all-time highest paid player.&lt;ref name=BRSalaries/&gt; Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22. This 10-game stretch was his longest home run slump since the 1998 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260422127|title=Bonds goes opposite field for career No. 709|accessdate=April 17, 2008|date=April 22, 2006|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, Bonds drew within one home run of tying Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list, hitting his 713th career home run into the second level of [[Citizens Bank Park]] in [[Philadelphia]], off pitcher [[Jon Lieber]] in a game in which the Giants lost to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260507122|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=May 7, 2006|title=Amidst Bonds spectacle, Phillies win eighth straight|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The towering home run—one of the longest in Citizens Bank Park's two-season history, traveling an estimated 450&amp;nbsp;feet (140&amp;nbsp;m)—hit off the facade of the third deck in right field.

On May 20, Bonds tied Ruth, hitting his 714th career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the 2nd inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260520111|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=May 20, 2006|title=Bonds reels in Babe, blasts home run No. 714|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home run came off left-handed pitcher [[Brad Halsey]] of the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]], in an [[interleague play|interleague]] game played in [[Oakland, California]].

[[File:20060825 Barry Bonds follow through.jpg|thumb|Bonds in August 2006 with the Giants]]
On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' [[Chris Spurling]] with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds's home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, though Bonds went 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260922108|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=September 22, 2006|title=Bonds ties Aaron's NL HR mark, but Giants fall to Brewers|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record. Hit in Milwaukee like the previous one, this was a solo home run off [[Chris Capuano]] of the Brewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=260923108|accessdate=July 2, 2007|date=September 23, 2006|title=Bonds hits NL-record 734th HR, but Giants lose again|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest [[slugging percentage]] (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

In the season opener on April 3rd, all he had was a first-inning single past third base with the infield shifted right, immediately followed by a stolen base and then thrown out at home on a base-running mistake, followed by a deep fly-out to left field, late in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=270403126|title=San Diego 7, San Francisco 0 (recap)|accessdate=April 14, 2007|publisher=[[Yahoo!

On December 15, 2011, Bonds was sentenced to 30 days of house arrest, two years of probation and 250 hours of community service, for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in 2003.

==Public persona==
During his playing career, Bonds was frequently described as a difficult person, surly, standoffish and ungrateful. However, in one interview with [[Terence Moore]] in 2016, he acknowledged regret over the persona which he had created. He attributed it to a response to the pressure he felt to perform as a young player with the Pirates.

Bonds reports that for a short time during his playing days with the Giants he changed his demeanor at the behest of a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant attitude. Shortly thereafter, Bonds says, in the midst of a slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team to lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted. Bonds says he complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.&lt;ref name=moore060116/&gt;

==Controversies==
===BALCO scandal===
[[File:Barry bonds mug shot 1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Mug shot taken after 2007 indictment]]
Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative ([[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative|BALCO]]) scandal. BALCO marketed [[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (&quot;the Clear&quot;), a  performance-enhancing [[anabolic steroid]] that was undetectable by doping tests.  He was under investigation by a federal [[grand jury]] regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] charges on November 15, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/fc/Sports/drugs_in_sports/news_stories/SIG=11b7p0t2o;_ylt=AmPRI2CkVWIaebTtBSsNRcEjKPIA/*http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/16/MNQ1TDKSG.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |title=Barry Bonds indicted |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721090718/http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/fc/Sports/drugs_in_sports/news_stories/SIG%3D11b7p0t2o%3B_ylt%3DAmPRI2CkVWIaebTtBSsNRcEjKPIA/%2Ahttp%3A//www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F11%2F16%2FMNQ1TDKSG.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment alleges that Bonds lied while under oath about his alleged use of steroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdn.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2007/11/16/barrybondsindictment.pdf |title=Barry Bonds indictment |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117084656/http://cdn.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2007/11/16/barrybondsindictment.pdf |archivedate=November 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Bonds first became embroiled in a scandal when [[Greg Anderson (trainer)|Greg Anderson]] of the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative]] (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] and charged with supplying anabolic steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594|title=Bonds testified that substances didn't work|accessdate=February 20, 2008|date=December 4, 2004|publisher=ESPN.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120163542/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594|archivedate=January 20, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003,&lt;ref name=BlEg2yip/&gt; Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/12/03/MNGGFA0UDU65.DTL |title=What Bonds told BALCO grand jury |date=December 3, 2004 |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |authors=Williams, Lance, Mark Fainaru-Wada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118085803/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F12%2F03%2FMNGGFA0UDU65.DTL |archivedate=November 18, 2007 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This testimony, as reported by [[Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada]], has frequently been misrepresented. Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using &quot;[[the cream]]&quot; and &quot;[[Tetrahydrogestrinone|the clear]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bttsdw/&gt;

In July 2005, all four defendants in the BALCO steroid scandal trial, including Anderson, struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/16/MNG7PDP6HA1.DTL|title=40 of 42 BALCO charges dropped – Steroid lab owner, Bonds' trainer guilty in plea deal|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=July 16, 2005|accessdate=February 20, 2008|author1=Fainaru-Wada, Mark  |author2=Lance Williams |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perjury case====
{{main|Barry Bonds perjury case}}
On November 15, 2007, Bonds was indicted on four counts of [[perjury]] and one count of [[obstruction of justice]] as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm|title=Baseball star Barry Bonds charged|work=BBC News|date=November 16, 2007|accessdate=February 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226225527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7097583.stm|archivedate=February 26, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 2008, a [[typo]] in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run. The reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3246675&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines|title=U.S. filing typo spurs erroneous Bonds drug report|publisher=ESPN.com|date=February 15, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218131536/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3246675&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines|archivedate=February 18, 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typo sparked a brief media frenzy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330742,00.html|title=Court Document Typo Spurs Erroneous Bonds Drug Allegation|work=[[Fox News]]|date=February 15, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201112725/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,330742,00.html|archive-date=February 1, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Players' Union===
Bonds withdrew from the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]]'s (MLBPA) [[license|licensing]] agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him. Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1661883|title=Bonds will be individually licensed|accessdate=February 20, 2008|publisher=ESPN.com|date=November 17, 2003|author=Rovell, Darren}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds. For this reason he does not appear in some baseball [[video games]], forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him. For example, Bonds is replaced by &quot;[[Jon Dowd]]&quot; in ''[[MVP Baseball 2005]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/sportsbusiness/news/story?id=1777084|title=Bonds flexes his muscles|accessdate=September 11, 2010|publisher=ESPN.com|author=Rovell, Darren|date=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Unable to find refs &quot;Wes Mailman&quot; in ''[[All-Star Baseball 2005]]'', &quot;Joe Young&quot; in [[MLB 2K7]], Backyard Baseball 2007 and &quot;Dean Gibeau&quot; in ''All-Star Baseball 2006 ''and &quot;Reggie Stocker&quot; in ''[[MLB 07: The Show]]''.

In May 2006, former ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Jeff Pearlman]] released a revealing biography of Bonds entitled ''Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti-Hero.''

An avid [[cyclist]], Bonds chose the activity to be a primary means of keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career.

Besides holding Major League career records in home runs (762), walks (2,558), and intentional walks (688), at the time of his retirement, Bonds also led all active players in RBI (1,996), [[on-base percentage]] (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and [[total bases]] (5,976). He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in [[strikeout]]s (1,539), through September 26, 2007.&lt;ref name=br-stats/&gt;

Bonds is the lone member of the 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen at least 500 bases (514); no other player has even 400 of both. He is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are [[José Canseco]], [[Alex Rodriguez]], and [[Alfonso Soriano]].

* 5-time SF Giants Player of the Year (1998, 2001–04)
* 3-Time NL Hank Aaron Award winner (2001–02, 2004)
* Listed at #6 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''{{'}} list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranked active player, in 2005.
* Named a finalist to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] in 1999, but not elected to the team in the fan balloting.
* Rating of 352 on Baseball-Reference.com's Hall of Fame monitor (100 is a good HOF candidate);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/hof_monitor.shtml|title=Hall of Fame Monitor Leaders |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|date=October 28, 2007|accessdate=November 16, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111073343/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/hof_monitor.shtml|archivedate=November 11, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9th among all hitters, highest among hitters not in HOF yet.
* Only the second player to twice have a single-season slugging percentage over .800, with his record .863 in 2001 and .812 in 2004. Babe Ruth was the other, with .847 in 1920 and .846 in 1921.
* Became the first player in history with more times on base (376) than official at-bats (373) in 2004. This was due to the record number of walks, which count as a time on base and as a plate appearance, but not an at-bat. He had 135 hits, 232 walks, and 9 hit-by-pitches for the 376 number.
* With his father [[Bobby Bonds|Bobby]] (332, 461), leads all father-son combinations in combined home runs (1,094) and stolen bases (975), respectively through September 26, 2007.
* Played minor league baseball in both Alaska and Hawaii. In 1983, he played for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks in the Alaska Baseball League,&lt;ref name=TAGoF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldpanners.com/Scrapbook/b/bonds-barry_83.htm|title=The Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks|publisher=goldpanners.com|year=2007|accessdate=January 31, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221042335/http://www.goldpanners.com/Scrapbook/b/bonds-barry_83.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1986, he played for the Hawaii Islanders in the Pacific Coast League.
