The '''Buffalo Bills''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in the [[Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area]]. &lt;!-- the Bills are based at New Era Field, located at 1 Bills Drive, Orchard Park, New York 14127. --&gt; The Bills compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The team plays their home games at [[New Era Field]] in [[Orchard Park (town), New York|Orchard Park, New York]]. The Bills are the only NFL team that plays its home games in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] play at [[MetLife Stadium]], located in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills conduct summer training camp at [[St. John Fisher College]] in [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford, New York]], an eastern suburb of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training Camp|url=https://www.buffalobills.com/training-camp/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BuffaloBills.com|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bills began play as an original franchise of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in [[1960 American Football League season|1960]]. The club joined the NFL as a result of the [[AFL–NFL merger]] for the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]]. The 1964 and 1965 Bills were the only teams representing Buffalo that won major league professional sports championships (&quot;back-to-back&quot; American Football League Championships). The Bills are the only team to win four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|conference championships]] and are the only NFL team to lose four consecutive [[Super Bowl]] games. The team was owned by [[Ralph Wilson]] from the team's founding in 1960, until his death in 2014 at the age of 95. After his death, Wilson's estate reached an agreement to sell the team to [[Terrence Pegula|Terry]] and [[Kim Pegula]], which was approved by the other NFL team owners on October 8, 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;SesslerBills&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Bills sale to Terry, Kim Pegula unanimously approved|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000407445/article/bills-sale-to-terry-kim-pegula-unanimously-approved|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=October 8, 2014|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills formerly possessed the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|longest active playoff drought]] in any of the four major professional sports in North America: they did not qualify to play in the [[National Football League playoffs|NFL playoffs]] from 1999 until 2017 and were the last NFL team (and last team in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American professional sports leagues]] overall) to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|title=Bills clinch first playoff spot since '99 with Ravens loss|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000901257/article/bills-clinch-first-playoff-spot-since-99-with-ravens-loss|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=December 31, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Bills End Their Playoff Drought, and Tears Flow|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/sports/football/buffalo-bills-playoffs.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 31, 2017|accessdate=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Bills have reached the playoffs in two of the past three NFL seasons and also clinched their first 10-win season in two decades in December 2019.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Buffalo Bills|List of Buffalo Bills seasons}}
The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the [[American Football League]] led by head coach [[Buster Ramsey]] and joined the NFL as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/stats/franchises.aspx |title=History: History of NFL franchises, 1920–present |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame |date=February 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in [[1964 American Football League Championship Game|1964]] and [[1965 American Football League Championship Game|1965]] with quarterback [[Jack Kemp]] and coach [[Lou Saban]], but the club has yet to win a league championship since.

Once the [[AFL–NFL merger]] took effect, the Bills became the second NFL team to represent the city; they followed the [[Buffalo All-Americans]], a charter member of the league. Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the [[Buffalo Indians|Indians/Tigers]] of the early 1940s and [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|an earlier team named the Bills]], originally the Bisons, in the late 1940s in the [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC).

Following the AFL–NFL merger, the Bills were generally mediocre in the 1970s, but featured All-Pro running back [[O. J. Simpson]]. After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the [[United States Football League]] and a series of highly drafted players such as [[Jim Kelly]] (who initially played for the USFL instead of the Bills), [[Thurman Thomas]], and [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]] allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championships]]; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent [[Super Bowl]]s, records in both categories that still stand.

The rise of the division rival [[New England Patriots]] under [[Tom Brady]], along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, prevented the Bills from reaching the playoffs in seventeen consecutive seasons between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year drought that was the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports at the time. It was broken when the Bills secured a wild-card berth on December 31, 2017. On October 8, 2014, [[Buffalo Sabres]] owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners' meetings, becoming the second ownership group of the team after team founder [[Ralph Wilson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SesslerBills&quot; /&gt;

===Name origins===
In 1947 a contest was held to rename the AAFC Bisons, which was owned by James Breuil of the [[Frontier Oil Company]]. The winning entry suggested &quot;Bills&quot;, reflecting on the famous western frontiersman, [[Buffalo Bill Cody]]. Carrying the &quot;frontier&quot; theme further, the winning contestant offered the team was being supported by Frontier Oil and was &quot;opening a new frontier in sports in Western New York.&quot; When Buffalo joined the new American Football League in 1960, the name of the city's earlier pro football entry was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/nicknames.aspx#sthash.fZkeALva.dpuf|title=Franchise nicknames - Pro Football Hall of Fame Official Site|website=www.profootballhof.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos and uniforms==
[[File:Buffalo Bills classic logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|Bills logo, 1962–1973]]

The Bills' uniforms in its first two seasons were based on those of the [[Detroit Lions]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillsUniformChanges&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gwarnerbuffnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Warner|first=Gene|title=Bills logo was artist's crowning achievement|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130408/CITYANDREGION/130409304/1082|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=April 8, 2013|accessdate=January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's original colors were Honolulu blue, silver and white, and the helmets were silver with no striping. There was no logo on the helmet, which displayed the players' numbers on each side.

In [[1962 Buffalo Bills season|1962]], the standing red bison was designated as the logo and took its place on a white helmet.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillsUniformChanges&quot; /&gt; In 1962, the team's colors also changed to red, white, and blue. The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white shoulder stripes similar to those worn by the Buffalo Bisons AHL hockey team of the same era. The helmets were white with a red center stripe.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillsUniformChanges&quot; /&gt; The jerseys again saw a change in [[1964 Buffalo Bills season|1964]] when the shoulder stripes were replaced by a distinctive stripe pattern on the sleeves consisting of four stripes, two thicker inner stripes and two thinner outer stripes all bordered by red piping. By [[1965 Buffalo Bills season|1965]], red and blue center stripes were put on the helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFLdecals.htm|title=Original AFL Decals|website=www.remembertheafl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bills introduced blue pants worn with the white jerseys in [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|1973]], the last year of the standing buffalo helmet. The blue pants remained through [[1985 Buffalo Bills season|1985]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/bills.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011202040/http://www.gridiron-uniforms.com/bills.html |archivedate=October 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The face mask on the helmet was blue from [[1974 Buffalo Bills season|1974]] through [[1986 Buffalo Bills season|1986]] before changing to white.

The standing bison logo was replaced by a blue charging one with a red slanting stripe streaming from its horn. The newer emblem, which is still the primary one used by the franchise, was designed by aerospace designer Stevens Wright in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Dallas|title=April 5 in Bills history: Charging Buffalo introduced as Bills logo|url=https://www.buffalobills.com/news/april-5-in-bills-history-charging-buffalo-introduced-as-bills-logo-15104242|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BuffaloBills.com|date=April 5, 2015|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lukas|first=Paul|title=Uni Watch: NFL archival treasures|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9682706/uni-watch-remembering-stevens-wright-created-buffalo-bills-logo-much-more|publisher=ESPN|date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1984 Buffalo Bills season|1984]], the helmet's shell color was changed from white to red, primarily to help Bills quarterback [[Joe Ferguson]] distinguish them more readily from three of their division rivals at that time, the [[Baltimore Colts]], the [[Miami Dolphins]], and the [[New England Patriots]], who all also wore white helmets at that point. Ferguson said &quot;Everyone we played had white helmets at that time. Our new head coach Kay Stephenson just wanted to get more of a contrast on the field that may help spot a receiver down the field.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Chris|title=Untold uniform stories: Fergie behind helmet color change|url=https://www.buffalobills.com/news/untold-uniform-stories-fergie-behind-helmet-color-change-5122371|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BuffaloBills.com|date=June 23, 2011|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Patriots have worn silver helmets since 1993, the Colts have since been realigned to the [[AFC South]], and the [[New York Jets]] have since switched back to green-colored helmets after 20 years with white ones in [[2019 NFL season|2019]].)

In [[2002 Buffalo Bills season|2002]], under the direction of general manager [[Tom Donahoe]], the Bills' uniforms went through radical changes. A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized &quot;B&quot; consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974—a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball—remained unchanged.

In [[2005 Buffalo Bills season|2005]], the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.

The Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms. They stopped wearing blue-on-white after [[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]], while the white-on-blue was not worn after [[2007 Buffalo Bills season|2007]].

For the [[2011 Buffalo Bills season|2011 season]], the Bills unveiled a new uniform design, an updated rendition of the 1975–83 design. This change includes a return to the white helmets with &quot;charging buffalo&quot; logo, and a return to [[royal blue]] instead of [[Navy blue|navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BillsCharge&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion forward: Bills unveil brand-new uniforms for 2011|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82078eab/article/fashion-forward-bills-unveil-brandnew-uniforms-for-2011|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffalo sporadically wore white at home in the 1980s, but stopped doing so before their Super Bowl years. On November 6, 2011, against the New York Jets, the Bills wore white at home for the first time since [[1986 Buffalo Bills season|1986]]. Since 2011, the Bills have worn white for a home game either with their primary uniform or a throwback set.

The Bills' uniform received minor alterations as part of the league's new uniform contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. The new Nike uniform was unveiled on April 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Chris|title=Nike unveils new NFL uniforms|url=https://www.buffalobills.com/news/nike-unveils-new-nfl-uniforms-7131790|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=BuffaloBills.com|date=April 3, 2012|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2015, the Bills and the New York Jets became the first two teams to participate in the NFL's [[NFL Color Rush|Color Rush]] uniform initiative, with Buffalo wearing an all-red combination for the first time in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Jets and Bills unveil 'Color Rush' unis Thursday|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000574519/article/jets-and-bills-unveil-color-rush-unis-thursday|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=November 6, 2015|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable use of the Bills' uniforms outside of football was in the [[2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], when the [[United States men's national junior ice hockey team]] wore Bills-inspired uniforms in their [[list of outdoor ice hockey games|outdoor game]] against [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Team Canada]] on December 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/06/14/usa-hockey-unveils-special-jersey-world-juniors-outdoor-game-buffalo/|title=USA Hockey unveils Bills-themed jersey for world junior outdoor game in Buffalo|date=June 14, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==
The Bills have rivalries with their three [[AFC East]] opponents, and also have had occasional or historical rivalries with other teams such as the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts]] (a former divisional rival), [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Dallas Cowboys]].&lt;ref name=whoisarival&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=compare_multiple_choice&amp;cid=stnbvll7tbrir&amp;qid=93326&amp;uid=|title=2017 Buffalo Bills Rivalry Survey|website=www.allcounted.com}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also play an annual preseason game against the [[Detroit Lions]].

===Divisional rivalries===
====Miami Dolphins====
{{main|Bills–Dolphins rivalry}}

This is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry. Though the Bills and [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] both originated in the [[American Football League]], the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills were one of the original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent (the Bills defeated the Dolphins in their first matchup of the 1980s). Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of [[Jim Kelly]] as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback [[Dan Marino]] shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the New England Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival,&lt;ref name = &quot;2017primaryrivalpoll&quot;/&gt; and the two teams have typically been close to each other in win-loss records. Miami leads the overall series 61–48–1 as of 2018, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 3–1, including a win in the [[1992–93 NFL playoffs|1992 AFC Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=17%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. Miami Dolphins Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New England Patriots====
{{main|Bills–Patriots rivalry}}

The rivalry with the [[New England Patriots]] first started when both teams were original franchises in the [[American Football League]] prior to the NFL-AFL merger. After the rise of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and quarterback [[Tom Brady]] in New England, the Patriots have dominated the AFC East, including the Bills. The Bills-Patriots rivalry in particular has become lopsided as the Patriots are 31–5 against the Bills since Belichick became head coach in 2000. This has led many fans and players in the 2000s and beyond to replace the Dolphins with the Patriots as Buffalo's most hated rival.&lt;ref name = &quot;2017primaryrivalpoll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=summary&amp;cid=stnbvll7tbrir&amp;uid=|title=2017 Buffalo Bills Rivalry Survey|website=www.allcounted.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://247sports.com/nfl/buffalo-bills/Article/New-England-Patriots-named-as-Bills-biggest-rival-74981320|title = Patriots named as Bills biggest rival|website = 247Sports.com|date = July 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Patriots lead the series 74–43–1 as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=19%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry is also notable as numerous players, including [[Drew Bledsoe]], [[Doug Flutie]], [[Lawyer Milloy]], [[Brandon Spikes]], [[Scott Chandler (American football)|Scott Chandler]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], [[Mike Gillislee]] and [[Stephon Gilmore]] have played for both teams at some point in their careers.

====New York Jets====
{{main|Bills–Jets rivalry}}

The Bills and [[New York Jets|Jets]] were both original AFL teams, and both represent the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], though the Jets (since 1984) actually play their games in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. While the rivalry represents the differences between [[New York City]] and [[Western New York]], it is not as intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases either have grudging respect or low-key annoyance for each other when the teams are not playing one another. Oftentimes the Bills-Jets rivalry has become characterized by ugly games and shared mediocrity, but it has had a handful of competitive moments. The series heated up recently when former Jets head coach [[Rex Ryan]] became the Bills' head coach for two seasons, and has become notable again as Bills quarterback [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] and Jets quarterback [[Sam Darnold]], both drafted in the same year, maintain a friendly rivalry with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/blog/buffalo-bills/post/_/id/33411/bills-josh-allen-and-jets-sam-darnold-close-friends-division-rivals |title=Bills' Josh Allen, Jets' Sam Darnold: Friendship before rivalry |last=Louis-Jacques |first=Marcell |date=2019-09-07 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |access-date=2020-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo leads the series 62–55 as of 2018, including a playoff win in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=22%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other rivalries===

====Tennessee Titans====
{{See also|The Comeback (American football)|Music City Miracle}}
The [[Tennessee Titans]] (formerly the [[Houston Oilers]]) share an extended history with the Bills, both teams being original AFL clubs in 1960 and rivals in that league's East Division before the AFL-NFL merger. Matchups were intense in the 1990s with quarterback [[Warren Moon]] leading the Oilers against Jim Kelly's Bills.&lt;ref name = &quot;da Comeback&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.buffalorumblings.com/2011/12/4/2609508/buffalo-bills-tennessee-titans-houston-oilers-comeback|title = Bills vs. Titans Classic: The Comeback|work = Buffalo Rumblings|publisher = SB Nation|first = Matt|last = Warren|date = December 4, 2011|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorable playoff moments between the teams include [[The Comeback (American football)|The Comeback]], in which the [[Frank Reich]]-led Bills overcame a 35–3 deficit to stun the Oilers 41–38 in 1992,&lt;ref name = &quot;da Comeback&quot;/&gt; and the [[Music City Miracle]], in which the now-Titans scored on a near-last-minute kickoff return with a controversial [[lateral pass]] to stun the Bills 22–16 in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.espn.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/page/blitz150101/still-not-buying-music-city-miracle-adam-schefter-blitz|title = Still not buying Music City Miracle|first = Adam|last = Schefter|publisher = ESPN.com|date = January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Music City Miracle was notable for being Buffalo's last playoff appearance until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wralsportsfan.com/wycheck-on-bills-bandwagon-18-years-after-music-city-miracle/17233538/|title = Wycheck on Bills bandwagon 18 years after Music City Miracle|date = January 4, 2018|first = John|last = Wawrow|work = The Associated Press|publisher = WRALSportsFan.com}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Titans currently lead the series 28–19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=31|title = Buffalo Bills vs. Tennessee Titans Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleveland Browns====
Though the Bills and [[Cleveland Browns]] are in different divisions and did not start playing each other until after 1972, match-ups between the two teams occasionally get heated up due to the proximity and similarity between the cities of Buffalo and Cleveland, though the teams' fanbases otherwise share a mutual respect. As with the Bills–Jets rivalry, the Bills and Browns often share bad luck and have seen their share of ugly games, including a 6–3 Browns win in which the winning quarterback only completed 2 of 17 passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/browns-win-ugly-beat-buffalo-6-3/|title = Browns Win Ugly, Beat Buffalo 6-3|date = October 11, 2009|publisher = CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been other occasions when both teams have been competitive such as in the 1980s and most recently in 2007 and 2014.&lt;ref name = billsbrownshist/&gt; The rivalry also gained heat when former Bills safety [[Donte Whitner]] was with the Browns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.footballinsiders.com/twitter-oils-rust-belt-rivalry-between-bills-browns/|title = Twitter oils Rust Belt rivalry between Bills, Browns|publisher = Football Insiders|date = November 26, 2014|access-date = July 12, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170804013305/http://www.footballinsiders.com/twitter-oils-rust-belt-rivalry-between-bills-browns/|archive-date = August 4, 2017|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Browns currently lead the series 13–9, including a playoff win in 1990, though the Bills have outscored the Browns in the series.&lt;ref name = &quot;Browns history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/cleveland-browns/teamvsteam?opp=4%7CCleveland|title=Cleveland Browns vs. Buffalo Bills Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns shared a rivalry with the Bills' [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|predecessors]] in the [[All-America Football Conference]], playing them twice in the AAFC playoffs before becoming one of three AAFC teams to join the NFL. The Bills were not selected to join the NFL and folded with the rest of the AAFC, leaving Buffalo without professional football until the current Bills were formed in 1959.&lt;ref name = billsbrownshist&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/11/cleveland_browns_vs_buffalo_bi_8.html|title = Cleveland Browns vs. Buffalo Bills series has seen it all: A championship, a fired coach and blizzard|first = Tim|last = Warsinskey|work = [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher = cleveland.com|date = November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other AFC rivals====
The Bills and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] were also original teams in the AFL and have had a long history against each other, despite never being in the same division. This rivalry heated up recently as the Bills and Chiefs met in consecutive years from 2008 to 2015, and again in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bills vs. Chiefs 2014: seventh straight year of Buffalo-Kansas City matchup|first = Brian|last = Galliford|work = Buffalo Rumblings|publisher = SB Nation|date = November 3, 2014|url = https://www.buffalorumblings.com/bills-news-notes/2014/11/3/7149531/bills-vs-chiefs-2014-series-history-ryan-fitzpatrick-matt-cassel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams have played three playoff games against each other, including the AFL Championship game that determined the AFL's (later AFC) representative in [[Super Bowl I|the first Super Bowl]], with Kansas City winning and going on to face the [[Green Bay Packers]] in the Super Bowl. However, Buffalo defeated Kansas City in the 1993 AFC championship game to advance to its fourth straight Super Bowl appearance. Buffalo currently leads the series 26-21-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=16%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. Kansas City Chiefs Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, bitterness has emerged between the Bills and the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], who had handed Buffalo its first playoff loss in [[New Era Field]] in 1996. Both teams occupy two of the smallest media markets in the NFL. After years of concurrent bottom feeding in the late 2000s and early 2010s, this rivalry has emerged after former Bills head coach [[Doug Marrone]], who had quit on the team after the 2014 season, was hired as a coaching assistant for Jacksonville and rose to become the Jaguars' head coach. Since then, the series has featured a Bills loss to the Jaguars in [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/sports/football/nfl/bills/2015/10/26/manuel-implosion-kills-bills-london/74579740/ |title=Manuel implosion kills Bills in London |last=Maiorana |first=Sal |date=October 26, 2015 |website=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle |language=en |access-date=April 5, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; an ugly, low-scoring playoff game in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaguars break defensive stalemate, push past Bills for wild-card win|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/jaguars/2018/01/07/jacksonville-jaguars-buffalo-bills-afc-wild-card-playoffs/1011405001/|date=January 7, 2018|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; trash talk from Jaguars players such as [[Jalen Ramsey]] and a brawl between the teams in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/reaction-bills-fans-let-jalen-ramsey-hear-for-calling-josh-allen-e2-80-9ctrash-e2-80-9d/ar-BBQ5MiX | title=Reaction: Bills fans let Jalen Ramsey hear for calling Josh Allen &quot;trash&quot; | publisher=USA Today Sports | work=Bills Wire | accessdate=November 25, 2018 | author=Kowalski, Rich | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406125357/https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/reaction-bills-fans-let-jalen-ramsey-hear-for-calling-josh-allen-e2-80-9ctrash-e2-80-9d/ar-BBQ5MiX | archive-date=April 6, 2019 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/brawl-after-td-costs-jaguars-seven-points-vs-bills-leads-to-leonard-fournette-ejection/ | title=Brawl after TD costs Jaguars seven points vs. Bills, leads to Leonard Fournette ejection | publisher=CBS Sports | accessdate=November 25, 2018 | author=Brinson, Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retired numbers===
The Buffalo Bills have retired three numbers in franchise history: No. 12 for [[Jim Kelly]], No. 34 for [[Thurman Thomas]] and No. 78 for [[Bruce Smith (defensive end)|Bruce Smith]]. Despite the fact that the Bills have only retired three jersey numbers in franchise history, the team has other numbers no longer issued to any player or in reduced circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;reduced&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BillsRetireSmithJersey&quot; /&gt;

Since the earliest days of the team, the number 31 was not supposed to be issued to any other player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back [[Preston Ridlehuber]] damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice [[James Williams (defensive back)|James (J.D.) Williams]] wore it for his first two seasons; it has since been returned to general circulation, with safety [[Dean Marlowe]] wearing the number in 2019.

Number 32 had been withdrawn from circulation, but not retired, after [[O. J. Simpson]]. Former owner [[Ralph Wilson]] insisted on not reissuing the number, even after Simpson's [[O. J. Simpson murder case|highly publicized murder case]] and later [[O. J. Simpson robbery case|robbery conviction]]. The number was placed back into circulation in 2019 with [[Senorise Perry]] wearing the number that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/05/21/buffalo-bills-oj-simpson-jersey-senorise-perry |title=Bills allow Senorise Perry to wear Simpson's No. 32 |last=Axson |first=Scooby |date=2019-05-21 |website=SI.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Number 15 was historically only issued sparingly after the retirement of [[Jack Kemp]],&lt;ref name=&quot;reduced&quot; /&gt; but was later returned to general circulation. Receiver [[John Brown (wide receiver)|John Brown]] wears the number as of 2019.

Number 1 has also only rarely been used, for reasons never explained. Kicker [[Mike Hollis]], who played one season for the Bills in 2002, was the most recent to wear the number in the regular season; it went 17 years without being reissued before [[David Sills V|David Sills]] was assigned it during the 2019 preseason.

The [[Buffalo Bills Radio Network]] is flagshipped at [[WGR]], AM 550 in Buffalo, owned by [[Entercom]]. [[John Murphy (announcer)|John Murphy]] is the team's current [[Sports commentary|play-by-play]] announcer; he was a [[color commentator]] alongside, and eventually succeeded, longtime voice [[Van Miller]] after Miller's retirement at the end of the [[2003 NFL season]]. [[Mark Kelso]] serves as the color analyst. The Bills radio network has approximately seventeen affiliates in [[upstate New York]] and one affiliate, [[CJCL]] 590AM (The Fan) in [[Toronto]]. As of early 2012, it is composed mostly of [[WGR]], Entercom's sister stations [[WCMF]] (96.5 FM) and [[WROC-AM]] 950 in Rochester, and a fleet of independent AM and FM stations across upstate New York from Jamestown east to Albany. Previous flagship [[Citadel Broadcasting]] was purchased by [[Cumulus Media]], who in turn ceased carrying Bills games at the end of the 2011 season, leaving the network without affiliates in Syracuse, Binghamton, and Erie. (The Syracuse affiliations were later picked up by [[Galaxy Communications]].)

During the preseason, most games are televised on Buffalo's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[WKBW-TV]] channel 7. In 2018, the team signed an agreement with [[Nexstar Media Group]] to carry Bills games across its network of stations in the region, which includes [[WJET-TV]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[WROC-TV]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[WSYR-TV]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[WUTR]] in [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[WETM-TV]] in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]] and [[WIVT]] in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]. Following the expiration of its contract with WKBW in 2019, the flagship station will become [[WIVB-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://buffalonews.com/2018/08/02/fred-jackson-to-join-bills-post-game-show-catalana-replaced-on-sidelines|title=Fred Jackson to join Bills postgame show; Catalana replaced on sidelines|date=August 2, 2018|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS analyst and former Bills special teams player [[Steve Tasker]] does color commentary on these games; the play-by-play position is rotated between his CBS partner [[Andrew Catalon]] and [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]]. WROC-TV reporter Thad Brown is the sideline reporter. Since 2008, preseason games have been broadcast in [[High-definition television|high definition]].

Beginning in the 2016 season, as per a new rights deal which covers rights to the team as well as its sister [[National Hockey League|NHL]] franchise, the [[Buffalo Sabres]], most team-related programming, including studio programming and the coach's show, was re-located to [[MSG Western New York]]—a joint venture of MSG and the team ownership. Preseason games will continue to air in simulcast on WKBW.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn-msgwny&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Pergament|first=Alan|title=Wide-ranging deal will keep Sabres – and other Pegula Sports &amp; Entertainment content – on MSG|url=http://sabres.buffalonews.com/2016/06/20/wide-ranging-deal-will-keep-sabres-and-other-pegula-sports-entertainment-content-on-msg/|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=June 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622213419/http://sabres.buffalonews.com/2016/06/20/wide-ranging-deal-will-keep-sabres-and-other-pegula-sports-entertainment-content-on-msg/#|archive-date=June 22, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event regular season games are broadcast by [[ESPN]], in accordance with the league's television policies, a local Buffalo station simulcasts the game. From 2014 to 2017, WKBW-TV held the broadcast rights to that contest, with the station having won back the rights to cable games after [[WBBZ-TV]] held the rights for 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pergament|first=Alan|title=Whither the weather coverage in Western New York?|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/columns/alan-pergament/whither-the-weather-coverage-in-western-new-york-20150809|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=August 9, 2015|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mascots, cheerleaders and marching band==
The Bills' official mascot is [[Billy Buffalo]], an eight-foot tall, anthropomorphic blue [[American bison]] who wears the jersey &quot;number&quot; BB.

The Bills currently do not have [[National Football League cheerleading|cheerleaders]]. The Bills operated a cheerleading squad named the [[Buffalo Jills]] from 1967 to 1985; from 1986 to 2013, the Jills operated as an independent organization sponsored by various companies, most recently by [[Citadel Broadcasting]]. The Jills suspended operations prior to the 2014 season due to legal actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/buffalo-bills-cheerleaders-halt-season-after-suit|title=Associated Press News|website=bigstory.ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills and Jills are currently involved in a legal battle, in which the Jills allege they were employees, not independent contractors, and are seeking back pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/05/19/judge-decides-jills-lawsuit-employees-not-independent-contractors/|newspaper=[[Buffalo News]]|last=Davis|first=Henry|title=Judge Decides Jills Lawsuit Employees Not Independent Contractors|date=May 19, 2017|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating matters is that Citadel's buyer, [[Cumulus Media]], declared bankruptcy and sought to discharge its remaining Bills-related debts in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/122518/cumulus-seeks-cancel-wlup-wkqx-lma-chicago-pbp-deals/ “Cumulus Seeks To Cancel WLUP/WKQX LMA Purchase; And Chicago PBP Deals”] from Radio Insight (January 19, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bills are one of six teams in the NFL to designate an official marching band or drumline (the others being the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Washington Redskins]], [[New York Jets]], [[Carolina Panthers]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]]). Since the last game of the 2013 season, this position has been served by the Stampede Drumline, known outside of Buffalo as Downbeat Percussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwiatkowski-Radlich|first=Jane|title=With no Jills to lead cheers, the job of drumming up fan excitement falls to the Stampede|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/with-no-jills-to-lead-cheers-the-job-of-drumming-up-fan-excitement-falls-to-the-stampede-20140912|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=September 13, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/buffalo-bills/index.ssf/2015/09/buffalo_bills_drumline_led_by_jordan_elbridge_family_friends_video.html Buffalo Bills drumline led by Jordan Elbridge, family, friends]. ''Syracuse.com''. Retrieved October 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bills have also used the full marching bands from Attica High School, the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Syracuse University]] at home games in recent years.

The Bills have several theme songs associated with them. One is a variation of the Isley Brothers hit &quot;[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]&quot;, recorded by Scott Kemper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Shei|first=Tim|title=He makes you want to 'Shout!': Meet singer of famous Bills jingle|url=http://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/09/12/he-makes-you-want-to-shout-meet-singer-of-famous-bills-jingle/|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=September 13, 2015|accessdate=July 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309083315/http://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/09/12/he-makes-you-want-to-shout-meet-singer-of-famous-bills-jingle/|archive-date=March 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as the Bills' official promotional song from 1987 through 1990s. It was officially replaced circa 2000 with &quot;The Power of the Bills&quot;, although &quot;Shout&quot; remains in use. The Bills' unofficial [[fight song]], &quot;Go Bills&quot;, was penned by Bills head coach [[Marv Levy]] in the mid-1990s on a [[friendly political wager|friendly wager]] with his players that he will write the song if the team won a particular game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-12-01/features/0611300370_1_fight-song-chicago-bears-philadelphia-eagles|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=Mooshil|first=Maria|title=10 more things to know about Bears fight song|date=December 1, 2006|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsiders often treat the Bills' fan base in derogatory terms, especially since the 2010s, in part because of negative press coverage of select fans' wilder antics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kritzker|first=Graham|title=Brawls, Balls, and Beer: A Year at The Ralph with Bills Mafia|url=https://sports.vice.com/ca/article/brawls-balls-and-beer-a-year-at-the-ralph-with-bills-mafia|publisher=Vice Sports|date=January 4, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bills fans have been noted as much for their boisterous behavior as they have for their generosity; after the Bills received help in breaking their 17-year playoff drought on a last-minute [[Cincinnati Bengals]] victory, Bills fans [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] the charities of Bengals players [[Andy Dalton]] and [[Tyler Boyd (American football)|Tyler Boyd]] with hundreds of thousands of dollars as a gesture of thanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Besecker|first=Aaron|title=Bengals QB Andy Dalton's foundation buys billboards to say 'thank you' to Bills fans|url=http://buffalonews.com/2018/01/03/dalton-foundation-buys-billboards-to-say-thank-you-to-bills-fans/|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=January 3, 2018|access-date=January 4, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2018/01/04/buffalo-bills-fans-also-generous-tyler-boyds-charity/1003369001/|title=Buffalo Bills fans also generous with Tyler Boyd's charity|first=Dave|last=Clark|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|date=January 4, 2018|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bills are one of the favorite teams of [[ESPN]] announcer [[Chris Berman]], who picked the Bills to reach the Super Bowl nearly every year in the 1990s. Berman often uses the catchphrase &quot;No one [[circle the wagons|circles the wagons]] like the Buffalo Bills!&quot; Berman gave the induction speech for Bills owner [[Ralph Wilson]] when Wilson was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

The Bills were also the favorite team of late [[NBC]] political commentator [[Tim Russert]], a [[South Buffalo, Buffalo, New York|South Buffalo]] native, who often referred to the Bills on his Sunday morning talk show, ''[[Meet the Press]]''. (His son, [[Luke Russert|Luke]], is also a notable fan of the team.)

ESPN anchor [[Kevin Connors]] is also a noted Bills fan, dating to his time attending [[Ithaca College]]. Actor [[Nick Bakay]], a Buffalo native, is also a well-known Bills fan; he has discussed the team in segments of ''[[NFL Top 10]]''.

Bills fans are particularly well known for their wearing of [[Zubaz]] zebra-printed sportswear; so much is the association between Bills fans and Zubaz that when a revival of the company opened their first brick-and-mortar storefront, it chose Western New York as its first location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Christmann|first=Samantha|title=Zubaz opens chain's first brick-and-mortar store at Fashion Outlets|url=http://buffalonews.com/2016/11/16/zubaz-store-opens-fashion-outlets|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
