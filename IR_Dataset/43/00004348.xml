'''BBC Radio 1''' is one of the [[BBC]]'s two flagship [[radio broadcasting|radio stations]] (the other being [[BBC Radio 2]]), specialising in modern [[popular music]] and current chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres at night, including [[electronica]], dance, [[hip hop]] and [[Independent music|indie]]. The choice of music and presenting style is entirely that of programme hosts, however those who present in the daytime have to rotate a number of songs a specific number of times (8, 13 or 15) per week. It was launched in 1967 to meet the demand for music generated by [[pirate radio]] stations, when the average age of the UK population was 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html &quot;Annual Population Survey&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210042804/http://ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html|date=10 December 2013}}.

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of BBC Radio 1}}

===First broadcast===
Radio 1 was established in 1967 (along with the more [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] [[BBC Radio 2]]) as a successor to the [[BBC Light Programme]], which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945. Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], which had been outlawed by [[Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967|Act of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/index.html|title=The Unofficial History of BBC Radio 1 &amp; 2|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio 1 was launched at 7:00{{nbsp}}am on Saturday 30 September 1967.

Broadcasts were on 247 metres (1215&amp;nbsp;kHz) medium wave, using a network of transmitters which had carried the Light Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The British Radio Scene: a Special Report|last=Scott|first=Robin|date=8 June 1968|work=Billboard|access-date=2 October 2017|page=43|author-link=Robin Scott (BBC controller)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most were of comparatively low power, at less than 50 kilowatts, leading to patchy coverage of the country.

The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was [[Tony Blackburn]], whose cheery style, first heard on [[Radio Caroline]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], won him the prime slot on what became known as the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot;. The first words on Radio 1 – after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2, [[Robin Scott (BBC controller)|Robin Scott]], and a jingle, recorded at [[PAMS]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, beginning &quot;The voice of Radio 1&quot; – were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01k1vrv|title=History of the BBC: Start of Radio 1 30 September 1967|publisher=BBC|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Gillian |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3668186/The-day-we-woke-up-to-pop-music-on-Radio-1.html |title=The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 September 2007|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|And, good morning everyone. Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1. | BBC Radio 1 opening message}}

This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio. The reason jingles from PAMS were used was that the [[Musicians' Union (UK)|Musicians' Union]] would not agree to a single fee for the singers and musicians if the jingles were made &quot;in-house&quot; by the BBC; they wanted repeat fees each time one was played.

The first music to be heard on the station was &quot;[[Theme One]]&quot;, specially composed for the launch by [[George Martin]]. It was followed by an extract from &quot;Beefeaters&quot; by [[Johnny Dankworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41414837|title=50 facts about Radio 1 &amp; 2 as they turn 50|first=Mark|last=Savage|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=22 October 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete record played on Radio 1 was &quot;[[Flowers in the Rain]]&quot; by [[The Move]], the number 2 record in that week's Top 20 (the number 1 record by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdink]] would have been inappropriate for the station's sound). The second single was &quot;[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]&quot; by [[Bee Gees|The Bee Gees]]. The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/radio_1_launch_day.htm|title=History – Launch day 1967|publisher=Radio Rewind|date=30 September 1967|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial rota of staff included [[John Peel]] and a gaggle of others, some transferred from pirate stations, such as [[Keith Skues]], [[Ed Stewart]], [[Mike Raven]], David Ryder, Jim Fisher, [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]], [[Dave Cash (DJ)|Dave Cash]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Simon Dee]], [[Terry Wogan]], [[Duncan Johnson]], Doug Crawford, [[Tommy Vance]], [[Chris Denning]], [[Emperor Rosko]], [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]], and [[Bob Holness]]. Many of the most popular pirate radio voices, such as Simon Dee, had only a one-hour slot per week (&quot;Midday Spin.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/original_presenter_list.htm|title=BBC Radio 1 History – Original Presenters|publisher=Radio Rewind|date=4 September 1967|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
{{Quote box|quote=I want to slag off all the people in charge of radio stations. Firstly, Radio 1. They outlawed the pirates and then didn't, as they promised, cater for the market the pirates created. Radio 1 and 2, most afternoons, run concurrently and the whole thing has slid right back to where it was before the pirates happened. They've totally fucked it. There's no radio station for young people any more. It's all down to housewives and trendies in Islington. They're killing the country by having that play list monopoly.

}}
Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as [[Jimmy Young (broadcaster)|Jimmy Young]] being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an &quot;establishment&quot; institution such as the [[BBC]] was a turn-off for some, and [[needle time]] restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.

Despite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened-to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20&amp;nbsp;million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early to mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work. The touring summer live broadcasts called the [[Radio 1 Roadshow]] – usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road – drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[Manx Radio]] in the Isle of Man. ([[Independent Local Radio]] did not begin until October 1973, took many years to cover virtually all of the UK and was initially a mixture of music and talk). [[Alan Freeman]]'s &quot;Saturday Rock Show&quot; was voted &quot;Best Radio Show&quot; five years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.

[[Annie Nightingale]], who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/annie_nightingale_page.htm|title=BBC Radio 1 People – Annie Nightingale – Hi|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday, 23 November 1978, the station moved to two new medium wave frequencies (275m and 285m), which allowed a major increase in transmitter powers and improved coverage of the UK. 247 metres was passed to Radio 3. The station was on medium wave only until the early '80s, when it took over the Radio 2 FM frequency for a number of hours on weekend afternoons and late weekday evenings. Eventually the BBC set up an FM channel specifically for Radio 1 and, after a number of years of parallel broadcasting, relinquished the medium wave frequencies.

===1980s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

At the start of 1981, [[Mike Read]] took over the [[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]] from [[Dave Lee Travis]]. Towards the end of the year, [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] started the long-running [[Steve Wright in the Afternoon]] show. In 1982, the new [[Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show]] started, initially with [[Tony Blackburn]] supported by [[Maggie Philpin]] and [[Keith Chegwin]]. Adrian John and [[Pat Sharp]] also join for the early weekend shows. [[Gary Davies]] and [[Janice Long]] also join, hosting Saturday night late and evening shows respectively. 

In 1984, [[Robbie Vincent]] joins to host a Sunday evening soul show. With [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] leaves for a while to present on BBC TV's [[Breakfast Time (British TV programme)|Breakfast Time]], Gary Davies then takes over weekday lunchtime slot. [[Bruno Brookes]] joins and replaces [[Peter Powell (DJ)|Peter Powell]] as presenter of the teatime show, with Powell replacing Blackburn on the weekend breakfast.

In March 1985, [[Ranking Miss P]] becomes the first black female DJ on the station, hosting a reggae programme. In July, [[Andy Kershaw]] also joins the station. 

[[Simon Mayo]] joins the station in 1986, whilst Smith rejoins to replace Read on the breakfast show.

In response to the growth in dance and rap music, Jeff Young joins in October 1987 with the Big Beat show. At the end of the year, [[Nicky Campbell]], [[Mark Goodier]], and [[Liz Kershaw]] all join.

Mayo replaces Smith on the breakfast show in May 1988. In September, Goodier and Kershaw take over weekend breakfasts with Powell departing. Campbell takes over weekdays.

From September 1988, Radio 1 begins its [[FM broadcasting|FM]] switch-on, with further rollout across the country through 1989.

===1990s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
In 1992, Radio 1, for the first and only time, even covered a [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election]]. Their coverage was presented by [[Nicky Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/98004ab354d34abd8fad4fbf09a9b331|title=Nicky Campbell's Election Special|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under [[Matthew Bannister]]. One of these &quot;[[Loud'n'proud]]&quot; was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in [[Manchester]] and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor [[Gay Pride]] event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '[[Smashie and Nicey]]' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as [[Simon Bates]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Alan Freeman]], [[Bob Harris (radio presenter)|Bob Harris]], [[Paul Gambaccini]] [[Gary Davies]], and later [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], [[Bruno Brookes]] and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]] left the station or were dismissed, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was dropped from the daytime [[playlist]].

Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, [[BBC GLR|GLR]]) with [[Emma Freud]] and [[Danny Baker]]. Another problem was that, at the time, [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], and commercial radio, which was targeting the &quot;Radio 1 and a half&quot; audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.

After the departure of [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]], who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular presenter who was eventually dismissed in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by [[Mark and Lard]] – [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]] (along with his sidekick [[Marc Riley]]), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by [[Zoe Ball]] and [[Kevin Greening]] eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of [[Britpop]] in the mid-90s – bands like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's &quot;Lost in Music&quot; which looked at the influence that the use of drugs have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside [[Broadcasting House]].

Later in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop ([[boy bands]] and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of [[rave]] culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ [[Pete Tong]] amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the [[Essential Mix]] where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]] and [[Seb Fontaine]] all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in [[Ibiza]].

===2000s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Lamacq whiley lowe.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Zane Lowe]]

Listening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as [[The Surgery]], [[Bobby Friction]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]]'s show, ''The Evening Session'' and its successor [[Zane Lowe]]'s show. Its website has also been well received.

However, the breakfast show and the [[UK Top 40]] continued to struggle. In 2000, Zoe Ball was replaced in the mornings by close friend and fellow [[ladette]] [[Sara Cox]], but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by [[Chris Moyles]]. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as [[The Chris Moyles Show]] and it increased its audience, ahead of [[Today programme|The Today Programme]] on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] as the second most popular breakfast show (after [[The Chris Evans Breakfast Show]] hosted by [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the ''[[Wake Up to Wogan]]'' show. In 2006, for example, creating a ''SAY NO TO WOGAN'' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time – Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.
The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host [[Mark Goodier]], amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's [[Pepsi Chart (UK)|Network Chart]] overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. Before July 2015, when the chart release day was changed to Friday, the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio's [[The Big Top 40 Show]] which was broadcast at the same time.

Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] and [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]]) have joined [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.
The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, [[Scott Mills]] and [[Zane Lowe]] all won gold [[Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio Awards]], while the station itself came away with the best station award.

A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&amp;B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&amp;B and reggae shows.

Following the tragic death of [[John Peel]] in October 2004, [[Annie Nightingale]] is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.

===2010s===
The licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tel-nov2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Amanda|last=Andrews|date=28 November 2010|title=BBC enlists commercial sector help to shake up radio|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/8164936/BBC-enlists-commercial-sector-help-to-shake-up-radio.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was &quot;to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tel-nov2010&quot;/&gt;

The controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt. Ben Cooper answers to the Director of BBC Audio and Music, Tim Davie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben Cooper is appointed BBC Radio 1's new controller|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/15494493|accessdate=31 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News – Newsbeat|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2011, Ben Cooper's first major changes to the station were announced. Skream &amp; Benga, [[Toddla T]], [[Charlie Sloth]] and [[Bobby Friction|Friction]] replaced Judge Jules, [[Gilles Peterson]], Kissy Sell Out and Fabio &amp; Grooverider.

In May 2018, it was announced that [[Nick Grimshaw]] would leave the Breakfast Show after six years, the second longest run hosting the show in history (only second to [[Chris Moyles]]). However, Grimshaw did not leave the station, but swapped slots with [[Greg James]], who hosted the home time show from 4-7pm weekdays. This change took place as of 20 August 2018 for the Radio 1 Breakfast Show (which was then renamed to Radio 1 Breakfast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl86/2018/08/20|title=BBC Radio 1 – Schedules, Monday 20 August 2018|publisher=BBC|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Grimshaw]]'s show started on 3 September 2018.

In October 2018, Charlie Sloth announced that he was leaving Radio 1 and 1Xtra after serving the station for nearly 10 years. He was hosting The 8th and The Rap Show at that point.

Charlie was nominated for best specialist music show at the ARIAS – a category he lost out on to Soundtracking with [[Edith Bowman]] and prompting him to appear on stage during her acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/radio/2018-10-21/charlie-sloth-leaves-radio-1-immediately/|title=Charlie Sloth to leave Radio 1 immediately|work=Radio Times|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He apologised on Twitter regarding this issue and Radio 1 had agreed with Charlie that he will not do the 10 remaining shows that were originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-45927344|title=Charlie Sloth leaving Radio 1 and 1Xtra immediately|date=20 October 2018|publisher=BBC News|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that his last show ended on 18 October 2018.

In the same month, [[B.Traits]] announced that she was leaving BBC Radio 1 after six years of commitment. She said she feels as though she can no longer devote the necessary time needed to make the show the best it can be, and is moving on to focus on new projects and adventures. Her last show was on 26 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2018/10/b-traits-leaves-bbc-radio-1-after-6-years/|title=B.Traits leaves BBC Radio 1 after 6 years – RadioToday|website=radiotoday.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Radio 1's Essentials Mix is then shifted earlier to 1am-3am, followed by Radio 1's Wind-Down from 3&amp;nbsp;am to 6&amp;nbsp;am.

At the end of October 2018, [[Dev (DJ)|Dev]]'s takeover on The 8th resulted in the swapping between [[Matt Edmondson]] and [[Mollie King]]'s show with Dev and [[Alice Levine]]'s show. This meant that Matt and Mollie became the new Weekend Breakfast hosts, and Dev and [[Alice Levine|Alice]] became the afternoon show hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45976649|title=Radio 1 gets new weekend breakfast hosts|last=McIntosh|first=Steven|date=26 October 2018|publisher=BBC News|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes came into effect on 16 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/radio/radio-presenters/matt-edmondson-mollie-king-announced-bbc-radio-1-weekend-breakfast/|title=Matt Edmondson and Mollie King announced as BBC Radio 1 weekend breakfast hosts|last=Reporters|first=Telegraph|date=26 October 2018|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=4 November 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl86/2018/11/16|title=BBC Radio 1 – Schedules, Friday 16 November 2018|publisher=BBC|access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2018, Radio 1 announced that Tiffany Calver, who has previously hosted a dedicated hip-hop show on the new-music station [[KissFresh]], would join the station and host the Rap Show.

On 26 November 2018, Radio 1 announced that the new hosts for The 8th would be those of Kiss 100's breakfast show: [[Rickie Haywood-Williams]], [[Melvin Odoom]] and Charlie Hedges. The change took effect in April 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46344373|title=Radio 1 poaches Kiss presenters to replace Sloth|last=McIntosh|first=Steven|date=26 November 2018|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019 it was announced that there would be 2 new shows on the weekend, the weekend early breakfast show and best new pop both of which started on 6 September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/arielle-free-early-breakfast-host|title=BBC – BBC Radio 1 announces Arielle Free as new Weekend Early Breakfast host – Media Centre|publisher=BBC|access-date=16 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Best new pop would be and is currently hosted by [[Mollie King]] and is currently broadcast between 6 and 6.30 on a Friday Morning. 

This in turn changed the timing of the [[Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show|Weekend breakfast Show]] hosted by [[Mollie King]] and  [[Matt Edmondson]]  which now runs between 6.30 and 10 on Friday and on Saturday and Sunday is broadcast between 7&amp;nbsp;am and 10&amp;nbsp;am.

==Broadcast==
===Studios===
From inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.

In 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from [[Broadcasting House]] to [[Egton House]]. The station moved to [[Yalding House]] in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.

Until recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on [[Great Portland Street]] in [[central London]]. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the &quot;[[Live Lounge]]&quot;, although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as [[Maida Vale Studios]] is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the &quot;Live Lounge&quot;, allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the &quot;Live Cam&quot;. The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.

In December 2012, Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]], Portland Place, just a few metres away from the &quot;Peel Wing&quot;, formerly the &quot;Egton Wing&quot;, which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the &quot;Peel Wing&quot; in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, [[John Peel]], who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.

Programmes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably ''The Mark and Lard Show'', broadcast every weekday from [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]], Oxford Road, [[Manchester]] for over a decade (October 1993 – March 2004) – the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.

===UK analogue frequencies===
Radio 1 originally broadcast on 1214&amp;nbsp;kHz [[medium wave]] (or 247 metres). On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to 1053 and 1089&amp;nbsp;kHz (275 and 285 m), but did not broadcast nationally on its own FM frequencies until late 1987. The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 2]]), [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] (now [[BBC Radio 3]]) and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]) stations. Thus when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2's]] FM transmitters for a few hours per week. These were Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening – most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons; 10{{nbsp}}pm to midnight on weeknights including [[Sounds of the Seventies]] until 1975, and thereafter the [[John Peel]] show (Mon–Thurs) and the Friday Rock Show; and most Bank Holiday afternoons, when Radio 2 was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of [[5 live Sport|Sport on 2]].

To coincide with Radio 1's 20th birthday, the first full-time FM broadcast began in the London area on 31 October 1987, at low power on 104.8&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/images/transmitfm_sht1.jpg|title=Plans for Radio 1 FM services introduction|publisher=Radiorewind.co.uk|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later the FM frequencies became national after the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97–99 FM, which the BBC acquired. The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England. A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended. Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995. The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995.

The Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to [[Independent National Radio]]. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with [[Stephen Duffy]]'s &quot;Kiss Me&quot; being the last record played on MW just before 9{{nbsp}}am. For those who continued to listen, just after 9{{nbsp}}am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with [[Mark Goodier]] was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an &quot;FM-only&quot; station.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio 1 transmitter AM switchoff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm|title=Radio 1 History – Transmitters|publisher=Radio Rewind|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on [[Sky Television plc|Sky Television's]] analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UK Gold]]) and later in stereo (on [[Sky Living|UK Living]]).

===Digital distribution===
The BBC launched its national radio stations on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was &quot;officially&quot; launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Virgin Media]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] began [[simulcast]]ing Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on [[Dish Network]] satellite TV. [[Sirius Canada]] began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were [[Time shifting|time shifted]] five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Time Zone]] to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29,{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_SIR_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=Sirius Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/pdf/11-524_XM_WebLUs_5_4.pdf|title=XM Channel Lineup|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6&amp;nbsp;million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone.
BBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.

===SiriusXM cancellation in North America===
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2013}}
At midnight on 9 August 2011, [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning. On 10 August 2011 the BBC issued the following statement:

Thousands of angry Sirius XM customers began a campaign on Facebook and other social media to reinstate BBC Radio 1 on Sirius XM Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/SaveRadio1inNorthAmerica | title=Get BBC Radio 1 Back on Sirius XM | publisher=Facebook | accessdate=12 October 2013}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, Sirius and the BBC agreed on a new carriage agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/bbcradio1 |title=BBC Radio 1 – British Pop hits from U.K. Charts – SiriusXM Radio |publisher=Siriusxm.com |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516153430/http://www.siriusxm.com/bbcradio1 |archivedate=16 May 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that saw Radio 1 broadcast on a time-shifted format on the Sirius XM Internet Radio platform only, on channel 815.

Starting on 15 January 2012, ''The Official Chart Show'' began broadcasting on SiriusXM ''20on20'' channel 3, at 4{{nbsp}}pm and 9{{nbsp}}pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bowman |first1=Samantha |title=Weekly countdown of the UK's top 40 songs to air on SiriusXM's 20 on 20 channel |url=http://investor.siriusxm.com/investor-overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2012/BBC-Radio-1s-The-Official-Chart-with-Reggie-Yates-to-Air-on-SiriusXM/default.aspx |website=SiriusXM |publisher=SiriusXM Radio |accessdate=1 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August 2014, SiriusXM again stopped carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no advanced notice. The stream is no longer available on the Internet Radio platform.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Regionalisation===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[BBC Northern Ireland]] --&gt;
From 1999 until 2012, Radio 1 split the [[home nations]] for localised programming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent. Most recently, these shows were under the [[BBC Introducing]] brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.

From January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592r |title=BBC Radio 1 – BBC Introducing in Scotland with Ally McCrae |publisher=BBC |date=11 June 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously it was hosted by [[Vic Galloway]] (who also presents for [[BBC Radio Scotland]]); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed.

Wales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x592p |title=BBC Radio 1 – BBC Introducing in Wales with Jen Long |publisher=BBC |date=28 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously [[Bethan Elfyn]] occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens,&lt;ref name=&quot;regions98&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |title=Frequency Finder UK – Classic Radio 1 schedules |publisher=Frequencyfinder.org.uk |date=25 October 2004 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111133603/http://frequencyfinder.org.uk/r1_sched_98_04.html |archivedate=11 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales – a Welsh-language music show on [[BBC Radio Cymru]] on Thursday evenings)

Phil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by [[Rory McConnell]]. Before joining the national network, [[Colin Murray]] was a presenter on ''The Session'' in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge;&lt;ref name=&quot;regions98&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |title=Who is Colin Murray? |publisher=Culturenorthernireland.org |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110024216/http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article.aspx?art_id=1253 |archivedate=10 November 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.

The regional opt-outs originally went out from 8{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm on Thursdays (the ''Evening Session''{{'}}s time slot) and were known as the &quot;Session in the Nations&quot; (the &quot;Session&quot; tag was later dropped due to the demise of the ''Evening Session''); they later moved to run from 7:30{{nbsp}}pm to 9{{nbsp}}pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am under the ''BBC Introducing'' banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of midnight to 2{{nbsp}}am on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.

The opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.

The [[BBC Trust]] announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18083178 |title=Children's shows to leave BBC One |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single ''BBC Introducing'' show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jk7zb |title=BBC Radio 1 – BBC Introducing with Jen and Ally |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

=== Music ===
Because of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a broad mix of current and potential future hits, including [[indie rock|independent]]/[[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip hop]], rock, dance/[[electronica]] and pop. This made the station stand out from other [[contemporary hit radio|top 40]] stations, both in the UK and across the world.

Due to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the &quot;[[needle time]]&quot; limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many of them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for [[John Peel]]'s late night programme are particularly renowned.

The station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for &quot;waffling&quot; by presenters, an experimental &quot;more music day&quot; in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.

===News and current affairs===
{{Main|Newsbeat}}
Radio 1 has a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcasting]] obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through [[Newsbeat]] bulletins throughout the day. Shared with [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two additional 15-minute bulletins at select times. The main presenter is Ben Mundy, with Roisin Hastie presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Newly announced Newsbeat presenters say reading bulletins on BBC Radio 1 is 'dream come true' |url=https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/newly-announced-newsbeat-presenters-say-reading-bulletins-on-bbc-radio-1-is-dream-come-true/ |magazine=Press Gazette |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online visualisation and social media===
In recent years Radio 1 has used social media to help reach a younger audience. Its YouTube channel now has over 5 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/user/bbcradio1|title = BBC Radio 1 – YouTube|accessdate = 24 July 2018|website = BBC Radio 1 – YouTube}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The highest viewed videos on the channel are predominately live music performances from the [[Live Lounge]].

The station also has a heavy presence on social media, with audience interaction occurring through Facebook and Twitter as well as [[Short Message Service|text messaging]].

It was announced in 2013 that Radio 1 had submitted plans to launch its own dedicated video channel on the [[BBC iPlayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/radio-1-channel.html|title = BBC Media Centre|date = 7 October 2013|website = Radio 1 to have own channel on BBC iPlayer|publisher = BBC}}
&lt;/ref&gt; where videos of live performances as well as some features and shows would be streamed in a central location. Plans were approved by the [[BBC Trust]] in November 2014 and the channel launched on 10 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://radiotoday.co.uk/2014/11/launch-date-set-for-radio-1s-iplayer-channel/|title = Launch date set for Radio 1's iPlayer channel|date = 3 November 2014|accessdate =3 November 2014 |website = Radio Today|publisher = Radio Today|last =Martin |first =Roy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special programming===
====Bank Holiday programming====
Radio 1 provides alternative programming on some Bank Holidays. Programmes have included 'The 10 Hour Takeover', a request-based special, in which the DJs on air would encourage listeners to select any available track to play, 'One Hit Wonder Day' and 'The Chart of the Decade' where the 150 biggest selling singles in the last 10 years were counted down and played in full.

====Anniversary programming====
On Sunday 30 September 2007, Radio 1 celebrated its 40th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/established1967|title = Radio 1 Established 1967|publisher = [[BBC]]|accessdate = 2 February 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; To mark this anniversary Radio 1 hosted a week of special features, including a re-creation of Simon Bates' [[The Golden Hour (Radio Feature)|Golden Hour]], and 40 different artists performing 40 different covers, one from each year since Radio 1 was established. On Saturday 30 September 2017, Radio 1 celebrated its 50th birthday. [[Tony Blackburn]] recreated the first ever Radio 1 broadcast on [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p059n6gl|title = Tony Blackburn|publisher = [[BBC]]|accessdate = 30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; simulcast on pop-up station Radio 1 Vintage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p059cwkn|title = Radio 1 Vintage|publisher = [[BBC]]|accessdate = 30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[The Radio 1 Breakfast Show]] celebration, tricast on Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 1 Vintage, presented by Tony Blackburn and [[Nick Grimshaw]], featuring former presenters as guests [[Simon Mayo]], [[Sara Cox]] and [[Mike Read]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p059kfxc|title = Tony Blackburn and Nick Grimshaw|publisher = [[BBC]]|accessdate = 30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charity====
Radio 1 regularly supports charities [[Comic Relief]], [[Sport Relief]] and [[Children in Need]].

On 18 March 2011, BBC's Radio 1 longest-serving breakfast DJ [[Chris Moyles]] and sidekick [[Comedy Dave|Dave Vitty]] broadcast for 52 hours as part of a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] attempt, in aid of [[Comic Relief]]. The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)’ after already breaking [[Simon Mayo]]'s 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief.

The presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30{{nbsp}}am on 18 March 2011. During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over £2,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit. After passing the £2,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10{{nbsp}}am and 10:30{{nbsp}}am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.

In total the event raised £2,622,421 for Comic Relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chrismoyles/longestshow/ |title=Radio 1 – BBC Radio 1's Longest Show Ever with Chris Moyles and Comedy Dave for Comic Relief |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drama====
In 1981, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the [[space opera]] film, ''[[Star Wars (radio)|Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Wars: A Wind to Shake the Stars – BBC Radio 1 England – 4 July 1981 – BBC Genome|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/deeb365665eb44a0867f3dd085a0f9d7|website=Radio Times Archive: BBC Radio 1|publisher=BBC Genome Project|accessdate=1 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029205244/http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/deeb365665eb44a0867f3dd085a0f9d7 |archivedate=29 October 2014|date=4 July 1981|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13-episode serial was adapted for radio by the author [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], and was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between the BBC and the American Broadcaster [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Robb|first1=Brian J.|title=A Brief Guide to Star Wars|date=2012|publisher=Hachette |location=London|isbn=9781780335834|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l-eBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT76&amp;dq=star%20wars%20national%20public%20radio&amp;pg=PT76#v=onepage&amp;q=star%20wars%20national%20public%20radio&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the ''Batman'' comic book storyline Knightfall, as part of the Marc Goodier show, featuring [[Michael Gough]] recreating his movie role as Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mark Goodier – BBC Radio 1 England – 11 April 1994 – BBC Genome|journal=Radio Times|issue=3665|pages=102|publisher=BBC Genome Project|accessdate=26 June 2018|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/076ac40cab8e4ababfb52c9423955ef8|date=7 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, Radio 1 also broadcast a re-edited version of the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] Superman radio drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Claire Sturgess = BBC Radio 1 England – 18 July 1994 14.00 – BBC Genome|journal=Radio Times|issue=3679|pages=102|publisher=BBC Genome Project|accessdate=26 June 2018|url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/25e12b7183bc4d938d4efdb2c724c413|date=14 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
===Radio 1 Roadshows===
The [[Radio 1 Roadshow]], which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/roadshow.htm|title=Radio Rewind – Radio 1 Shows – Roadshow; the early years|publisher=Radio Rewind}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[Alan Freeman]] in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, with the final one held at [[Heaton Park]], Manchester in 1999. Although the Roadshow attracted large crowds and the style changed with the style of the station itself—such as the introduction of whistlestop audio postcards of each location in 1994 (&quot;2minuteTour&quot;)—they were still rooted in the older style of the station, and therefore fit for retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/end-of-the-road-for-radio-one-roadshow-284233.html|title=End of the road for Radio One Roadshow|date=16 March 2000|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend===
{{Main|Radio 1's Big Weekend}}
In March 2000, Radio 1 decided to change the Roadshow format, renaming it ''One Big Sunday'' in the process. Several of these ''Sundays'' were held in large city-centre parks. In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded ''[[Radio 1's Big Weekend|One Big Weekend]]'', with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited [[Derry]] in Northern Ireland, as part of the ''Music Lives'' campaign, and [[Perry Park (Birmingham)|Perry Park]] in Birmingham.

The most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]]. Venues under this title have included [[Herrington]] Country Park, [[Camperdown Country Park]], [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]]–which was the first ''Weekend'' to feature a third stage–[[Mote Park]], [[Lydiard Park]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Airport]].

Tickets for each ''Big Weekend'' are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/|title=Radio 1 announced line-up for One Big Weekend, Preston|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2 February 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080218203420/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/| archivedate= 18 February 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The Hackney Weekend took place over the weekend of 23–24 June 2012 in [[Hackney Marshes]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London. The event was to celebrate the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]] in London and had artists such as [[Rihanna]], [[Jay-Z]] and [[Florence and the Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/events/hackneyweekend2012 |title=Radio 1's Hackney Weekend 2012 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Radio 1's Big Weekend returned to [[Derry]] as part of the City of Culture 2013 celebrations. So far, Derry is the only city to have hosted the Big Weekend twice.

In May 2014, Radio 1's Big Weekend was held in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Acts which played at the event included [[Rita Ora]], [[The 1975]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Jake Bugg]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]. The event was opened on the Friday with a dance set in [[George Square]], featuring Radio 1 Dance DJs such as [[Danny Howard]] and [[Pete Tong]], and other well-known acts such as [[Martin Garrix]] and [[Tiësto|Tiesto]].

In 2015, the event was held in [[Norwich]] and featured performances from the likes of [[Taylor Swift]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[David Guetta]], [[Years &amp; Years]] and others.

2016 saw the event make its way to [[Exeter]]. It was headlined by [[Coldplay]] who closed the weekend on the Sunday evening.

The event was in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in 2017 and saw performances by artists such as [[Zara Larsson]], [[Shawn Mendes]], [[Stormzy]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Little Mix]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Rita Ora]], [[The Chainsmokers]], [[Clean Bandit]] and [[Kings of Leon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/eppp6q/performances|title=Radio 1's Big Weekend 2017|website=BBC Music Events|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 to take advantage of [[Glastonbury Festival]]'s fallow year, 4 separate Big Weekends were held simultaneously between 25 and 28 May. Stylized as &quot;BBC Music's Biggest Weekend&quot;, events were held in [[Swansea]] (with a line-up curated by Radio 1), [[Coventry]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] (both curated by Radio 2) and [[Belfast]] (curated by Radio 6). Tickets sold out for the Swansea, Perth and Coventry Big Weekends.

===Ibiza Weekend===
Radio 1 has annually held a dance music weekend broadcast live from [[Ibiza]] since the 1990s. The weekend is usually the first weekend in August and has performances from world-famous DJs and Radio 1's own dance music talent such as [[Pete Tong]] and [[Annie Mac]].

===BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards===
Since 2008 Radio 1 has held an annual event for teenagers aged 14 to 17 years. Originally named [[BBC Switch]] Live, the first event was held on 12 October 2008 at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]]. The event has been hosted by various Radio 1 DJs and guest co-hosts.

In 2010 the event was renamed 'BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards', and includes awards given to celebrities and particularly inspirational young people. Now hosted at [[Wembley Arena]], the event has included guests such as [[One Direction]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Jessie J]].

The 2014 event took place on 19 October and was hosted by [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Rita Ora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/ec8mxj|title=BBC Radio 1's Teen Awards 2014 – event – Radio 1|work=BBC Music Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edinburgh Festival===
Radio 1 often has a presence at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]]. Past events have included 'The Fun and Filth Cabaret' and 'Scott Mills: The Musical'.

=== Europe's Biggest Dance Show ===
On Friday 11 October 2019 Radio 1 joined forces with several European radio stations, all other members of the [[European Broadcasting Union]], including Swedish [[Sveriges Radio P3|SR P3]], German [[1LIVE]] and [[RBB Fritz]], Belgian [[Studio Brussel|VRT Studio Brussel]], Irish [[RTÉ 2fm]], French [[Mouv'|Radio France Mouv]] and Dutch [[NPO 3FM]] headed up by British [[BBC Radio 1]] for a special simulcast show named &quot;[[Europe's Biggest Dance Show]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/biggest-dance-show|title=BBC – BBC Radio 1 to host biggest dance show ever – Media Centre|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show started at 7&amp;nbsp;pm UK time and the format was that every country involved would takeover for 1 hour of the 7-hour show, showcasing some of their countries' best [[dance music]] starting off with [[Annie Mac]] for Radio 1. The German hour was shared with 30mins being broadcast by 1LIVE in [[Cologne|Köln]] and 30mins by Radio Fritz in [[Berlin]]. Most stations chose to feature at least 1 live DJ set, with Radio 1 having DJ [[Jax Jones]] live in the mix. The show reached an estimated 18 million listeners&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;. Each participant station linked to Radio 1 where BBC staff mixed the show at [[New Broadcasting House]] in London, the mixed show was then sent back out to the participating stations to broadcast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DanDJMorris/status/1182776237816713216|title=Lots of lines!

Radio 1 Head of Programmes Aled Haydn-Jones said before the show &quot;This is going to be a real radio event! Having seven countries showcasing the best dance music from their country is absolutely the best way it can delivered. I’m proud BBC Radio 1 partnered with seven other radio stations and I can't wait to hear it!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
