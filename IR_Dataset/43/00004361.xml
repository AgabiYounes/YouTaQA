'''Biological warfare''' ('''BW''')—also known as '''germ warfare'''—is the use of [[Toxin#Biotoxins|biological toxins]] or [[Pathogen|infectious agents]] such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[insects]], and [[Fungus|fungi]] with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. [[Biological agent|Biological weapon]]s (often termed &quot;bio-weapons&quot;, &quot;biological threat agents&quot;, or &quot;bio-agents&quot;) are living [[organism]]s or replicating entities ([[virus]]es, which are not universally considered &quot;alive&quot;). [[Entomological warfare|Entomological (insect) warfare]] is a subtype of BW. 

Biological warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]] and [[chemical warfare]], which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs). None of these are considered [[conventional weapons]], which are deployed primarily for their [[explosion|explosive]], [[kinetic energy|kinetic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] potential.

Biological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some [[chemical weapon]]s, biological weapons may also be useful as [[area denial weapon]]s. These agents may be lethal or [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by [[nation state]]s or by non-national groups. In the latter case, or if a nation-state uses it [[Clandestine operation|clandestinely]], it may also be considered [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wheelis&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wheelis|first=Mark|last2=Rózsa |first2=Lajos |last3=Dando |first3=Malcolm | name-list-format = vanc |title=Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945|publisher =Harvard University Press|year=2006|pages=284–293, 301–303|isbn=978-0-674-01699-6}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological warfare and chemical warfare overlap to an extent, as the use of [[toxin]]s produced by some living organisms is considered under the provisions of both the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Toxins and [[Psychochemical warfare|psychochemical weapons]] are often referred to as ''midspectrum agents''. Unlike bioweapons, these midspectrum agents do not reproduce in their host and are typically characterized by shorter incubation periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gray | first = Colin | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2007 | title = Another Bloody Century: Future Warfare | pages = 265–266 | publisher = Phoenix | isbn = 978-0-304-36734-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Offensive biological warfare, including [[mass production]], stockpiling, and use of biological weapons, was outlawed by the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The [[Theory of justification|rationale]] behind this [[treaty]], which has been [[Ratification|ratified]] or acceded to by [[List of parties to the Biological Weapons Convention|170 countries]] as of April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[[Biological Weapons Convention]]&lt;/ref&gt; is to prevent a biological attack which could conceivably result in large numbers of [[civilian casualties]] and cause severe disruption to [[economic]] and societal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/bwc/text|title=Show Treaty|website=disarmament.un.org|access-date=2018-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214040338/http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/bwc/text|archive-date=14 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, including signatories of the BWC, currently pursue research into the defense or protection against BW, which is not prohibited by the BWC.

A nation or group and  that can pose a credible threat of mass casualty has the ability to alter the terms on which other nations or groups interact with it. Biological weapons allow for the potential to create a level of destruction and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons, relative to their mass and cost of development and storage. Therefore, biological agents may be useful as strategic deterrents in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430190200/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html|date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714004040&amp;db=all|title=Informaworld link|access-date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents ([[smallpox]], [[pneumonic plague]]) ([[JOEL]])have the capability of person-to-person [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] via [[Bioaerosol|aerosolized]] [[Droplet contact|respiratory droplets]]. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW is less of a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.

The [[British Army]] commanders approved the use of smallpox as a biological weapon in the [[French and Indian War]] to target [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] during the [[Siege of Fort Pitt]] in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America (Pivotal Moments in American History)|last=Calloway|first=Collin G. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0195331271|location=|page=73|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rationalizing Epidemics|last=Jones|first=David S. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0674013056|location=|page=97|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Country Between: The Upper Ohio Valley and Its Peoples, 1724-1774|last=McConnel|first=Michael N. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondence between General (Baron) Jeffrey Amherst and Colonel Henry Bouquet provides further evidence that the English army freely planned for the use of biological weapons to kill Native Americans, as detailed in [[Native American disease and epidemics]].  A smallpox outbreak was reported in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes area through 1763 and 1764.

The spread of smallpox weakened the French and Native American resistance to the British troops led by  Bouquet. The smallpox outbreak was considered a direct result of two blankets and a scarf taken from a Small Pox Hospital, then gifted by William Trent and others English army representatives to leader Maumaultee and warrior Turtle Heart of the Delaware people  during their visit to Ft Pitt. Amherst and Bouquet discussed other biological weapon deployments as a result. Apologists pose questions as to whether the outbreak was the result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the [[Lenape|Delaware people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barras V, Greub G | title = History of biological warfare and bioterrorism | journal = Clinical Microbiology and Infection | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 497–502 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24894605 | doi = 10.1111/1469-0691.12706 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/1469-0691.12706/asset/clm12706.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j4bf3l4p&amp;s=4351999801f90a508f62ce76425596025d9fff97 | quote = However, in the light of contemporary knowledge, it remains doubtful whether his hopes were fulfilled, given the fact that the transmission of smallpox through this kind of vector is much less efficient than respiratory transmission, and that Native Americans had been in contact with smallpox &gt;200 years before Ecuyer’s trickery, notably during Pizarro’s conquest of South America in the 16th century.

By 1900 the [[germ theory]] and advances in [[bacteriology]] brought a new level of sophistication to the techniques for possible use of [[bio-agent]]s in war.

With the onset of [[World War II]], the [[Ministry of Supply]] in the [[United Kingdom]] established a BW program at [[Porton Down]], headed by the microbiologist [[Paul Fildes]]. The research was championed by [[Winston Churchill]] and soon [[tularemia]], [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]], [[brucellosis]], and [[botulism]] toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, [[Gruinard Island]] in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed on its own, its program was the first to successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SoDwO-dl-i0C|title=Biological Agents, Volume 2 | vauthors = Prasad SK  |year=2009 |publisher=Discovery Publishing House |page=36 |isbn=9788183563819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;garrett&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Garrett | first = Laurie | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=teMYnJoVolkC&amp;pg=PA340 | title = Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2003 | pages = 340–341 | isbn = 978-0198526834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[brucellosis]], [[tularemia]] and later [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus|equine encephalomyelitis]] and [[vaccinia]] [[virus]]es, but the programme was unilaterally cancelled in 1956.

In 1969, the UK and the Warsaw Pact, separately, introduced proposals to the UN to ban biological weapons, and US President [[Richard Nixon]] terminated production of biological weapons, allowing only scientific research for defensive measures. The [[Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention]] was signed by the US, UK, USSR and other nations, as a ban on &quot;development, production and stockpiling of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts necessary for protective and peaceful research&quot; in 1972. However, the [[Soviet Union]] continued research and production of massive offensive biological weapons in a program called [[Biopreparat]], despite having signed the convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alibek&quot; /&gt; as of September 2018, 182 countries have ratified the treaty and none are proven—though nine are still suspected&lt;ref name=qpppvabv /&gt;—to possess offensive BW programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;qpppvabv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usiraq.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000678 |title=26 Countries' WMD Programs; A Global History of WMD Use - US - Iraq War - ProCon.org |publisher=Usiraq.procon.org |date=2009-05-29 |access-date=2013-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419042545/http://usiraq.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000678 |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a means of terrorism==
{{main|Bioterrorism}}

Biological weapons are difficult to detect, economical and easy to use, making them appealing to terrorists. The cost of a biological weapon is estimated to be about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Potential Agents of Biological Terrorism {{!}} SIU School of Medicine|url=https://www.siumed.edu/im/overview-potential-agents-biological-terrorism.html|website=SIU School of Medicine|access-date=15 November 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119070804/http://www.siumed.edu/im/overview-potential-agents-biological-terrorism.html|archive-date=19 November 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, their production is very easy as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics. A major factor about biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation. This is because the potential organism has incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving terrorists a lead.

A technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat ([[CRISPR]]) is now so cheap and widely available that scientists fear that the amateurs will start experimenting with them. In this technique, a DNA sequence is cut off and replaced with a new sequence or code that codes for a particular protein or characteristic, which could potentially show up in the required organism. Though this technique is a breakthrough and is commendable, it can cause serious issues and potential danger if used by people with wrong intentions. Concerns have emerged regarding do-it-yourself biology research organizations due to their associated risk that a rogue amateur DIY researcher could attempt to develop dangerous bioweapons using genome editing technology.&lt;ref&gt;Millet, P., Kuiken, T., &amp; Grushkin, D.

==Entomological warfare==
{{Main|Entomological warfare}}

Entomological warfare (EW) is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to attack the enemy. The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunshine&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}&quot;, ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002. Retrieved 25 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The insects then act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method uses uninfected insects, such as bees, wasps, etc., to directly attack the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Jeffrey A. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = USA | date =  2008 | pages = 9–26 | isbn = 978-0195333053 | title-link = Six-legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BW by target==
It has been argued that rational state actors would never use biological weapons offensively. The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force.

===Anti-personnel===
[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]

Ideal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s, and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.

The primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.

For example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3–7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &amp;#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.

Agents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the [[Bunyaviridae]] (especially [[Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley fever virus]]), [[Ebola]]virus, many of the [[Flaviviridae]] (especially [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]]), [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Machupo virus]], [[Marburg virus]], Variola virus, and [[Yellow fever|yellow fever virus]]. Fungal agents that have been studied include ''[[Coccidioides]] spp.''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alibek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hassani M, Patel MC, Pirofski LA | title = Vaccines for the prevention of diseases caused by potential bioweapons | journal = Clinical Immunology | volume = 111 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15093546 | doi = 10.1016/j.clim.2003.09.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toxins that can be used as weapons include [[ricin]], [[Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B|staphylococcal enterotoxin B]], [[botulinum toxin]], [[saxitoxin]], and many [[mycotoxin]]s. These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.

The former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).

===Anti-agriculture===
====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====
{{see also|United States military anti-plant research}}
The United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franz|first=David|name-list-format=vanc|title=The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|journal=Arizona University|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219221907/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.

Though herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.  The Army Biological Laboratory tested each agent and the Army's Technical Escort Unit was responsible for transport of all chemical, biological, radiological (nuclear) materials. Scorched earth tactics or destroying livestock and farmland were carried out in the Vietnam war (cf. Agent Orange)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3798581.stm|title=Vietnam's war against Agent Orange|date=14 June 2004|access-date=17 April 2010|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111171055/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3798581.stm|archive-date=11 January 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sri Lankan Civil War|Eelam War]] in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/critics-accuse-sri-lanka-of-using-scorched-earth-tactics-against-tamils-1.524770|title=Critics accuse Sri Lanka of using scorched earth tactics against Tamils|website=The National|language=en|access-date=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological warfare can also specifically target plants to destroy crops or defoliate vegetation. The United States and Britain discovered plant growth regulators (i.e., [[herbicide]]s) during the Second World War, and initiated a [[herbicidal warfare]] program that was eventually used in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[Agent Orange|Vietnam]] in [[counterinsurgency]] operations.

In 1980s Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had successfully developed variants of [[foot-and-mouth disease]], and [[rinderpest]] against cows, [[African swine fever]] for pigs, and [[psittacosis]] to kill chicken. These agents were prepared to spray them down from tanks attached to airplanes over hundreds of miles.

===Research and development into medical counter-measures===
{{expand section|date=December 2011}}
In 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in [[Geneva]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = European Union cooperative Initiatives to improve Biosafety and Biosecurity | title = Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction | url = https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/708897/files/BWC_MSP_2010_MX_WP.5-EN.pdf | date = 12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
the [[sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance]] was suggested as well-tested means for enhancing the monitoring of infections and parasitic agents, for practical implementation of the [[International Health Regulations]] (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties.

===Role of public health and disease surveillance===
It is important to note that most classical and modern biological weapons' pathogens can be obtained from a plant or an animal which is naturally infected.&lt;ref&gt;Ouagrham-Gormley S. Dissuading Biological Weapons Proliferation. Contemporary Security Policy [serial online]. December 2013;34(3):473–500. Available from: Humanities International Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed 28 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, in the largest biological weapons accident known—the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now [[Yekaterinburg]]) in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1979—sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city and still off limits to visitors today, (see [[Sverdlovsk Anthrax leak]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Guillemin J | date = 2013 | title = The Soviet Biological Weapons Program: A History. Politics &amp; The Life Sciences | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–105 | doi = 10.2990/32_1_102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, a robust surveillance system involving human clinicians and veterinarians may identify a bioweapons attack early in the course of an epidemic, permitting the prophylaxis of disease in the vast majority of people (and/or animals) exposed but not yet ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ryan CP | title = Zoonoses likely to be used in bioterrorism | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 276–81 | date = 2008 | pmid = 19006970 | pmc = 2289981 | doi = 10.1177/003335490812300308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24–36 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique [[chest X-ray]] finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkening D 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkening DA | title = Modeling the incubation period of inhalational anthrax | journal = Medical Decision Making | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 593–605 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18556642 | doi = 10.1177/0272989X08315245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incubation period for humans is estimated to be about 11.8 days to 12.1 days.  This suggested period is the first model that is independently consistent with data from the largest known human outbreak. These projections refines previous estimates of the distribution of early onset cases after a release and supports a recommended 60-day course of prophylactic antibiotic treatment for individuals exposed to low doses of anthrax.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24058320&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toth DJ, Gundlapalli AV, Schell WA, Bulmahn K, Walton TE, Woods CW, Coghill C, Gallegos F, Samore MH, Adler FR | title = Quantitative models of the dose-response and time course of inhalational anthrax in humans | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = e1003555 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 24058320 | pmc = 3744436 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By making these data available to local public health officials in real time, most models of anthrax epidemics indicate that more than 80% of an exposed population can receive antibiotic treatment before becoming symptomatic, and thus avoid the moderately high mortality of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkening D 2015&quot;/&gt;

===Common epidemiological clues that may signal biological attack===
From most specific to least specific:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Treadwell TA, Koo D, Kuker K, Khan AS | title = Epidemiologic clues to bioterrorism | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 118 | issue = 2 | pages = 92–8 | date = March–April 2003 | pmid = 12690063 | pmc = 1497515 | doi = 10.1093/phr/118.2.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Single cause of a certain disease caused by an uncommon agent, with lack of an epidemiological explanation.
#Unusual, rare, genetically engineered strain of an agent.
#High morbidity and mortality rates in regards to patients with the same or similar symptoms.
#Unusual presentation of the disease.
#Unusual geographic or seasonal distribution.
#Stable endemic disease, but with an unexplained increase in relevance.
#Rare transmission (aerosols, food, water).
#No illness presented in people who were/are not exposed to &quot;common ventilation systems (have separate closed ventilation systems) when illness is seen in persons in close proximity who have a common ventilation system.&quot;
#Different and unexplained diseases coexisting in the same patient without any other explanation.
#Rare illness that affects a large, disparate population (respiratory disease might suggest the pathogen or agent was inhaled).
#Illness is unusual for a certain population or age-group in which it takes presence.
#Unusual trends of death and/or illness in animal populations, previous to or accompanying illness in humans.
#Many affected reaching out for treatment at the same time.
#Similar genetic makeup of agents in affected individuals.
#Simultaneous collections of similar illness in non-contiguous areas, domestic, or foreign.
#An abundance of cases of unexplained diseases and deaths.

===Identification of bioweapons===
The goal of [[biodefense]] is to integrate the sustained efforts of the national and homeland security, medical, public health, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities. Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.

The traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.

The growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a &quot;sandwich immunoassay&quot;, in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, &quot;Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons&quot;, 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231844/http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ). This system would be implemented into the national response plan for bioweapon attacks in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tno.nl/content.cfm?context=markten&amp;content=case&amp;laag1=178&amp;item_id=832|title=BiosparQ features|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113041020/http://www.tno.nl/content.cfm?context=markten&amp;content=case&amp;laag1=178&amp;item_id=832|archive-date=13 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Ben Gurion University]] in Israel are developing a different device called the BioPen, essentially a &quot;Lab-in-a-Pen&quot;, which can detect known biological agents in under 20 minutes using an adaptation of the [[ELISA]], a similar widely employed immunological technique, that in this case incorporates fiber optics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Genuth | first1 = Iddo | last2 = Fresco-Cohen | first2 = Lucille | name-list-format = vanc | date = 13 November 2006 | url = http://www.tfot.info/content/view/96/56/ | title = BioPen Senses BioThreats | work = The Future of Things | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070430131012/http://www.tfot.info/content/view/96/56/ | archive-date = 30 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
