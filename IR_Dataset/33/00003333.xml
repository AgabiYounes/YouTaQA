It was a huge commercial success and became highly influential. The film's release has also been acknowledged as an inspiration for [[Ku Klux Klan#Second Klan: 1915–1944|the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan]] only months later. In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
The film consists of two parts of similar length. The first part closes with the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], after which there is an [[intermission]]. At the New York premiere, Dixon spoke on stage between the parts, reminding the audience that the dramatic version of ''The Clansman'' appeared in that venue nine years previously. &quot;Mr. Dixon also observed that he would have allowed none but the son of a Confederate soldier to direct the film version of ''The Clansman.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their three sons and two daughters. Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, during the brothers' visit to the Cameron estate in [[South Carolina]], representing the [[Old South]]. Meanwhile, young Ben Cameron (modeled after [[Leroy McAfee]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Corkin|first=Stanley|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/31610418|title=Realism and the birth of the modern United States : cinema, literature, and culture|date=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1996|isbn=0-8203-1730-6|location=Athens|pages=156|oclc=31610418}}&lt;/ref&gt; idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War arrives, the young men of both families enlist in their respective armies. The younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in combat. Meanwhile, the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout a black militia after an attack on the Cameron home. Ben Cameron leads a heroic final charge at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], earning the nickname of &quot;the Little Colonel&quot;, but he is also wounded and captured. He is then taken to a Union [[military hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

During his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben. When [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theatre]], his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and other [[Radical Republican]]s are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the [[Reconstruction Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffith followed the then-dominant [[Dunning School]] or &quot;Tragic Era&quot; view of Reconstruction presented by early 20th-century historians such as [[William Archibald Dunning]] and [[Claude G. Bowers]]. {{harvnb|Stokes|2007|pp=190–191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 2: Reconstruction===
Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a [[psychopath]]ic [[mulatto]] (modeled after [[Alonzo J. Ransier]] and [[Richard Howell Gleaves]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leistedt | first1 = Samuel J. | last2 = Linkowski | first2 = Paul | title = Psychopathy and the Cinema: Fact or Fiction? | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | date = January 2014 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–174 | doi = 10.1111/1556-4029.12359 | ref = harv | pmid = 24329037 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; head to [[South Carolina]] to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|lieutenant governor]], blacks are observed [[Ballot box stuffing|stuffing the ballot boxes]], while [[Reconstruction era#Suffrage|many whites are denied the vote]]. The newly elected, mostly black members of the [[South Carolina General Assembly|South Carolina legislature]] are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on [[Fried chicken#Racial stereotype|fried chicken]].
[[File:Birth-of-a-nation-klan-and-black-man.jpg|thumb|left|Hooded Klansmen catch Gus, portrayed in [[blackface]] by white actor [[Walter Long (actor)|Walter Long]].]]

Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a [[freedman]] and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and [[Lynching|lynches]] him.

Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing [[interracial marriage|mixed-race marriages]]. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's [[Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia|Klan regalia]], now considered a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them. An [[intertitle]] states, &quot;The former enemies of North and South are united again in common defense of their [[Aryan]] birthright.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AbO_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=%22The+former+enemies+of+North+and+South+are+united+again+in+defense+of+their+%5B%5BAryan%5D%5D+birthright.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The+former+enemies+of+North+and+South+are+united+again+in+defense+of+their+%5B%5BAryan%5D%5D+birthright.%22&amp;f=false|title=The Long Reconstruction: The Post-Civil War South in History, Film, and Memory|first1=Frank J.|last1=Wetta|first2=Martin A.|last2=Novelli|date=September 11, 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books|isbn=9781136331862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan gathered together, with Ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes and are intimidated into not voting.

The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]]. The penultimate title is: &quot;Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more. But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace.&quot;

==Production==
===1911 version===
There was an [[Incomplete film|uncompleted]], now [[Lost film|lost]], 1911 version, titled ''The Clansman''. It used [[Kinemacolor]] and a new sound process; one reason for this version's failure is the unwillingness of theater owners to purchase the equipment to show it. The director was [[William F. Haddock]], and the producer was George Brennan. Some scenes were filmed on the porches and lawns of [[Homewood Plantation (Natchez, Mississippi)|Homewood Plantation]], in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreland|first1=George M.|title=Rambling in Mississippi|journal=The Memphis Commercial Appeal|date=January 18, 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; One and a half reels were completed.&lt;ref name=Rohauer/&gt;{{rp|330}}

Kinemacolor received a settlement from the producers of ''Birth'' when they proved that they had an earlier right to film the work.&lt;ref name=Rohauer/&gt;{{rp|329}}

The footage was shown to the trade in an attempt to arouse interest. Early movie critic [[Frank E. Woods]] attended; Griffiths always credited Woods with bringing ''The Clansman'' to his attention.&lt;ref name=Rohauer/&gt;{{rp|331}}

===Development===
After the failure of the Kinemacolor project, in which Dixon was willing to invest his own money,&lt;ref name=Rohauer/&gt;{{rp|330}} he began visiting other studios to see if they were interested.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2019}} In late 1913, Dixon met the film producer Harry Aitken, who was interested in making a film out of ''The Clansman''; through Aitken, Dixon met Griffith.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2019}} Like Dixon, Griffith was a [[White Southerners|Southerner]], a fact that Dixon points out;&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;{{rp|295}} Griffith's father served as a [[colonel]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] and, like Dixon, viewed Reconstruction negatively.

Griffith agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1914}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) for the rights to his play ''The Clansman''. Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received [up to 2007] for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The American historian [[John Hope Franklin]] suggested that many aspects of the script for ''The Birth of a Nation'' appeared to reflect Dixon's concerns more than Griffith's, as Dixon had an obsession in his novels of describing in loving detail the lynchings of black men, which did not reflect Griffith's interests.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|422–423}}

===Filming===
[[File:Walthall with DW Griiffith2.jpg|left|thumb|Griffith (left) on the set of ''The Birth of a Nation'' with actor [[Henry B. Walthall|Henry Walthall]] (center) and others]]

Griffith began [[Principal photography|filming]] on July 4, 1914&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=America's film legacy : the authoritative guide to the landmark movies in the National Film Registry|last=Eagan, Daniel.|date=2010|publisher=Continuum|others=National Film Preservation Board (U.S.)|isbn=9781441116475|location=New York|pages=42–44|oclc=676697377}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was finished by October 1914.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|421}} [[D. W. Griffith]] took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor. [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] engineers provided technical advice on the [[American Civil War]] battle scenes, providing Griffith with the artillery used in the film. Much of the filming was done on the [[Griffith Ranch]] in [[San Fernando Valley]], with the Petersburg scenes being shot at what is today [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] and other scenes being shot in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]] and [[Ojai Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Seelye, Katharine Q. &quot;When Hollywood's Big Guns Come Right From the Source&quot;, ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/ListedResources/Detail/716 Cal Parks, Griffith Ranch]&lt;/ref&gt; The film's war scenes were influenced after [[Robert Underwood Johnson]]'s book ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'', ''Harper's Pictorial History of the Civil War'', ''The Soldier in Our Civil War'', and [[Mathew Brady]]'s photography.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; 

Many of the African-Americans in the film were portrayed by white actors in blackface. Griffith initially claimed this was deliberate, stating &quot;“on careful weighing of every detail concerned, the decision was to have no black blood among the principals; it was only in the legislative scene that Negroes were used, and then only as ‘extra people.’&quot; However black extras who had been housed in segregated quarters, including Griffith's acquaintance and frequent collaborator [[Madame Sul-Te-Wan]], can be seen in many other shots of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

Griffith's budget started at US$40,000&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=D.W. Griffith's the Birth of a Nation: A History of &quot;the Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time&quot;|last=Stokes|first=Melvyn|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-533678-8|location=Oxford, UK|pages=105, 122, 124, 178|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1915|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}) but rose to over $100,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall &amp; Neale (2010)&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Sheldon |last2=Neale |first2=Stephen |title=Epics, spectacles, and blockbusters: a Hollywood history |series=Contemporary Approaches to Film and Television |year=2010 |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8143-3697-7 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro0hASPfC68C&amp;pg=PA270&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 270] (note 2.78)|quote=In common with most film historians, he estimates that ''The Birth of Nation'' cost &quot;just a little more than $100,000&quot; to produce...}}&lt;/ref&gt; (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1915|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}).

By the time he finished filming, Griffith shot approximately 150,000 feet of footage (or about 36 hours worth of film), which he edited down to 13,000 feet (just over 3 hours).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The film was edited after early screenings in reaction to audience reception, and existing prints of the film are missing footage from the standard version of the film. Evidence exists that the film originally included scenes of white [[Atlantic slave trade|slave traders]] seizing blacks from [[West Africa]] and detaining them aboard a [[slave ship]], Southern congressmen in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Northerners reacting to the results of the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], the passage of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], a [[Union League]] meeting, depictions of [[Martial law in the United States|martial law]] in South Carolina, and a battle sequence. In addition, several scenes were cut at the insistence of [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[John Purroy Mitchel]] due to their highly racist content before its release in New York City, including a female [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] activist recoiling from the [[body odor]] of a black boy, black men seizing white women on the streets of Piedmont, and deportations of blacks with the title &quot;Lincoln's Solution.&quot; It was also long rumored, including by Griffith's biographer Seymour Stern, that the original film included a [[rape]] scene between Gus and Flora before her suicide, but the cinematographer [[Karl Brown (cinematographer)|Karl Brown]] denied that such a scene had been filmed in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; 

===Score===
[[File:Sheet music for &quot;The Perfect Song&quot; from The Birth of a Nation.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Sheet music for &quot;The Perfect Song&quot;, one of the themes Breil composed for the film.]]
Although ''The Birth of a Nation'' is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman77&quot;&gt;Hickman 2006, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Though film was still silent at the time, it was common practice to distribute musical [[Cue (theatrical)|cue sheets]], or less commonly, [[full score]]s (usually for [[Theatre organ|organ]] or [[piano]] accompaniment) along with each print of a film.&lt;ref&gt;Hickman 2006, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''The Birth of a Nation'', composer [[Joseph Carl Breil]] created a three-hour-long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time: adaptations of existing works by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman77&quot; /&gt; Though it had been specifically composed for the film, Breil's score was not used for the [[Los Angeles]] première of the film at [[Clune's Auditorium]]; rather, a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] showings. Breil's score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the [[Liberty Theatre]] but it was the score featured in all showings save those on the West Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman78&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;marks-1997&quot; /&gt;

Outside of original compositions, Breil adapted classical music for use in the film, including passages from ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], ''[[Leichte Kavallerie]]'' by [[Franz von Suppé]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and &quot;[[Ride of the Valkyries]]&quot; by [[Richard Wagner]], the latter used as a [[leitmotif]] during the ride of the KKK.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman77&quot; /&gt; Breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time, including many Southern melodies; among these songs were &quot;[[Maryland, My Maryland]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR_Dixie_2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Qureshi |first1=Bilal |title=The Anthemic Allure Of 'Dixie,' An Enduring Confederate Monument |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/649954248/the-anthemic-allure-of-dixie-an-enduring-confederate-monument |date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Old Folks at Home]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, &quot;[[America the Beautiful]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]&quot;, &quot;[[Auld Lang Syne]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Where Did You Get That Hat?]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman77&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic |pure_url=yes |class=album |id=mw0000649893 }} |title=Birth of a Nation [Original Soundtrack] |first=Bruce |last=Eder |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=All Media Network, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DJ Spooky]] has called Breil's score, with its mix of [[Dixieland]] songs, classical music and &quot;vernacular heartland music&quot; &quot;an early, pivotal accomplishment in remix culture.&quot; He has also cited Breil's use of music by Richard Wagner as influential on subsequent Hollywood films, including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/05/dj-spooky-is-remixing-birth-of-a-nation/527472/|title=Why Remix The Birth of a Nation?|last=Capps|first=Kriston|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=May 23, 2017|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his original compositions for the film, Breil wrote numerous [[leitmotif]]s to accompany the appearance of specific characters. The principal love theme that was created for the romance between Elsie Stoneman and Ben Cameron was published as &quot;The Perfect Song&quot; and is regarded as the first marketed &quot;theme song&quot; from a film; it was later used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hickman78&quot;&gt;Hickman 2006, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;marks-1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Martin Miller |title= Music and the Silent Film : Contexts and Case Studies, 1895–1924 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-536163-6 |pages=127–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's backers understood that the film needed a massive [[publicity campaign]] if they were to cover the immense cost of producing it. A major part of this campaign was the release of the film in a [[roadshow theatrical release]]. This allowed Griffith to charge premium prices for [[Movie ticket|tickets]], sell souvenirs, and build excitement around the film before giving it a [[wide release]]. For several months, Griffith's team traveled to various cities to show the film for one or two nights before moving on. This strategy was immensely successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

There is dispute about Wilson's attitude toward the movie. A newspaper reported that he &quot;received many letters protesting against his alleged action in Indorsing the pictures {{sic}}&quot;, including a letter from [[Massachusetts]] [[Representative (US)|Representative]] [[Thomas Thacher]] (whose term ended March 15).&lt;ref name=Indorsed/&gt; The showing of the movie had caused &quot;several near-riots&quot;.&lt;ref name=Indorsed/&gt; When [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] [[William H. Lewis]] and A. Walters, a bishop of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], called at the White House &quot;to add their protests&quot;, President Wilson's private secretary, [[Joseph Patrick Tumulty|Joseph Tumulty]], showed them a letter he had written to Thacher on Wilson's behalf. According to the letter, Wilson had been &quot;entirely unaware of the character of the play [movie] before it was presented and has at no time expressed his approbation of it. Its exhibition at the White House was a courtesy extended to an old acquaintance.&quot;&lt;ref name=Indorsed/&gt; Dixon, in his autobiography, quotes Wilson as saying, when Dixon proposed showing the movie at the White House, that &quot;I am pleased to be able to do this little thing for you, because a long time ago you took a day out of your busy life to do something for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;{{rp|298}} What Dixon had done for Wilson was to suggest him for an honorary degree, which Wilson received, from Dixon's ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Wake Forest College]].&lt;ref name=Benbow/&gt;{{rp|512}}
[[File:Wilson-quote-in-birth-of-a-nation.jpg|thumb|A quote from Woodrow Wilson's ''History of the American People'' is included in the film's [[intertitle]]s.]]
Dixon had been a fellow graduate student in history with Wilson at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and, in 1913, dedicated his historical novel about Lincoln, ''The Southerner'', to &quot;our first Southern-born president since Lincoln, my friend and collegemate Woodrow Wilson&quot;.

The evidence that Wilson knew &quot;the character of the play&quot; in advance of seeing it is circumstantial but very strong: &quot;Given Dixon's career and the notoriety attached to the play ''The Clansman'', it is not unreasonable to assume that Wilson must have had some idea of at least the general tenor of the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=Benbow/&gt;{{rp|513}} The movie was based on a best-selling novel and was preceded by a stage version (play) which was received with protests in several cities — in some cities it was prohibited — and received a great deal of news coverage. Wilson issued no protest when the ''[[Washington Evening Star|Evening Star]]'', at that time Washington's &quot;newspaper of record&quot;, reported in advance of the showing, in language suggesting a press release from Dixon and Griffiths, that Dixon was &quot;a schoolmate of President Wilson and is an intimate friend&quot;, and that Wilson's interest in it &quot;is due to the great lesson of peace it teaches&quot;.&lt;ref name=President/&gt; Wilson, and only Wilson, is quoted by name in the movie for his observations on American history, and the title of Wilson's book (''History of the American People'') is mentioned as well.&lt;ref name=Benbow/&gt;{{rp|518–519}} The three [[title card]]s with quotations from Wilson's book read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Adventurers swarmed out of the North, as much the enemies of one race as of the other, to cozen, beguile and use the negroes.... [Ellipsis in the original.] In the villages the negroes were the office holders, men who knew none of the uses of authority, except its insolences.&quot;

&quot;....The policy of the congressional leaders wrought…a veritable overthrow of civilization in the South.....in their determination to &lt;u&gt;'put the white South under the heel of the black South.'&quot;&lt;/u&gt; [Ellipses and underscore in the original.]

&quot;The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation.....until at last there had sprung into existence a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the southern country.&quot; [Ellipsis in the original.]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same book, Wilson has harsh words about the abyss between the original goals of the Klan and what it evolved into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Showing in the Raleigh Hotel ballroom====
The next day, February 19, 1915, Griffiths and Dixon held a showing of the film in the [[Raleigh Hotel (Washington D.C.)|Raleigh Hotel]] ballroom, which they had hired for the occasion. Early that morning, Dixon called on a North Carolina friend, the white supremacist [[Josephus Daniels]], [[Secretary of the Navy]]. Daniels set up a meeting that morning for Dixon with [[Edward Douglass White]], [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]]. Initially Justice White was not interested in seeing the film, but when Dixon told him it was the &quot;true story&quot; of Reconstruction and the Klan's role in &quot;saving the South&quot;, White, recalling his youth in Louisiana, jumped to attention and said: &quot;I was a member of the Klan, sir&quot;.&lt;ref name=Cook1968&gt;{{cite book

====Consequences====
In Griffith's words, the showings to the president and the entire Supreme Court conferred an &quot;honor&quot; upon ''Birth of a Nation''.&lt;ref name=Benbow/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2019}} Dixon and Griffiths used this commercially.

The following day, Griffiths and Dixon transported the film to New York City for review by the [[National Board of Censorship]]. They presented the film as &quot;endorsed&quot; by the President and the cream of Washington society. The Board approved the film by 15 to 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Justice White was very angry when advertising for the film stated that he approved it, and he threatened to denounce it publicly.&lt;ref name=Benbow/&gt;{{rp|519}}

Dixon clearly was rattled and upset by criticism by African Americans that the movie encouraged hatred against them, and he wanted the endorsement of as many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2019}} Dixon always vehemently denied having anti-black prejudices—despite the way his books promoted white supremacy—and stated: &quot;My books are hard reading for a Negro, and yet the Negroes, in denouncing them, are unwittingly denouncing one of their greatest friends&quot;.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|424}}

In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, Wilson's secretary, Dixon wrote: &quot;The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!&quot;&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|430}} In a letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: &quot;This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters.

===New opening titles on re-release===
One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schickel (1984). ''D. W. Griffith: An American Life''. New York: Limelight Editions, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints).&lt;ref&gt;This includes the one at the Internet Movie Archive [https://archive.org/details/dw_griffith_birth_of_a_nation] and the Google video copy [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5639233838609252948#]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813174157/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5639233838609252948|date=August 13, 2010}} and Veoh [http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/entertainment/watch/v1640308YD8z9qcp Watch Videos Online | The Birth of a Nation | Veoh.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609173838/http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/entertainment/watch/v1640308YD8z9qcp|date=June 9, 2010}}. However, of multiple YouTube copies one which has the full opening titles is {{YouTube|vPxRIF1c2fI|DW GRIFFITH THE BIRTH OF A NATION PART 1 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE:

We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe [[Bible|the Bible]] and the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that &quot;Griffith's greatest achievement in ''The Birth of a Nation'' was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated, but comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modernism, Ireland and the erotics of memory |last=Miller |first= Nicholas Andrew |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-81583-3|page=226  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, S.

Kittrell |year=2007 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-440-8|page=307 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith &quot;masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression&quot; and creates film which &quot;erodes the very ideal&quot; of liberty which he asserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Realism and the birth of the modern United States:cinema, literature, and culture |last=Corkin |first=Stanley |year=1996  |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0-8203-1730-4|pages=144–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary reception==
===Press reaction===
[[The New York Times|''The New York Times'']] gave it a quite brief review, calling it &quot;melodramatic&quot; and &quot;inflamatory&quot;, adding that: &quot;A great deal might be said concerning the spirit revealed in Mr. Dixon's review of the unhappy chapter of Reconstruction and concerning the sorry service rendered by its plucking at old wounds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEwan |first=Paul |title=The Birth of a Nation |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2015 |page=16 |isbn=978-1844576593 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-R9dDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22A+great+deal+might+be+said+concerning+the+spirit+revealed%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20great%20deal%20might%20be%20said%20concerning%20the%20spirit%20revealed%22&amp;f=false |via=GoogleBooks |accessdate=June 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film played at the [[Liberty Theater]] at [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]] for 44 weeks with tickets priced at $2.20 ({{Inflation|US|2.20|1915|fmt=eq}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;THR&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | url = http://m.hollywoodreporter.com/entry/view/id/909518 | title = 'The Birth of a Nation' at 100: &quot;Important, Innovative and Despicable&quot; (Guest Column) | author = Thomas Doherty | magazine = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = February 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1917, Epoch reported to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schickel_281&quot; /&gt; and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wasko&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wasko |first=Janet |chapter=D.W.

The film held the mantle of the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until it was overtaken by ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), another film about the Civil War and Reconstruction era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Finler |first=Joel Waldo |year=2003 |title=The Hollywood Story |publisher=Wallflower Press |isbn=978-1-903364-66-6 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rvVhEJmbfrsC&amp;pg=PA47 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kindem, Gorham Anders| title =The international movie industry | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Zg-1VxIZKAwCr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1940 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine estimated the film's cumulative [[gross rental]] (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Show Business: Record Wind |date=February 19, 1940 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763541,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202110029/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763541,00.html |archivedate=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schickel_281&quot; /&gt; It is not known for sure how much the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wasko&quot; /&gt; It is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monaco&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Monaco |first=James |title=How to Read a Film:Movies, Media, and Beyond |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-975579-0 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bgbOsjnppAcC&amp;pg=PA262 262] |quote=The Birth of a Nation, costing an unprecedented and, many believed, thoroughly foolhardy $110,000, eventually returned $20 million and more.

===Criticism===
Like Dixon's novels and play, ''Birth of a Nation'' received considerable criticism, both before and after its premiere. Dixon, who believed it entirely truthful, attributed this to &quot;Sectionalists&quot;, i.e. non-Southerners who in Dixon's opinion were hostile to the truth about the South.&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;{{rp|301, 303}} It was to counter these &quot;sinister forces&quot; and the &quot;dangerous...menace&quot; that Dixon and Griffiths sought &quot;the backing&quot; of President Wilson and the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=Southern/&gt;{{rp|296}}

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) protested at premieres of the film in numerous cities. According to the historian David Copeland, &quot;by the time of the movie's March 3 [1915] premiere in New York City, its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism, protests, and calls for [[censorship]], which began after the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP requested the city's film board ban the movie. Since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites, few review boards initially banned Griffith's picture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, David (2010). ''The Media's Role in Defining the Nation: The Active Voice''. Peter Lang Publisher. p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The NAACP also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119213141/http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/|url-status=dead|title=NAACP – Timeline|archivedate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the lack of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP secretary [[Mary Childs Nerney]] wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: &quot;I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to ''The Birth of a Nation'' ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;historymatters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nerney|first1=Mary Childs|title=An NAACP Official Calls for Censorship of The Birth of a Nation|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4966/|website=History Matters|accessdate=May 9, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524132722/http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4966|archivedate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WMTrotter1915.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper editor and activist [[William Monroe Trotter]] led a demonstration against the film, which resulted in a [[List of ethnic riots|riot]].]]
[[Jane Addams]], an American social worker and social reformer, and the founder of [[Hull House]], voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the ''[[New York Post]]'' on March 13, 1915, just ten days after the film was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes_432&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that &quot;One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to-day. Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokes_432&quot; /&gt; In New York, Rabbi [[Stephen Samuel Wise]] told the press after seeing ''The Birth of a Nation'' that the film was &quot;an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings&quot;.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|426}} In Boston, [[Booker T. Washington]] wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film,&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|426}} while the civil rights activist [[William Monroe Trotter]] organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicted was going to worsen race relations. On Saturday, April 10, and again on April 17, Trotter and a group of other blacks tried to buy tickets for the show's premiere at the Tremont Theater and were refused. They stormed the box office in protest, 260 police on standby rushed in, and a general melee ensued. Trotter and ten others were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Race Riot at Theater|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=April 18, 1915|page=2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/30109816/protests_at_birth_of_a_nation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day a huge demonstration was staged at [[Faneuil Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NAACP&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2016/10/05/when-birth-nation-sparked-riot-boston/bN9S0ltko6QyRIQiJcr9KJ/story.html|title=When 'Birth of a Nation' sparked a riot in Boston|last=Lehr|first=Dick|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Washington D.C, the Reverend [[Francis James Grimké]] published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Fighting a Vicious Film&quot; that challenged the historical accuracy of ''The Birth of a Nation'' on a scene-by-scene basis.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|427}} When the film was released, riots also broke out in [[Philadelphia]] and other major cities in the United States. The film's inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. On April 24, 1916, the ''[[Chicago American]]'' reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]], after seeing the film, although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen ''The Birth of a Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;Gallen, Ira H. &amp; Stern Seymour.

(2001). ''Fire and Desire: Mixed-Race Movies in the Silent Era''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when the film was screened in Boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reel Politics, American Political Movies from Birth of a Nation to Platoon|last = Christensen|first = Terry|publisher = Basil Blackwell Inc.|year = 1987|isbn = 978-0-631-15844-8|location = New York|pages = [https://archive.org/details/reelpoliticsamer00chri/page/19 19]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/reelpoliticsamer00chri/page/19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sherwin Lewis of ''The New York Globe'' wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few &quot;dirty dollars&quot;, Griffith responded that &quot;the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it&quot;.

The Reverend [[Charles Henry Parkhurst]] defended the film against the charge of racism by saying that it &quot;was exactly true to history&quot; by depicting freedmen as they were and, therefore, it was a &quot;compliment to the black man&quot; by showing how far black people had &quot;advanced&quot; since Reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rylance&quot;&gt;Rylance, David &quot;Breech Birth: The Receptions To D.W.

==Current reception==
===Critical response===
[[File:Roger Ebert cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roger Ebert]] deemed ''The Birth of a Nation'' &quot;a great film that argues for evil.&quot;]]
Released in 1915, ''The Birth of a Nation'' has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. According to the film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]], the film was &quot;astounding in its time&quot; and initiated &quot;so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, Kevin (1968). ''The Parade's Gone By...''. University of California Press. p. 78. {{ISBN|0520030680}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatant racism. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certainly ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old [[minstrel show]] or a vile comic pamphlet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Birth of a Nation (1915)|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-birth-of-a-nation-1915|work=[[RogerEbert.com]]|accessdate=August 5, 2019|date=March 30, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224005516/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20030330%2FREVIEWS08%2F303300301%2F1023|archivedate=February 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics, with Ebert mentioning its use as a historical tool: &quot;''The Birth of a Nation'' is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like [[Leni Riefenstahl|Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;

According to a 2002 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/316.html Hartford-HWP.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234509/http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/316.html |date=February 1, 2017 }}, A Painful Present as Historians Confront a Nation's Bloody Past.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History.com]] similarly states that &quot;There is no doubt that ''Birth of a Nation'' played no small part in winning wide public acceptance&quot; for the KKK, and that throughout the film &quot;African Americans are portrayed as brutish, lazy, morally degenerate, and dangerous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/birth-of-a-nation-opens|title=Birth of A Nation Opens|website=history.com|publisher=A+E Networks|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129021913/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/birth-of-a-nation-opens|archivedate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Duke]] used the film to recruit Klansmen in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/02/08/383279630/100-years-later-whats-the-legacy-of-birth-of-a-nation|title=100 Years Later, What's The Legacy Of 'Birth Of A Nation'?|website=[[NPR]]|date=February 8, 2015|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the American critic [[Richard Brody]] wrote ''The Birth of a Nation'' was :

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a seminal commercial spectacle but also a decisively original work of art—in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality. It's tempting to think of the film's influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it's even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie's fabricated events shouldn't lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn't lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of ''Birth of a Nation'', even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about ''The Birth of a Nation'' is how good it is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it's that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment—together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel past mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home-maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. Likewise, Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Bull Run]] by dancing around the &quot;eerie flare of a bonfire&quot; which imply &quot;a dance of death&quot;, foreshadowing the destruction of [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's March]] that was to come. In the same way, Brody wrote that the scene where the Klan dumps Gus's body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene &quot;obscene and horrifying&quot;. Finally, Brody argued that the end of the film, where the Klan prevents defenseless African-Americans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them, today seems &quot;unjust and cruel&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;

In an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', film critic [[Ty Burr]] deemed ''The Birth of a Nation'' the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/what-was-the-most-influential-film-in-history/513863/|title=What Was the Most Influential Film in History?|website=[[The Atlantic]]|date=March 2017|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Corliss of ''Time'' wrote that Griffith &quot;established in the hundreds of one- and two-reelers he directed a cinematic textbook, a fully formed visual language, for the generations that followed. More than anyone else—more than all others combined—he invented the film art. He brought it to fruition in ''The Birth of a Nation''.&quot; Corliss praised the film's &quot;brilliant storytelling technique&quot; and noted that &quot;''The Birth of a Nation'' is nearly as antiwar as it is antiblack. The Civil War scenes, which consume only 30 minutes of the extravaganza, emphasize not the national glory but the human cost of combat. ... Griffith may have been a racist politically, but his refusal to find uplift in the South's war against the Union—and, implicitly, in any war at all—reveals him as a cinematic humanist.&quot;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3729807/d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation-10/|title=D.W.

===Accolades===
In 1992, the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].  The [[American Film Institute]] recognized the film by ranking it #44 within the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list in 1998.

===Historical portrayal===
The film remains controversial due to its interpretation of American history. [[University of Houston]] historian [[Steven Mintz]] summarizes its message as follows: &quot;[[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was an unmitigated disaster, blacks could never be [[racial integration|integrated]] into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Mintz|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm|title= Slavery in film: The Birth of a Nation (1915)|website=Digital History|accessdate=November 18, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212055821/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm|archive-date=December 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The South is portrayed as a victim. The first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which Abraham Lincoln signs the call for the first 75,000 volunteers. However, the first aggression in the Civil War, made when the Confederate troops fired on [[Fort Sumter]] in 1861, is not mentioned in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the postwar South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and [[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called [[Dunning School]] of historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|pp=190–91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is slightly less extreme than the books upon which it is based, in which Dixon misrepresented Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, storming into weddings to rape white women with impunity.&lt;ref name=dixon&gt;{{cite web| last = Leiter| first = Andrew| title = Thomas Dixon, Jr.: Conflicts in History and Literature| publisher = Documenting the American South| date = 2004| url = http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/dixon_intro.html| accessdate = July 21, 2017| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170228142801/http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/dixon_intro.html| archivedate = February 28, 2017| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film portrayed President [[Abraham Lincoln]] as a friend of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and refers to him as &quot;the Great Heart&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=188}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two romances depicted in the film, Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman, reflect Griffith's retelling of history. The couples are used as a metaphor, representing the film's broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the North and South to defend white supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmracepolitics.weebly.com/blog|title=The Birth of a Nation: The Significance of Love, Romance, and Sexuality|date=March 6, 2015|publisher=Weebly|accessdate=August 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208165535/http://filmracepolitics.weebly.com/blog|archivedate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among both couples, there is an attraction that forms before the war, stemming from the friendship between their families.  With the war, however, both families are split apart, and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy.  One of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity: &quot;The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol8No2/SalterBirth.htm|title=The Birth of a Nation as American Myth|first=Richard C.|last=Salter|website=The Journal of Religion and Film|series=Vol. 8, No. 2|date=October 2004|accessdate=August 22, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622205145/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol8No2/SalterBirth.htm|archivedate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film further reinforced the popular belief held by whites, especially in the South, of Reconstruction as a disaster. In his 1929 book ''The Tragic Era: The Revolution After Lincoln'', the respected historian [[Claude Bowers]] treated ''The Birth of a Nation'' as a factually accurate account of Reconstruction.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|432}} In ''The Tragic Era'', Bowers presented every black politician in the South as corrupt, portrayed Republican Representative [[Thaddeus Stevens]] as a vicious &quot;[[race traitor]]&quot; intent upon making blacks the equal of whites, and praised the Klan for &quot;saving civilization&quot; in the South.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|432}} Bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worst sort of &quot;scum&quot; from the North like Stevens &quot;inflamed the Negro's egoism and soon the lustful assaults began. Rape was the foul daughter of Reconstruction!&quot;&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|432}}

===Academic assessment===
The American historian [[John Hope Franklin]] wrote that not only did Claude Bowers treat ''The Birth of a Nation'' as accurate history, but his version of history seemed to be drawn from ''The Birth of a Nation''.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|432}} Some historians, such as [[E. Merton Coulter]] in his ''The South Under Reconstruction'' (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many white Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens. Coulter in ''The South During Reconstruction'', which again treated ''The Birth of a Nation'' as historically correct and painted a vivid picture of &quot;black beasts&quot; running amok, encouraged by alcohol-sodden, corrupt and vengeful black Republican politicians.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|432}} Franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist [[Alistair Cooke]] in his books and TV shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by ''The Birth of a Nation'', noting that Cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in Reconstruction while having almost nothing to say about the suffering of blacks or about how blacks were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877.&lt;ref name=Franklin/&gt;{{rp|432}}

[[File:Thaddeus Stevens - Brady-Handy-crop.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The character of Congressman Stoneman in the film is similar to [[Thaddeus Stevens]] (''pictured'').]]
Veteran film reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in ''Intolerance'' (1916), which criticized prejudice. And in ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' he told perhaps the first [[Miscegenation|interracial love]] story in the movies—even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000123/REVIEWS08/1230301/1023|title=Great Movies: 'Broken Blossoms'|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=January 23, 2000|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|accessdate=July 3, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004011203/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20000123%2FREVIEWS08%2F1230301%2F1023|archivedate=October 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and Rep. Thaddeus Stevens of [[Pennsylvania]], Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1868. However, Stevens' biracial housekeeper, [[Lydia Hamilton Smith]], was considered his common-law wife, and was generously provided for in his will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Egnal]], ''Clash of Extremes'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, Abraham Lincoln is portrayed in a positive light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards Southern whites. The president's views are opposite those of Austin Stoneman, a character presented in a negative light, who acts as an antagonist. The assassination of Lincoln marks the transition from war to Reconstruction, each of which periods has one of the two &quot;acts&quot; of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boothiebarn.com/2013/06/15/the-assassination-in-the-birth-of-a-nation/|title=The Assassination in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;|last=BoothieBarn|date=June 15, 2013|website=BoothieBarn|access-date=June 22, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715103923/https://boothiebarn.com/2013/06/15/the-assassination-in-the-birth-of-a-nation/|archivedate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/reel_new/films/list/0_68_9_123|title=Reel American History – Films – List|last=University|first=Library and Technology Services, Lehigh|website=digital.lib.lehigh.edu|access-date=June 22, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015004629/http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/reel_new/films/list/0_68_9_123|archivedate=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin wrote the film's depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite journal

The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan continued activities as small groups of &quot;night riders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;West, Jerry Lee. ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865–1877'' (2002) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[civil rights movement]] and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar [[Eric Foner]], who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on [[Black Reconstruction in America|W. E. B. DuBois' work]] but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African-American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of [[suffrage]] to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War''. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, 2006, p. 150-154&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film innovations===
In his review of ''The Birth of a Nation'' in ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]'', Jonathan Kline writes that &quot;with countless artistic innovations, Griffith essentially created contemporary film language ... virtually every film is beholden to [''The Birth of a Nation''] in one way, shape or form. Griffith introduced the use of dramatic close-ups, tracking shots, and other expressive camera movements; parallel action sequences, crosscutting, and other editing techniques&quot;. He added that &quot;the fact that ''The Birth of a Nation'' remains respected and studied to this day-despite its subject matter-reveals its lasting importance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die | editor1-first= Steven Jay | editor1-last= Schneider| year= 2014 | edition= 7th |publisher= [[Barron's Educational Series]] |location=Hauppauge, New York |isbn= 978-1844037339 |page= 24 |oclc= 796279948| series= [[Quintessence Editions]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; ''The Birth of a Nation'' also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Home media and restorations===
[[File:Birth of a Nation (1915).webm|thumb|''The Birth of a Nation'' (full film)]]
For many years, ''The Birth of a Nation'' was poorly represented in home media and restorations.  This stemmed from several factors, one of which was the fact that Griffith and others had frequently reworked the film, leaving no definitive version.  According to the silent film website ''Brenton Film'', many home media releases of the film consisted of &quot;poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in ''definitely unoriginal'' black and white&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenton Film&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/the-birth-of-a-nation-controversial-classic-gets-a-definitive-new-restoration |title=The Birth of a Nation: Controversial Classic Gets a Definitive New Restoration |work=Brenton Film |accessdate=February 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225184025/http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/the-birth-of-a-nation-controversial-classic-gets-a-definitive-new-restoration |archivedate=February 25, 2016 |date=February 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest high-quality home versions was film preservationist [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]]'s 1992 transfer of a [[16 mm film|16mm]] print for [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] release via [[Image Entertainment]]. A short documentary, ''The Making of The Birth of a Nation'', newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on [[DVD]] by Image in 1998 and the [[United Kingdom]]'s Eureka Entertainment in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenton Film&quot; /&gt;

In the UK, [[Photoplay Productions]] restored the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s [[35mm movie film|35mm]] print that was the source of Shepard's 16&amp;nbsp;mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the [[British Film Institute]]. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score. Though broadcast on [[Channel 4]] television and theatrically screened many times, Photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenton Film&quot; /&gt;

Shepard's transfer and documentary were reissued in the US by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Video]] in 2002, this time in a 2-DVD set with added extras on the second disc. These included several Civil War shorts also directed by D. W. Griffith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenton Film&quot; /&gt; In 2011, Kino prepared a HD transfer of a 35&amp;nbsp;mm negative from the Paul Killiam Collection. They added some material from the [[Library of Congress]] and gave it a new compilation score. This version was released on [[Blu-ray]] by Kino in the US, Eureka in the UK (as part of their &quot;[[Masters of Cinema]]&quot; collection) and Divisa Home Video in Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenton Film&quot; /&gt;

In 2015, the year of the film's centenary, [[Photoplay Productions]]' [[Patrick Stanbury]], in conjunction with the [[British Film Institute]], carried out the first full restoration. It mostly used new [[4K resolution|4K]] scans of the LoC's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. It, too, was given the original Breil score and featured the film's original tinting for the first time since its 1915 release. The restoration was released on a 2-Blu-ray set by the BFI, alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored Civil War-related films from the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brenton Film&quot; /&gt;

===In popular culture===
* ''The Birth of a Nation''{{'s}} reverent depiction of the Klan was lampooned in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name=mel/&gt;
* [[Ryan O'Neal]]'s character Leo Harrigan in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[Nickelodeon (film)|Nickelodeon]]'' (1976) attends the premiere of ''The Birth of a Nation'' and realizes that it will change the course of American cinema.&lt;ref name=mel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/07/why-birth-of-a-nation-is-still-the-most-controversial-movie-ever/|title=Why 'Birth of a Nation' is still the most racist movie ever|first=Lou|last=Lumenick|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=February 7, 2015|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clips from Griffith's film are shown in
**[[Robert Zemeckis]]' ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994), where the footage is meant to portray the [[Forrest Gump (character)|titular character]]'s ancestor and namesake [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2011/02/17/barbour_birth_nation/|title=Still lying about history|first1=Nancy|last1=Isenberg|first2=Andrew|last2=Burnstein|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Lee's ''[[BlacKkKlansman]]'' (2018), where [[Harry Belafonte]]'s character Jerome Turner speaks about its role in the [[lynching of Jesse Washington]] as the modern Ku Kluk Klan lead by [[Grand Wizard]] [[David Duke]] ([[Topher Grace]]) screens it as propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/review-blackkklansman-spike-lee-david-edelstein/|title=Review: Spike Lee's provocative &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;|first1=David|last1=Edelstein|website=[[CBS News]]|date=August 11, 2018|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Director [[Kevin Willmott]]'s  [[mockumentary]] ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'' (2004) portrays an imagined history where the Confederacy won the Civil War. It shows part of an imagined Griffith film, ''The Capture of Dishonest Abe'', which resembles ''The Birth of a Nation'' and was supposedly adapted from Thomas Dixon's ''The Yankee''.&lt;ref name=Brody&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/c-s-a-the-confederate-states-of-america-a-faux-documentary-that-skewers-real-white-supremacy|title=&quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America,&quot; a Faux Documentary Skewers Real White Supremacy|first=Richard|last=Brody|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=February 15, 2017|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In [[Justin Simien]]'s ''[[Dear White People]]'' (2014), Sam ([[Tessa Thompson]]) screens a short film called ''The Rebirth of a Nation'' which portrays white people wearing [[Whiteface (performance)|whiteface]] while criticizing [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; 
* In 2016, [[Nate Parker]] produced and directed the film ''[[The Birth of a Nation (2016 film)|The Birth of a Nation]]'', based on [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]]; Parker clarified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://filmmakermagazine.com/97103-five-questions-with-the-birth-of-a-nation-director-nate-parker/#.VsC1bvmLTIU|title = Five Questions with the Birth of a Nation director Nate Parkr|date = 25 January 2016|website = Filmmaker magazine|last = Rezayazdi|first = Soheil|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160128054154/http://filmmakermagazine.com/97103-five-questions-with-the-birth-of-a-nation-director-nate-parker/#.VsC1bvmLTIU|archivedate = January 28, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Dinesh D'Souza]]'s 2016 [[political documentary]] ''[[Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party]]'' depicts President Wilson and his cabinet viewing ''The Birth of a Nation'' in the White House before a Klansman comes out of the screen and into the real world. The film is meant to accuse the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American political left]] in general of covering up its past support of white supremacy and continuing it through [[Social programs in the United States|welfare policies]] and [[Political machine|machine politics]].&lt;ref name=av&gt;{{cite web |work= [[The A.V.

* The title of D'Souza's 2018 film ''[[Death of a Nation (2018 film)|The Death of a Nation]]'' is a reference to Griffith's film, and like his previous film is meant to accuse the Democratic Party and the American left-wing of racism.&lt;ref name=av/&gt;

===Negative reaction===
* In 2019, [[Bowling Green State University]] renamed its Gish Film Theater, named for actress Lilian Gish, after protests alleging that using her name is inappropriate, because of her role in ''Birth of a Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
