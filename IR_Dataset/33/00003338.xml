'''The Bronx''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɹ|ɒ|ŋ|k|s}}) is a [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[New York City]], coterminous with '''Bronx County''', in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], the third-most densely populated [[Administrative divisions of New York (state)#County|county]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;density&quot; /&gt; It is south of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]; northeast and east of [[Manhattan]], across the [[Harlem River]]; and north of [[Queens]], across the [[East River]]. The Bronx has a land area of {{convert|42|sqmi|km2|0}} and a population of 1,432,132 in 2018.&lt;ref name=BronxQuickFacts/&gt; Of the five boroughs, it has the fourth-largest area, fourth-highest population, and third-highest [[population density]].&lt;ref name=&quot;density&quot;&gt;New York State Department of Health, [http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2010/table02.htm ''Population, Land Area, and Population Density by County, New York State – 2010''], retrieved on August 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the only borough predominantly on the [[Contiguous United States|U.S. mainland]]. If each borough were ranked as a city, the Bronx would rank as the [[List of United States cities by population|eighth-most populous in the U.S.]] 

The Bronx is divided by the [[Bronx River]] into a hillier section in the [[West Bronx|west]], and a flatter [[East Bronx|eastern]] section. East and west street names are divided by [[Jerome Avenue]]. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultan&quot; /&gt; Bronx County was separated from New York County in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtstart&quot;&gt;On the start of business for Bronx County: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/01/03/100295000.pdf Bronx County In Motion.

:&quot;Despite the fact that the new Bronx County Court House is not completed there was no delay yesterday in getting the court machinery in motion. All the new county officials were on hand and the County Clerk, the District Attorney, the Surrogate, and the County Judge soon had things in working order. The seal to be used by the new county was selected by County Judge Louis D. Gibbs. It is circular. In the center is a seated figure of Justice. To her right is an American shield and over the figure is written 'Populi Suprema.' ...&quot;
:&quot;Surrogate George M. S. Schulz, with his office force, was busy at the stroke of 9 o'clock. Two wills were filed in the early morning, but owing to the absence of a safe they were recorded and then returned to the attorneys for safe keeping. ...&quot;
:&quot;There was a rush of business to the new County Clerk's office. Between seventy-five and a hundred men applied for first naturalization papers. Two certificates of incorporation were issued, and seventeen judgments, seven lis pendens, three mechanics' liens and one suit for negligence were filed.&quot;
:&quot;Sheriff O'Brien announced several additional appointments.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; About a quarter of the Bronx's area is open space,&lt;ref name=&quot;blooming&quot;/&gt; including [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]], [[Van Cortlandt Park]], [[Pelham Bay Park]], the [[New York Botanical Garden]], and the [[Bronx Zoo]] in the borough's north and center. These open spaces are situated primarily on land deliberately reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north and east from Manhattan.

The name Bronx originated with Swedish-born [[Jonas Bronck]], who established the first settlement in the area as part of the [[New Netherland]] colony in 1639.&lt;ref name=Faroeislands&gt;{{cite book |last= Wylie |first= Jonathon |title= The Faroe Islands: Interpretations of History |publisher= University of Kentucky Press |year= 1987 |page= 209 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=7kmEYtkttx4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780813115788#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn= 978-0-8131-1578-8 |quote= Jónas Bronck (or Brunck) was the son of Morten Jespersen Bronck ...

The Bronx is referred to with the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] as &quot;The Bronx&quot;, both legally&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://24.97.137.100/nyc/AdCode/Title2_2-202.asp New York City Administrative Code §2–202] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010445/http://24.97.137.100/nyc/AdCode/Title2_2-202.asp |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and colloquially.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.bce0fff116ccd007a62fa24601c789a0/ references on the New York City website]&lt;/ref&gt; The County of Bronx does not place &quot;The&quot; immediately before &quot;Bronx&quot; in formal references, unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx, nor does the [[United States Postal Service]] in its database of Bronx addresses (the city and state mailing-address format is simply &quot;Bronx, NY&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp |title=ZIP Code Lookup |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |quote=Note that the database also does not use punctuation, and other articles (such as ''the'') to improve automated scanning of addresses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region was apparently named after the [[Bronx River]] and first appeared in the &quot;Annexed District of The Bronx&quot; created in 1874 out of part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. It was continued in the &quot;Borough of The Bronx&quot;, which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898. The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Erin [http://www.ny1.com/nyc/bronx/news/2015/06/7/what-s-in-a-name--how--the--bronx-got-the--the-.html &quot;What's in a Name: How 'The' Bronx Got the 'The'&quot;], ''NY1'', June 7, 2015, Retrieved on February 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hess, &quot;From The Hague to the Bronx: Definite Articles in Place Names&quot;, ''Journal of the North Central Name Society'', Fall 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; A time-worn story explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough's name stems from the phrase &quot;visiting the Broncks&quot;, referring to the settler's family.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. David J. Born (who asserts it was a Jakob Bronck and his family who settled there), letter to [[William F.

The capitalization of the borough's name is sometimes disputed. Generally, the definite article is lowercase in place names (&quot;the Bronx&quot;) except in official references. The definite article is capitalized (&quot;The Bronx&quot;) at the beginning of a sentence or in any other situation when a normally lowercase word would be capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/pdf/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-5.pdf|title=3.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of the Bronx}}
European colonization of the Bronx began in 1639. The Bronx was originally part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], but it was ceded to [[Manhattan|New York County]] in two major parts ([[West Bronx]], 1874 and [[East Bronx]], 1895) before it became Bronx County. Originally, the area was part of the [[Lenape]]'s [[Lenapehoking]] territory inhabited by [[Siwanoy]] of the [[Wappinger]] Confederacy. Over time, European colonists converted the borough into farmlands.

===Before 1914===
{{See also|List of former municipalities in New York City}}
The development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between [[New England]] and New York ([[Manhattan]]). Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule. The King's Bridge, built in 1693 where [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] reached the [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]], was a possession of [[Frederick Philipse]], lord of [[Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site|Philipse Manor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CrotonHarlemFSEIS-7-12&quot;/&gt; The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek, and in 1759, Jacobus Dyckman and [[Benjamin Palmer]] led them in building a free bridge across the Harlem River.&lt;ref name=Fordam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/medny/ganelli2.html |title=Dyckman House – History |work=fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the King's Bridge toll was abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins1912&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen Jenkins |title=The Story of the Bronx from the Purchase Made by the Dutch from the Indians in 1639 to the Present Day |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9nIC6Lva5sC&amp;pg=PA177 |accessdate=January 2, 2017 |year=1912 |publisher=[[G.

The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], one of the 12 original counties of the English [[Province of New York]]. The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns in [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]], [[Eastchester (town), New York|Eastchester]], and [[Pelham, New York|Pelham]]. In 1846, a new town was created by division of Westchester, called West Farms. The town of [[Morrisania, Bronx|Morrisania]] was created, in turn, from West Farms in 1855. In 1873, the town of [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] was established within the former borders of Yonkers, roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge, [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], and [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]].

Among famous settlers in the Bronx during the 19th and early 20th centuries were author [[Willa Cather]], tobacco merchant [[Pierre Lorillard IV|Pierre Lorillard]], and inventor [[Jordan L. Mott]], who established [[Mott Haven]] to house the workers at his iron works.&lt;ref&gt;For Jordan L. Mott:

The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages. In 1873, the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge, West Farms, and Morrisania to New York, effective in 1874; the three towns were soon abolished in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;thorne&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thorne, Kathryn Ford|editor=Long, John H.|title=New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1993 |pages=33, 118–133 &lt;!-- &quot;P. 033&quot; was cited in error? --&gt; |isbn=0-13-051962-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York. ''Laws of New York''. 1873, 96th Session, Chapter 613, Section 1. p. 928.&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole territory east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895, three years before New York's consolidation with [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]. This included the Town of Westchester (which had voted against consolidation in 1894) and portions of Eastchester and Pelham.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thorne&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Articles on &quot;consolidation&quot; (by David C.

Accessed July 17, 2008. &quot;But the Harlem riverfront was industrializing, and in 1874 the city annexed the area west of the Bronx River: Morrisania, West Farms and Kingsbridge. A second annexation in 1894 gathered in Westchester and portions of Eastchester and Pelham.&quot; However, 1894 must refer to the referendum, since the enabling act was not passed or signed until 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; The nautical community of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]]&lt;!---what on earth is a &quot;nautical community&quot;??---&gt; voted to join the city in 1896.

On January 1, 1898, the consolidated [[City of Greater New York|City of New York]] was born, including the Bronx as one of the five distinct [[Borough (New York City)|boroughs]] (at the same time, the Bronx's territory moved from Westchester County into [[New York County]], which already contained Manhattan and the rest of pre-1874 New York City).

On April 19, 1912, those parts of New York County which had been annexed from Westchester County in the past decades were newly constituted as Bronx County, the 62nd and last county to be created by the state, effective in 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;thorne&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York. ''Laws of New York''. 1912, 135th Session, Chapter 548, Section 1. p. 1352.&lt;/ref&gt; Bronx County's courts opened for business on January 2, 1914 (the same day that [[John P. Mitchel]] started work as [[Mayor of New York City]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;courtstart&quot; /&gt; [[Marble Hill, Manhattan]] was now connected to the Bronx, but it did not become part of that county by a historical accident due to changes in waterways.

===After 1914===
The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods: a boom period during 1900–29, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The [[Great Depression]] and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline. The mid to late century were hard times, as the Bronx declined during 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty. The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olmsted 1989; Olmsted 1998&quot;/&gt;

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 2004, reference #04001027.]]

The Bronx was a mostly rural area for many generations, small farms supplying the city markets, but it grew into a railroad suburb in the late 19th century. Faster transportation enabled rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to Manhattan in 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olmsted 1989; Olmsted 1998&quot;&gt;Olmsted (1989); Olmsted (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Bronx was a manufacturing center for many years and was noted as a center of [[piano]] manufacturing in the early part of the 20th century. In 1919, the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piano Workers May Strike&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/08/29/103460481.pdf |title=Piano Workers May Strike |date=August 29, 1919 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of [[World War I]], the Bronx hosted the rather small [[Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries|1918 World's Fair]] at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultan&quot;&gt;Lloyd Ultann, Bronx Borough Historian, [http://www.bronxriver.org/?pg=content&amp;p=abouttheriver&amp;m1=9&amp;m2=58 &quot;History of the Bronx River,&quot;] Paper presented to the [[Bronx River Alliance]], November 5, 2002 (notes taken by Maarten de Kadt, November 16, 2002), retrieved on August 29, 2008. This 2½ hour talk covers much of the early history of the Bronx as a whole, in addition to the [[Bronx River]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE103DF931A15750C0A964958260 &quot;Streetscapes: The New York Coliseum; From Auditorium To Bus Garage to...&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]'', Real Estate section, March 22, 1992, retrieved on July 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the [[New York City Subway]] contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction. Among these groups, many [[Irish Americans]], [[Italian Americans]], and especially [[Jewish Americans]] settled here. In addition, [[French American|French]], [[German Americans|German]], [[Polish American|Polish]], and other immigrants moved into the borough. As evidence of the change in population, by 1937, 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]], 1943'', page 494, citing the [[American Jewish Committee]] and the Jewish Statistical Bureau of the [[Synagogue Council of America]]&lt;/ref&gt; while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011. Many [[synagogue]]s still stand in the Bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.&lt;ref

(retrieved on August 10, 2008), citing population estimates in &quot;The Jewish Community Study of New York: 2002&quot;, UJA [United Jewish Appeal] Federation of New York,
June 2004, and his own survey of synagogue sites.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decline====
[[rum-running|Bootleggers]] and gangs were active in the Bronx during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] (1920–33). Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.

Between 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]]) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today [[Demographics of the Bronx|are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough]].

From the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the [[quality of life]] declined sharply for many Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that [[Robert Moses]]' [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in [[Robert Caro]]'s biography ''[[The Power Broker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Power Broker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of [[high-rise]] [[Public housing in the United States and Canada|housing projects]], particularly in the [[South Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanrealities.org/locations/south_bronx/ |title=The South Bronx |publisher=American Realities}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as [[mortgage loan]]s or insurance policies—a process known as [[redlining]]. Others have suggested a &quot;[[planned shrinkage]]&quot; of municipal services, such as fire-fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Wallace: &quot;A synergism of plagues: 'planned shrinkage,' contagious housing destruction, and AIDS in the Bronx.&quot; ''Environmental Research'', October 1988, Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 1–33, and &quot;Urban desertification, public health and public order: 'planned shrinkage', violent death, substance abuse and AIDS in the Bronx&quot;, ''Social Science &amp; Medicine'', Vol. 37, No. 7 (1990) pp. 801–813—abstracts retrieved on July 5, 2008 from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ PubMed]. One sentence in the abstract of the 1990 article reads, &quot;Empirical and theoretical analyses strongly imply present sharply rising levels of violent death, intensification of deviant behaviors implicated in the spread of AIDS, and the pattern of the AIDS outbreak itself, have been gravely affected, and even strongly determined, by the outcomes of a program of 'planned shrinkage' directed against African-American and Hispanic communities, and implemented through systematic and continuing denial of municipal services—particularly fire extinguishment resources—essential for maintaining urban levels of population density and ensuring community stability.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Issues such as redlining, hospital quality, and what looked like the planned shrinkage of garbage collection were alleged as the motivations which sparked the [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] activists known as the [[Young Lords]]. The Young Lords coalesced with similar groups who claimed to be fighting for neighborhood empowerment, such as the [[Black Panthers]], to protest urban renewal and arson for profit with sit-ins, marches, and violence. See pages 6–9 of the guide to [https://www.pbs.org/pov/utils/youthviews/pov_palante_toolkit.pdf ''¡Palante Siempre Palante!'' The Young Lords] a &quot;P.O.V.&quot; (Point of View) documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service]].&lt;/ref&gt; There was also much debate as to whether [[rent control]] laws had made it less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of this argument, as well as of several other theses mentioned here, see [http://www.city-data.com/forum/new-york-city/257896-when-bronx-burning-6.html &quot;When the Bronx was burning&quot;] ''City-data'' forum (blog), 2007, where rubygreta writes:

{{quote|Rent control destroyed the Bronx, especially starting in the 1960s and 1970s, when oil prices rose through the roof, and heavily subsidized Coop City opened in the East Bronx.
Essentially, tenants never moved out of their apartments because they had below-market rents thanks to rent control. The apartments deteriorated and common areas deteriorated because the landlords had no cash-flow. And no cash flow meant that they could not get mortgages for major repairs such as boilers, roofs and window replacement.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx. One explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money, as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945795-2,00.html |title=Arson for Hate and Profit |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 31, 1977 |accessdate=March 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez 2004&quot;&gt;Gonzalez (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate. By the early 1980s, the South Bronx was considered one of the most blighted urban areas in the country, with a loss of 60% of the population and 40% of housing units. However, starting in the 1990s, many burned-out and run-down tenements were replaced by multi-unit housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez 2004&quot; /&gt;

Among the remarks of Richard H. Neiman, New York State's Superintendent of Banks, were these: &quot;The Bronx was an economically stable community until the mid-1960s when the entire South Bronx struggled with major construction, real estate issues, red-lining, and block busting. This included a thoroughfare that divided communities, the deterioration of property as a result of rent control, and decrease in the value of real estate.

Due to strong community leadership, advances in policing, social services, and changing economic migration patterns to New York City, the Bronx is undergoing a resurgence, with new housing developments and thriving business. From 2000 to 2006, there was a 2.2% increase in population, and home ownership rates increased by 19.6%. Still, bank branches were absent in places such as Community districts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hispanicmpr.com/2007/12/11/new-bank-targets-latinos-in-south-bronx/ New bank targets Latinos in South Bronx] December 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On June 30, 2005, there were 129 Federally insured banking offices in the Bronx, for a ratio of 1.0 offices for every 10,000 inhabitants.

[[File:Co-op City Hutch River.jpg|thumb|The neighborhood of [[Co-op City]] is the largest cooperative housing development in the world.]]
East of the [[Bronx River]], the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas, or 'necks,' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh: Hunts Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck (Castle Hill Point) and [[Throgs Neck]]. The East Bronx has older tenement buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multifamily homes, as well as single family homes. It includes New York City's largest park: [[Pelham Bay Park]] along the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]-Bronx border.

Neighborhoods include: [[Clason's Point, Bronx|Clason's Point]], [[Harding Park, Bronx|Harding Park]], [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]], [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]], [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 9|Board 9]])''; [[Throggs Neck]], [[Country Club, Bronx|Country Club]], [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]], [[Pelham Bay]], [[Edgewater Park (Bronx)|Edgewater Park]], [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 10|Board 10]])''; [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]], [[Van Nest]], [[Pelham Parkway, Bronx|Pelham Parkway]], [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 11|Board 11]])''; [[Williamsbridge, Bronx|Williamsbridge]], [[Eastchester, Bronx|Eastchester]], [[Baychester, Bronx|Baychester]], [[Edenwald, Bronx|Edenwald]] and [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 12|Board 12]])''.

=====City Island and Hart Island=====

[[File:CityIsland.jpg|thumb|A sunken boat off the shore of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]]]]
([[Bronx Community Board 10]])

City Island is located east of [[Pelham Bay Park]] in [[Long Island Sound]] and is known for its seafood restaurants and private waterfront homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Fischler | first=Marcelle Sussman | title=City Island, a Quainter Side of the Bronx |work=The New York Times | date=September 13, 2015 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/realestate/city-island-a-quainter-side-of-the-bronx.html | accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; City Island's single shopping street, City Island Avenue, is reminiscent of a small New England town. It is connected to [[Rodman's Neck]] on the mainland by the [[City Island Bridge]].

East of City Island is [[Hart Island (New York)|Hart Island]], which is uninhabited and not open to the public. It once served as a prison and now houses New York City's [[potter's field]] for unclaimed bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Walshe | first=Sadhbh | title='Like a prison for the dead': welcome to Hart Island, home to New York City's pauper graves |work=[[The Guardian]]| date=June 3, 2015 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/03/hart-island-new-york-city-mass-burial-graves | accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Bronx====

[[File:Grand Conc 165 jeh.JPG|thumb|[[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] at East 165th Street]]
([[Bronx Community Board]]s 1 to 8, progressing roughly from south to northwest)

The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges, running south to north. The West Bronx has older apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] and [[Fieldston, Bronx|Fieldston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fpoa.info/images/FPOA_APPROVED_BY-LAWS.doc Fieldston Property Owners' Association, Inc. By-Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721202132/http://fpoa.info/images/FPOA_APPROVED_BY-LAWS.doc |date=July 21, 2011 }}, by the FPOA, September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It includes New York City's third-largest park: [[Van Cortlandt Park]] along the Westchester-Bronx border. The [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], a wide boulevard, runs through it, north to south.

=====Northwestern Bronx=====
([[Bronx Community Board]]s 7 ''[between the [[Bronx River|Bronx]] and [[Harlem River]]s]'' and 8 ''[facing the [[Hudson River]]]'' – plus part of Board 12)

Neighborhoods include: Fordham-Bedford, [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]], [[Norwood, Bronx|Norwood]], [[Kingsbridge Heights]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 7|Board 7]])'', [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]], [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 8|Board 8]])'', and [[Woodlawn, Bronx|Woodlawn]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 12|Board 12]])''.
([[Marble Hill, Manhattan]] is now connected by land to the Bronx rather than Manhattan and is served by [[Bronx Community Board 8]].)

=====South Bronx=====

([[Bronx Community Board]]s 1 to 6 plus part of Board 7—''progressing northwards, Boards 2, 3 and 6 border the [[Bronx River]] from its mouth to [[Bronx Park]], while 1, 4, 5 and 7 face Manhattan across the [[Harlem River]]'')

Like other [[neighborhoods in New York City]], the South Bronx has no official boundaries. The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and is applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s, [[Fordham Road]] was often used as a northern limit. The [[Bronx River]] more consistently forms an eastern boundary. The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multi-unit homes. The South Bronx is home to the [[Bronx County Courthouse]], Borough Hall, and other government buildings, as well as [[Yankee Stadium]]. The [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] bisects it, east to west. The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas.

Neighborhoods include: [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] (a retail district at [[Third Avenue]] and East 149th Street), [[Port Morris, Bronx|Port Morris]], [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 1|Board 1]])'', [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 1|Board 1]] &amp; [[Bronx Community Board 3|Board 3]])'', [[Morrisania]], [[East Morrisania, Bronx|East Morrisania]] [also known as Crotona Park East] ''([[Bronx Community Board 3|Board 3]])'', [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], [[Longwood, Bronx|Longwood]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 2|Board 2]])'', [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], [[Concourse, Bronx|Concourse]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 4|Board 4]])'', [[West Farms, Bronx|West Farms]], [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]], [[East Tremont, Bronx|East Tremont]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 6|Board 6]])'', [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]], [[Morris Heights, Bronx|Morris Heights]] ''([[Bronx Community Board 5|Board 5]])'', [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]].

===Roads and streets===
[[File:Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Bronx–Whitestone Bridge]]]]

====Surface streets====
The Bronx [[street grid]] is irregular. Like the northernmost part of [[upper Manhattan]], the [[West Bronx]]'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx. This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.

The [[East Bronx]] is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the [[Wakefield, Bronx|Wakefield]] neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.

Three major north-south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: [[Third Avenue]], [[Park Avenue]], and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. Other major north-south roads include the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Sedgwick Avenue]], [[Webster Avenue]], and [[White Plains Road]]. Major east-west thoroughfares include [[Mosholu Parkway]], [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]], [[Fordham Road]], [[Pelham Parkway]], and Tremont Avenue.

Most east-west streets are prefixed with either ''East'' or ''West'', to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses [[Fifth Avenue]] as the dividing line).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2012/02/unlock-the-grid-then-ditch-the-maps-and-apps/ &quot;Unlock the Grid, Then Ditch the Maps and Apps&quot;], [[WNET]], February 24, 2012. Accessed August 1, 2016. &quot;Jerome Avenue is the Bronx's Fifth Avenue: Jerome Avenue divides the eastern and western halves of the Bronx. Much of the West Bronx's numbering continues where Upper Manhattan's street grid left off.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic [[Boston Post Road]], part of the long pre-revolutionary road connecting [[Boston]] with other northeastern cities, runs east-west in some places, and sometimes northeast-southwest.

[[Mosholu Parkway|Mosholu]] and [[Pelham Parkway]]s, with [[Bronx Park]] between them, [[Van Cortlandt Park]] to the west and [[Pelham Bay Park]] to the east, are also linked by [[bridle path]]s.

As of the 2000 Census, approximately 61.6% of all Bronx households do not have access to a car. Citywide, the percentage of autoless households is 55%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tstc.org/reports/cpsheets/Bronx_factsheet.pdf Bronx factsheet], Tri‐State Transportation Campaign. Accessed August 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Highways====
Several major [[limited access]] highways traverse the Bronx. These include:
* the [[Bronx River Parkway]]
* the [[Bruckner Expressway]] ([[Interstate 278|I-278]]/[[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]])
* the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]/[[Interstate 295 (New York)|I-295]])
* the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]])
* the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]] ([[New York State Route 9A|NY-9A]])
* the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]]
* the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]])

====Bridges and tunnels====
[[File:Aerial View of the Throgs Neck Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|An aerial view of the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]]]]
Thirteen bridges and three tunnels connect the Bronx to Manhattan, and three bridges connect the Bronx to [[Queens]]. These are, from west to east:

''To Manhattan:'' the [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]], the [[Henry Hudson Bridge]], the [[Broadway Bridge (Manhattan)|Broadway Bridge]], the [[University Heights Bridge]], the [[Washington Bridge]], the [[Alexander Hamilton Bridge]], the [[High Bridge (New York City)|High Bridge]], the [[Concourse Tunnel]], the [[Macombs Dam Bridge]], the [[145th Street Bridge]], the [[149th Street Tunnel]], the [[Madison Avenue Bridge]], the [[Park Avenue Bridge (New York City)|Park Avenue Bridge]], the [[Lexington Avenue Tunnel]], the [[Third Avenue Bridge (Manhattan)|Third Avenue Bridge]] (southbound traffic only), and the [[Willis Avenue Bridge]] (northbound traffic only).

''To both Manhattan and Queens:'' the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge]], formerly known as the Triborough Bridge.

''To Queens:'' the [[Bronx–Whitestone Bridge]] and the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]].

Two [[Metro-North Railroad]] commuter rail lines (the [[Harlem Line]] and the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]) serve 11 stations in the Bronx. ([[Marble Hill (Metro-North station)|Marble Hill]], between the [[Spuyten Duyvil (Metro-North station)|Spuyten Duyvil]] and [[University Heights (Metro-North station)|University Heights]] stations, is actually in the only part of Manhattan connected to the mainland.) In addition, trains serving the [[New Haven Line]] stop at [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham Plaza]].  As part of [[Penn Station Access]], the 2018 MTA budget funded construction of four new stops along the New Haven Line to serve [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]], [[Parkchester, Bronx|Parkchester]], [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]], and [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.welcome2thebronx.com/2016/05/25/mta-budget-for-four-new-east-bronx-metro-north-stations-finally-approved/|title=MTA Budget For Four New East Bronx Metro North Stations Finally Approved|date=May 25, 2016|work=Welcome2TheBronx|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[NYC Ferry]]'s Soundview line opened, connecting the [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]] landing in [[Clason Point|Clason Point Park]] to three [[East River]] locations in Manhattan.

The office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that [[Brooklyn]], the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than [[Staten Island]], the least populous borough, a violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment's]] [[Equal Protection Clause]] pursuant to the high court's 1964 &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;law.cornell.edu&quot;&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v. Morris], accessed June 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the [[New York City Council|City Council]], the New York state government, and corporations.

Until March 1, 2009, the Borough President of the Bronx was [[Adolfo Carrión Jr.]], elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the [[White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy]]. His successor, Democratic [[New York State Assembly]] member [[Ruben Diaz, Jr.|Rubén Díaz, Jr.]], who won a special election on April 21, 2009 by a vote of 86.3% (29,420) on the &quot;Bronx Unity&quot; line to 13.3% (4,646) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the &quot;People First&quot; line,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Trymaine Lee, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/nyregion/22bronx.html &quot;Bronx Voters Elect Díaz as New Borough President&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', New York edition, April 22, 2009, page A24, retrieved on May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vote.nyc.ny.us&quot;&gt;The Board of Elections in the City of New York, [http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/pdf/results/2009/BronxBoroPresident_4_21_09/BronxBoroPresident-Recap.pdf Bronx Borough President special election results, April 21, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725025650/http://www.vote.nyc.ny.us/pdf/results/2009/BronxBoroPresident_4_21_09/BronxBoroPresident-Recap.pdf |date=July 25, 2011 }} ([[PDF]] with details by Assembly District, April 29, 2009), retrieved on May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; became Borough President on May 1.

All of the Bronx's currently elected public officials have first won the nomination of the [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democratic Party]] (in addition to any other endorsements). Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in the Bronx include environmental issues, the cost of housing, and annexation of parkland for new [[Yankee Stadium]].

Since its separation from [[New York County]] on January 1, 1914, the Bronx, has had, like each of the other 61 counties of New York State, its own criminal court system&lt;ref name=&quot;courtstart&quot; /&gt; and [[District attorney|District Attorney]], the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. [[Darcel D. Clark]] has been the [[Bronx County District Attorney]] since 2016. Her predecessor was [[Robert T. Johnson]], was the District Attorney from 1989 to 2015. He was the first African-American District Attorney in New York State.

[[Membership of the New York City Council|Eight members]] of the [[New York City Council]] represent districts wholly within the Bronx (11–18), while a ninth represents a Manhattan district (8) that also includes a small area of the Bronx. One of those members, [[Joel Rivera]] (District 15), has been the Council's [[Majority Leader]] since 2002. In 2008, all of them were Democrats.

The Bronx also has twelve [[Community boards of the Bronx|Community Boards]], appointed bodies that field complaints and advise on land use and municipal facilities and services for local residents, businesses and institutions. (They are listed at [[Bronx Community Board]]s).

After becoming a separate county in 1914, the Bronx has supported only two Republican Presidential candidates. It voted heavily for the winning Republican [[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1920|1920]], but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor [[Calvin Coolidge]] in [[United States presidential election in New York, 1924|1924]] (Coolidge 79,562; [[John W. Davis]], Dem., 72,834; [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], 62,202 equally divided between the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] lines).

Since then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2–1 for the unsuccessful [[Al Smith]] in 1928, followed by four 2–1 votes for the successful [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. [[Thomas E. Dewey]] won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. [[Harry Truman]], the winning Democrat, and 17% for [[Henry A. Wallace]] of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressives]]. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, [[Charles Evans Hughes]], had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 49.8% and Socialist candidate [[Allan Benson]]'s 7.3%.)&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'' for 1929 &amp; 1957; [http://ourcampaigns.com/ContainerHistory.html?ContainerID=9099 Our Campaigns (New York Counties Bronx President History)]; ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] ([[Yale University Press]] and the [[New-York Historical Society]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]], 1995 {{ISBN|0-300-05536-6}}), article on &quot;government and politics&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in [[New York City mayoral elections|elections for Mayor]]. The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the [[American Labor Party]] line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican).&lt;ref&gt;(The Republican line exceeded the ALP's in every other borough)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in 1997 and [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 2005. The anti-war [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] campaign of [[Morris Hillquit]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 1917|1917 mayoral election]] won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor [[John P. Mitchel]], who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.&lt;ref&gt;To see a comparison of borough votes for Mayor, see [[New York City mayoral elections#How the boroughs voted]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent shopping areas in the Bronx include [[Fordham Road]], [[Bay Plaza Shopping Center|Bay Plaza]] in [[Co-op City]], [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]], the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]]/[[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] shopping center, and [[Bruckner Boulevard]]. Shops are also concentrated on streets aligned underneath elevated railroad lines, including Westchester Avenue, [[White Plains Road]], [[Jerome Avenue]], [[Southern Boulevard (Bronx)|Southern Boulevard]], and [[Broadway (Bronx)|Broadway]]. The [[Bronx Terminal Market]] contains several [[big-box store]]s, which opened in 2009 south of Yankee Stadium.

There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx: The Hub, Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard. The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District (B.I.D.), in [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]], is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], located where four roads converge: East 149th Street, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/hub/hub.html The Hub] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106082418/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/hub/hub.html |date=January 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehman.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/publicart/neighborhood.htm Bronx Neighborhood Histories] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515092129/http://www.lehman.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/publicart/neighborhood.htm |date=May 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hub has been called &quot;the Broadway of the Bronx&quot;, being likened to [[Broadway (Bronx)|the real Broadway]] in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therealdeal.net/issues/JULY_2006/1151609191.php Bronx Hub revival gathers steam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112071728/http://www.therealdeal.net/issues/JULY_2006/1151609191.php |date=November 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density.

The [[Bronx Terminal Market]], in the [[West Bronx]], formerly known as Gateway Center, is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space, built on a {{convert|17|acre|0}} site that formerly held a wholesale fruit and vegetable market also named Bronx Terminal Market as well as the former [[Bronx House of Detention]], south of [[Yankee Stadium]]. The $500 million shopping center, which was completed in 2009, saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings, one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market. The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars. The center has earned itself a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] &quot;Silver&quot; designation in its design.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chains of Silver: Gateway Center At Bronx Terminal Market Earns LEED Silver Bona Fides&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{See also|Education in New York City|List of public elementary schools in New York City|Category:Charter schools in New York (state)}}

Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions, many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx. The [[New York City Department of Education]] manages public noncharter schools in the borough. In 2000, public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx's residents over 3 years old (out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools).&lt;ref name=&quot;quicktable&quot;&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=qt&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP19&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-CONTEXT=qt&amp;-tree_id=403&amp;-all_geo_types=N&amp;-geo_id=05000US36005&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en QT-P19.

Private schools range from élite [[independent school]]s to religiously affiliated [[parochial schools#United States|schools]] run by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]] and Jewish organizations.

A small portion of land that is between Pelham and Pelham Bay Park, with a total of 35 houses, is a part of the Bronx, but is cut off from the rest of the borough due to the way the county boundaries were established; the New York City government pays for the residents' children to go to [[Pelham Union Free School District]] schools, including [[Pelham Memorial High School]], since that is more cost effective than sending school buses to take the students to New York City schools. This arrangement has been in place since 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;gross19970506&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/nyregion/a-tiny-strip-of-new-york-that-feels-like-the-suburbs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=A Tiny Strip of New York That Feels Like the Suburbs |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 1997 |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |author=Gross, Jane |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717200357/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/nyregion/a-tiny-strip-of-new-york-that-feels-like-the-suburbs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |archivedate=July 17, 2016 }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational attainment===
In 2000, according to the [[United States Census]], out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old, 62.3% had graduated from high school and 14.6% held a bachelor's or higher college degree. These percentages were lower than those for New York's other boroughs, which ranged from 68.8% (Brooklyn) to 82.6% (Staten Island) for high school graduates over 24, and from 21.8% (Brooklyn) to 49.4% (Manhattan) for college graduates. (The respective state and national percentages were ''[NY]'' 79.1% &amp; 27.4% and ''[US]'' 80.4% &amp; 24.4%.)&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Census Bureau]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080422014749/http://www.census.gov/statab/ccdb/ccdbstcounty.html ''County and City Data Book:2007''], Table B-4. Counties – Population Characteristics&lt;/ref&gt;

===High schools===
{{See also|List of high schools in New York City#Bronx}}
[[File:BronxScience.jpg|thumb|[[The Bronx High School of Science]]]]

In the 2000 Census, 79,240 of the nearly 95,000 Bronx residents enrolled in high school attended public schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;quicktable&quot;/&gt;

Many public [[High school (North America)|high schools]] are located in the borough including the elite [[Bronx High School of Science]], [[Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music]], [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[High School for Violin and Dance]], [[Bronx Leadership Academy 2]], [[Bronx International High School]], the [[School for Excellence]], the [[Morris Academy for Collaborative Study]], Wings Academy for young adults, The Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice, Validus Preparatory Academy, The Eagle Academy For Young Men, Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School, Bronx Academy of Letters, [[Herbert H. Lehman High School]] and [[High School of American Studies at Lehman College|High School of American Studies]]. The Bronx is also home to three of New York City's most prestigious private, secular schools: [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston]], [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann]], and [[Riverdale Country School]].

High schools linked to the [[Catholic Church]] include: [[St. Raymond Academy|Saint Raymond's Academy for Girls]], [[All Hallows High School]], [[Fordham Preparatory School]], [[Monsignor Scanlan High School]], [[St. Raymond High School for Boys]], [[Cardinal Hayes High School]], [[Cardinal Spellman High School (New York City)|Cardinal Spellman High School]], [[Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School|The Academy of Mount Saint Ursula]], [[Aquinas High School (New York City)|Aquinas High School]], [[Preston High School (New York City)|Preston High School]], [[St. Catharine Academy]], [[Mount Saint Michael Academy]], and [[St. Barnabas High School]].

The [[SAR Academy]] and [[SAR High School]] are [[Modern Orthodox]] Jewish [[Yeshiva]] coeducational day schools in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]], with roots in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]].

In the 1990s, New York City began closing the large, public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools. Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety. Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include [[John F. Kennedy High School (Bronx, New York)|John F. Kennedy]], [[James Monroe High School (New York)|James Monroe]], [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Taft]], [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (New York City)|Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Adlai E. Stevenson High School (New York City)|Adlai Stevenson]], [[Evander Childs High School|Evander Childs]], [[Christopher Columbus High School (Bronx, New York)|Christopher Columbus]], [[Morris High School (Bronx, New York)|Morris]], [[Walton High School (New York City)|Walton]], and South Bronx High Schools. More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.

===Colleges and universities===
{{See also|List of colleges and universities in New York City}}
In 2000, 49,442 (57.5%) of the 86,014 Bronx residents seeking college, graduate or professional degrees attended public institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;quicktable&quot;/&gt;

Several colleges and universities are located in the Bronx.

[[Fordham University]] was founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the [[Archdiocese of New York|Diocese of New York]] as the first Catholic institution of higher education in the [[Northeast United States|northeast]]. It is now officially an independent institution, but strongly embraces its [[Jesuit]] heritage. The {{convert|85|acre|m2|adj=on}} Bronx campus, known as Rose Hill, is the main campus of the university, and is among the largest within the city (other Fordham campuses are located in Manhattan and Westchester County).&lt;ref name=&quot;fordzoo&quot;&gt;In September 2008, [[Fordham University]] and its neighbor, the Wildlife Conservation Society, a global research organization which operates the [[Bronx Zoo]], will begin a joint program leading to a [[Master of Science]] degree in adolescent science education (biology grades 7–12).&lt;/ref&gt;

Three campuses of the [[City University of New York]] are in the Bronx: [[Hostos Community College]], [[Bronx Community College]] (occupying the former [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] Campus of [[New York University]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chronopoulos |first=Themis |title=&quot;Urban Decline and the Withdrawal of New York University from University Heights, The Bronx.&quot; The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLVI (Spring/Fall 2009): 4–24. |url=http://themis.slass.org/university-heights.html |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031124152/http://themis.slass.org/university-heights.html |archivedate=October 31, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Herbert H. [[Lehman College]] (formerly the uptown campus of [[Hunter College]]), which offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

The [[College of Mount Saint Vincent]] is a Catholic liberal arts college in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] under the direction of the [[Sisters of Charity of New York]]. Founded in 1847 as a school for girls, the academy became a degree-granting college in 1911 and began admitting men in 1974. The school serves 1,600 students. Its campus is also home to the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], a transdenominational rabbinical and cantorial school.

[[Manhattan College]] is a Catholic college in [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] which offers undergraduate programs in the arts, business, education, engineering, and science. It also offers graduate programs in education and engineering.

[[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], part of the [[Montefiore Medical Center]], is in [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]].

Two colleges based in [[Westchester County]] have Bronx campuses. The Catholic and nearly all-female [[The College of New Rochelle|College of New Rochelle]] maintains satellite campuses at [[Co-op City]] and in [[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]]. The coeducational and non-sectarian [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], founded by the Catholic [[Sisters of Mercy]] in 1950, has a campus near [[Westchester Square, Bronx|Westchester Square]].

By contrast, the private, proprietary [[Monroe College]], focused on preparation for business and the professions, started in the Bronx in 1933 but now has a campus in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] (Westchester County) as well the Bronx's [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monroecollege.edu/aboutmonroe/monroeshistory Monroe College history] (from the College's web site) retrieved on July 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[State University of New York Maritime College]] in [[Fort Schuyler]] ([[Throggs Neck]])—at the far southeastern tip of the Bronx—is the national leader in maritime education and houses the [[Maritime Industry Museum]]. (Directly across [[Long Island Sound]] is [[Kings Point, New York|Kings Point]], Long Island, home of the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]] and the American Merchant Marine Museum.)

Author [[Edgar Allan Poe]] spent the last years of his life (1846 to 1849) in the Bronx at [[Poe Cottage]], now located at [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] Road and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]. A small wooden farmhouse built around 1812, the cottage once commanded unobstructed vistas over the rolling Bronx hills to the shores of [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/poecottage.html |title=Edgar Allan Poe Cottage |date= |access-date=October 9, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005212044/http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/poecottage.html |archive-date=October 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe moved there to get away from the Manhattan city air and crowding in hope that the then rural area would be beneficial for his wife's tuberculosis.

More than a century later, the Bronx would evolve from a hot bed of [[Latin jazz]] to an incubator of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] as documented in the award-winning documentary, produced by [[City Lore]] and broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 2006, &quot;From Mambo to Hip Hop: A South Bronx Tale.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1169817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has identified 1520 [[Sedgwick Avenue]] &quot;an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] and hard along the [[Major Deegan Expressway]]&quot; as a starting point, where [[DJ Kool Herc]] presided over parties in the community room.&lt;ref&gt;David Gonzalez, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/nyregion/21citywide.html &quot;Will Gentrification Spoil the Birthplace of Hip-Hop?&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 21, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lee, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/tenants-might-buy-the-birthplace-of-hip-hop &quot;Tenants Might Buy the Birthplace of Hip-Hop&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 15, 2008, retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 [[Netflix]] series ''[[The Get Down]]'' is based on the development of hip hop in 1977 in the South Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/15/baz-luhrmann-get-down-tv-review-netflix &quot;''The Get Down'' review – an insanely extravagant love letter to 70s New York&quot;] by Sam Wollaston, ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years earlier, the [[Bronx Opera]] had been founded.

===Founding of hip-hop===
On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was a [[D.J.]] and [[M.C.]] at a party in the [[recreation room]] of [[1520 Sedgwick Avenue]] in the Bronx adjacent to the Cross Bronx Expressway.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;Tukufu Zuberi (&quot;detective&quot;), &quot;Birthplace of Hip Hop&quot;, ''[[History Detectives]]'', Season 6, Episode 11, New York City, found at [https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/611_hiphop.html PBS official website]. Accessed February 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was not the actual &quot;Birthplace of Hip Hop&quot; – the [[genre]] developed slowly in several places in the 1970s – it was verified to be the place where ''one of'' the pivotal and formative events occurred.&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt; Specifically:

{{quote|[Cool Herc] extended an instrumental beat ([[DJ mix|mixing]] or [[scratching]]) to let people dance longer ([[breakdancing|B-boying]]) and began MC'ing ([[rapping]]) during the extended breakdancing. ... [This] helped lay the foundation for a cultural revolution.|''[[History Detectives]]''&lt;ref name=PBS /&gt;}}

Beginning with the advent  of beat match DJing, in which Bronx disc jockeys) including [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]] extended the breaks of [[funk]] records, a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk, [[disco]] and [[soul music|soul]] songs. As hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking (&quot;[[rapping]]&quot;) in sync with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The Herculoids, made up of Herc, [[Coke La Rock]], and Clark Kent,{{efn|Not [[Clark Kent (producer)]].}} were the earliest to gain major fame. The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as &quot;The Boogie Down Bronx&quot;, or just &quot;The Boogie Down&quot;. This was hip-hop pioneer [[KRS-One]]'s inspiration for his group BDP, or [[Boogie Down Productions]], which included DJ [[Scott La Rock]]. Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include [[Big Pun]], [[Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz]], [[Camp Lo]], [[Swizz Beatz]], [[Drag-On]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]] and [[Cory Gunz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Johan|editor-last=Kugelberg|title=Born in the Bronx: A Visual Record of the Early Days of Hip Hop|page=31|location=New York|publisher=[[Rizzoli New York]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7893-1540-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
[[File:New Yankee Stadium.JPG|thumb|New [[Yankee Stadium]] at 161st and River Avenue]]

The Bronx is the home of the [[New York Yankees]], nicknamed &quot;the Bronx Bombers&quot;, of [[Major League Baseball]]. The original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 [[World Series]] Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Whitey Ford]], [[Yogi Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Thurman Munson]], [[Don Mattingly]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Mariano Rivera]].

The original stadium was the scene of [[Lou Gehrig]]'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1956 to 1973.

The original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new [[Yankee Stadium]] in which the team started play in 2009. It is located north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of [[New York City FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], who began play in 2015.

===Off-Off-Broadway===
{{Main|Off-Off-Broadway}}
The Bronx is home to several [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The [[Pregones Theater]], which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.

===Arts===
The [[Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance]], founded in 1998 by [[Arthur Aviles]] and Charles Rice-Gonzalez, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. It is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the Bronx Dance Coalition. The Academy was formerly in the [[American Bank Note Company Building]] before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baadbronx.org/about.html|title=About|website=BAAD! Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]], founded in 1971, exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and {{convert|11000|sqft|m2|-2}} of galleries. Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm [[Arquitectonica]].

The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the &quot;[[Heinrich Heine]] Memorial&quot;, better known as the [[Lorelei Fountain]]. After Heine's German birthplace of [[Düsseldorf]] had rejected, allegedly for [[anti-Semitic]] motives, a centennial monument to the radical [[German-Jewish]] poet (1797–1856), his incensed [[German-American]] admirers, including [[Carl Schurz]], started a movement to place one instead in [[Midtown Manhattan]], at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art.&lt;ref name=&quot;GrayNYT2007&quot;&gt;Christopher Gray, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/realestate/27scap.html &quot;Sturm und Drang Over a Memorial to Heinrich Heine&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2007, retrieved on July 3, 2008.

In 1999, it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse.

===Maritime heritage===
The [[peninsula]]r borough's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.[http://www.cityislandmuseum.org/ The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum] occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system's turn-of-the-last-century master architect [[C.

[[Canoeing]] and [[kayaking]] on the borough's namesake river have been promoted by the [http://www.bronxriver.org/ Bronx River Alliance]. The river is also straddled by the [[New York Botanical Gardens]], its neighbor, the [[Bronx Zoo]], and a little further south, on the west shore, Bronx River Art Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxriverart.org |title=Welcome |publisher=Bronx River Art Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community celebrations===
&quot;Bronx Week,&quot; traditionally held in May, originated as a one-day celebration.  Initiated by Bronx historian Lloyd Ultan and supported by then borough president Robert Abrams, the original one-day program was based on the &quot;Bronx Borough Day&quot; festival which took place in the 1920s.  The following year, at the height of the decade's civil unrest, the festival was extended to a one-week event.  In the 1980s the key event, the &quot;Bronx Ball,&quot; was launched.  The week includes the Bronx Week Parade as well as inductions into the &quot;Bronx Walk of Fame.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Top Bronx Week events set for May 19–20 weekend|last=Mitchell|first=Alex|date=May 11, 2018|work=Bronx Times Reporter|accessdate=|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press and broadcasting===
The Bronx is home to several local newspapers and radio and television studios.

====Newspapers====
The Bronx has several local newspapers, including ''The [[Bronx News]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bxnews.net/ bxnews.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610160535/http://www.bxnews.net/ |date=June 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Parkchester]] News'', ''City News'', ''The [[Norwood News]]'', ''The [[Riverdale Press]]'', ''[[Riverdale Review]]'', ''The [[Bronx Times Reporter]]'', ''[[Inner City Press]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.innercitypress.org/aboutus.html |title=(some) About Us |publisher=Inner City Press |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which now has more of a focus on national issues) and ''[[Co-op City]] Times''. Four non-profit news outlets, ''[[Norwood News]]'', ''Mount Hope Monitor'', ''[[Mott Haven Herald]]'' and ''The [[Hunts Point, Bronx|Hunts Point]] Express'' serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of ''The Riverdale Press'', Bernard Stein, won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1959.)

The Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, ''[[The Bronx Home News]]'', which started publishing on January 20, 1907, and merged into the ''[[New York Post]]'' in 1948. It became a special section of the ''Post'', sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.

====Radio and television====
One of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is [[WFUV]], a [[National Public Radio]]-affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from [[Fordham University]]'s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building owned by [[Montefiore Medical Center]].

The City of New York has an official television station run by [[NYC Media]] and broadcasting from [[Bronx Community College]], and [[Cablevision]] operates [[News 12 Networks|News 12 The Bronx]], both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. [[Co-op City]] was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond [[Manhattan]], to have its own [[cable television]] provider. The local [[public-access television]] station [[BronxNet]] originates from Herbert H. Lehman College, the borough's only four year CUNY school, and provides [[government-access television]] (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.&lt;ref&gt;Its website showcases very short selections (less than 20 seconds and over 2 MB each in uncompressed [[AIFF]] format) from ''[http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm Bronx Music Vol.1]'', an out-of-press [[compact disc]] of the old and new sounds and artists of the Bronx. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813130030/http://www.bronxnet.org/info/music/bxmusic.htm |date=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gangs===
The Bronx is the home of many gangs, including:
* [[Dominicans Don't Play]] - formed around 1990, it primarily targets high school students and second-generation immigrants to join their gang, and make most of their money from robberies and drug deals.&lt;ref name=NYPost-Gangs&gt;https://nypost.com/2007/10/28/gangs-of-new-york/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mid-20th century====
Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled, working-class, urban culture. Hollywood films such as ''[[From This Day Forward]]'' (1946), set in [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], occasionally delved into Bronx life. [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chronopoulos |first=Themis |title=&quot;Paddy Chayefsky's 'Marty' and Its Significance to the Social History of Arthur Avenue, The Bronx, in the 1950s.&quot; The Bronx County Historical Society Journal XLIV (Spring/Fall 2007): 50–59. |url=http://themis.slass.org/marty.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120181558/http://themis.slass.org/marty.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film ''[[The Catered Affair]]'', and in the 1993 [[Robert De Niro]]/[[Chazz Palminteri]] film, ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', [[Spike Lee]]'s 1999 movie ''[[Summer of Sam]]'', centered in an [[Italian-American]] Bronx community, 1994's ''[[I Like It Like That (film)|I Like It Like That]]'' that takes place in the predominantly [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] neighborhood of the South Bronx, and ''Doughboys'', the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.

The Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the &quot;[[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]&quot;, a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by [[New York Yankees]] fans. The sound can be heard, for example, on the [[Spike Jones]] and His City Slickers recording of &quot;Der Fuehrer's Face&quot; (from the 1942 [[Disney]] [[animated film]] of the [[Der Fuehrer's Face|same name]]), repeatedly lambasting [[Adolf Hitler]] with: &quot;We'll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil!

Some movies have also used the term ''Bronx'' for comic effect, such as &quot;Bronx&quot;, the character on the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.

Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that &quot;The Bronx is burning&quot;: in 1974 it was the title of both a ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[editorial]] and a [[BBC]] [[documentary film]]. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the [[1977 World Series]], when a fire broke out near [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] as the team was playing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer [[Howard Cosell]] [[The Bronx Is Burning#Summary|is wrongly remembered to have said something like]], &quot;There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning&quot;. Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mahler |first=Jonathan |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning |url=https://archive.org/details/ladiesgentlemenb00mahl |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |isbn=0-312-42430-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new feature-length documentary film by [[Edwin Pagan]] called ''Bronx Burning''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115184832/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0906735/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 15, 2009|title=Bronx Burning (2008)|date=January 15, 2009|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |title=Opportunities for Arts Organizations and Community Based Organizations |publisher=Bronx Council on the Arts |work=E-News Update |date=January 2006 |access-date=December 27, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626082500/http://www.bronxarts.org/newsletter/200601.html |archive-date=June 26, 2006 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.

Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel ''The Wanderers'' by Bronx native [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] and the [[The Wanderers (1979 film)|1979 movie of the same name]]. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', the eponymous gang go to a meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]]. ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'' (1993) depicts gang activities in the [[Belmont, Bronx|Belmont]] &quot;Little Italy&quot; section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and &quot;Gunhill&quot; (a play off the name [[Gun Hill Road (Bronx)|Gun Hill Road]]). This theme lends itself to the title of ''[[The Bronx Is Burning]]'', an eight-part [[ESPN]] TV mini-series (2007) about the [[New York Yankees]]' drive to winning baseball's [[1977 World Series]]. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager [[Billy Martin]], catcher [[Thurman Munson]] and outfielder [[Reggie Jackson]], as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of [[Ed Koch]] as mayor.

The 1981 film ''[[Fort Apache, The Bronx]]'' is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed &quot;Fort Apache&quot;. Also from 1981 is the horror film ''[[Wolfen (film)|Wolfen]]'' making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. ''[[Knights of the South Bronx]]'', a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film ''[[Fuga dal Bronx]]'', also known as ''Bronx Warriors 2'' and ''Escape 2000'', an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, &quot;Leave the Bronx!&quot; Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in [[Queens]], substituting as the Bronx. ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', filmed in Vancouver, was a 1995 [[Jackie Chan]] [[kung-fu]] film, another which popularized the Bronx to international audiences. ''[[Last Bronx]]'', a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.

====As a setting====
Bronx native [[Nancy Savoca]]'s 1989 comedy, ''[[True Love (1989 film)|True Love]]'', explores two [[Italian-American]] Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding. The film, which debuted [[Annabella Sciorra]] and [[Ron Eldard]] as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The [[CBS]] [[television sitcom]] ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred [[Ted Danson]] as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.

[[Penny Marshall]]'s 1990 film ''[[Awakenings]]'', which was nominated for several [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], is based on neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]]' [[Awakenings (book)|1973 account]] of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of [[encephalitis]] but briefly responded to the drug [[L-dopa]]. [[Robin Williams]] played the physician; [[Robert De Niro]] was one of the patients who emerged from a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot not far from Sacks' actual [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] residence. A 1973 [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3D8103DF932A15752C0A9679C8B63 Yorkshire Television documentary] and &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot;, a 1985 play by [[Harold Pinter]],&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|0-573-12129-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; were also based on Sacks' book.

[[Gus Van Sant]]'s 2000 ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' was quickly billed &quot;[[Good Will Hunting]] in the Hood.&quot; [[Sean Connery]] is in the title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel that garnered the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. He meets 16-year-old Jamal, portrayed by [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]], a gifted basketball player and aspiring writer from the Bronx, and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

The 2012 documentary &quot;South Bronx United&quot; features the [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]] neighborhood and its conflict over the online grocery delivery service [[Fresh Direct]]'s move of their trucking facility from [[Long Island City]] to the [[South Bronx]].

===In literature===
{{See also|List of books set in New York City}}

====Books====
The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in [[Herman Wouk]]'s [[City Boy: The Adventures of Herbie Bookbinder]] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. [[Kate Simon]]'s ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood'' is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near [[Arthur Avenue]] and [[Tremont Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Simon, ''Bronx Primitive: Portraits in a Childhood.'' New York: Harper Colophon, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jacob M. Appel's short story, &quot;The Grand Concourse&quot; (2007),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Threepenny Review]]'', [http://www.threepennyreview.com/tocs/109_sp07.html Volume 109, Spring 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; a woman who grew up in the iconic [[Lewis Morris]] Building returns to the [[Morrisania]] neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in [[Avery Corman]]'s book ''The Old Neighborhood'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;[[Avery Corman]], ''The Old Neighborhood'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1980; {{ISBN|0-671-41475-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood ([[Fordham Road]] and the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]]), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.

By contrast, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities|Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wolfe, ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] 1987 (hardback) {{ISBN|978-0-374-11535-7}}, Picador Books 2008 (paperback) {{ISBN|978-0-312-42757-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in the [[South Bronx]] and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that &quot;the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments.&quot; In the same article, the Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] (whose fictional analogue in the novel is &quot;Reverend Bacon&quot;) asserts that &quot;twenty years later, the cynicism of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' is as out of style as [[Tom Wolfe]]'s wardrobe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Barnard, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/nyregion/10bonfire.html Twenty Years After 'Bonfire,' A City No Longer in Flames], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 10, 2007, retrieved on July 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don DeLillo]]'s ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]'' (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards. [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s &quot;[[Savage in Limbo]]&quot; is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters feel they are unable to move.

====Poetry====
In poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest [[couplet]]s:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;The Bronx
No Thonx
: [[Ogden Nash]], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 1931&lt;/poem&gt;

Nash repented 33 years after his [[calumny]], penning in 1964 the following [[prose poem]] to the Dean of [[Bronx Community College]]:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;I can't seem to escape
the sins of my smart-alec youth;
Here are my amends.
I wrote those lines, &quot;The Bronx?
No thonx&quot;;
I shudder to confess them.
Now I'm an older, wiser man
I cry, &quot;The Bronx?
God bless them!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thonx&quot; /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

In 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published ''Bronx Trilogy''—consisting of ''the shoe shine parlor poems et al'', ''concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx'', and ''from the banks of brook avenue''. The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events. [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], [[St. Mary's Park (Bronx)|St. Mary's Park]], and Brook Avenue are a few of the schools, parks, and streets Rodriguez uses as subjects for his poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/wr-rodriguez/banks-brook-avenue/|title=From the Banks of Brook Avenue by W.R. Rodriguez |website=Kirkusreviews.com|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash's couplet &quot;The Bronx No Thonx&quot; and his subsequent blessing are mentioned in ''Bronx Accent: A Literary and Pictorial History of the Borough'', edited by Llyod Ultan and Barbara Unger and published in 2000.  The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s ''[[Kaddish (poem)|Kaddish]]'', as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther's poem, &quot;Bronx&quot;, which is described as a celebration of the borough's landmarks.  There is a selection of works from poets such as [[Sandra María Esteves]], [[Milton Kessler]], Joan Murray, W. R. Rodriguez, Myra Shapiro, Gayl Teller, and [[Terence Winch|Terence Wynch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ultan | first=Lloyd | last2=Unger | first2=Barbara | title=Bronx Accent: A Literary and Pictorial History of the Borough | publisher=Rutgers University Press | series=Rivergate Regionals Collection | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-8135-3862-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2i8HAAACAAJ | access-date=August 2, 2017 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bronx Memoir Project====

''[[Bronx Memoir Project: Vol. 1]]'' is a published [[anthology]] by the Bronx Council on the Arts and brought forth through a series of workshops meant to empower Bronx residents and shed the stigma on the Bronx's burning past.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYDNI&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = A trio of Bronx tomes tell the tales of the borough|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/trio-bronx-tomes-tales-borough-article-1.2057670|website = NY Daily News|access-date = January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bronx Memoir Project was created as an ongoing collaboration between the [[Bronx Council on the Arts]] and other [[cultural institution]]s, including The Bronx [[Documentary film|Documentary]] Center, The [[Bronx Library Center]], the (Edgar Allan) [[Poe Park Visitor Center]], Mindbuilders, and other institutions and funded through a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Writing to Heal in the Bronx|url = https://huffingtonpost.com/charlie-vazquez/writing-to-heal-in-the-br_b_7485218.html|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AT&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bronx Council on the Arts Receives National Endowment for the Arts Grant for The Bronx Memoir Project – Bronx, NY|url = http://www.americantowns.com/ny/bronx/news/bronx-council-on-the-arts-receives-national-endowment-for-the-arts-grant-for-the-bronx-memoir-project-15548834|website = www.americantowns.com|access-date = January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to develop and refine memoir fragments written by people of all walks of life that share a common bond residing within the Bronx.&lt;ref name=&quot;HP&quot; /&gt;

===In songs===
* The theme song to the 1960s U.S. television comedy series ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' begins [[Car 54, Where Are You?#Theme song|&quot;There's a holdup in the Bronx&quot;]].
* The song &quot;[[New York, New York (On the Town)|New York, New York]]&quot; from [[On the Town (musical)|the 1944 musical comedy]] and 1949 film, ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' explains that &quot;The Bronx is up and [[The Battery (Manhattan)|the Battery]]'s down.&quot;
*&quot;[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]&quot; by [[Rodgers and Hart]] for the 1925 musical ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'' declares &quot;We'll have Manhattan,/The Bronx and Staten/Island too./It's lovely going through/the zoo.&quot;
* In Marc Ferris's 5-page, 15-column list of &quot;Songs and Compositions Inspired by New York City&quot; in ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'' (1995),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'', edited by [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] ([[Yale University Press]] and the [[New-York Historical Society]], New Haven, Connecticut, 1995 {{ISBN|0-300-05536-6}}), pages 1091–1095&lt;/ref&gt; only a handful refer to the Bronx; most refer to New York City proper, especially Manhattan and Brooklyn. Ferris's extensive but selective 1995 list mentions only four songs referring specifically to the Bronx: &quot;On the Banks of the Bronx&quot; (1919), [[William LeBaron]], [[Victor Jacobi]]; &quot;Bronx Express&quot; (1922), [[Henry Creamer]] and [[Henry Creamer]]; &quot;The [[Tremont Avenue]]&lt;!--intentional disambiguation--&gt; Cruisewear Fashion Show&quot; (1973), [[Jerry Livingston]], Mark David; &quot;I Love the [[New York Yankees]]&quot; (1987), Paula Lindstrom.
