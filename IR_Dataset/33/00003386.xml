The Black Sea is bordered by Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, and Russia. It has a positive [[water balance]]; that is, a net outflow of water {{convert|300|km3|abbr= on}} per year through the [[Bosphorus]] and the [[Dardanelles]] into the [[Aegean Sea]]. There is a two-way hydrological exchange: the more saline and therefore denser, but warmer, Mediterranean water flows into the Black Sea under its less saline outflow. This creates a significant [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] layer well below the surface waters. The Black Sea drains into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], via the Aegean Sea and various [[strait]]s, and is navigable to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The Bosphorus Strait connects it to the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the Strait of the [[Dardanelles]] connects that sea to the Aegean Sea region of the Mediterranean. The Black Sea is also connected, to the north, to the [[Sea of Azov]] by the [[Kerch Strait]].

The water level has varied significantly over geological time. Due to these variations in the water level in the basin, the surrounding shelf and associated aprons have sometimes been dry land. At certain critical water levels, connections with surrounding water bodies can become established. It is through the most active of these connective routes, the [[Turkish Straits]], that the Black Sea joins the [[world ocean]]. During geological periods when this hydrological link was not present, the Black Sea was an [[endorheic basin]], operating independently of the global ocean system (similar to the [[Caspian Sea]] nowadays). Currently, the Black Sea water level is relatively high; thus, water is being exchanged with the Mediterranean. The Turkish Straits connect the Black Sea with the Aegean Sea and comprise the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles. The [[Black Sea undersea river]] is a current of particularly saline water flowing through the Bosphorus Strait and along the [[seabed]] of the Black Sea. The discovery of the river announced on August 1, 2010, was made by scientists at the [[University of Leeds]] and is the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/7920006/Undersea-river-discovered-flowing-on-sea-bed.html|title=Undersea river discovered flowing on sea bed|last=Gray|first=Richard|date=August 1, 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undersea river stems from salty water spilling through the Bosphorus Strait from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea, where the water has a lower salt content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray&quot;/&gt;

Such names have not yet been shown conclusively to predate the 13th&amp;nbsp;century.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}}

In [[Greece]], the historical name &quot;Euxine Sea&quot;, which holds a different meaning (see below), is still widely used:
* [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el-Latn|Éfxeinos Póntos}} ({{lang|el|Eύξεινος Πόντος}}); the literal {{lang|el-Latn|Mavri Thalassa}} ({{lang|el|Μαύρη Θάλασσα}}) is less common

===Historical names and etymology===
The principal [[Greek language|Greek]] name &quot;Póntos Áxeinos&quot; is generally accepted to be a rendering of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] word {{lang|ira|*axšaina-}} (&quot;dark colored&quot;), compare [[Avestan language|Avestan]] {{lang|ae|axšaēna-}} (&quot;dark colored&quot;), [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] {{lang|peo|axšaina-}} (color of [[turquoise]]), [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] {{lang|pal|axšēn}}/{{lang|pal|xašēn}} (&quot;blue&quot;), and [[New Persian language|New Persian]] {{lang|fa-Latn|xašīn}} (&quot;blue&quot;), as well as [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]] {{lang|os|œxsīn}} (&quot;dark gray&quot;).{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} The ancient Greeks, most likely those living to the north of the Black Sea, subsequently adopted the name and altered it to {{lang|grc-Latn|á-xe(i)nos}}.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} Thereafter, Greek tradition refers to the Black Sea as the &quot;Inhospitable Sea&quot;, {{lang|grc|Πόντος Ἄξεινος}} {{transl|grc|ISO|''Póntos Áxeinos''}}, which is first attested in [[Pindar]] ({{circa|475&amp;thinsp;BC}}).{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} The name was considered to be &quot;ominous&quot; and was later changed into the euphemistic name &quot;Hospitable sea&quot;, {{lang|grc|Εὔξεινος Πόντος}} {{transl|grc|ISO|''Eúxeinos Póntos''}}, which was also for the first time attested in Pindar.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} This became the commonly used designation for the sea in Greek.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} In contexts related to mythology, the older form {{lang|grc-Latn|Póntos Áxeinos}} remained favored.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}}

It has been erroneously suggested that the name was derived from the color of the water, or was at least related to climatic conditions.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} Black or dark in this context, however, referred to a system in which colors represent the [[cardinal points]] of the known world.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} Black or dark represented the north; red the south; white the west; and green or light blue for the east.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} The symbolism based on cardinal points was used on multiple occasions and is therefore widely attested.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} For example, the &quot;Red Sea&quot;, a body of water reported since the time of [[Herodotus]] ({{circa|484}}–{{c.|425&amp;thinsp;BC|lk=no}}) in fact designated the [[Indian Ocean]], together with bodies of water now known as the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} According to the same explanation and reasoning, it is therefore considered to be impossible for the [[Scythians]], who principally roamed in present-day Ukraine and Russia, to have given the designation because they lived to the north of the sea, which would, therefore, be a southern body of water for them.{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}} The name could have only been given by people who were aware of both the northern &quot;black/dark&quot; and southern &quot;red&quot; seas; it is therefore considered probable it was given its name by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] (550–330&amp;thinsp; BC).{{sfn|Schmitt|1989|pages=310–313}}

[[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' (1.2.10) reports that in antiquity, the Black Sea was often simply called &quot;the Sea&quot; ({{lang|grc|ὁ πόντος}} {{transl|grc|ISO|''ho Pontos''}}). He also thought the Black Sea was called &quot;inhospitable&quot; before Greek colonization because it was difficult to navigate and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes.

The Black Sea is divided into two depositional basins—the Western Black Sea and Eastern Black Sea—separated by the Mid-Black Sea High, which includes the Andrusov Ridge, Tetyaev High, and Archangelsky High, extending south from the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]]. 
The basin includes two distinct relict [[back-arc basin]]s which were initiated by the splitting of an [[Albian]] [[volcanic arc]] and the [[subduction]] of both the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Paleo]]- and Neo-[[Tethys Ocean|Tethys]] Oceans, but the timings of these events remain uncertain. Arc volcanism and extension occurred as the Neo-Tethys Ocean subducted under the southern margin of [[Laurasia]] during the [[Mesozoic]]. Uplift and compressional deformation took place as the Neotethys continued to close. Seismic surveys indicate that rifting began in the Western Black Sea in the [[Barremian]] and [[Aptian]] followed by the formation of oceanic crust 20 million years later in the [[Santonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Petroleum Geology of the Black Sea|year=2018|publisher=The Geological Society of London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1q5oDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=geology+black+sea#v=onepage&amp;q=geology%20black%20sea&amp;f=false|page=2|editor1-last=Simmons|editor1-first=M.

===Oil and natural gas===
The Black Sea contains oil and natural gas resources but exploration in the sea is incomplete. As of 2017, 20 wells are in place. Throughout much of its existence, the Black Sea has had significant oil and gas-forming potential because of significant inflows of sediment and nutrient-rich waters. However, this varies geographically. For example, prospects are poorer off the coast of Bulgaria because of the large influx of sediment from the Danube River which obscured sunlight and diluted organic-rich sediments. Many of the discoveries to date have taken place offshore of Romania in the Western Black Sea and only a few discoveries have been made in the Eastern Black Sea.

During the [[Eocene]], the Paratethys Ocean was partially isolated and sea levels fell. During this time sand shed off the rising Balkanide, Pontide and Caucasus mountains trapped organic material in the Maykop Suite of rocks through the [[Oligocene]] and early [[Miocene]]. Natural gas appears in rocks deposited in the Miocene and Pliocene by the paleo-Dnieper and pale-Dniester rivers, or in deep-water Oligocene-age rocks. Serious exploration began in 1999 with two deep-water wells, Limanköy-1 and Limanköy-2, drilled in Turkish waters. Next, the HPX (Hopa)-1 deepwater well targeted late Miocene sandstone units in Achara-Trialet fold belt (also known as the Gurian fold belt) along the Georgia-Turkey maritime border. Although geologists inferred that these rocks might have hydrocarbons that migrated from the Maykop Suite, the well was unsuccessful. No more drilling happened for five years after the HPX-1 well. Then in 2010, Sinop-1 targeted carbonate reservoirs potentially charged from the nearby Maykop Suite on the Andrusov Ridge, but the well-struck only Cretaceous volcanic rocks. Yassihöyük-1 encountered similar problems. Other Turkish wells, Sürmene-1 and Sile-1 drilled in the Eastern Black Sea in 2011 and 2015 respectively tested four-way closures above Cretaceous volcanoes, with no results in either case. 
A different Turkish well, Kastamonu-1 drilled in 2011 did successfully find thermogenic gas in Pliocene and Miocene shale-cored anticlines in the Western Black Sea. A year later in 2012, Romania drilled Domino-1 which struck gas prompting the drilling of other wells in the Neptun Deep. In 2016, the Bulgarian well Polshkov-1 targeted Maykop Suite sandstones in the Polshkov High and Russia is in the process of drilling Jurassic carbonates on the Shatsky Ridge as of 2018. {{sfn|Simmons|Tari|Okay|2018|p=10-12}}

[[File: The Danube Spills into the Black Sea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|This [[SeaWiFS]] view reveals the colorful interplay of currents on the sea's surface]]

The Black Sea is a [[marginal sea]]&lt;ref name=Talley&gt;Descriptive Physical Oceanography. Talley, Pickard, Emery, Swift.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the world's largest body of water with a [[meromictic]] basin.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meromictic |title=Meromictic|publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] water.&lt;ref name=Exploring&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/blacksea/research/index.html |title=Exploring Ancient Mysteries: A Black Sea Journey |publisher=Ceoe.udel.edu |date= |accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Sea's circulation patterns are primarily controlled by basin topography and [[fluvial]] inputs, which result in a strongly stratified vertical structure. Because of the extreme stratification, it is classified as a [[estuary#Salt wedge|salt wedge estuary]].

The Black Sea only experiences water transfer with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], so all inflow and outflow occurs in the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]]. Inflow from the Mediterranean has a higher salinity and density than the outflow, creating the classical estuarine circulation. This means that the inflow of dense water from the Mediterranean occurs at the bottom of the basin while the outflow of fresher Black Sea surface-water into the [[Marmara Sea]] occurs near the surface. The outflow is 16 000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (around 500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) and the inflow is 11 000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s (around 350&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year), acc to Gregg (2002).&lt;ref name=Gregg&gt;Gregg, M. C., and E. O¨ zsoy (2002), Flow, water mass changes, and hydraulics in the Bosphorus, J. Geophys. Res., 107(C3), 3016, doi:10.1029/2000JC000485&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 
The following water budget can be estimated:
* Water IN:
** Total river discharge : 370&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Black Sea Commission, State of Environment Report 2001-2006/7, Chap. 1B |url=http://www.blacksea-commission.org/_publ-SOE2009-CH1B.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Precipitation : 180 km3/year&lt;ref name=Black_Sea_Commission&gt;{{cite news |title=Black Sea Commission, State of Environment Report 2001-2006/7, Chap. 1A |url=http://www.blacksea-commission.org/_publ-SOE2009-CH1A.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Inflow via Bosphorus : 350&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year&lt;ref name=Gregg /&gt;
* Water OUT:
** Evaporation : 400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year (reducing since the 1970’s)&lt;ref name=Black_Sea_Commission /&gt;
** Outflow via Bosphorus : 500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year&lt;ref name=Gregg /&gt;

The southern sill of the Bosphorus is located at -36.5 m below present sea level (deepest spot of the shallowest cross-section in the Bosphorus, located in front of [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]) and has a wet section of around 38 000 m2.&lt;ref name=Gregg /&gt; Inflow and outflow current speeds are averaged around 0.3 to 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, but much higher speeds are found locally, inducing significant turbulence and vertical shear. This allows for turbulent mixing of the two layers.&lt;ref name=Talley /&gt; Surface water leaves the Black Sea with a salinity of 17 [[Practical salinity unit|psu]] and reaches the Mediterranean with a salinity of 34 PSU. Likewise, an inflow of the Mediterranean with salinity 38.5 PSU experiences a decrease to about 34 psu.&lt;ref name=Talley /&gt;

Mean surface circulation is [[Cyclonic rotation|cyclonic]] and waters around the perimeter of the Black Sea circulate in a basin-wide shelfbreak [[gyre]] known as the Rim Current. The Rim Current has a maximum velocity of about 50–100&amp;nbsp; cm/s. Within this feature, two smaller cyclonic gyres operate, occupying the eastern and western sectors of the basin.&lt;ref name=Talley /&gt; The Eastern and Western Gyres are well-organized systems in the winter but dissipate into a series of interconnected [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] in the summer and autumn. Mesoscale activity in the peripheral flow becomes more pronounced during these warmer seasons and is subject to interannual variability.

Outside of the Rim Current, numerous quasi-permanent coastal eddies are formed as a result of upwelling around the coastal apron and &quot;wind curl&quot; mechanisms. The intra-annual strength of these features is controlled by seasonal atmospheric and fluvial variations. During the spring, the Batumi eddy forms in the southeastern corner of the sea.&lt;ref name=Korotaev&gt;{{Cite journal

Beneath the surface waters—from about 50–100 meters—there exists a [[halocline]] that stops at the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL). This layer is composed of cool, salty surface waters, which are the result of localized atmospheric cooling and decreased fluvial input during the winter months. It is the remnant of the winter surface mixed layer.&lt;ref name=Talley /&gt; The base of the CIL is marked by a major [[pycnocline]] at about {{convert|100|-|200|m|ft}} and this density disparity is the major mechanism for isolation of the deep water.

Below the pycnocline is the Deep Water mass, where salinity increases to 22.3 PSU and temperatures rise to around 8.9&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Talley /&gt; The hydrochemical environment shifts from oxygenated to anoxic, as bacterial decomposition of sunken biomass utilizes all of the free oxygen. Weak [[geothermal heating]] and long [[Residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] create a very thick convective bottom layer.&lt;ref name=Korotaev /&gt;

==Hydrochemistry==
Because of the anoxic water at depth, organic matter, including [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] artifacts such as boat hulls, are well preserved. During periods of high surface productivity, short-lived [[algae|algal]] blooms form organic rich layers known as [[sapropel]]s. Scientists have reported an annual [[phytoplankton]] bloom that can be seen in many NASA images of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=3669 Black Sea Becomes Turquoise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028221745/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/natural_hazards_v2.php3?img_id=3669 |date=October 28, 2008 }} earthobservatory.nasa.gov.

The Black Sea supports an active and dynamic marine ecosystem, dominated by species suited to the [[brackish]], nutrient-rich, conditions. As with all marine food webs, the Black Sea features a range of [[Trophic level|trophic]] groups, with [[autotrophic]] algae, including [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellates]], acting as primary producers. The fluvial systems draining Eurasia and central Europe introduce large volumes of sediment and dissolved nutrients into the Black Sea, but the distribution of these nutrients is controlled by the degree of physiochemical stratification, which is, in turn, dictated by seasonal physiographic development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oguz, T.|author2=H.

Generally, the annual cycle of phytoplankton development comprises significant diatom and dinoflagellate-dominated spring production, followed by a weaker mixed assemblage of community development below the seasonal thermocline during summer months and surface-intensified autumn production.&lt;ref name=Oguz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eker, E.|author2=L.

It is also possible that the low winter temperatures below {{convert|4|°C}} of the Black Sea prevent [[thermophilous]] species from becoming established. The relatively high organic matter content of Black Sea surface water favor the development of [[heterotrophic]] (an organism that uses organic carbon for growth) and mixotrophic dinoflagellates species (able to exploit different trophic pathways), relative to autotrophs. Despite its unique hydrographic setting, there are no confirmed [[endemism|endemic]] dinoflagellate species in the Black Sea.&lt;ref name=Gomez/&gt;
* [[Diatoms]]
: The Black Sea is populated by many species of the marine diatom, which commonly exist as colonies of [[unicellular]], non-motile auto- and [[heterotrophic]] [[algae]]. The life-cycle of most diatoms can be described as 'boom and bust' and the Black Sea is no exception, with diatom blooms occurring in surface waters throughout the year, most reliably during March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;/&gt; In simple terms, the phase of rapid population growth in diatoms is caused by the in-wash of [[silicon]]-bearing terrestrial sediments, and when the supply of silicon is exhausted, the diatoms begin to sink out of the photic zone and produce resting [[cysts]]. Additional factors such as predation by zooplankton and [[ammonium]]-based regenerated production also have a role to play in the annual diatom cycle.&lt;, ref name=&quot;Oguz99&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oguz/&gt; Typically, {{lang|la|Proboscia alata}} blooms during spring and {{lang|la|Pseudosolenia calcar-avis}} blooms during the autumn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eker-Develi, E 2003&quot;/&gt;
* [[Coccolithophores]]
: Coccolithophores are a type of [[Motility|motile]], [[autotrophic]] [[phytoplankton]] that produce CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plates, known as [[coccoliths]], as part of their life cycle. In the Black Sea, the main period of [[coccolithophore]] growth occurs after the bulk of the dinoflagellate growth has taken place. In May, the dinoflagellates move below the seasonal [[thermocline]], into deeper waters, where more nutrients are available. This permits coccolithophores to utilize the nutrients in the upper waters, and by the end of May, with favorable light and temperature conditions, growth rates reach their highest. The major bloom-forming species is {{lang|la|[[Emiliania huxleyi]]}}, which is also responsible for the release of [[dimethyl sulfide]] into the atmosphere. Overall, coccolithophore diversity is low in the Black Sea, and although recent sediments are dominated by {{lang|la|E. huxleyi}}, {{lang|la|Braarudosphaera bigelowii}}, [[Holocene]] sediments have also been shown to contain Helicopondosphaera and Discolithina species.
* [[Cyanobacteria]]
: Cyanobacteria are a phylum of [[picoplankton]]ic (plankton ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.0 [[micrometre|µm]]) [[bacteria]] that obtain their energy via [[photosynthesis]], and are present throughout the world's oceans. They exhibit a range of morphologies, including filamentous colonies and [[biofilms]]. In the Black Sea, several species are present, and as an example, ''Synechococcus'' spp. can be found throughout the photic zone, although concentration decreases with increasing depth. Other factors which exert an influence on distribution include nutrient availability, predation, and salinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vertical distribution of marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus spp. in the Black, Marmara, Aegean, and eastern Mediterranean seas|doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2006.03.016|year=2006|last1=Uysal|first1=Z|journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II|volume=53|issue=17–19|pages=1976–1987|bibcode=2006DSRII..53.1976U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animal species====
* [[Zebra mussel]]
: The Black Sea along with the [[Caspian Sea]] is part of the Zebra mussel's native range. The mussel has been accidentally introduced around the world and become an [[invasive species]] where it has been introduced.
* [[Common Carp]]
: The Common Carp's native range extends to The Black Sea along with the Caspian Sea and [[Aral Sea]]. Like the Zebra mussel the Common Carp is an invasive species when introduced to other habitats.
* [[Round Goby]]
: Is another native fish that is also found in the Caspian Sea. It preys upon Zebra mussels. Like the mussels and common carp it has become invasive when introduced to other environments, like the [[Great Lakes]].

====Ecological effects of pollution====
Since the 1960s, rapid industrial expansion along the Black Sea coast line and the construction of a major dam has significantly increased annual variability in the N:P:Si ratio in the basin. In coastal areas, the biological effect of these changes has been an increase in the frequency of monospecific phytoplankton blooms, with diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 2.5 and non-diatom bloom frequency increasing by a factor of 6. The non-diatoms, such as the prymnesiophytes {{lang|la|Emiliania huxleyi}} (coccolithophore), {{lang|la|Chromulina}} sp., and the Euglenophyte {{lang|la|Eutreptia lanowii}} are able to out-compete diatom species because of the limited availability of Si, a necessary constituent of diatom frustules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effect of Danube River dam on Black Sea biogeochemistry and ecosystem structure|doi=10.1038/386385a0|year=1997|last1=Humborg|first1=Christoph|last2=Ittekkot|first2=Venugopalan|last3=Cociasu|first3=Adriana|last4=Bodungen|first4=Bodo v.|journal=Nature|volume=386|issue=6623|pages=385–388|bibcode=1997Natur.386..385H}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these blooms, benthic macrophyte populations were deprived of light, while anoxia caused mass mortality in marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sburlea, A. |author2=L.

The decline in macrophytes was further compounded by overfishing during the 1970s, while the invasive ctenophore ''Mnemiopsis'' reduced the biomass of copepods and other zooplankton in the late 1980s. Additionally, an alien species—the [[warty comb jelly]] ({{lang|la|Mnemiopsis leidyi}})—was able to establish itself in the basin, exploding from a few individuals to estimated biomass of one billion metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Woodard|title=Ocean's end: travels through endangered seas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QsVeUi_XbF4C&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=August 1, 2011|date=February 11, 2001|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01571-9|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in species composition in Black Sea waters also has consequences for hydrochemistry, as Ca-producing coccolithophores influence salinity and pH, although these ramifications have yet to be fully quantified. In central Black Sea waters, Si levels were also significantly reduced, due to a decrease in the flux of Si associated with advection across isopycnal surfaces. This phenomenon demonstrates the potential for localized alterations in Black Sea nutrient input to have basin-wide effects.

Pollution reduction and regulation efforts have led to a partial recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem during the 1990s, and an EU monitoring exercise, 'EROS21', revealed decreased N and P values, relative to the 1989 peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/ecss.2000.0659|url=http://www.physoz.icbm.de/download/sebastian/ECSS_lsebs.pdf|title=Modelling the Danube-influenced North-western Continental Shelf of the Black Sea.

===Mediterranean connection during the Holocene===
[[File:Istanbul and Bosporus big.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Bosphorus]], taken from the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[File:Dardanelles map2.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the [[Dardanelles]]]]

The Black Sea is connected to the [[World Ocean]] by a chain of two shallow straits, the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]]. The Dardanelles is {{convert|55|m|abbr=on}} deep and the Bosphorus is as shallow as {{convert|36|m|abbr=on}}. By comparison, at the height of the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]], sea levels were more than {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} lower than they are now.

There is also evidence that water levels in the Black Sea were considerably lower at some point during the post-glacial period. Some researchers theorize that the Black Sea had been a landlocked freshwater lake (at least in upper layers) during the last glaciation and for some time after.

In the aftermath of the last glacial period, water levels in the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea rose independently until they were high enough to exchange water. The exact timeline of this development is still subject to debate. One possibility is that the Black Sea filled first, with excess freshwater flowing over the Bosphorus sill and eventually into the Mediterranean Sea. There are also catastrophic scenarios, such as the &quot;[[Black Sea deluge theory]]&quot; put forward by [[William Ryan (geologist)|William Ryan]], [[Walter Pitman (geologist)|Walter Pitman]] and [[:bg:Петко Димитров|Petko Dimitrov]].

====Deluge hypothesis====
{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}
The '''Black Sea deluge''' is a hypothesized catastrophic rise in the level of the Black Sea circa 5600 BC due to waters from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] breaching a sill in the [[Bosporus]] Strait. The hypothesis was headlined when ''[[The New York Times]]'' published it in December 1996, shortly before it was published in an [[academic journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |title=Geologists Link Black Sea Deluge To Farming's Rise |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 1996 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/17/science/geologists-link-black-sea-deluge-to-farming-s-rise.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is agreed that the sequence of events described did occur, there is debate over the suddenness, dating, and magnitude of the events. Relevant to the hypothesis is that its description has led some to connect this catastrophe with prehistoric [[Deluge (mythology)|flood myths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=William Ryan |author2=Walter Pitman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries About the Event That Changed History |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] Paperbacks |place=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-85920-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780684859200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recorded history===
[[File:Diego-homem-black-sea-ancient-map-1559.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|A medieval map of the Black Sea by [[Diogo Homem]].]]
[[File: Greek colonies of the Euxine Sea.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Greek colonies (8th–3rd century BCE) of the Black Sea (Euxine, or &quot;hospitable&quot; sea).]]
The Black Sea was a busy waterway on the crossroads of the ancient world: the Balkans to the west, the Eurasian [[steppe]]s to the north, the Caucasus and Central Asia to the east, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to the south, and Greece to the south-west.

The [[Varna Necropolis|oldest processed gold in the world]] was found in [[Varna]], Bulgaria, and the Black Sea was supposedly sailed by the [[Argonauts]]. The land at the eastern end of the Black Sea, [[Colchis]], (now [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), marked for the Greeks the edge of the known world.

The steppes to the north of the Black Sea have been suggested as the original homeland ({{lang|la|[[Urheimat]]}}) of the speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], (PIE) the progenitor of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, by some scholars such as [[Marija Gimbutas]]; others move the heartland further east towards the [[Caspian Sea]], yet others to [[Anatolia]].

The Black Sea became an [[Ottoman Navy]] lake within five years of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] losing the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]] in 1479, after which the only Western merchant vessels to sail its waters were those of [[Venice]]'s old rival [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]. This restriction was gradually changed by the [[Russian Navy]] from 1783 until the relaxation of export controls in 1789 because of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Venetian Empire 1200–1670|page=17|author=David Nicolle |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|year=1989|isbn=978-0-85045-899-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Economic Life in Ottoman Europe: Taxation, Trade and the Struggle for Land, 1600–1800, Studies in Modern Capitalism|page=134|author=Bruce McGowan|isbn=978-0-521-13536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Sea was a significant naval theatre of [[Naval warfare of World War I#Black Sea|World War I]] and saw both naval and land battles during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]].

===Archaeology===
[[File:Aivazovsky - Black Sea Fleet in the Bay of Theodosia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. ''Black Sea Fleet in the Bay of Theodosia'', just before the [[Crimean War]]]]
Ancient trade routes in the region are currently{{when|date=March 2015}} being extensively studied by scientists, as the Black Sea was sailed by [[Hittites]], [[Carians]], [[Colchis|Colchians]], [[Thracians]], [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Slavs]], [[Varangians]], [[Crusaders]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], [[Colchis|Georgians]], [[Tatars]] and [[Ottomans]].

Perhaps the most promising areas in deepwater archaeology are the quest for submerged prehistoric settlements in the continental shelf and for ancient shipwrecks in the anoxic zone, which are expected to be exceptionally well preserved due to the absence of oxygen. This concentration of [[historical powers]], combined with the preservative qualities of the deep [[anoxic waters]] of the Black Sea, has attracted increased interest from [[marine archaeology|marine archaeologists]] who have begun to discover a large number of [[Ancient Black Sea shipwrecks|ancient ships and organic remains]] in a high state of preservation.

===Commercial and civic use===
According to NATO, the Black sea is a strategic corridor that provides smuggling channels for moving legal and illegal goods including drugs, radioactive materials, and counterfeit goods that can be used to finance terrorism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Sea Security&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EfNxWxwDX0EC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=traffic+on+the+black+sea&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GfIlftezr-&amp;sig=yEUW3Hrr4YKsy7oZ5alRXPeo2Sc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PTRAU9_aCdWisAT2wIHAAg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBTgK#v=snippet&amp;q=traffic%20on%20the%20black%20sea&amp;f=false| title=Black Sea Security | work=NATO Advanced Research Workshop | date=2010 | accessdate=December 31, 2010 | agency=NATO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Navigation====

=====Ports and ferry terminals=====
According to the [[International Transport Workers' Federation]] 2013 study, there were at least 30 operating merchant [[seaport]]s in the Black Sea (including at least 12 in [[Ukraine]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Черное море признано&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.blackseanews.net/read/64439 | title=Черное море признано одним из самых неблагоприятных мест для моряков | work=[[International Transport Workers' Federation]] | date=May 27, 2013 | accessdate=September 20, 2013 | agency=BlackSeaNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Merchant fleet and traffic=====
According to the International Transport Workers' Federation 2013 study, there were around 2,400 commercial vessels operating in the Black Sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Черное море признано&quot; /&gt;

====Fishing====
[[European anchovy|Anchovy]]: the Turkish commercial fishing fleet catches around 300,000 tons per year on average, and fishery carried out mainly in winter and the highest portion of the stock is caught between November and December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamsi.ims.metu.edu.tr/sunumlar/6-Anchovy_Medias_2013.pdf Turkish Black Sea Acoustic Surveys: Winter distribution of anchovy along the Turkish coast] Serdar SAKINAN. Middle East Technical University – Institute of Marine Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydrocarbons exploration====
Since the 1980s, the [[Soviet Union]] started [[offshore drilling]] for [[petroleum]] in the sea's western portion (adjoining [[Ukraine]]'s coast). Independent Ukraine continued and intensified that effort within its [[exclusive economic zone]], inviting major international oil companies for exploration. Discovery of the new, massive oilfields in the area stimulated an influx of foreign investments. It also provoked a short-term peaceful [[territorial dispute]] with [[Romania]] which was resolved in 2011 by an international court redefining the exclusive economic zones between the two countries.

====Holiday resorts and spas====
[[File:Cities of the Black Sea.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Cities of the Black Sea]]

In the years following the end of the [[Cold War]], the popularity of the Black Sea as a [[tourism|tourist]] destination steadily increased. Tourism at Black Sea resorts became one of the region's growth industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bulgariansearesorts.com|title=Bulgarian Sea Resorts|accessdate=February 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of notable Black Sea [[resort]] towns:

===Modern military use===

====International and military use of the Straits====
The [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|1936 Montreux Convention]] provides for free passage of civilian ships between the international waters of the Black and the Mediterranean Seas. However, a single country (Turkey) has complete control over the straits connecting the two seas. Military ships are separate categories from civilian ships and they can only pass through the straits if the ship is belonging to a Black Seapower. Other military ships have the right to pass through the straits if they are not in a war against Turkey and they can stay in the Black Sea basin for a limited time. The 1982 amendments to the Montreux Convention allow Turkey to close the Straits at its discretion in both wartime and peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.yeniansiklopedi.com/bogazlar-sorunu/%20|title=Montreaux and The Bosphorus Problem|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1936 Montreux Convention governs the passage of vessels between the Black, the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and the presence of military vessels belonging to non-[[littoral]] states in the Black Sea waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karalahana.com/kafkasya-politika-strateji/Montro_TR.pdf|title=Montreaux Convention and Turkey (pdf)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319212703/http://www.karalahana.com/kafkasya-politika-strateji/Montro_TR.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2018, the [[Kerch Strait incident]] took place. The Russian Navy and Coast guard took control of three ships belonging to their counterparts. The ships were trying to enter the Black Sea&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/ukraine-ports-partially-unblocked-by-russia-says-kiev|title=Ukraine's ports partially unblocked by Russia, says Kiev|first=Associated|last=Press|date=December 4, 2018|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
