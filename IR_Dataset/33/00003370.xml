'''Boron nitride''' is a thermally and chemically resistant [[refractory]] compound of [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]] with the [[chemical formula]] '''BN'''. It exists in various [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystalline forms]] that are [[isoelectronic]] to a similarly structured [[carbon]] lattice. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] corresponding to [[graphite]] is the most stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic ([[Zincblende (crystal structure)#Zincblende structure|sphalerite structure]]) variety analogous to [[diamond]] is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] BN modification is similar to [[lonsdaleite]] but slightly softer than the cubic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1811.09503|doi = 10.1063/1.5082739|title = Myths about new ultrahard phases: Why materials that are significantly superior to diamond in elastic moduli and hardness are impossible|journal = Journal of Applied Physics|volume = 125|issue = 13|pages = 130901|year = 2019|last1 = Brazhkin|first1 = Vadim V.|last2 = Solozhenko|first2 = Vladimir L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of [[carbon nanotube]]s, i.e. [[graphene]] (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.

==Structure==
Boron nitride exists in multiple forms that differ in the arrangement of the boron and nitrogen atoms, giving rise to varying bulk properties of the material.

=== Amorphous form (a-BN) ===

The amorphous form of boron nitride (a-BN) is non-crystalline, lacking any long-distance regularity in the arrangement of its atoms. It is analogous to [[amorphous carbon]].

All other forms of boron nitride are crystalline.

=== Hexagonal form (h-BN) ===

The most stable crystalline form is the hexagonal one, also called h-BN, α-BN, g-BN, and ''graphitic boron nitride''. Hexagonal boron nitride (point group = D&lt;sub&gt;6h&lt;/sub&gt;; space group = P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc) has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong [[covalent bond]]s, whereas the layers are held together by weak [[van der Waals force]]s. The interlayer &quot;registry&quot; of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms. This registry reflects the polarity of the B–N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawaguchi, M. | title = Electronic Structure and Intercalation Chemistry of Graphite-Like Layered Material with a Composition of BC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N | journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids | volume = 69 | year = 2008 | page = 1171 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpcs.2007.10.076 |issue = 5–6 |bibcode = 2008JPCS...69.1171K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cubic form (c-BN) ===

Cubic boron nitride has a crystal structure analogous to that of [[diamond]]. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate between the two is negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, the same as that of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.

=== Wurtzite form (w-BN) ===

The [[Wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] form of boron nitride (w-BN; point group = C&lt;sub&gt;6v&lt;/sub&gt;; space group = P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;mc) has the same structure as [[lonsdaleite]], a rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into [[tetrahedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Silberberg, M. S. | title = Chemistry: The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change | edition = 5th | location = New York | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2009 | page = 483 |isbn=978-0073048598}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the cubic form, the boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into 6-membered rings; in the cubic form all rings are in the [[chair configuration]], in w-BN the rings between 'layers' are in [[boat configuration]]. Earlier  optimistic reports predicted that the Wurtzite form is thought to be very strong, and was estimated by a simulation as potentially having a strength 18% stronger than that of diamond, but because only small amounts of the mineral exist in nature, this has not yet been experimentally verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16610-diamond-no-longer-natures-hardest-material/ |title=Diamond no longer nature's hardest material |last=Griggs |first=Jessica  |date=2014-05-13 |website=New Scientist |access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;, recent studies measured w-BN hardness at 46 GPa slightly harder than commercial Borides, but softer than the cubic form of Boron Nitride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1811.09503|doi = 10.1063/1.5082739|title = Myths about new ultrahard phases: Why materials that are significantly superior to diamond in elastic moduli and hardness are impossible|journal = Journal of Applied Physics|volume = 125|issue = 13|pages = 130901|year = 2019|last1 = Brazhkin|first1 = Vadim V.|last2 = Solozhenko|first2 = Vladimir L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partly [[ionic bond|ionic]] structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large [[band gap]]. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the [[basal plane]]s (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high [[anisotropy]] of most properties of h-BN.

For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.

Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of bulk c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pan, Z. | title = Harder than Diamond: Superior Indentation Strength of Wurtzite BN and Lonsdaleite | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 102 | page = 055503 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.055503 | pmid = 19257519 | bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102e5503P | issue = 5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycrystalline c-BN with grain sizes on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;nm is also reported to have [[Vickers hardness]] comparable or higher than diamond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tian, Yongjun |doi=10.1038/nature11728|title=Ultrahard nanotwinned cubic boron nitride|year=2013|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7432|pages=385–8|pmid=23325219|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2013Natur.493..385T }}

===Thermal stability===
Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition at temperatures up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in air, 1400&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, and 2800&amp;nbsp;°C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below.

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;
*In air or oxygen: B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300&amp;nbsp;°C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400&amp;nbsp;°C.
*In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525&amp;nbsp;°C after 12&amp;nbsp;h.
*In vacuum ({{val|e=-5|u=Pa}}): conversion to h-BN at 1550–1600&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Chemical stability===
Boron nitride is insoluble in the usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as [[Lithium hydroxide|LiOH]], [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]], [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]]-[[Sodium carbonate|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Sodium nitrate|NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium nitride|Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N]], [[Magnesium nitride|Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Strontium nitride|Sr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Barium nitride|Ba&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or [[Lithium boron nitride|Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which are therefore used to etch BN.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

===Thermal conductivity===
The theoretical thermal conductivity of hexagonal Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) can approach 1700–2000 W/(m·K), which has the same order of magnitude as the experimental measured value for [[graphene]], and can be comparable to the theoretical calculations for graphene nanoribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lan, J.

The thermal conductivity of zigzag-edged BNNRs is about 20% larger than that of armchair-edged nanoribbons at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Thermal Transport in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoribbons | doi = 10.1088/0957-4484/21/24/245701 | pmid = 20484794 | journal = Nanotechnology | volume = 21 | issue = 24 | year = 2010 | page = 245701 |bibcode = 2010Nanot..21x5701O | last1 = Ouyang | first1 = Tao | last2 = Chen | first2 = Yuanping | last3 = Xie | first3 = Yuee | last4 = Yang | first4 = Kaike | last5 = Bao | first5 = Zhigang | last6 = Zhong | first6 = Jianxin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
In 2009, a naturally occurring boron nitride mineral in the cubic form (c-BN) was reported in [[Tibet]], with a proposed name of ''[[qingsongite]]''. The substance was found in dispersed [[micron]]-sized inclusions in chromium-rich rocks. In 2013, the International Mineralogical Association affirmed the mineral and the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobrzhinetskaya, L.F. |year=2013|title=Qingsongite, IMA 2013-030|journal=CNMNC Newsletter|volume=16|pages=2708|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dobrzhinetskaya, L.F. |year=2014|title=Qingsongite, natural cubic boron nitride: The first boron mineral from the Earth's mantle|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=99|issue=4|pages=764–772|url=http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/toc/Abstracts/2014_Abstracts/APR14_Abstracts/Dobr_p764_14.pdf|doi=10.2138/am.2014.4714|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2014AmMin..99..764D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

===Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN===
Boron nitride is produced synthetically. Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or boric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[urea]] (CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a nitrogen atmosphere:&lt;ref name=prod&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rudolph, S. | journal = American Ceramic Society Bulletin | volume = 79 | year = 2000 | page = 50 | url = http://www.a-m.de/deu/literatur/cb0600.html | title = Boron Nitride (BN) | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306221940/http://www.a-m.de/deu/literatur/cb0600.html | archivedate = 2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BN + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (T = 900&amp;nbsp;°C)
:B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → BN + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (T = 900&amp;nbsp;°C)
:B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BN + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (T &gt; 1000&amp;nbsp;°C)
:B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 CaB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 20 BN + 3 CaO (T &gt; 1500&amp;nbsp;°C)

The resulting disordered ([[amorphous]]) boron nitride contains 92–95% BN and 5–8% B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The remaining B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures {{nowrap|&gt; 1500 °C}} in order to achieve BN concentration &gt;98%. Such annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm | accessdate = 2009-06-06 | title = Synthesis of Boron Nitride from Oxide Precursors | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212115253/http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm | archivedate = December 12, 2007 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

h-BN parts can be fabricated inexpensively by hot-pressing with subsequent machining. The parts are made from boron nitride powders adding boron oxide for better compressibility. Thin films of boron nitride can be obtained by [[chemical vapor deposition]] from [[boron trichloride]] and nitrogen precursors.&lt;ref name=cvd&gt;{{cite journal | title = Review of Advances in Cubic Boron Nitride Film Synthesis | author = Mirkarimi, P.

Boron nitride reacts with [[iodine monofluoride|iodine fluoride]] in [[trichlorofluoromethane]] at −30&amp;nbsp;°C to produce an extremely sensitive [[contact explosive]], NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in low yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tornieporth-Oetting, I. |author2=Klapötke, T. | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | year = 1990 | volume = 29 | pages =677–679 | doi = 10.1002/anie.199006771 | title = Nitrogen Triiodide | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercalation of hexagonal BN===

===Preparation of cubic BN===
Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as [[synthetic diamond]] is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18&amp;nbsp;GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230&amp;nbsp;°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion.&lt;ref name=wentorf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wentorf, R. H. Jr. | authorlink = Robert H. Wentorf, Jr. |date=March 1961 | title = Synthesis of the Cubic Form of Boron Nitride | journal = Journal of Chemical Physics | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 809–812 | doi = 10.1063/1.1731679 |bibcode = 1961JChPh..34..809W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of a small amount of boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7&amp;nbsp;GPa and temperature to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine.&lt;ref name=vel&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0921-5107(91)90121-B | title = Cubic Boron Nitride: Synthesis, Physicochemical Properties and Applications | author = Vel, L. | journal = Materials Science and Engineering: B | volume = 10 | year = 1991 | page = 149 | issue = 2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fukunaga, O. | title = Science and Technology in the Recent Development of Boron Nitride Materials | year = 2002 | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume = 14 | page = 10979 | doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/14/44/413 | issue = 44 |bibcode = 2002JPCM...1410979F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive [[shock wave]]. The shock wave method is used to produce material called [[heterodiamond]], a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Komatsu, T. | title = Creation of Superhard B–C–N Heterodiamond Using an Advanced Shock Wave Compression Technology | journal = Journal of Materials Processing Technology | volume = 85 | issue = 1–3 | year = 1999 | page = 69 | doi = 10.1016/S0924-0136(98)00263-5 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, [[boron trifluoride]] is used for c-BN. [[Ion beam deposition]], [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]], [[pulsed laser deposition]], [[Sputter deposition|reactive sputtering]], and other [[physical vapor deposition]] methods are used as well.&lt;ref name=cvd/&gt;

===Preparation of wurtzite BN===
Wurtzite BN can be obtained via static high-pressure or dynamic shock methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Characterization of Wurtzite Type Boron Nitride Synthesized by Shock Compression | author = Soma, T. | journal = Materials Research Bulletin | volume = 9 | year = 1974 | page = 755 | doi = 10.1016/0025-5408(74)90110-X | issue = 6 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limits of its stability are not well defined. Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much lower temperatures close to 1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=vel/&gt;

===Production statistics===
Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see [[boron]]), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about $75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200–$400/kg for high purity BN grades.&lt;ref name=prod/&gt;

==Applications==

===Hexagonal BN===
{{main|Synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride}}
[[Image:BNcrucible.jpg|thumb|right|Ceramic BN crucible]]
Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900&amp;nbsp;°C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere). h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in [[cosmetics]], [[paint]]s, [[dental cement]]s, and [[pencil]] leads.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Greim, Jochen |author2=Schwetz, Karl A. | chapter = Boron Carbide, Boron Nitride, and Metal Borides | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_295.pub2 |isbn=978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in [[Japan]]. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application. Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundations]], [[make-up]], [[eye shadow]]s, blushers, [[eye liner|kohl pencils]], [[lipstick]]s and other skincare products.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;

Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] and in steelmaking.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt; Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion as well as higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows and as a structural material for seals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis, R.F. | title = III-V Nitrides for Electronic and Optoelectronic Applications | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | year = 1991 | volume= 79 | pages = 702–712 | doi = 10.1109/5.90133 | issue= 5 | url = http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.2/610 | bibcode = 1991IEEEP..79..702D }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as dielectric in resistive random access memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Chengbin|last2=Ji|first2=Yanfeng|last3=Xiao|first3=Na|last4=Hui|first4=Fei|last5=Tang|first5=Kechao|last6=Guo|first6=Yuzheng|last7=Xie|first7=Xiaoming|last8=Puglisi|first8=Francesco M.|last9=Larcher|first9=Luca|date=2017-01-01|title=Coexistence of Grain-Boundaries-Assisted Bipolar and Threshold Resistive Switching in Multilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=27|issue=10|pages=1604811|doi=10.1002/adfm.201604811}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Puglisi|first=F.

The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.&lt;ref name=dkg/&gt;

Parts can be made by [[hot pressing]] from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a [[boron trioxide|boron oxide]] [[binder (material)|binder]]; it is usable up to 550–850&amp;nbsp;°C in oxidizing atmosphere and up to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a [[calcium borate]] binder and is usable at 1600&amp;nbsp;°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder and can be used up to 3000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Harper, Charles A. | title = Handbook of Ceramics, Glasses and Diamonds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0070267121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

h-BN has been used since the mid-2000s as a bullet and bore lubricant in precision target rifle applications as an alternative to [[molybdenum disulfide]] coating, commonly referred to as &quot;moly&quot;. It is claimed to increase effective barrel life, increase intervals between bore cleaning, and decrease the deviation in point of impact between clean bore first shots and subsequent shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bulletin.accurateshooter.com/2014/09/hexagonal-boron-nitride-hbn-how-well-does-it-work/ | title = Hexagonal Boron Nitride (HBN) — How Well Does It Work? | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | date = 8 September 2014 | website = AccurateShooter.com | access-date = 28 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cubic boron nitride===
Cubic boron nitride (CBN or c-BN) is widely used as an [[abrasive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mprg&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Todd RH, Allen DK, Dell KAlting L | year = 1994 | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide | publisher = Industrial Press Inc. | pages = 43–48 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | isbn = 978-0-8311-3049-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in [[iron]], [[nickel]], and related [[alloy]]s at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a [[Passivation_(chemistry)#Surface_passivation|passivation layer]] of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the [[tool bit]]s of [[cutting tool]]s. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders can be used as well. Commercial products are known under names &quot;[[Borazon]]&quot; (by Diamond Innovations), and &quot;Elbor&quot; or &quot;Cubonite&quot; (by Russian vendors).&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for [[heat spreader]]s.

As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=El Khakani, M.

===Amorphous boron nitride===
Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some [[semiconductor device]]s, e.g. [[MOSFET]]s. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of [[trichloroborazine|trichloro]][[borazine]] with [[caesium]], or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schmolla, W. | title = Positive Drift Effect of BN-InP Enhancement N-Channel MISFET | doi =10.1080/00207218508939000 | journal = International Journal of Electronics | volume = 58 | year = 1985 | page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other forms of boron nitride==
=== Atomically thin boron nitride ===
Hexagonal boron nitride can be exfoliated to mono or few atomic layer sheets.

'''Mechanical properties.''' Atomically thin boron nitride is one of the strongest electrically insulating materials. Monolayer boron nitride has an average Young's modulus of 0.865TPa and fracture strength of 70.5GPa, and in contrast to graphene, whose strength decreases dramatically with increased thickness, few-layer boron nitride sheets have a strength similar to that of monolayer boron nitride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falin|first=Aleksey|last2=Cai|first2=Qiran|last3=Santos|first3=Elton J.G.|last4=Scullion|first4=Declan|last5=Qian|first5=Dong|last6=Zhang|first6=Rui|last7=Yang|first7=Zhi|last8=Huang|first8=Shaoming|last9=Watanabe|first9=Kenji|date=2017-06-22|title=Mechanical properties of atomically thin boron nitride and the role of interlayer interactions|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15815|doi=10.1038/ncomms15815|pmid=28639613|pmc=5489686|bibcode=2017NatCo...815815F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal stability.''' The air stability of graphene shows a clear thickness dependence: monolayer graphene is reactive to oxygen at 250&amp;nbsp;°C, strongly doped at 300&amp;nbsp;°C, and etched at 450&amp;nbsp;°C; in contrast, bulk graphite is not oxidized until 800&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;LiSantos2014&quot;/&gt; Atomically thin boron nitride has much better oxidation resistance than graphene.

'''Dielectric properties.''' Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride is an excellent dielectric substrate for graphene, molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and many other 2D material-based electronic and photonic devices. As shown by electric force microscopy (EFM) studies, the electric field screening in atomically thin boron nitride shows a weak dependence on thickness, which is in line with the smooth decay of electric field inside few-layer boron nitride revealed by the first-principles calculations.&lt;ref name=&quot;LiSantos2014&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Lu Hua|last2=Santos|first2=Elton J.

===Boron nitride aerogel===
{{main|Boron nitride aerogel}}
Boron nitride aerogel is an [[aerogel]] made of highly porous BN. It typically consists of a mixture of deformed BN nanotubes and [[Boron nitride nanosheet|nanosheets]]. It can have a density as low as 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g, and therefore has potential applications as an [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], catalyst support and gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly [[hydrophobic]] and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in oil. They are resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted [[chemical vapor deposition]] using [[borazine]] as the feed gas.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt;

===Composites containing BN===
Addition of boron nitride to [[silicon nitride]] ceramics improves the [[thermal shock]] resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-[[alumina]] and [[titanium nitride]]-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and [[zirconia]], [[borosilicate glass]]es, [[glass ceramic]]s, [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], and composite ceramics with [[titanium boride]]-boron nitride, titanium boride-[[aluminium nitride]]-boron nitride, and [[silicon carbide]]-boron nitride composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Handbook of Composite Reinforcements | author = Lee, S.

==Health issues==
Boron nitride (along with Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak [[fibrogenic]] activity, and to cause [[pneumoconiosis]] when inhaled in particulate form. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;
