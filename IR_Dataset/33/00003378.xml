'''Beryllium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Be''' and [[atomic number]] 4. It is a [[Abundance of the chemical elements#Universe|relatively rare]] element in the [[universe]], usually occurring as a product of the [[spallation]] of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with [[cosmic ray]]s. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. It is a [[divalent]] element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable [[gemstones]] which contain beryllium include [[beryl]] ([[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[emerald]]) and [[chrysoberyl]]. As a free [[Chemical element|element]] it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle [[alkaline earth metal]].

In structural applications, the combination of high [[flexural rigidity]], [[thermal stability]], [[thermal conductivity]] and low [[density]] (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable [[aerospace]] material for aircraft components, [[missile]]s, [[spacecraft]], and [[satellites]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Because of its low density and [[atomic mass]], beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of [[ionizing radiation]]; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of [[particle detector]]s.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and [[beryllium oxide]] have led to their use in thermal management applications. When added as an [[alloy]]ing element to [[aluminium]], [[copper]] (notably the alloy [[beryllium copper]]), [[iron]] or [[nickel]] beryllium improves many physical properties.{{such as|date=April 2019}}&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Tools made of [[beryllium copper]] [[alloy]]s are [[Strength of materials|strong]] and [[Hardness|hard]] and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. Beryllium does not form oxides until it reaches very high temperatures.

The commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the [[toxicity]] of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called [[berylliosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nchem.1033|title=A brighter beryllium|date=2011|last1=Puchta|first1=Ralph|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=3|issue=5|pages=416|pmid=21505503|bibcode=2011NatCh...3..416P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical properties===
Beryllium is a steel gray and hard [[metal]] that is brittle at room temperature and has a close-packed hexagonal [[crystal structure]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter&gt;{{cite book

 | date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has exceptional [[stiffness]] ([[Young's modulus]] 287 GPa) and a [[melting point]] of 1287 C. The [[modulus of elasticity]] of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast [[speed of sound|sound conduction speed]] in beryllium – about 12.9&amp;nbsp;km/s at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]]. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear [[thermal expansion]] (11.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.&lt;ref name=Be&gt;{{Cite book| title=Landolt-Börnstein&amp;nbsp;– Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data.

===Nuclear properties===
Naturally occurring beryllium, save for slight contamination by the cosmogenic radioisotopes, is isotopically pure beryllium-9, which has a [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] of {{sfrac|3|2}}. Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 [[barn (unit)|barns]] for energies above approximately 10&amp;nbsp;keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and [[neutron moderator]], effectively slowing the neutrons to the [[neutron temperature|thermal energy]] range of below 0.03&amp;nbsp;eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower – exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.

The single primordial beryllium isotope &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9&amp;nbsp;MeV, to produce &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:&lt;ref name =&quot;BeMelurgy&quot;/&gt;
:{{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n → 2 {{nuclide|Helium|4}} + 2 n

Neutrons are liberated when beryllium [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are struck by energetic [[alpha particle]]s&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; producing the nuclear reaction
:{{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + {{nuclide|Helium|4}} → {{nuclide|Carbon|12}} + n
where {{nuclide|Helium|4}} is an alpha particle and {{nuclide|Carbon|12}} is a [[carbon-12]] nucleus.&lt;ref name =&quot;BeMelurgy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=FCnUN45cL1cC&amp;pg=PA239|page=239|chapter=Nuclear Properties|title=Beryllium its Metallurgy and Properties|publisher=University of California Press|first=Henry H.|last=Hausner| date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered [[nuclear reaction]] [[neutron source]]s for the laboratory production of free neutrons.

Small amounts of [[tritium]] are liberated when {{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step nuclear reaction
:{{nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n → {{nuclide|Helium|4}} + {{nuclide|Helium|6}},&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{nuclide|Helium|6}} → {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} + n → {{nuclide|Helium|4}} + {{nuclide|Hydrogen|3}} 
Note that {{nuclide|Helium|6}} has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds, β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is an electron, and {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} has a high neutron absorption cross-section. Tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomberlin|first1=T.

As a metal, beryllium is [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to most wavelengths of [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, making it useful for the output windows of [[X-ray tube]]s and other such apparatus.

===Isotopes and nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Isotopes of beryllium}}
Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when [[cosmic rays]] induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ILQ7sTrRixMC&amp;pg=PA172|title=Physics: 1981–1990|author=Ekspong, G. |publisher=World Scientific|date=1992|pages=172 ff|isbn=978-981-02-0729-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be, and therefore beryllium is a [[monoisotopic element|monoisotopic]] and [[mononuclidic element]].

[[File:Solar Activity Proxies.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in sunspot number (red) and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be concentration (blue). Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be levels]]
Radioactive [[cosmogenic]] [[beryllium-10|&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be]] is produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]] by the [[cosmic ray spallation]] of [[oxygen]]&lt;!-- NEEDS CITE and [[nitrogen]]--&gt;.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=56}} &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be accumulates at the [[soil]] surface, where its relatively long [[half-life]] (1.36 million years) permits a long [[residence time (fluid dynamics)|residence time]] before decaying to [[boron]]-10. Thus, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural [[soil erosion]], [[soil formation]] and the development of [[laterite|lateritic soils]], and as a [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for measurement of the variations in [[solar variation|solar activity]] and the age of [[ice core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/beryllium.html|title=Beryllium: Isotopes and Hydrology|publisher=University of Arizona, Tucson |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased [[solar wind]] during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s that reach the Earth.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=56}} Nuclear explosions also form &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at [[nuclear weapon test]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.016|date=Feb 2008|author=Whitehead, N|author2=Endo, S|author3=Tanaka, K|author4=Takatsuji, T|author5=Hoshi, M|author6=Fukutani, S|author7=Ditchburn, Rg|author8=Zondervan, A|title=A preliminary study on the use of (10)Be in forensic radioecology of nuclear explosion sites|volume=99|issue=2|pages=260–70 |pmid=17904707|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The isotope &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be.

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be has a very short half-life of about 8{{e|-17}}&amp;nbsp;s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=R. N. |last2=Kajino |first2= T. |date=1989 |title=Can Be-9 provide a test of cosmological theories? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=336|bibcode=1989ApJ...336L..55B |pages=L55 |doi=10.1086/185360}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's [[nucleosynthesis]] phase to produce carbon by the fusion of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available [[beryllium-8]]. British [[astronomer]] Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] first showed that the energy levels of &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C allow carbon production by the so-called [[triple-alpha process]] in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of [[carbon-based life]]) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by [[AGB star]]s and [[supernova]]e (see also [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]), as well as the creation of all other elements with [[atomic number]]s larger than that of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PXGWGnPPo0gC&amp;pg=PA223|page=223|title=Supernovae and nucleosynthesis|author=Arnett, David |publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1996|isbn=978-0-691-01147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be decays by L-[[electron capture]], it does so by taking electrons from its [[atomic orbital]]s that may be participating in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings&amp;nbsp;– a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html|title=How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates|first=Bill|last=Johnson|publisher=University of California, Riverside|accessdate =30 March 2008 |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Be which decays through [[neutron emission]]. It has a half-life of 2.7&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; s.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Hammond, C.

==Production==
The extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. Currently the United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://beryllium.com/About-Beryllium/Sources%20of%20Beryllium.aspx |title=Sources of Beryllium |publisher=Materion Corporation |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan produces Be from a concentrate stockpiled before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]] around 1991. This resource has become nearly depleted by mid-2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prd-wret/assets/palladium/production/mineral-pubs/beryllium/myb1-2016-beryl.pdf &quot;Beryllim&quot;] in ''2016 Minerals Yearbook''. [[USGS]] (September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of beryllium in Russia was halted in 1997, and is planned to being resumed in the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tass.ru/ural-news/6431308 Уральский производитель изумрудов планирует выпускать стратегический металл бериллий].

Beryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral [[beryl]], which is either [[sintering|sintered]] using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with [[sodium fluorosilicate]] and soda at {{convert|770|C|F}} to form [[Tetrafluoroberyllate|sodium fluoroberyllate]], [[aluminium oxide]] and [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; [[Beryllium hydroxide]] is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and [[sodium hydroxide]] in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to {{convert|1650|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated {{convert|250|to|300|C|F}} in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], mostly yielding [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[aluminium sulfate]].&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Aqueous [[ammonia]] is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.

Beryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into [[beryllium fluoride]] or [[beryllium chloride]]. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to {{convert|1000|C|F}} to form beryllium fluoride.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Heating the fluoride to {{convert|900|C|F}} with [[magnesium]] forms finely divided beryllium, and additional heating to {{convert|1300|C|F}} creates the compact metal.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine. [[Electrolysis]] of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;

A beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The predominant [[oxidation state]] of beryllium is +2; the beryllium atom has lost both of its valence electrons. Lower oxidation states have been found in, for example, bis(carbene) compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arrowsmith|first=Merle|last2=Braunschweig|first2=Holger|last3=Celik|first3=Mehmet Ali|last4=Dellermann|first4=Theresa|last5=Dewhurst|first5=Rian D.|last6=Ewing|first6=William C.|last7=Hammond|first7=Kai|last8=Kramer|first8=Thomas|last9=Krummenacher|first9=Ivo|title=Neutral zero-valent s-block complexes with strong multiple bonding|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=8|issue=9|pages=890–894|doi=10.1038/nchem.2542|pmid=27334631|bibcode=2016NatCh...8..890A|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Beryllium's chemical behavior is largely a result of its small [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic]] radii. It thus has very high [[ionization potential]]s and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are [[Covalent bond|covalent]]. Its chemistry has similarities with the chemistry of aluminium, an example of a [[diagonal relationship]]. An oxide layer forms on the surface of beryllium metal that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of [[beryllium oxide]] and [[beryllium nitride]]. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-[[oxidizing acid]]s, such as HCl and diluted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but not in [[nitric acid]] or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary compounds of beryllium(II) are polymeric in the solid state. [[Beryllium fluoride|BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] has a [[silica]]-like structure with corner-shared BeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra. [[Beryllium chloride|BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[beryllium bromide|BeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. [[Beryllium oxide]], BeO, is a white [[refractory]] solid, which has the [[zinc sulfide|wurtzite]] crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as some metals. BeO is [[amphoteric]]. Beryllium [[sulfide]], [[selenide]] and [[telluride (chemistry)|telluride]] are known, all having the [[Cubic crystal system#Zincblende structure|zincblende structure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wiberg, Egon|author2=Holleman, Arnold Frederick|date=2001|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beryllium nitride]], Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is known and beryllium phosphide, Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a similar structure to Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A number of beryllium [[boride]]s are known, such as Be&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;B, Be&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B, Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B, BeB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BeB&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and BeB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Beryllium carbide]], Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give [[methane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;/&gt; No beryllium [[silicide]] has been identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt;

The halides BeX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X=F, Cl, Br, I) have a linear monomeric molecular structure in the gas phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt; Complexes of the halides are formed with one or more ligands donating at total of two pairs of electrons. Such compounds obey the [[octet rule]]. Other 4-coordinate complexes such as the aqua-ion [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; also obey the octet rule.

Solutions of beryllium salts, such as [[beryllium sulfate]] and [[beryllium nitrate]], are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. The concentration of the first hydrolysis product, [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is less than 1% of the beryllium concentration. The most stable hydrolysis product is the [[trimer (chemistry)|trimeric]] ion [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Beryllium hydroxide]], Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is insoluble in water at pH 5 or more. Consequently, beryllium compounds are generally insoluble at biological pH. Because of this, inhalation of beryllium metal dust by people leads to the development of the fatal condition of [[berylliosis]]. Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolves in strongly [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] solutions. In [[basic beryllium acetate]] the central oxygen atom is surrounded by a tetrahedron of beryllium atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;/&gt; [[Beryllium difluoride]], unlike the other alkaline earth difluorides, is very soluble in water,.&lt;ref name=&quot;dissolve&quot;&gt;{{cite book|pages=278–80|title=First Outlines of a Dictionary of Solubilities of Chemical Substances| author= Storer, Frank Humphreys| publisher= Cambridge| date=1864| isbn=978-1-176-62256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aqueous solutions of this salt contain ions such as [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beryllium halide and pseudohalides&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in inorganic chemistry and radiochemistry|volume=14|date=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-12-023614-5|pages=256–277|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=VupzlLU9NB0C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=beryllium+fluoride+covalent#v=onepage&amp;q=beryllium%20fluoride%20covalent&amp;f=false|author=Bell, N.

==History==
The mineral [[beryl]], which contains beryllium, has been used at least since the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535}} In the first century [[Common Era|CE]], Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned in his encyclopedia ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that beryl and [[emerald]] (&quot;smaragdus&quot;) were similar.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=536}} The [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis]], written in the third or fourth century CE, contains notes on how to prepare artificial emerald and beryl.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=536}}

[[File:Louis Nicolas Vauquelin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] discovered beryllium]]
Early analyses of emeralds and beryls by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Torbern Olof Bergman]], [[Franz Karl Achard]], and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are [[aluminium silicate]]s.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=537}} Mineralogist [[René Just Haüy]] discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] for a chemical analysis.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=535}}

In a 1798 paper read before the [[Institut de France]], Vauquelin reported that he found a new &quot;earth&quot; by dissolving [[aluminium hydroxide]] from emerald and beryl in an additional [[alkali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annales de Chimie| first=Louis-Nicolas|last=Vauquelin|title=De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre|trans-title=Aquamarine or beryl; and discovery of a new earth in this stone | date=1798| volume=26|pages=155–169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the journal ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'' named the new earth &quot;glucine&quot; for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.&lt;ref&gt;In a footnote on [https://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 169] of (Vauquelin, 1798), the editors write: &quot;(1) La propriété la plus caractéristique de cette terre, confirmée par les dernières expériences de notre collègue, étant de former des sels d'une saveur sucrée, nous proposons de l'appeler ''glucine'', de γλυχυς, ''doux'', γλυχύ, ''vin doux'', γλυχαιτω, ''rendre doux'' … ''Note des Rédacteurs''.&quot; ((1) The most characteristic property of this earth, confirmed by the recent experiments of our colleague [Vauquelin], being to form salts with a sweet taste, we propose to call it ''glucine'' from γλυχυς, ''sweet'', γλυχύ, ''sweet wine'', γλυχαιτω, ''to make sweet'' … ''Note of the editors''.)&lt;/ref&gt; Klaproth preferred the name &quot;beryllina&quot; due to the fact that [[yttria]] also formed sweet salts.&lt;ref&gt;Klaproth, Martin Heinrich, ''Beitrage zur Chemischen Kenntniss der Mineralkörper'' (Contribution to the chemical knowledge of mineral substances), vol. 3, (Berlin, (Germany): Heinrich August Rottmann, 1802), [https://books.google.com/books?id=8A8KAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 78–79]: &quot;Als Vauquelin der von ihm im Beryll und Smaragd entdeckten neuen Erde, wegen ihrer Eigenschaft, süsse Mittelsalze zu bilden, den Namen ''Glykine'', ''Süsserde'', beilegte, erwartete er wohl nicht, dass sich bald nachher eine anderweitige Erde finden würde, welche mit völlig gleichem Rechte Anspruch an diesen Namen machen können. Um daher keine Verwechselung derselben mit der Yttererde zu veranlassen, würde es vielleicht gerathen seyn, jenen Namen ''Glykine'' aufzugeben, und durch Beryllerde (''Beryllina'') zu ersetzen; welche Namensveränderung auch bereits vom Hrn. Prof. Link, und zwar aus dem Grunde empfohlen worden, weil schon ein Pflanzengeschlecht ''Glycine'' vorhanden ist.&quot; (When Vauquelin conferred – on account of its property of forming sweet salts – the name ''glycine'', ''sweet-earth'', on the new earth that had been found by him in beryl and smaragd, he certainly didn't expect that soon thereafter another earth would be found which with fully equal right could claim this name. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion of it with yttria-earth, it would perhaps be advisable to abandon this name ''glycine'' and replace it with beryl-earth (''beryllina''); which name change was also recommended by Prof. Link, and for the reason that a genus of plants, ''Glycine'', already exists.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=538}} The name &quot;beryllium&quot; was first used by Wöhler in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wöhler | first1 = F. | date = 1828 | title = Ueber das Beryllium und Yttrium |trans-title=On beryllium and yttrium | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3iAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA577#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| journal = Annalen der Physik und Chemie | volume = 13 | issue = 89| pages = 577–582 | bibcode = 1828AnP....89..577W | doi = 10.1002/andp.18280890805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K → 2 KCl + Be
Using an alcohol lamp, Wöhler heated alternating layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he saw that it was made of fine particles with a dark metallic luster.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}} The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the [[electrolysis]] of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.

The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] by [[Paul Lebeau]] in 1898 resulted in the first pure (99.5 to 99.8%) samples of beryllium.{{sfn|Weeks|1968|p=539}} However, industrial production started only after the First World War. The original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland OH and Siemens &amp; Halske AG in Berlin. In the US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by [[Alfred Stock]] and [[Hans Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|last=Boillat|first=Johann|date=27 August 2016|title=From Raw Material to Strategic Alloys.

A sample of beryllium was bombarded with [[alpha ray]]s from the decay of [[radium]] in a 1932 experiment by [[James Chadwick]] that uncovered the existence of the [[neutron]].{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory [[neutron source]]s that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

Beryllium production saw a rapid increase during World War II, due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and [[phosphor]]s for [[fluorescent light]]s. Most early fluorescent lamps used [[zinc orthosilicate]] with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium [[tungstate]] improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors|chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=klE5qGAltjAC&amp;pg=PA98|page=98|title=Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress|isbn=978-0-88173-378-5|author1=Kane, Raymond|author2=Sell, Heinz|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrolysis of a mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the [[alkali metals]]. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of [[beryllium iodide]] was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of [[zirconium]], but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08827508808952633|title=Beryllium Extraction&amp;nbsp;– A Review|date=1988|author=Babu, R.

Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as [[beryllium chloride]] with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently, most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=crc84hammond&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond |first=C.R. |title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qJId5TKOkC&amp;pg=PP9|accessdate=18 July 2019|edition=84th|year=2003|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-0-8493-0595-5|pages=4–5|contribution=The Elements}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price on the American market for [[Casting (metalworking)|vacuum-cast]] beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/|title=Beryllium Statistics and Information|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate =18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 [[tonne]]s. It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSMCS2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/100300.pdf|title=Commodity Summary: Beryllium |publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate =16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSMCS2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/mcs-2010-beryl.pdf|title=Commodity Summary 2000: Beryllium |publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate =16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Early precursors of the word ''beryllium'' can be traced to many languages, including [[Latin]] {{lang|la|beryllus}}; [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|béry}}; [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|βήρυλλος}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|bērullos}}, 'beryl'; [[Prakrit]] {{lang|pra|वॆरुलिय‌}} ({{lang|pra-Latn|veruliya}}); [[Pāli]] {{lang|pi|वेलुरिय}} ({{lang|pi-Latn|veḷuriya}}), {{lang|pi|भेलिरु}} ({{lang|pi-Latn|veḷiru}}) or {{lang|pi|भिलर्}} ({{lang|pi-Latn|viḷar}}) – &quot;to become pale&quot;, in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa|वैडूर्य}} ({{lang|sa-Latn|vaidurya}}), which is of [[Dravidian languages|South Indian]] origin and could be related to the name of the modern city of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|beryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until c. 1900, beryllium was also known as {{anchor|Glucinium}} '''glucinum''' or '''glucinium''' (with the accompanying chemical symbol &quot;'''Gl'''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|beryllium}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;'''G'''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Newlands (chemist)|Newlands, John]] (1866) [[c:File:Newlands periodiska system 1866.png|table of octaves]], from {{cite book|author=Scerri, Eric R. |title=The Periodic Table: Its Story and Its Significance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yPtSszJMOO0C&amp;pg=PA79|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534567-4|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the name coming from the Ancient Greek word for sweet: {{wikt-lang|grc|γλυκύς}}, due to the sweet taste of beryllium [[salt (chemistry)|salts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/4.shtml |title=Beryllium |date=2010 |work=Periodic Table of Elements |publisher=[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] |accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Radiation windows===
[[File:Beryllium target.jpg|thumb|left|Beryllium target which &quot;converts&quot; a proton beam into a neutron beam]]
[[File:Be foil square.jpg|thumb|right|A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an [[X-ray microscope]]. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low [[atomic number]].]]
Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for [[X-ray tube]]s.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of [[synchrotron]] radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (≈100&amp;nbsp;eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

Low [[atomic number]] also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic [[Elementary particle|particles]]. Therefore, it is used to build the [[beamline|beam pipe]] around the collision region in [[particle physics]] setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[LHCb]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Installation and commissioning of vacuum systems for the LHC particle detectors|publisher=CERN|first1 =R.|last1=Veness|first2 =D.|last2 =Ramos|first3 =P.|last3 =Lepeule|first4 =A.|last4=Rossi|first5 =G.|last5 =Schneider|first6 =S.|last6 =Blanchard|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/PAC2009/papers/mo6rfp010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tevatron]] and the [[SLAC]]. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above [[absolute zero]], and its [[diamagnetic]] nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and [[strong focusing|focus]] the [[particle beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)01149-4|title=A new inner vertex detector for STAR|date=2001|author=Wieman, H|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A|volume=473|issue=1–2|pages=205|bibcode=2001NIMPA.473..205W|last2=Bieser|first2=F.|last3=Kleinfelder|first3=S.|last4=Matis|first4=H.

===Mechanical applications===
Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and [[aerospace]] industries in high-speed [[aircraft]], [[guided missile]]s, [[spacecraft]], and [[satellite]]s, including the [[James Webb telescope]]. Several [[liquid-fuel rocket]]s have used [[rocket engine nozzle|rocket nozzles]] made of pure beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC&amp;pg=PA690| title=Metals handbook|chapter=Beryllium|first=Joseph R.|last=Davis|publisher=ASM International|date=1998|isbn=978-0-87170-654-6|pages=690–691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6fdmMuj0rNEC&amp;pg=PA62|page=62|title=Encyclopedia of materials, parts, and finishes|author=Schwartz, Mel M. |publisher=CRC Press|date=2002|isbn=978-1-56676-661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium powder was itself studied as a [[rocket fuel]], but this use has never materialized.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}} A small number of extreme high-end [[bicycle frame]]s have been built with beryllium.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mombat.org/American.htm|title=Museum of Mountain Bike Art &amp; Technology: American Bicycle Manufacturing|access-date=26 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720022521/http://mombat.org/American.htm|archive-date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2000, the [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] team used [[Mercedes-Benz]] engines with beryllium-aluminium-[[alloy]] pistons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Wayne|title=Aluminium-Beryllium|url=http://www.ret-monitor.com/articles/967/aluminium-beryllium/?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801083918/http://www.ret-monitor.com/articles/967/aluminium-beryllium/|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 August 2010|publisher=Ret-Monitor|accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by [[Scuderia Ferrari]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collantine|first=Keith|title=Banned! – Beryllium|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/02/08/banned-beryllium/|accessdate=18 July 2012|date=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixing about 2.0% beryllium into [[copper]] forms an [[alloy]] called [[beryllium copper]] that is six times stronger than copper alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGraw-Hill2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high [[electrical conductivity]] and [[thermal conductivity]], high strength and [[hardness (materials science)|hardness]], nonmagnetic properties, as well as good [[corrosion]] and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue resistance]].{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}}&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; These applications include&lt;!-- the making of [[spot welding]] electrodes,--&gt; non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases ([[beryllium nickel]]), in [[spring (device)|springs]] and membranes (beryllium nickel and [[beryllium iron]]) used in surgical instruments and high temperature devices&lt;!-- and [[electrical contact]]s--&gt;.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=58}}&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid [[magnesium]] leads to a significant increase in oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt;
[[File:Beryllium Copper Adjustable Wrench.jpg|thumb|Beryllium copper adjustable wrench]]

The high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in [[inertial guidance]] systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in &quot;[[Needlegun scaler|Jason pistols]]&quot;, which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=8 August 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Defence-forces-face-rare-toxic-metal-exposure-risk/2005/02/01/1107228681666.html|title=Defence forces face rare toxic metal exposure risk|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.&lt;ref&gt;Shure V15VxMR user's guide, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier major application of beryllium was in [[brake]]s for military [[airplane]]s because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to [[heat dissipation|dissipate heat]]. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

To reduce costs, beryllium can be [[alloy]]ed with significant amounts of [[aluminium]], resulting in the [[AlBeMet]] alloy (a trade name). This blend is cheaper than pure beryllium, while still retaining many desirable properties.

===Mirrors===
Beryllium [[mirror]]s are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a [[honeycomb mirror|honeycomb support structure]], are used, for example, in [[meteorological satellite]]s where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in [[control system|optical guidance]] systems and in [[fire-control system]]s, e.g. in the German-made [[Leopard 1]] and [[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]s. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard [[electroless nickel plating]] which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to [[cryogenic]] operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

The [[James Webb Space Telescope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html|title=Beryllium related details from NASA|accessdate =18 September 2008|publisher =NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529052057/http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The James Webb Space Telescope|first=Jonathan P.|last=Gardner|date=2007|journal=Proceedings of Science|url=http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/052/005/MRU_005.pdf|bibcode=2007mru..confE...5G|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the optics of the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] are entirely built of beryllium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Spitzer Space Telescope Mission|arxiv=astro-ph/0406223|journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement|date=2004|doi=10.1086/422992|volume=154|issue=1|pages=1–9|last1=Werner|first1=M.

Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military [[explosive ordnance disposal]] teams for work on or near [[naval mine]]s, since these mines commonly have [[fuze|magnetic fuzes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0263919|title=The selection of low-magnetic alloys for EOD tools|publisher=Naval Weapons Plant Washington DC|author=Kojola, Kenneth|author2=Lurie, William|date=9 August 1961|access-date=28 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823130608/http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0263919|archive-date=23 August 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EqtlqFNkWwQC&amp;pg=PT891|page=891|title=Understanding anesthesia equipment|author=Dorsch, Jerry A.|author2=Dorsch, Susan E.|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[radio communication]]s and powerful (usually military) [[radar]]s, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic [[klystron]]s, [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling wave tube]]s, etc., that are used for generating high levels of [[microwave]] power in the [[transmitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZ786vEild0C&amp;pg=PA7|page=7|title=Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds|isbn=9780444595539|last1=Ropp|first1=Richard C.|date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear applications===
Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in [[nuclear weapon design]]s as the very outer layer of the [[plutonium pit]]s in the primary stages of [[thermonuclear bomb]]s, placed to surround the [[fissile]] material. These layers of beryllium are good &quot;pushers&quot; for the [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium-239]], and they are good [[neutron reflector]]s, just as in beryllium-moderated [[nuclear reactors]].&lt;ref name=weapons/&gt;

Beryllium is also commonly used in some [[neutron source]]s in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a [[particle accelerator]]-powered [[neutron generator]]). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a [[radioisotope]] such as [[polonium]]-210, [[radium]]-226, [[plutonium]]-238, or [[americium]]-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such [[alpha decay]] driven beryllium neutron sources, named [[Modulated neutron initiator|&quot;urchin&quot;]] neutron initiators, were used in some early [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=weapons&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|page=35|title=How nuclear weapons spread|author=Barnaby, Frank |publisher=Routledge|date=1993|isbn=978-0-415-07674-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with [[gamma ray]]s from a [[gamma decay]] radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J.

Beryllium is also used in fuel fabrication for [[CANDU]] reactors. The fuel elements have small appendages that are resistance brazed to the fuel cladding using an induction brazing process with Be as the braze filler material. Bearing pads are brazed in place to prevent fuel bundle to pressure tube contact, and inter-element spacer pads are brazed on to prevent element to element contact.

Beryllium is also used at the [[Joint European Torus]] [[nuclear fusion|nuclear-fusion research laboratory]], and it will be used in the more advanced [[ITER]] to condition the components which face the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9ngHTkC8hG8C&amp;pg=PA15|page=15|title=Nuclear fusion research|author=Clark, R.

Beryllium is a [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopant]] in [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V compound semiconductors]]. It is widely used in materials such as [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]], [[AlGaAs]], [[InGaAs]] and [[InAlAs]] grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oJs6nK3TZrwC&amp;pg=PA104|page=104|title=High-power diode lasers|author=Diehl, Roland |publisher=Springer|date=2000|isbn=978-3-540-66693-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for [[printed circuit board]]s in [[surface-mount technology]]. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and [[heat sink]]. The application also requires a coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] that is well matched to the alumina and [[glass-reinforced plastic|polyimide-glass]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrates]]. The beryllium-beryllium oxide [[metal matrix composite|composite]] &quot;[[E-Material]]s&quot; have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

[[Beryllium oxide]] is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an [[electrical insulator]] and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point.

==Occupational safety and health==
Beryllium is a health and safety issue for workers. Exposure to beryllium in the workplace can lead to a sensitization immune response and can over time develop [[Berylliosis|chronic beryllium disease]] (CBD).&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/beryllium/be-sensitization-drds.html|title=CDC – Beryllium Research- NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing a better understanding of the work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt; The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/method-b.html|title=CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (2003–154) – Alpha List B|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 35&amp;nbsp;micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=57}} Beryllium is chemically similar to [[magnesium]] and therefore can displace it from [[enzyme]]s, which causes them to malfunction.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=57}} Because Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be removed.&lt;ref name=Venugopal&gt;{{cite book |last=Venugopal |first=B. |date=14 March 2013 |title=Physiologic and Chemical Basis for Metal Toxicity |publisher=Springer |pages=167–8 |isbn=9781468429527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic [[berylliosis]] is a [[pulmonary]] and [[systemic circulation|systemic]] [[granuloma]]tous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=57}} The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Category 1 carcinogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds|chapter-url =http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol58/mono58-1.html|publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer|title=IARC Monograph|volume=58|date=1993|accessdate =18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has designated a [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace with a time-weighted average (TWA) 2&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a constant exposure limit of 5&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over 30 minutes, with a maximum peak limit of 25&amp;nbsp;µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of constant 500&amp;nbsp;ng/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toxicity of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does not carry the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised to handle them with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.

Acute beryllium disease in the form of [[chemical pneumonitis]] was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing [[fluorescent lamp]]s in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=5}} Chronic berylliosis resembles [[sarcoidosis]] in many respects, and the [[differential diagnosis]] is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as [[Herbert L. Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Photos/CP1/image5.shtml|title=Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946|date=19 June 2006|publisher=Office of Public Affairs, Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate =18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro&quot;&gt;[http://articles.dailypress.com/2013-08-31/business/dp-nws-shipyard-beryllium-20130831_1_beryllium-shipyard-workers-slag Newport News Shipbuilding Workers Face a Hidden Toxin], [[Daily Press (Virginia)]], Michael Welles Shapiro, 31 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance.&lt;ref name=deGruyter/&gt; Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust ([[lung cancer]] is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc106.htm |title=Beryllium: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CRITERIA 106 |author=International Programme on Chemical Safety |date= 1990 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute [[ammonium bifluoride]] for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7458.htm|title=ASTM D7458&amp;nbsp;–08|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1520/JAI13168|title=Development of a New Fluorescence Method for the Detection of Beryllium on Surfaces|date=2005|last1=Minogue|first1 =E.
