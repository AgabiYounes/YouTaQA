The '''Buddha''' (also known as '''Siddhattha Gotama''' or '''Siddhārtha Gautama'''){{refn|{{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|d|ɑr|t|ə|,_|-|θ|ə}}; {{IPA-sa|sɪddʱaːɽtʰɐ ɡautɐmɐ|lang}}; Gautama namely Gotama in Pali|group=&quot;note&quot;}} was a [[philosopher]], [[Bhikkhu|mendicant]], meditator, spiritual teacher, and religious leader who lived in [[ancient India]] (c. 5th to 4th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 5, 9, 10, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=45}}{{refn|name=&quot;dating&quot;|group=&quot;note&quot;}} He is revered as the founder of the [[World religions|world religion]] of [[Buddhism]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/buddhaintro.html|title=An Introduction to Buddhism|last=Boeree|first=C George|authorlink=C. George Boeree|publisher=Shippensburg University|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic and lay.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching is based on his insight into ''[[duḥkha]]'' (typically translated as &quot;suffering&quot;) and the end of dukkha - the state called ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nibbāna or Nirvana]]''.

The Buddha was born into an aristocratic family, in the [[Shakya]] clan. He renounced lay life. According to Buddhist tradition, after several years of mendicancy, meditation, and [[asceticism]], he [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakened]] to understand mechanism which keeps us trapped in the cycle of rebirth. After a couple of centuries he came thus to be known by the title [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] which means “Awakened One” or the &quot;Enlightened One&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha then traveled throughout the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Ganges plain]] teaching and building a [[Sangha|religious community]]. The Buddha taught a [[Middle Way|middle way]] between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the Indian [[śramaṇa]] movement.{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=4}} He taught a [[Spirituality|spiritual path]] that included [[Buddhist ethics|ethical training]] and [[Meditation|meditative practices]] such as ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]'' and [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]. The Buddha also critiqued the practices of [[brahmin]] priests, such as [[animal sacrifice]].

After his death, the Buddhist community compiled his teachings. The [[Sutta Piṭaka|Suttas]] contain his discourses. The [[Vinaya]] contain his codes for monastic practice. These were passed down in [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle-Indo Aryan]] dialects through an [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=4-7, 44}} Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as ''[[Abhidharma]]'', biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about the Buddha's past lives known as ''[[Jataka tales]]'', and additional discourses, i.e, the [[Mahayana sutras]].{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Collett (2003). &quot;Abidharma&quot;, in: Buswell, Robert E. ed.

== Names and titles ==
Besides &quot;Buddha&quot; and the name Siddhārtha Gautama (Pali: Siddhattha Gotama), he was also known by other names and titles, such as Shakyamuni (&quot;Sage of the [[Shakya|Shakyas]]&quot;).{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=230}}{{refn|{{IPA-sa|ɕaːkjɐmʊnɪ bʊddʱɐ|lang}}|group=&quot;note&quot;}}

In the early texts, the Buddha also often refers to himself as [[Tathāgata]] (Sanskrit:&amp;nbsp;[tɐˈtʰaːɡɐtɐ]). The term is often thought to mean either &quot;one who has thus gone&quot; (tathā-gata) or &quot;one who has thus come&quot; (tathā-āgata), possibly referring to the transcendental nature of the Buddha's spiritual attainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chalmers&quot;&gt;Chalmers, Robert.

The Pali Canon also contains numerous other titles and epithets for the Buddha, including: All-seeing, All-transcending sage, Bull among men, The Caravan leader, Dispeller of darkness, The Eye, Foremost of charioteers, Foremost of those who can cross, King of the Dharma (''Dharmaraja''), Kinsman of the Sun, Helper of the World (''Lokanatha''), Lion (''Siha''), Lord of the Dhamma, Of excellent wisdom (''Varapañña''), Radiant One, Torchbearer of mankind, Unsurpassed doctor and surgeon, Victor in battle, and Wielder of power.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, David N.

== Historical person ==
Scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life. Most people accept that the Buddha lived, taught, and founded a monastic order during the [[Mahajanapada]] era during the reign of [[Bimbisara]] ({{circa|558|491 BCE}}, or c. 400 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Hugh George.

===Historical context===
[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient kingdoms and cities of India during the time of the Buddha (circa 500 BCE)]]
According to the Buddhist tradition, Gautama was born in [[Lumbini]], now in modern-day Nepal, and raised in Kapilvastu, which may have been either in what is present-day [[Tilaurakot]], Nepal or [[Piprahwa]], India.{{refn|group=note|name = &quot;birthplace&quot; |According to the Buddhist tradition, following the ''Nidanakatha'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://archive.org/details/buddhistbirth00daviuoft | title = Buddhist birth-stories; Jataka tales.

Based on stone inscriptions, there is also speculation that Lumbei, Kapileswar village, [[Odisha]], at the east coast of India, was the site of ancient Lumbini.{{sfn |Mahāpātra| 1977}}{{sfn |Mohāpātra | 2000 | p = 114}}{{sfn |Tripathy| 2014}} Hartmann discusses the hypothesis and states, &quot;The inscription has generally been considered spurious (...)&quot;{{sfn|Hartmann|1991| pp = 38–39}} He quotes Sircar: &quot;There can hardly be any doubt that the people responsible for the Kapilesvara inscription copied it from the said facsimile not much earlier than 1928.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kapilavastu was the place where he grew up:{{sfn |Keown| Prebish | 2013 | p = 436}}{{refn|group=note|Some sources mention Kapilavastu as the birthplace of the Buddha. Gethin states: &quot;The earliest Buddhist sources state that the future Buddha was born Siddhārtha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gotama), the son of a local chieftain—a ''rājan''—in Kapilavastu (Pali Kapilavatthu) what is now the Indian–Nepalese border.&quot;{{sfn |Gethin|1998| p= 14}} Gethin does not give references for this statement.}}
* Warder: &quot;The Buddha [...] was born in the Sakya Republic, which was the city state of Kapilavastu, a very small state just inside the modern state boundary of Nepal against the Northern Indian frontier.{{sfn|Warder|2000|p= 45}}
* Walshe: &quot;He belonged to the Sakya clan dwelling on the edge of the Himalayas, his actual birthplace being a few miles north of the present-day Northern Indian border, in Nepal. His father was, in fact, an elected chief of the clan rather than the king he was later made out to be, though his title was ''raja''—a term which only partly corresponds to our word 'king'. Some of the states of North India at that time were kingdoms and others republics, and the Sakyan republic was subject to the powerful king of neighbouring Kosala, which lay to the south&quot;.{{sfn|Walshe|1995|p=20}}
* The exact location of ancient Kapilavastu is unknown.{{sfn |Keown |Prebish|2013| p= 436}} It may have been either [[Piprahwa]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], northern India,{{sfn | Nakamura |1980|p=18}}{{sfn |Srivastava|1979|pp = 61–74}}{{sfn |Srivastava|1980|p = 108}} or [[Tilaurakot]],{{sfn |Tuladhar|2002|pp = 1–7}} present-day Nepal.{{sfn |Huntington | 1986}}{{sfn | Keown| Prebish| 2013| p= 436}} The two cities are located only fifteen miles from each other.{{sfn|Huntington | 1986}}
See also [[Gautama Buddha#Conception and birth|Conception and birth]] and [[Gautama Buddha#Birthplace Sources|Birthplace Sources]]}} According to Buddhist tradition, he obtained his enlightenment in [[Bodh Gaya]], gave his first sermon in [[Sarnath]], and died in [[Kushinagar]].

One of Gautama's usual names was &quot;Sakamuni&quot; or &quot;Sakyamunī&quot; (&quot;Sage of the Shakyas&quot;). This and the evidence of the early texts suggests that he was born into the [[Shakya]] clan, a community that was on the periphery, both geographically and culturally, of the eastern Indian subcontinent in the 5th century BCE.{{sfn |Gombrich|1988|p= 49}}  The community was either a small republic, or an [[oligarchy]]. His father was an elected chieftain, or oligarch.{{sfn |Gombrich|1988|p=49}} Bronkhorst calls this eastern culture &quot;Greater Magadha&quot; and notes that &quot;Buddhism and Jainism arose in a culture which was recognized as being non-Vedic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst, J.

The Shakyas were an eastern sub-Himalayan ethnic group who were considered outside of the [[Āryāvarta]] and of ‘mixed origin’ (''saṃkīrṇa-yonayaḥ'', possibly part Aryan and part indigenous). The [[Manusmriti|laws of Manu]] treats them as being non [[Aryan]]. As noted by Levman, &quot;The ''Baudhāyana-dharmaśāstra'' (1.1.2.13–4) lists all the tribes of Magadha as being outside the pale of the Āryāvarta; and just visiting them required a purificatory sacrifice as expiation&quot; (In Manu 10.11, 22).&lt;ref&gt;Levman, Bryan Geoffrey (2013).

ISSN (online) 1747-9681.&lt;/ref&gt; This is confirmed by the ''Ambaṭṭha Sutta'', where the Sakyans are said to be &quot;rough-spoken&quot;, &quot;of menial origin&quot; and criticised because &quot;they do not honour, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmans.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Levman, Bryan Geoffrey.

Apart from the [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[Brahmin]]s, the Buddha's lifetime coincided with the flourishing of influential [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa schools]] of thought like [[Ājīvika]], [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajñana]].{{sfn | Jayatilleke | 1963 | loc = chpt. 1–3}} [[Brahmajala Sutta]] records sixty-two such schools of thought.

But from the middle of the 3rd century BCE, several [[Edicts of Ashoka]] (reigned c. 269–232 BCE) mention the Buddha, and particularly [[Ashoka]]'s [[Lumbini pillar inscription]] commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to [[Lumbini]] as the Buddha's birthplace, calling him the ''Buddha Shakyamuni'' ([[Brahmi script]]: 𑀩𑀼𑀥 [[wikt:𑀲𑀓𑁆𑀬𑀫𑀼𑀦𑀻|𑀲𑀓𑁆𑀬𑀫𑀼𑀦𑀻]] ''Bu-dha Sa-kya-mu-nī'', &quot;Buddha, Sage of the [[Shakya]]s&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org&quot;&gt;In [[Ashoka]]'s [[Lumbini|Rummindei Edict]] circa 260 BCE, in {{cite book |last1=Hultzsch |first1=E. |title=Inscriptions of Asoka.

The oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]], found in Afghanistan and written in [[Gāndhārī language|Gāndhārī]], they date from the first century BCE to the third century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170527215100/https://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/SALANC.html|publisher = UW Press |title = Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhara |accessdate = 4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of [[philology|philological]] evidence, Indologist and Pali expert [[Oskar von Hinüber]] says that some of the Pali suttas have retained very archaic place-names, syntax, and historical data from close to the Buddha's lifetime, including the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāṇa Sutta]]'' which contains a detailed account of the Buddha's final days. Hinüber proposes a composition date of no later than 350–320 BCE for this text, which would allow for a &quot;true historical memory&quot; of the events approximately 60 years prior if the Short Chronology for the Buddha's lifetime is accepted (but he also points out that such a text was originally intended more as [[hagiography]] than as an exact historical record of events).&lt;ref&gt;[[Oskar von Hinüber]] [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8977/2870 &quot;Hoary past and hazy memory.

John S. Strong sees certain biographical fragments in the canonical texts preserved in Pali, as well as Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit as the earliest material.

=== Biographical sources ===
The sources which present a full and complete picture of the life of Siddhārtha Gautama are a variety of different, and sometimes conflicting, traditional biographies. These include the ''[[Buddhacarita]]'', ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]'', ''[[Mahāvastu]]'', and the ''Nidānakathā''.{{sfn|Fowler|2005|p=32}} Of these, the ''Buddhacarita''{{sfn|Beal|1883|p=}}{{sfn|Cowell|1894|p=}}{{sfn|Willemen|2009|p=}} is the earliest full biography, an epic poem written by the poet [[Aśvaghoṣa]] in the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olivelle|first1=Patrick|title=Life of the Buddha by Ashva-ghosha|date=2008|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-6216-5|page=xix|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lalitavistara Sūtra'' is the next oldest biography, a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]]/[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] biography dating to the 3rd century CE.{{sfn|Karetzky|2000|p=xxi}} The ''Mahāvastu'' from the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] [[Lokottaravāda]] tradition is another major biography, composed incrementally until perhaps the 4th century CE.{{sfn|Karetzky|2000|p=xxi}} The [[Dharmaguptaka]] biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive, and is entitled the ''Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra'',{{sfn|Beal|1875|p=}} and various Chinese translations of this date between the 3rd and 6th century CE. The ''Nidānakathā'' is from the [[Theravada]] tradition in Sri Lanka and was composed in the 5th century by [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]].{{sfn|Swearer|2004|p=177}}

The earlier canonical sources include the ''Ariyapariyesana Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikāya|MN]] 26), the ''Mahāparinibbāṇa Sutta'' ([[Dīgha Nikāya|DN]] 16), the ''Mahāsaccaka-sutta'' (MN 36), the ''Mahapadana Sutta'' (DN 14), and the ''Achariyabhuta Sutta'' (MN 123), which include selective accounts that may be older, but are not full biographies. The [[Jataka tales|Jātaka tales]] retell previous lives of Gautama as a [[bodhisattva]], and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Schober|2002|p=20}} The ''Mahāpadāna Sutta'' and ''Achariyabhuta Sutta'' both recount miraculous events surrounding Gautama's birth, such as the bodhisattva's descent from the [[Tushita|Tuṣita Heaven]] into his mother's womb.

=== Nature of traditional depictions ===

In the earliest Buddhist texts, the [[nikāya]]s and [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], the Buddha is not depicted as possessing [[omniscience]] (''sabbaññu'')&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Anålayo, &quot;The Buddha and Omniscience&quot;,  ''Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies'', 2006, vol. 7 pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; nor is he depicted as being an eternal transcendent (''lokottara'') being. According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], ideas of the Buddha's omniscience (along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography) are found only later, in the [[Mahayana sutras]] and later [[Pali]] commentaries or texts such as the ''Mahāvastu''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; In the ''Sandaka Sutta'', the Buddha's disciple [[Ananda]] outlines an argument against the claims of teachers who say they are all knowing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1 = Tan, Piya (trans) |authorlink1 = Piya Tan |title = The Discourse to Sandaka (trans. of Sandaka Sutta, Majjhima Nikāya 2, Majjhima Paṇṇāsaka 3, Paribbājaka Vagga 6) |url = http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/35.7-Sandaka-S-m76-piya.pdf |website=The Dharmafarers |publisher=The Minding Centre |accessdate = 24 September 2015 |pages = 17–18 |date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the ''Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta'' the Buddha himself states that he has never made a claim to being omniscient, instead he claimed to have the &quot;higher knowledges&quot; ([[abhijñā]]).&lt;ref&gt;MN 71 Tevijjavacchagotta [Tevijjavaccha]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest biographical material from the Pali Nikayas focuses on the Buddha's life as a [[śramaṇa]], his search for enlightenment under various teachers such as [[Alara Kalama]] and his forty-five-year career as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor1 = Access to Insight |editorlink1 = Access to Insight |title = A Sketch of the Buddha's Life: Readings from the Pali Canon |url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/buddha.html |website = Access to Insight: Readings in Theravāda Buddhism |publisher=Access to Insight (Legacy Edition) |accessdate = 24 September 2015 |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional biographies of Gautama generally include numerous miracles, omens, and supernatural events. The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mahāvastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such &quot;in conformity with the world&quot;; omniscience, and the ability to &quot;suppress karma&quot;.{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} As noted by Andrew Skilton, the Buddha was often described as being superhuman, including descriptions of him having the 32 major and 80 minor marks of a &quot;great man,&quot; and the idea that the Buddha could live for as long as an aeon if he wished (see DN 16).{{sfn|Skilton|2004|pp=64–65}} 

The ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life. These texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient India which can be corroborated from the [[Jain Agamas (Śvētāmbara)|Jain scriptures]], and make the Buddha's time the earliest period in [[History of India|Indian history]] for which significant accounts exist.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=15}} British author [[Karen Armstrong]] writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound, we can be reasonably confident that Siddhārtha Gautama did exist as a historical figure.{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=xii}} Michael Carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of &quot;birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death&quot; must be true.{{sfn|Carrithers|2001|p=}}

== Previous lives ==
[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|The legendary Jataka collections depict the Buddha-to-be in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]], making a resolve to be a Buddha, and receiving a prediction of future Buddhahood.]]
Legendary biographies like the Pali ''[[Buddhavaṃsa]]'' and the Sanskrit ''Jātakamālā'' depict the Buddha's (referred to as &quot;[[bodhisattva]]&quot; before his awakening) career as spanning hundreds of lifetimes before his last birth as Gautama. Many stories of these previous lives are depicted in the [[Jataka tales|Jatakas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The format of a Jataka typically begins by telling a story in the present which is then explained by a story of someone's previous life.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Besides imbuing the pre-Buddhist past with a deep karmic history, the Jatakas also serve to explain the bodhisattva's (the Buddha-to-be) path to Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In biographies like the ''Buddhavaṃsa'', this path is described as long and arduous, taking &quot;four incalculable ages&quot; (''[[Asaṃkhyeya|asamkheyyas]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In these legendary biographies, the bodhisattva goes through many different births (animal and human), is inspired by his meeting of [[List of the named Buddhas|past Buddhas]], and then makes a series of resolves or vows (''[[Bodhisattva vow|pranidhana]]'') to become a Buddha himself. Then he begins to receive predictions by past Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most popular of these stories is his meeting with [[Dīpankara Buddha|Dipankara]] Buddha, who gives the bodhisattva a prediction of future Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme found in the Pali Jataka Commentary (''Jātakaṭṭhakathā'') and the Sanskrit ''Jātakamālā'' is how the Buddha-to-be had to practice several &quot;perfections&quot; ([[Pāramitā|''pāramitā'']]) to reach Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jatakas also sometimes depict negative actions done in previous lives by the bodhisattva, which explain difficulties he experienced in his final life as Gautama.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Buddhist sources state that the Buddha was born to an aristocratic (''[[Kshatriya|khattiya]]'') family called Gotama (Sanskrit: Gautama), who were part of the [[Shakya|Shakyas]], a tribe of rice-farmers living near the modern border of India and Nepal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirakawa21&quot;&gt;Hirakawa (1990), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Samuel|2010}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Geoffrey Samuel]], the Buddha was born as a Kshatriya,{{sfn|Samuel|2010}} in a moderate Vedic culture at the central Ganges Plain area, where the shramana-traditions developed.

The early Buddhist texts contain very little information about the birth and youth of Gotama Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Later biographies developed a dramatic narrative about the life of the young Gotama as a prince and his existential troubles.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa (1990), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; They also depict his father Śuddhodana as a [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarch]] of the [[Suryavansha]] (Solar dynasty) of {{IAST|Ikṣvāku}} (Pāli: Okkāka). This is unlikely however, as many scholars think that Śuddhodana was merely a Shakya aristocrat (''khattiya''), and that the Shakya republic was not a hereditary monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173196980|title=The Buddha &amp; his disciples|last=Dhammika, Shravasti, 1951-|date=[199-?]|publisher=Buddha Dhamma Mandala Society|isbn=981-00-4525-5|location=Singapore|oclc=173196980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pp=49–50}} Indeed, the more egalitarian ''[[Gaṇa sangha|gana-sangha]]'' form of government, as a political alternative to Indian monarchies, may have influenced the development of the śramanic [[Jain monasticism|Jain]] and Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]], where monarchies tended toward [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Brahmanism]].{{sfn|Thapar|2002|p=146}}

According to later traditional biographies such as the ''[[Mahāvastu|Mahavastu]]'' and the ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra|Lalitavistara]]'', his mother Māyā was a [[Koliya]]n princess. Legend has it that, on the night Gotama was conceived, Queen Māyā dreamt that a [[white elephant (animal)|white elephant]] with six white tusks entered her right side,{{sfn|Beal|1875|p=37}}{{sfn|Jones|1952|p=11}} and ten [[lunar month|months]] later{{sfn|Beal|1875|p=41}} Siddhartha (Pāli: Siddhattha, meaning &quot;he who achieves his aim&quot;) Gautama was born. 

The day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in [[Theravada]] countries as [[Vesak]].{{sfn|Turpie|2001|p=3}} [[Buddha's Birthday]] is called ''Buddha [[Purnima]]'' in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day.  

According to the later biographical legends, during the birth celebrations, the hermit seer [[Asita]] journeyed from his mountain abode, analyzed the child for the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha|&quot;32 marks of a great man&quot;]] and then announced that he would either become a great king ([[chakravartin|''chakravartin'']]) or a great religious leader.{{sfn|Narada|1992|pp=9–12}}&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day and invited eight [[Brahmin]] scholars to read the future. All gave similar predictions.{{sfn|Narada|1992|pp=9–12}} [[Kaundinya|Kondañña]], the youngest, and later to be the first [[arhat]] other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|pp=11–12}}

According to the [[early Buddhist Texts]] of several schools, and numerous [[post-canonical Buddhist texts|post-canonical accounts]], Gotama had a wife, [[Yaśodharā|Yasodhara]], and a son, named [[Rāhula]].{{sfn|Meeks|2016|p=139}} Besides this, the Buddha in the early texts reports that &quot;'I lived a spoilt, a very spoilt life, monks (in my parents’ home).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legendary biographies like the ''[[Lalitavistara Sūtra|Lalitavistara]]'' also tell stories of young Gotama's great martial skill, which was put to the test in various contests against other Shakyan youths.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the earliest sources merely depict Gotama seeking a higher spiritual goal and becoming an ascetic or [[Śramaṇa|''sramana'']] after being disillusioned with lay life, the later legendary biographies tell a more elaborate dramatic story about how he became a mendicant.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa (1990), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest accounts of the Buddha's spiritual quest is found in texts such as the Pali ''Ariyapariyesanā-sutta'' (&quot;The discourse on the noble quest,&quot; MN 26) and its Chinese parallel at [[Madhyama Agama|MĀ]] 204.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; These texts report that what led to Gautama's renunciation was the thought that his life was subject to old age, disease and death and that there might be something better (i.e. liberation, nirvana).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; The early texts also depict the Buddha's explanation for becoming a sramana as follows: &quot;The household life, this place of impurity, is narrow - the ''samana'' life is the free open air. It is not easy for a householder to lead the perfected, utterly pure and perfect holy life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; MN 26, MĀ 204, the [[Dharmaguptaka]] Vinaya and the [[Mahāvastu]] all agree that his mother and father opposed his decision and &quot;wept with tearful faces&quot; when he decided to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|thumb|Prince Siddhartha shaves his hair and becomes a [[sramana]]. [[Borobudur]], 8th century]]
Legendary biographies also tell the story of how Gautama left his palace to see the outside world for the first time and how he was shocked by his encounter with human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary biographies depict Gautama's father as shielding him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human [[dukkha|suffering]], so that he would become a great king instead of a great religious leader. &lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Nidanakatha]]'' (5th century CE), Gautama is said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer [[Channa (Buddhist)|Chandaka]] explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a diseased man, a decaying corpse, and an [[shramana|ascetic]] that inspired him.{{sfn|Conze|1959|pp=39–40}}{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=322}}&lt;ref name=&quot;HWS&quot;&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  This story of the &quot;[[four sights]]&quot; seems to be adapted from an earlier account in the ''Digha Nikaya'' (DN 14.2) which instead depicts the young life of a previous Buddha, [[Vipassī Buddha|Vipassi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HWS&quot; /&gt; 

The legendary biographies depict Gautama's departure from his palace as follows. Shortly after seeing the four sights, Gautama woke up at night and saw his female servants lying in unattractive, corpse-like poses, which shocked him.{{sfn|Strong|2001|loc=Incitements to Leave Home}} Therefore, he discovered what he would later understand more deeply during his [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]: [[dukkha|suffering]] and the end of suffering.{{sfn||Strong|2015|loc=The Beginnings of Discontent}} Moved by all the things he had experienced, he decided to leave the palace in the middle of the night against the will of his father, to live the life of a wandering ascetic.{{sfn|Conze|1959|pp=39–40}} Accompanied by Chandaka and riding his horse [[Kanthaka]], Gautama leaves the palace, leaving behind his son [[Rahula]] and [[Yashodhara|Yaśodhara]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|pp=15–16}} He traveled to the river [[Anoma River|Anomiya]], and cut off his hair. Leaving his servant and horse behind, he journeyed into the woods and changed into [[Kasaya (clothing)|monk's robes]] there,{{sfn|Strong|2015|loc=The Great Departure}} though in some other versions of the story, he received the robes from a [[Brahma (Buddhism)|''Brahma'']] deity at Anomiya.{{sfn|Penner|2009|p=28}} 

According to the legendary biographies, when the ascetic Gautama first went to Rajagaha (present-day [[Rajgir]]) to beg for [[alms#Buddhism|alms]] in the streets, King [[Bimbisara]] of [[Magadha]] learned of his quest, and offered him a share of his kingdom. Gautama rejected the offer but promised to visit his kingdom first, upon attaining enlightenment.{{sfn|Strong|2001|loc=The Great Departure}}{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=25}}

=== Ascetic life and Awakening ===
{{See also|Enlightenment in Buddhism}}
{{Main|Moksha|Nirvana (Buddhism)}}All sources agree that the ascetic Gautama practised under two teachers of [[yogic]] meditation.{{sfn|Upadhyaya|1971|p=95}}{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Grubin|2010}} According to MN 26 and its Chinese parallel at MĀ 204, after having mastered the teaching of [[Alara Kalama|Ārāḍa Kālāma]] ({{lang-pi|Alara Kalama}}), who taught a meditation attainment called &quot;the sphere of nothingness&quot;, he was asked by Ārāḍa to become an equal leader of their spiritual community.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gautama felt unsatisfied by the practice because it &quot;does not lead to revulsion, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to knowledge, to awakening, to Nibbana&quot;, and moved on to become a student of [[Udaka Ramaputta|Udraka Rāmaputra]] ({{lang-pi|Udaka Ramaputta}}).&lt;ref&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Armstrong|2000|p=77}} With him, he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness (called &quot;The Sphere of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception&quot;) and was again asked to join his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied for the same reasons as before, and moved on.{{sfn|Narada|1992|pp=19–20}}

Majjhima Nikaya 4 also mentions that Gautama lived in &quot;remote jungle thickets&quot; during his years of spiritual striving and had to overcome the fear that he felt while living in the forests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:ปางบำเพ็ญทุกรกิริยา ประเทศไทย.png|thumb|The gilded &quot;Emaciated Buddha statue&quot; in an [[Ubosoth]] in [[Bangkok]] representing the stage of his [[asceticism]]]]
After leaving his meditation teachers, Gotama then practiced ascetic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa (1990), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; An account of these practices can be seen in the ''Mahāsaccaka-sutta'' (MN 36) and its various parallels (which according to [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo]] include some Sanskrit fragments, an individual Chinese translation, a sutra of the ''Ekottarika-āgama'' as well as sections of the ''Lalitavistara'' and the ''Mahāvastu'').&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' pp. 234–235..&lt;/ref&gt; The ascetic techniques described in the early texts include very minimal food intake, different forms of [[Pranayama|breath control]], and forceful mind control. The texts report that he became so emaciated that his bones became visible through his skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to other early Buddhist texts,&lt;ref name=&quot;sn56&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html |title = Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion |publisher=Access to insight |date = 12 February 2012 |accessdate = 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; after realising that meditative [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]] was the right path to [[Wikt:awakening|awakening]], Gautama discovered &quot;the [[Middle Way]]&quot;—a path of moderation away from the extremes of [[hedonism|self-indulgence]] and self-mortification, or the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sn56&quot; /&gt; His break with asceticism is said to have led his five companions to abandon him, since they believed that he had abandoned his search and become undisciplined.

[[File:Bodhgaya 3639641913 f4c5f73689 t.jpg|thumb|The Mahabodhi Tree at the Sri [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in [[Bodh Gaya]]]]
Following his decision to stop extreme ascetic practices, MĀ 204 and other parallel early texts report that Gautama sat down to meditate with the determination not to get up until full awakening (''sammā-sambodhi'') had been reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; This event was said to have occurred under a [[Sacred fig|pipal]] tree—known as &quot;the [[Bodhi tree]]&quot;—in [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Bihar]].{{sfn |Gyatso |2007 |pp = 8–9}} 

Likewise, the ''Mahāsaccaka-sutta'' and most of its parallels agree that after taking asceticism to its extremes, the Buddha realized that this had not helped him reach awakening. At this point, he remembered a previous meditative experience he had as a child sitting under a tree while his father worked.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; This memory leads him to understand that dhyana (meditation) is the path to awakening, and the texts then depict the Buddha achieving all four dhyanas, followed by the &quot;three higher knowledges&quot; (''[[tevijja]]'') culminating in awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gautama thus became known as the ''Buddha'' or &quot;Awakened One&quot;. The title indicates that unlike most people who are &quot;asleep&quot;, a Buddha is understood as having &quot;woken up&quot; to the true nature of reality and sees the world 'as it is' (''yatha-bhutam'').&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A Buddha has achieved liberation (''vimutti''), also called Nirvana, which is seen as the extinguishing of the &quot;fires&quot; of desire, hatred, and ignorance, that keep the cycle of suffering and rebirth going.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=nirvana|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9055914/nirvana|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various early texts like the ''Mahāsaccaka-sutta,'' and the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]],'' a Buddha has achieved three higher knowledges: Remembering one's former abodes (i.e. past lives), the &quot;Divine eye&quot; (''dibba-cakkhu''), which allows the knowing of others' [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] destinations and the &quot;extinction of mental intoxicants&quot; (''[[Āsava|āsavakkhaya]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans.)

According to some texts from the Pali canon, at the time of his awakening he realised complete insight into the [[Four Noble Truths]], thereby attaining [[Moksha|liberation]] from ''[[samsara]]'', the endless cycle of rebirth.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref name=&quot;EB-DL Four Truths&quot;&gt;Donald Lopez, [http://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths ''Four Noble Truths''], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|group=note|Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras.

As reported by various texts from the Pali Canon, the Buddha sat for seven days under the bodhi tree &quot;feeling the bliss of deliverance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pali texts also report that he continued to meditate and contemplated various aspects of the Dharma while living by the [[Lilajan River|River Nairañjanā]], such as [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent Origination]], the [[Indriya|Five Spiritual Faculties]] and Suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), pp. 30–35&lt;/ref&gt;

The legendary biographies like the ''Mahavastu'' and the ''Lalitavistara'' depict an attempt by [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the Lord of the desire realm, to prevent the Buddha's nirvana. He does so by sending his daughters to seduce the Buddha, by asserting his superiority and by assaulting him with armies of monsters.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, J.S. (2001),  p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Buddha is unfazed and calls on the earth (or in some versions of the legend, the [[Prithvi|earth goddess]]) as witness to his superiority by [[Mudra|touching the ground]] before entering meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, J.S.

=== First sermon and formation of the saṅgha ===
[[File:Sarnath1.jpg|thumb|[[Dhamek Stupa]] in [[Sarnath]], India, site of the first teaching of the Buddha in which he taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] to his first five disciples]]
According to MN 26, immediately after his awakening, the Buddha hesitated on whether or not he should teach the ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]'' to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed, and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is &quot;subtle, deep and hard to grasp.&quot; However, the god [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahmā Sahampati|Brahmā Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some &quot;with little dust in their eyes&quot; will understand it. The Buddha relented and agreed to teach. According to Analayo, the Chinese parallel to MN 26, MĀ 204, does not contain this story, but this event does appear in other parallel texts, such as in an ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottarika-āgama]]'' discourse, in the ''Catusparisat-sūtra'', and in the ''Lalitavistara''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

According to MN 26 and MĀ 204, after deciding to teach, the Buddha initially intended to visit his former teachers, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Udaka Ramaputta]], to teach them his insights, but they had already died, so he decided to visit his five former companions.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; MN 26 and MĀ 204 both report that on his way to [[Varanasi|Vārānasī]]  (Benares), he met another wanderer, called Ājīvika Upaka in MN 26. The Buddha proclaimed that he had achieved full awakening, but Upaka was not convinced and &quot;took a different path&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; 

MN 26 and MĀ 204 continue with the Buddha reaching the [[Sarnath|Deer Park (Sarnath)]] near Vārānasī , where he met the group of five ascetics and was able to convince them that he had indeed reached full awakening.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; According to  MĀ 204 (but not MN 26), as well as the Theravāda Vinaya, an [[Ekottara Agama|''Ekottarika-āgama'']] text, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the [[Mahīśāsaka]] Vinaya, and the ''Mahāvastu'', the Buddha then taught them the &quot;first sermon&quot;, i.e. the teaching of &quot;the noble eightfold path as the middle path aloof from the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; The Pali text reports that after the first sermon, the ascetic Koṇḍañña became the first [[Arhat|arahant]] (liberated being) and the first Buddhist [[bhikkhu]] or monastic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha then continued to teach the other ascetics and they formed the first [[Sangha (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṅgha}}]]: the company of Buddhist monks.

Various sources such as the ''Mahāvastu,'' the ''Mahākhandhaka'' of the Theravāda Vinaya and the ''Catusparisat-sūtra'' also mention that the Buddha taught them his second discourse at this time, which was the sutra on the characteristic of [[Anatta|&quot;not-self&quot;]] (''[[Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta|Anātmalakṣaṇa Sūtra]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gayasisa1.jpg|thumb|Gayasisa or Brahmayoni Hill, is where Buddha taught the Fire Sermon.]]

The Theravāda Vinaya and the ''Catusparisat-sūtra'' also speak of the conversion of [[Yasa]], a local guild master, and his friends and family, who were some of the first converts to the Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, who brought with them five hundred converts who had previously been &quot;matted hair ascetics,&quot; and whose spiritual practice was related to fire sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), pp. 48, 54–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), pp. 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Theravāda Vinaya, the Buddha then stopped at Gayasisa near Gaya and delivered his third discourse, The ''[[Ādittapariyāya Sutta]]'' (The Discourse on Fire).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Buddha's community grows to around sixty awakened monks, he instructs them to wander on their own, teach and ordain people into the community, for the &quot;welfare&quot; and &quot;benefit&quot; of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The growth of the saṅgha ===
For the remaining 40 or 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the [[Gangetic Plain]], in what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and southern Nepal, teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to servants, ascetics and householders, murderers such as [[Angulimala]], and cannibals such as Alavaka.{{sfn | Malalasekera|1960| pp = 291–92}}&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schumann, the Buddha's wanderings ranged from &quot;[[Kosambi]] on the [[Yamuna]] (25 km south-west of [[Allahabad]] )&quot;, to Campa (40 km east of [[Bhagalpur]])&quot; and from &quot;Kapilavatthu (95 km north-west of [[Gorakhpur]]) to Uruvela (south of Gaya).&quot; This covers an area of 600 by 300 km.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;Schumann, Hans Wolfgang (2003), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; His sangha enjoyed the patronage of the kings of [[Kosala]] and [[Magadha]] and he thus spent a lot of time in their respective capitals, [[Shravasti|Savatthi]] and [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt; 

Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it is likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]] dialects, of which [[Pali]] may be a standardisation.

The sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the Dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[Vassa]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to flora and animal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The health of the ascetics might have been a concern as well.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Khantipalo (1995). ''&quot;[https://accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel206.html Lay Buddhist Practice, The Shrine Room, Uposatha Day, Rains Residence]&quot;''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.

[[File:Buddha mit Mogallana und Sariputta.JPG|thumb|The chief disciples of the Buddha, Mogallana (chief in psychic power) and Sariputta (chief in wisdom).]]

The first vassana was spent at [[Varanasi]] when the sangha was formed. According to the Pali texts, shortly after the formation of the sangha, the Buddha traveled to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]], capital of [[Magadha]], and met with King [[Bimbisara]], who gifted a bamboo grove park to the sangha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Buddha's sangha continued to grow during his initial travels in north India. The early texts tell the story of how the Buddha's [[Śrāvaka#Foremost disciples|chief disciples]], [[Śāriputra|Sāriputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana|Mahāmoggallāna]], who were both students of the skeptic sramana [[Sanjaya Belatthiputta|Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta]], were converted by [[Assaji]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; They also tell of how the Buddha's son, [[Rāhula|Rahula]], joined his father as a bhikkhu when the Buddha visited his old home, Kapilavastu.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, other Shakyans joined the order as bhikkhus, such as Buddha's cousin [[Ānanda|Ananda]], [[Anuruddha]], [[Upali]] the barber, the Buddha's half-brother [[Nanda (Buddhism)|Nanda]] and [[Devadatta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), pp. 79–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Buddha's father Suddhodana heard his son's teaching, converted to Buddhism and became a [[sotapanna|stream-enterer]].
[[File:Jetavana.jpg|thumb|The remains of a section of [[Jetavana|Jetavana Monastery]], just outside of ancient [[Sravasti|Savatthi]], in [[Uttar Pradesh]].]]
The early texts also mention an important lay disciple, the merchant [[Anathapindika|Anāthapiṇḍika]], who became a strong lay supporter of the Buddha early on. He is said to have gifted [[Jetavana|Jeta's grove]] (''Jetavana'') to the sangha at great expense (the Theravada Vinaya speaks of thousands of gold coins).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of the bhikkhunī order ===
[[File:Mahapajapati.jpg|thumb|Mahāprajāpatī, the first bhikkuni and Buddha's stepmother, ordains]]
The formation of a parallel order of female monastics ([[bhikkhunī]]) was another important part of the growth of the Buddha's community. As noted by Analayo's comparative study of this topic, there are various versions of this event depicted in the different early Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2016), pp. 40–41. Analayo draws from seven early sources: &quot;the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in Four Parts, preserved in Chinese; – a *Vinayamātṛkā preserved in Chinese translation, which some scholars suggest represents the Haimavata tradition; the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda Vinaya, preserved in Sanskrit; – the Mahīśāsaka Vinaya in Five Parts, preserved in Chinese; – the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, where the episode is extant in Chinese and Tibetan translation, with considerable parts also preserved in Sanskrit fragments; – a discourse in the Madhyama-āgama, preserved in Chinese, probably representing the Sarvāstivāda tradition; a Pāli discourse found among the Eights of the Aṅguttara-nikāya; the same account is also found in the Theravāda Vinaya preserved in Pāli.&quot;  &lt;/ref&gt;

According to all the major versions surveyed by Analayo, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī]], Buddha's step-mother, is initially turned down by the Buddha after requesting ordination for her and some other women. Mahāprajāpatī and her followers then shave their hair, don robes and begin following the Buddha on his travels. The Buddha is eventually convinced by Ānanda to grant ordination to Mahāprajāpatī on her acceptance of [[Eight Garudhammas|eight conditions called gurudharmas]] which focus on the relationship between the new order of nuns and the monks.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2016). &quot;The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,&quot; projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 43. &lt;/ref&gt;

According to Analayo, the only argument common to all the versions that Ananda uses to convince the Buddha is that women have the same ability to reach all stages of awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2016). &quot;The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,&quot; projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Analayo also notes that some modern scholars have questioned the authenticity of the eight gurudharmas in their present form due to various inconsistencies. He holds that the historicity of the current lists of eight is doubtful, but that they may have been based on earlier injunctions by the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo, Bhikkhu]] (2013). &quot;The Gurudharmaon Bhikṣuṇī Ordination in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Tradition&quot; (PDF). ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics''. '''20''': 752. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 1076-9005. Retrieved August 17, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2016). &quot;The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,&quot; projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Analayo also notes that various passages indicate that the reason for the Buddha's hesitation to ordain women was the danger that the life of a wandering sramana posed for women that were not under the protection of their male family members (such as dangers of sexual assault and abduction). Due to this, the gurudharma injunctions may have been a way to place &quot;the newly founded order of nuns in a relationship to its male counterparts that resembles as much as possible the protection a laywoman could expect from her male relatives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2016). &quot;The Foundation History of the Nun's Order,&quot; projekt verlag, Bochum/Freiburg, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

[[File:Indian_Museum_Sculpture_-_Ajatasattu_worships_the_Buddha_%289217704485%29.jpg|thumb|Ajatasattu worships the Buddha, relief from the [[Bharhut]] Stupa at the Indian Museum, [[Kolkata]]]]

According to J.S. Strong, after the first 20 years of his teaching career, the Buddha seems to have slowly settled in Sravasti, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala, spending most of his later years in this city.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sangha grew in size, the need for a standardized set of monastic rules arose and the Buddha seems to have developed a set of regulations for the sangha. These are preserved in various texts called &quot;[[Pratimokṣa|Pratimoksa]]&quot; which were recited by the community every fortnight. The Pratimoksa includes general ethical precepts, as well as rules regarding the essentials of monastic life, such as bowls and robes.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, the Buddha's fame grew and he was invited to important royal events, such as the inauguration of the new council hall of the Shakyans (as seen in MN 53) and the inauguration of a new palace by Prince Bodhi (as depicted in MN 85).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts also speak of how during the Buddha's old age, the kingdom of Magadha was usurped by a new king, [[Ajatashatru|Ajatasattu]], who overthrew his father [[Bimbisara]]. According to the ''Samaññaphala Sutta,'' the new king spoke with different ascetic teachers and eventually took refuge in the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, Kailash Chand (1991), ''Lord Mahāvīra and His Times'', p. 79, [[Motilal Banarsidass]], {{ISBN|978-81-208-0805-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jain sources also claim his allegiance, and it is likely he supported various religious groups, not just the Buddha's sangha exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;Mahajan V.D. (2016), ''&quot;Ancient India&quot;'', S. Chand Publishing, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  

As the Buddha continued to travel and teach, he also came into contact with [[Śramaṇa#Pre-Buddhist śrāmana schools in Buddhist texts|members of other śrāmana sects.]] There is evidence from the early texts that the Buddha encountered some of these figures and critiqued their doctrines. The ''Samaññaphala Sutta'' identifies six such sects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts also depict the elderly Buddha as suffering from back pain. Several texts depict him delegating teachings to his chief disciples since his body now needed more rest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddha continued teaching well into his old age.  

One of the most troubling events during the Buddha's old age was [[Devadatta|Devadatta's]] schism. Early sources speak of how the Buddha's cousin, Devadatta, attempted to take over leadership of the order and then left the sangha with several Buddhist monks and formed a rival sect. This sect is said to have also been supported by King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''&quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot;'' p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pali texts also depict Devadatta as plotting to kill the Buddha, but these plans all fail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; They also depict the Buddha as sending his two chief disciples (Sariputta and Moggallana) to this schismatic community in order to convince the monks who left with Devadatta to return.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the major early Buddhist Vinaya texts depict Devadatta as a divisive figure who attempted to split the Buddhist community, but they disagree on what issues he disagreed with the Buddha on. The [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthavira]] texts generally focus on &quot;five points&quot; which are seen as excessive ascetic practices, while the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahāsaṅghika]] Vinaya speaks of a more comprehensive disagreement, which has Devadatta alter the discourses as well as monastic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Sujato (2012), ''[http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/WhyDevadattaWasNoSaint.pdf &quot;Why Devadatta Was No Saint, A critique of Reginald Ray’s thesis of the ‘condemned saint’&quot;]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

At around the same time of Devadatta's schism, there was also war between Ajatasattu's Kingdom of Magadha, and Kosala, led by an elderly king Pasenadi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Ajatasattu seems to have been victorious, a turn of events the Buddha is reported to have regretted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last days and ''parinirvana''  ===
[[File:040 Ananda worships Buddha (25595318747).jpg|thumb|This East Javanese relief depicts the Buddha in his final days, and [[Ānanda]], his chief attendant. |alt=Metal relief |upright=1.3]]

The main narrative of the Buddha's last days, death and the events following his death is contained in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]'' (DN 16) and its various parallels in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Analayo, these include the Chinese Dirgha Agama 2, &quot;Sanskrit fragments of the ''Mahaparinirvanasutra&quot;'', and &quot;three discourses preserved as individual translations in Chinese&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2014). &quot;The Buddha’s Last Meditation in the Dirgha-Agama.&quot; The Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Mahaparinibbana sutta'' depicts the Buddha's last year as a time of war. It begins with Ajatasattu's decision to make war on the [[Vajji|Vajjian federation]], leading him to send a minister to ask the Buddha for advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), pp. 286–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha responds by saying that the Vajjians can be expected to prosper as long as they do seven things, and he then applies these seven principles to the Buddhist Sangha, showing that he is concerned about its future welfare. The Buddha says that the Sangha will prosper as long as they &quot;hold regular and frequent assemblies, meet in harmony, do not change the rules of training, honor their superiors who were ordained before them, do not fall prey to worldly desires, remain devoted to forest hermitages, and preserve their personal mindfulness.&quot; He then gives further lists of important virtues to be upheld by the Sangha. &lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts also depict how the Buddha's two chief disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana, died just before the Buddha's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahaparinibbana'' depicts the Buddha as experiencing illness during the last months of his life but initially recovering. It also depicts him as stating that he cannot promote anyone to be his successor. When Ānanda requested this, the ''Mahaparinibbana'' records his response as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ananda, why does the Order of monks expect this of me? I have taught the Dhamma, making no distinction of “inner” and “ outer”: the Tathagata has no “teacher’s fist” (in which certain truths are held back). If there is anyone who thinks: “I shall take charge of the Order”, or “the Order is under my leadership”, such a person would have to make arrangements about the Order. The Tathagata does not think in such terms. Why should the Tathagata make arrangements for the Order? I am now old, worn out . . . I have reached the term of life, I am turning eighty years of age. Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps, so the Tathagata's body is kept going by being bandaged up . . . Therefore, Ananda, you should live as islands unto yourselves, being your own refuge, seeking no other refuge; with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, seeking no other refuge. . . Those monks who in my time or afterwards live thus, seeking an island and a refuge in themselves and in the Dhamma and nowhere else, these zealous ones are truly my monks and will overcome the darkness (of rebirth).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After traveling and teaching some more, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]]. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant Ānanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his death and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Access insight | chapter-url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html | chapter = Maha-parinibbana Sutta | title = Digha Nikaya | number = 16 | at = verse 56| title-link = Digha Nikaya }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mettanando and [[Oskar von Hinüber|von Hinüber]] argue that the Buddha died of [[Superior mesenteric artery syndrome|mesenteric]] [[infarction]], a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.{{sfn|Mettanando|Hinueber| 2000}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mettanando |url = http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm |title=Buddha net |date=15 May 2001 |accessdate=25 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114032016/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms. The [[Theravada]] tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the [[Mahayana]] tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom. These may reflect the different traditional views on [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] and the precepts for monks and nuns.{{sfn|Waley|1932|pp=343–54}} Modern scholars also disagree on this topic, arguing both for pig's flesh or some kind of plant or mushroom that pigs like to eat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayley1932&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Waley notes: ''suukara-kanda'', &quot;pig-bulb&quot;; ''suukara-paadika'', &quot;pig's foot&quot; and  ''sukaresh.ta''  &quot;sought-out by pigs&quot;.  He cites Neumann's suggestion that if a plant called &quot;sought-out by pigs&quot; exists then ''suukaramaddava'' can mean &quot;pig's delight&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the case, none of the sources which mention the last meal attribute the Buddha's sickness to the meal itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

As per the ''Mahaparinibbana sutta,'' after the meal with Cunda, the Buddha and his companions continued traveling until he was too weak to continue and had to stop at [[Kushinagar]], where Ānanda had a resting place prepared in a grove of Sala trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann249&quot;&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; After announcing to the sangha at large that he would soon be passing away to final Nirvana, the Buddha ordained one last novice into the order personally, his name was Subhadda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schumann249&quot; /&gt; He then repeated his final instructions to the sangha, which was that the Dhamma and Vinaya was to be their teacher after his death. Then he asked if anyone had any doubts about the teaching, but nobody did.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gautama Buddha#CITEREFSchumann2003|Schumann 2003]], p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: &quot;All [[Saṅkhāra|''saṅkhāras'']] decay. Strive for the goal with diligence ([[Appamāda|''appamāda'']])&quot; (Pali: 'vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādethā').&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Alexander (2007), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He then entered his final meditation and died, reaching what is known as ''parinirvana'' (final nirvana, the end of rebirth and suffering achieved after the death of the body). The ''Mahaparinibbana'' reports that in his final meditation he entered the four dhyanas consecutively,  then the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|immaterial attainments]] and finally the meditative dwelling known as ''nirodha-samāpatti,'' before returning to the fourth dhyana right at the moment of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John S. Strong|Strong, J.S.]] (2001), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posthumous events ===
{{See also|Śarīra|Relics associated with Buddha}}
According to the ''Mahaparinibbana sutta,'' the Mallians of Kushinagar spent the days following the Buddha's death honoring his body with flowers, music and scents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The sangha waited until the eminent elder [[Mahākāśyapa|Mahākassapa]] arrived to pay his respects before cremating the body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Buddha's body was then cremated and the remains, including his bones, were kept as [[relic]]s and they were distributed among various north Indian kingdoms like Magadha, Shakya and [[Koliya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ñāṇamoli Bhikkhu]] (1992), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; These relics were placed in monuments or mounds called [[Stupa|stupas]], a common funerary practice at the time. Centuries later they would be exhumed and enshrined by [[King Ashoka|Ashoka]] into many new stupas around the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan realm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83105/Buddha/230773/The-Buddhas-relics | first =Donald S | last = Lopez Jr.| title = The Buddha's relics}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn |Strong|2007|pp= 136–37}} Many supernatural legends surround the history of alleged relics as they accompanied the spread of Buddhism and gave legitimacy to rulers. 

According to various Buddhist sources, the [[First Buddhist Council]] was held shortly after the Buddha's death to collect, recite and memorize the teachings. Mahākassapa was chosen by the sangha to be the chairman of the council. However, the historicity of the traditional accounts of the first council is disputed by modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (2013), ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices'' (PDF) (2nd ed.), New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 88, [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] &lt;bdi&gt;[[Special:BookSources/978-0-521-85942-4|978-0-521-85942-4]]&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracing the oldest teachings ===
One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest versions of the [[Pali Canon]] and other texts, such as the surviving portions of [[Sarvastivada]], [[Mulasarvastivada]], [[Mahisasaka]], [[Dharmaguptaka]],{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{sfn|Warder|1999}} and the Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]].&lt;ref&gt;Tse-Fu Kuan. Mindfulness in similes in Early Buddhist literature in ''Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, [[Nirbhay N. Singh]]. Buddhist Foundations of Mindfulness, p. 267''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mun-Keat Choong (1999). ''The Notion of Emptiness in Early Buddhism,'' Motilal Banarsidass, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The reliability of these sources, and the possibility of drawing out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1990}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} According to Tilmann Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{refn|group=note|Exemplary studies are the study on descriptions of &quot;liberating insight&quot; by Lambert Schmithausen,{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} the overview of early Buddhism by Tilmann Vetter,{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} the philological work on the four truths by K.R. Norman,{{sfn|Norman|1992}} the textual studies by Richard Gombrich,{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} and the research on early meditation methods by Johannes Bronkhorst.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}}}

According to [[Lambert Schmithausen]], there are three positions held by modern scholars of Buddhism:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# &quot;Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials.&quot;{{refn|group=note|Two well-known proponent of this position are [[A.K. Warder]] and [[Richard Gombrich]].&lt;br /&gt;* According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication &quot;Indian Buddhism}, &quot;from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=inside flap}} According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: &quot;This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the ''parinirvana'' of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers&quot;.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=inside flap}}&lt;br /&gt;* Richard Gombrich: &quot;I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius. By &quot;the main edifice&quot; I mean the collections of the main body of sermons, the four Nikāyas, and of the main body of monastic rules.&quot;{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}}}
# &quot;Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism.&quot;{{refn|group=note|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson.}}{{refn|group=note|Ronald Davidson: &quot;While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historical Buddha.&quot;{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}
# &quot;Cautious optimism in this respect.&quot;{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponents of the third position are:&lt;br /&gt;* J.W. de Jong: &quot;It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas.&quot;{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}&lt;br /&gt;* Johannes Bronkhorst: &quot;This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek may find, even if no success is guaranteed.&quot;{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}&lt;br /&gt;* Donald Lopez: &quot;The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct.&quot;{{sfn|Lopez|1995|p=4}}}}

Regarding their attribution to the historical Buddha Gautama &quot;Sakyamuni&quot;, scholars such as [[Richard Gombrich]], Akira Hirakawa, Alexander Wynne and [[A.K.

According to scholars of [[Indology]] such as Richard Gombrich, the Buddha's teachings on [[Karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]] are a development of pre-Buddhist themes that can be found in [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Brahminism|Brahmanical]] sources, like the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard (2009), ''&quot;What the Buddha Thought&quot;'', pp. 9, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''[[Saṃsāra|samsara]]'', the idea that we are trapped in cycle of rebirth and that we should seek liberation from this through non-harming (''[[Ahiṃsā|ahimsa]]'') and spiritual practices, pre-dates the Buddha and was likely taught in early Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard (2009), ''&quot;What the Buddha Thought&quot;'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In various texts, the Buddha is depicted as having studied under two named teachers, [[Alara Kalama|Āḷāra Kālāma]] and [[Uddaka Ramaputta|Uddaka Rāmaputta]]. According to Alexander Wynne, these were yogis who taught doctrines and practices similar to those in the [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Alexander, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation'', pp. 23, 37, Routledge, 2004. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The Buddha's tribe of origin, the Shakyas, also seem to have had non-Vedic religious practices which influenced Buddhism, such as the veneration of trees and sacred groves, and the worship of tree spirits (yakkhas) and serpent beings (nagas). They also seem to have built burial mounds called stupas.&lt;ref&gt;Levman, Bryan Geoffrey.

Tree veneration remains important in Buddhism today, particularly in the practice of venerating Bodhi trees. Likewise, yakkas and nagas have remained important figures in Buddhist religious practices and mythology. &lt;ref&gt;Levman, Bryan Geoffrey.

In the Early Buddhist Texts, the Buddha also references Brahmanical devices. For example, in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] 111, [[Majjhima Nikaya]] 92 and Vinaya i 246 of the [[Pali Canon]], the Buddha praises the [[Agnihotra]] as the foremost sacrifice and the [[Gayatri mantra]] as the foremost meter.{{refn|group=note|''aggihuttamukhā yaññā sāvittī chandaso mukham.''
Sacrifices have the Agnihotra as foremost; of meter, the foremost is the Sāvitrī.{{sfn|Shults|2014|p=119}}}}

The Buddhist teaching of the ''[[three marks of existence]]''{{refn|group=note|Understanding of these marks helps in the development of detachment:
* ''[[Anicca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''anitya''): That all things that come to have an end;
* ''[[Dukkha]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|duḥkha}}''): That nothing which comes to be is ultimately satisfying;
* ''[[Anatta|Anattā]]'' (Sanskrit: ''anātman''): That nothing in the realm of experience can really be said to be &quot;I&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;.}} may also reflect Upanishadic or other influences according to K.R. Norman.{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=26}}

According to Johannes Bronkhorst, the &quot;meditation without breath and reduced intake of food&quot; which the Buddha practiced before his awakening are forms of asceticism which are similar to Jain practices.&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst, Johannes, ''The two traditions of meditation in Ancient India, Second edition'': Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. 1993. (Reprint: 2000), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Buddhist practice called [[Brahmavihara|''Brahma-vihara'']] may have also originated from a Brahmanic term;{{sfn|Norman|1997|p=28}} but its usage may have been common in the sramana traditions.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}

=== Teachings preserved in the Early Buddhist Texts ===
[[File:Fragmentary_Buddhist_text_-_Gandhara_birchbark_scrolls_(1st_C),_part_31_-_BL_Or._14915.jpg|thumb|[[Gandharan Buddhism|Gandharan Buddhist]] birchbark scroll fragments]]
{{Main|Early Buddhist Texts}}The Early Buddhist Texts present many teachings and practices which may have been taught by the historical Buddha. These include basic doctrines such as [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent Origination]], the [[Middle Way]], the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]], the [[Three poisons|Three unwholesome roots]], the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]]. According to N. Ross Reat, all of these doctrines are shared by the Theravada Pali texts and the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] school's [[Salistamba Sutra|''Śālistamba Sūtra'']].&lt;ref&gt;Reat, Noble Ross. ''“The Historical Buddha and his Teachings”''. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, pp. 28, 33, 37, 41, 43, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A recent study by [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] concludes that the Theravada ''[[Majjhima Nikāya|Majjhima Nikaya]]'' and Sarvastivada ''[[Madhyama Agama]]'' contain mostly the same major doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). ''A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya.'' Dharma Drum Academic Publisher. p. 891.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Richard Salomon (South Asian Studies)|Richard Salomon]] has written that the doctrines found in the [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts|Gandharan Manuscripts]] are &quot;consistent with non-Mahayana Buddhism, which survives today in the Theravada school of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, but which in ancient times was represented by eighteen separate schools.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lionsroar.com/how-the-gandharan-manuscripts-change-buddhist-history/|title=How the Gandharan Manuscripts Change Buddhist History|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=20 January 2020|website=lionsroar.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=21 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These basic teachings such as the Four Noble Truths tend to be widely accepted as basic doctrines in all major [[schools of Buddhism]], as seen in ecumenical documents such as the [[Basic points unifying Theravāda and Mahāyāna|''Basic points unifying Theravāda and Mahāyāna.'']]

====Critique of Brahmanism====
[[File:Indian Museum Sculpture - Buddha meets a Brahmin (9218121775).jpg|thumb|150px|Buddha meets a Brahmin, at the Indian Museum, [[Kolkata]]]]
In the early Buddhist texts, the Buddha critiques the [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanical religion]] and social system on certain key points. 

The [[brahmin]] caste held that the [[Vedas]] were eternal revealed (''[[Śruti|sruti]]'') texts. The Buddha, on the other hand, did not accept that these texts had any divine authority or value.&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;Tola, Fernando. Dragonetti, Carmen (2009). ''&quot;Brahamanism and Buddhism: Two Antithetic Conceptions of Society in Ancient India.&quot;'' p. 26: &quot;This also implied the denial of the Shruti provided with characteristics which grant it the status of a substance. All this carried with itself also the negation of the authority of all the sacred texts of Brahmanism. Buddhism does not acknowledge to them any value as ultimate criterion of truth, as depository of the norms which regulate man’s conduct as a member of society and in his relations with the Gods. Buddhism ignores the Shruti, the very foundation of Brahmanism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha also did not see the Brahmanical rites and practices as useful for spiritual advancement. For example, in the [[Udāna]], the Buddha points out that [[Ritual purification|ritual bathing]] does not lead to purity, only &quot;truth and morality&quot; lead to purity.{{refn|group=note|“Not by water man becomes pure; people here bathe too much; in whom there is truth and morality, he is pure, he is (really) a brahman”&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}} He especially critiqued [[animal sacrifice]] as taught in Vedas.&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha contrasted his teachings, which were taught openly to all people, with that of the Brahmins', who kept their [[Mantra|mantras]] secret.{{refn|group=note|“These three things, monks, are conducted in secret, not openly. What three? Affairs with women, the mantras of the brahmins, and wrong view.
But these three things, monks, shine openly, not in secret. What three? The moon, the sun, and the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata.” AN 3.129&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also critiqued numerous other brahmanical practices, such [[astrology]], [[divination]], [[fortune-telling]], and so on (as seen in the ''Tevijja sutta'' and the ''Kutadanta sutta'').&lt;ref&gt;Kancha Ilaiah, ''&quot;God as Political Philosopher: Buddha's Challenge to Brahminism&quot;'' p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha also attacked the brahmins' claims of superior birth and the idea that different castes and bloodlines were inherently pure or impure, noble or ignoble.&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Vasettha sutta ''the Buddha argues that the main difference among humans is not birth but their actions and occupations.&lt;ref&gt;Omvedt, Gail. &quot;Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste&quot; p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddha, one is a &quot;brahmin&quot; (i.e. divine, like [[brahma]]) only to the extent that one has cultivated virtue.{{refn|group=note|&quot;In a favourite stanza quoted several times in the Pali Canon: “The kshatriya is the best among those people who believe in lineage; but he, who is endowed with knowledge and good conduct, is the best among Gods and men”.&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}} Because of this the early texts report that he proclaimed: &quot;Not by birth one is a brahman, not by birth one is a non-brahman; - by moral action one is a brahman&quot;&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aggañña Sutta|''Aggañña Sutta'']] explains all classes or [[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]] can be good or bad and gives a sociological explanation for how they arose, against the Brahmanical idea that they are divinely ordained.&lt;ref&gt;Omvedt, Gail. ''&quot;Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste.&quot;'' p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kancha Ilaiah]], the Buddha posed the first [[contract theory]] of society.&lt;ref&gt;Omvedt,  Gail, ''Review: The Buddha as a Political Philosopher'', Vol. 36, No. 21 (May 26 – Jun. 1, 2001), pp. 1801–1804 (4 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha's teaching then is a single universal moral law, one [[Dharma]] valid for everybody, which is opposed to the Brahmanic ethic founded on “one’s own duty” (''svadharma'') which depends on caste.&lt;ref name=Tola&amp;Dragonetti&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, all castes including untouchables were welcome in the Buddhist order and when someone joined, they renounced all caste affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Mrozik, Susanne. &quot;Upali&quot; in MacMillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, pg. 870.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kancha Ilaiah, ''&quot;God as Political Philosopher: Buddha's Challenge to Brahminism&quot;'' p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analysis of existence ====
The early Buddhist texts present the Buddha's worldview as focused on understanding the nature of [[dukkha|''dukkha'']], which is seen as the fundamental problem of life.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Dukkha refers to all kinds of suffering, unease, frustration, and dissatisfaction that sentient beings experience.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; At the core of the Buddha's analysis of dukkha is the fact that everything we experience is impermanent, unstable and thus unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common presentation of the core structure of Buddha's teaching found in the early texts is that of the [[Four noble truths|Four Noble Truths]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gethin63&quot;&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching is most famously presented in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' (&quot;The discourse on the turning of the Dharma wheel&quot;) and its many parallels.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The basic outline of the four truths is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;gethin63&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;  

*There is dukkha.
*There are causes and conditions for the arising of dukkha. Various conditions are outlined in the early texts, such as [[Taṇhā|craving (''taṇhā'')]], but the three most basic ones are [[Three poisons|greed, aversion and delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the conditions for dukkha cease, dukkha also ceases. This is &quot;[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]]&quot; (literally 'blowing out' or 'extinguishing').&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is path to follow that leads to Nirvana. 

According to [[Bhikkhu Analayo]], the four truths schema appears to be based &quot;on an analogy with [[Ayurveda|Indian medical]] diagnosis&quot; (with the form: &quot;disease, pathogen, health, cure&quot;) and this comparison is &quot;explicitly made in several early Buddhist texts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

In another Pali sutta, the Buddha outlines how &quot;eight worldly conditions&quot;, &quot;keep the world turning around...Gain and loss, fame and disrepute, praise and blame, pleasure and pain.&quot; He then explains how the difference between a noble (''arya'') person and an uninstructed worldling is that a noble person reflects on and understands the impermanence of these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha's analysis of existence includes an understanding that [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] are part of life. According to the Buddha, the constant cycle of dying and being reborn (i.e. saṃsāra) according to one's karma is just dukkha and the ultimate spiritual goal should be liberation from this cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pali suttas, the Buddha stated that &quot;this saṃsāra is without discoverable beginning. A first point is not discerned of beings roaming and wandering on hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha's teaching of karma differed to that of the Jains and Brahmins, in that on his view, karma is primarily mental intention (as opposed to mainly physical action or ritual acts).&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha is reported to have said &quot;By karma I mean intention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gombrich summarizes the Buddha's view of karma as follows: &quot;all thoughts, words, and deeds derive their moral value, positive or negative, from the intention behind them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Buddha, our karmic acts also affected the rebirth process in a positive or negative way. This was seen as an impersonal natural law similar to how certain seeds produce certain plants and fruits (in fact, the result of a karmic act was called its &quot;fruit&quot; by the Buddha).&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that the Buddha did not hold that everything that happens is the result of karma alone. In fact when the Buddha was asked to state the causes of pain and pleasure he listed various physical and environmental causes alongside karma.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dependent Origination====
[[File:Buddha teaching Dharma, on lion throne.jpg|thumb|150px|Schist Buddha statue with the famed [[Ye Dharma Hetu]] [[dhāraṇī]] around the head, which was used as a common summary of Dependent Origination. It states: &quot;Of those experiences that arise from a cause, The Tathāgata has said: 'this is their cause, And this is their cessation': This is what the Great Śramaṇa teaches.&quot;]]
In the early texts, the process of the arising of dukkha is most thoroughly explained by the Buddha through the teaching of [[Dependent Origination]].&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt; At its most basic level, Dependent Origination is an empirical teaching on the nature of phenomena which says that nothing is experienced independently of its conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2000) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most basic formulation of Dependent Origination is given in the early texts as: 'It being thus, this comes about' (Pali: ''evam sati idam hoti'').&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be taken to mean that certain phenomena only arise when there are other phenomena present (example: when there is craving, suffering arises), and so, one can say that their arising is &quot;dependent&quot; on other phenomena. In other words, nothing in experience exists without a cause.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In numerous early texts, this basic principle is expanded with a list of phenomena that are said to be conditionally dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|One common basic list of twelve elements in the Early Buddhist Texts goes as follows: &quot;Conditioned by (1) ignorance are (2) formations, conditioned by formations is (3) consciousness, conditioned by consciousness is (4) mind-and-body, conditioned by mind-and-body are (5) the six senses, conditioned by the six senses is (6) sense-contact, conditioned by sense-contact is (7) feeling, conditioned by feeling is (8) craving, conditioned by craving is (9) grasping, conditioned by grasping is (10) becoming, conditioned by becoming is (11) birth, conditioned by birth is (12) old-age and death-grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair come into being. Thus is the arising of this whole mass of suffering.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;}} These phenomena are supposed to provide an analysis of the cycle of dukkha as experienced by sentient beings. The philosopher Mark Siderits has outlined the basic idea of the Buddha's teaching of Dependent Origination of dukkha as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;given the existence of a fully functioning assemblage of psycho-physical elements (the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the three characteristics of sentient existence—suffering, impermanence and non-self—will lead, in the course of normal interactions with the environment, to appropriation (the identification of certain elements as ‘I’ and ‘mine’). This leads in turn to the formation of attachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening of ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These ensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease and death, in a potentially unending cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Buddha saw his analysis of Dependent Origination as a &quot;Middle Way&quot; between &quot;eternalism&quot; (''sassatavada'', the idea that some essence exists eternally) and &quot;annihilationism&quot; (''ucchedavada'', the idea that we go completely out of existence at death).&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; This middle way is basically the view that, conventionally speaking, persons are just a causal series of impermanent psycho-physical elements.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Metaphysics and personal identity ====
Closely connected to the idea that experience is dependently originated is the Buddha's teaching that there is no independent or permanent self (Sanskrit: [[Ātman (Hinduism)|''atman'']], Pali: ''atta'').&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2000) p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this view which (termed [[anatta|''anatta'']]), the Buddha's teaching was opposed to all soul theories of his time, including the Jain theory of a ''&quot;[[jiva]]&quot;'' (&quot;life monad&quot;) and the Brahmanical theories of atman and [[purusha]]. All of these theories held that there was an eternal unchanging [[essence]] to a person which transmigrated from life to life.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2000) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

While Brahminical teachers affirmed atman theories in an attempt to answer the question of what really exists ultimately, the Buddha saw this question as not being useful, as illustrated in [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|the parable of the poisoned arrow]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2000) pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Buddha's contemporaries, the atman was also seen to be the unchanging constant which was separate from all changing experiences and the inner controller in a person.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha instead held that all things in the world of our experience are transient and that there is no unchanging part to a person.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), pp. 9, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Gombrich, the Buddha's position is simply that &quot;everything is process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this [[Anti-essentialism|anti-essentialist]] view still includes an understanding of continuity through rebirth, it is just the rebirth of a process (karma), not an essence like the atman.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most important way the Buddha analyzed individual experience in the early texts was by way of the [[Skandha|five 'aggregates' or 'groups' (''khandha'')]] of physical and mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhist_philosophy#Anatta|Buddha's arguments against an unchanging self]] rely on these five aggregate schema, as can be seen in the Pali ''[[Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta]]'' (and its parallels in Gandhari and Chinese)''.''&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2000) pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Glass, Mark Allon (2007). ''&quot;Four Gandhari Samyuktagama Sutras&quot;'', pp. 5, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mun-keat Choong (2000), ''&quot;The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism: A Comparative Study Based on the Sutranga Portion of the Pali Samyutta-Nikaya and the Chinese Samyuktagama&quot;,'' Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 59.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to the early texts, the Buddha argued that because we have no ultimate control over any of the psycho-physical processes that make up a person, there cannot be an &quot;inner controller&quot; with command over them. Also, since they are all impermanent, one cannot regard any of the psycho-physical processes as an unchanging self.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 136-137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt; Even mental processes such as [[Vijñāna|consciousness]] and will ([[cetana|''cetana'']]) are seen as being dependently originated and impermanent and thus do not qualify as a self (''atman'').&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Gombrich, in the early texts the Buddha teaches that all five aggregates, including consciousness (''[[Vijñāna|viññana]]'', which was held by Brahmins to be eternal), arise dependent on causes.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), pp. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, existence is based on processes that are subject to dependent origination. He compared samsaric existence to a fire, which is dynamic and requires fuel (the ''khandas'', literally: &quot;heaps&quot;) in order to keep burning.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (2009), pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Rupert Gethin]] explains, for the Buddha:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am a complex flow of physical and mental phenomena, but peel away these phenomena and look behind them and one just does not find a constant self that one can call one's own. My sense of self is both logically and emotionally just a label that I impose on these physical and mental phenomena in consequence of their connectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Buddha saw the belief in a self as arising from our grasping at and identifying with the various changing phenomena, as well as from ignorance about how things really are.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Buddha held that we experience suffering because we hold on to erroneous self views.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2000) p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worldly happiness====
As noted by [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], the Buddha as depicted in the Pali suttas does not exclusively teach a world transcending goal, but also teaches laypersons how to achieve worldly [[happiness]] (''sukha'').&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), pp. 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Bodhi, the &quot;most comprehensive&quot; of the suttas that focus on how to live as a layperson is the ''[[Sigālovāda Sutta]]'' (DN 31). This sutta outlines how a layperson behaves towards six basic social relationships: &quot;parents and children, teacher and pupils, husband and wife, friend and friend, employer and workers, lay follower and religious guides.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; This Pali text also has parallels in Chinese and in Sanskrit fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Pannasiri, Bhadanta (1950). &quot;Sigālovāda-Sutta&quot;, Visva-Bharati Annals, 3:
150–228. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martini, Giuliana (2013). &quot;Bodhisattva Texts, Ideologies and Rituals in Khotan in the Fifth and Sixth Centuries&quot;, in Buddhism among the Iranian Peoples
of Central Asia, M. De Chiara et al. (ed.), 11–67, Wien: Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In another sutta (''[[Dīghajāṇu Sutta]]'', [[Aṅguttara Nikāya|AN]] 8.54) the Buddha teaches two types of happiness. First, there is the happiness visible in this very life. The Buddha states that four things lead to this happiness: &quot;The accomplishment of persistent effort, the accomplishment of protection, good friendship, and balanced living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in several other suttas, the Buddha teaches on how to improve family relationships, particularly on the importance of filial love and gratitude as well as marital well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the happiness of the next life, the Buddha (in the ''[[Dīghajāṇu Sutta]]'') states that the virtues which lead to a good rebirth are: [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] (in the Buddha and the teachings), moral discipline, especially keeping the [[five precepts]], generosity, and wisdom (knowledge of the arising and passing of things).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), pp. 111, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Buddha of the suttas then, achieving a good rebirth is based on cultivating wholesome or skillful (''kusala'') karma, which leads to a good result, and avoiding unwholesome (''akusala'') karma. A common list of good karmas taught by the Buddha is the list of ten courses of action (''[[kammapatha]]'') as outlined in MN 41 ''Saleyyaka Sutta'' (and its Chinese parallel in SĀ 1042).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), pp. 146–148, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). &quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot; p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Good karma is also termed [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit (''puñña'')]], and the Buddha outlines three bases of meritorious actions: giving, moral discipline and meditation (as seen in AN 8:36).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), pp. 151, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberation (''[[Moksha|vimutti]]'') from the ignorance and grasping which create suffering is not easily achieved because all beings have deeply entrenched habits (termed ''[[Asava|āsavas]]'', often translated as &quot;influxes&quot; or &quot;defilements&quot;) that keep them trapped in samsara. Because of this, the Buddha taught a path (''marga'') of training to undo such habits.&lt;ref&gt;Siderits (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This path taught by the Buddha is depicted in the early texts (most famously in the Pali ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' and its numerous parallel texts) as a &quot;[[Middle Way]]&quot; between sensual indulgence on one hand and mortification of the body on the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Anālayo, ''&quot;The Chinese Parallels to the Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta (2).&quot;'' Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, 2013 (5): 9-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common formulations of the path to liberation in the earliest Buddhist texts is the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|right view; right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right 
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}} There is also an alternative formulation with ten elements which is also very commonly taught in the early texts.&lt;ref&gt;Bucknell, Rod, &quot;The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages&quot;, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 7, Number 2, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gethin, another common summary of the path to awakening wisely used in the early texts is &quot;abandoning the [[Five hindrances|hindrances]], practice of the four establishments of mindfulness and development of [[Bojjhangas|the awakening factors]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The early texts also contain many different presentations of the [[Buddhist_paths_to_liberation#Early_Buddhism|Buddha's path to liberation]] aside from the Eightfold Path.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Bucknell, Rod, ''&quot;The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages&quot;'', The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 7, Number 2, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rupert Gethin, in the Nikayas and Agamas, the Buddha's path is mainly presented in a cumulative and gradual &quot;step by step&quot; process, such as that outlined in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta|''Samaññaphala Sutta'']].&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 83, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Gethin adds: &quot;This schema is assumed and, in one way or another, adapted by the later manuals such as the [[Visuddhimagga]], the [[Abhidharmakosa]], Kamalasila's [[Bhavanakrama]] ('Stages of Meditation', eighth century) and also Chinese and later Tibetan works such as Chih-i's [[Mohe Zhiguan|Mo-ho chih-kuan]] ('Great Calm and Insight') and Hsiu-hsi chih-kuan tso-ch'an fa-yao ('The Essentials for Sitting in Meditation and Cultivating Calm and Insight', sixth century), [[Gampopa|sGam-po-pa]]'s Thar-pa rin-po che'i rgyan ('Jewel Ornament of Liberation', twelfth century) and [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong-kha-pa]]'s Lam rim chen mo ('Great Graduated Path', fourteenth century).&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Early texts that outline the graduated path include the ''Cula-Hatthipadopama-sutta'' (MN 27, with Chinese parallel at MĀ 146) and the ''Tevijja Sutta'' (DN 13, with Chinese parallel at DĀ 26 and a fragmentary Sanskrit parallel entitled the ''Vāsiṣṭha-sūtra'').&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2011). &quot;A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya Volume 1 (Introduction, Studies of Discourses 1 to 90),&quot; p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anālayo. ''&quot;Brahmavihāra and Awakening, A Study of the Dīrgha-āgama Parallel to the Tevijja-sutta.&quot;'' Asian Literature and Translation Vol. 3, No. 4 (2015) 1– 27 1  &lt;/ref&gt; Other early texts like the ''Upanisa sutta'' (SN 12.23), present the path as reversions of the process of Dependent Origination.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (1995). ''[http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/upanisa_sutta.pdf &quot;Transcendental Dependent Arising. A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta.&quot;]'' &lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|As Gethin notes: &quot;A significant ancient variation on the formula of dependent arising, having detailed the standard sequence of conditions leading to the arising of this whole mass of suffering, thus goes on to state that: Conditioned by (1) suffering, there is (2) faith, conditioned by faith, there is (3) gladness, conditioned by gladness, there is (4) joy, conditioned by joy, there is (5) tranquillity, conditioned by tranquillity, there is (6) happiness, conditioned by happiness, there is (7) concentration, conditioned by concentration, there is (8) knowledge and vision of what truly is, conditioned by knowledge and vision of what truly is, there is (9) disenchantment, conditioned by disenchantment, there is (10) dispassion, conditioned by dispassion, there is (11) freedom, conditioned by freedom, there is (12) knowledge that the defilements are destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Some common practices which are shared by most of these early presentations of the path include ''[[Buddhist ethics|sila]]'' (ethical training), restraint of the senses (''indriyasamvara''), mindfulness and clear awareness (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''-''[[sampajañña]]'') and the practice of ''jhana'' (meditative absorption).&lt;ref&gt;Bucknell, Rod, &quot;The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages&quot;, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 7, Number 2, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Mental development (''[[citta]] [[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]'') was central to the Buddha's spiritual path as depicted in the earliest texts and this included [[Buddhist_meditation#Pre-sectarian_Buddhism|meditative practices]]. 

Regarding the training of right view and sense restraint, the Buddha taught that it was important to reflect on the dangers or drawbacks (''adinava'') of sensual pleasures. Various suttas discuss the different drawbacks of sensuality. In the ''Potaliya Sutta'' (MN 54) sensual pleasures are said by the Buddha to be a cause of conflict for all humans beings.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to be unable to satisfy one's craving, like a clean meatless bone given to a dog.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Sensuality is also compared to a torch held against the wind, since it burns the person holding on to it.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddha, there is &quot;a delight apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, which surpasses even divine bliss.&quot; The Buddha thus taught that one should take delight in the higher spiritual pleasures instead of sensual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; This is explained with the simile the leper, who cauterizes his skin with fire to get relief from the pain of leprosy, but after he is cured, avoids the same flames he used to enjoy before (see MN 75, ''Magandiya Sutta'').&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous scholars such as Vetter have written on the centrality of the practice of [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|''dhyāna'']] to the teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Vetter|1988a|pp=xxx, xxxv–xxxvi, 4–5}} It is the training of the mind, commonly translated as [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], to withdraw the mind from the automatic responses to sense-impressions, and leading to a &quot;state of perfect [[Upekkha|equanimity]] and awareness (''upekkhā-sati-parisuddhi'').&quot;{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=5}} Dhyana is preceded and supported by various aspects of the path such as seclusion and sense restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2017). &quot;Early Buddhist meditation studies,&quot; pp. 80, 128, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important mental training in the early texts is the practice of [[mindfulness]] (''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]''), which was mainly taught using the schemas of the &quot;Four Ways of Mindfulness&quot; (''[[Satipatthana]]'', as taught in the Pali ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' and its various parallel texts) and the sixteen elements of &quot;Mindfulness of Breath&quot; (''[[Anapanasati]]'', as taught in the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta]]'' and its various parallels).&lt;ref&gt;For a comparative survey of Satipatthana in the Pali, Tibetan and Chinese sources, see: ''Analayo (2014), &quot;Perspectives on Satipatthana.&quot;'' For a comparative survey of Anapanasati, see: ''Dhammajoti KL (2008), &quot;Sixteen-mode Mindfulness of Breathing&quot;, JCBSSL v. VI.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because getting others to practice the path was the central goal of the Buddha's message, the early texts depict the Buddha as refusing to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which his contemporaries were preoccupied with, (such as &quot;is the world eternal?&quot;). This is because he did not see these questions as being useful on the path and as not being &quot;connected to the goal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monasticism====
The early Buddhist texts depict the Buddha as promoting the life of a homeless and [[Celibacy|celibate]] &quot;''sramana''&quot;, or mendicant, as the ideal way of life for the practice of the path.&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), pp. 85, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that mendicants or &quot;beggars&quot; ([[Bhikkhu|''bhikkhus'']]) were supposed to give up all possessions and to own just a begging bowl and three robes. &lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Buddha's monastic discipline, they were also supposed to rely on the wider lay community for the basic necessities (mainly food, clothing, and lodging).&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha's teachings on monastic discipline were preserved in the various [[Vinaya]] collections of the different early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana (1992) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist monastics, which included both monks and nuns, were supposed to beg for their food, were not allowed to store up food or eat after noon and they were not allowed to use gold, silver or any valuables.&lt;ref&gt;Heirman, Ann (2019). &quot;Vinaya rules for monks and nuns.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socio-political teachings====
The early texts depict the Buddha as giving a deflationary account of the importance of politics to human life. Politics is inevitable and is probably even necessary and helpful, but it is also a tremendous waste of time and effort, as well as being a prime temptation to allow ego to run rampant. Buddhist political theory denies that people have a moral duty to engage in politics except to a very minimal degree (pay the taxes, obey the laws, maybe vote in the elections), and it actively portrays engagement in politics and the pursuit of enlightenment as being conflicting paths in life.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew J. Moore, ''Buddhism and Political Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2016  {{ISBN|9780190465513}} p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Aggañña Sutta]]'', the Buddha teaches a history of how monarchy arose which according to Matthew J. Moore is &quot;closely analogous to a social contract.&quot; The ''Aggañña Sutta'' also provides a social explanation of how different classes arose, in contrast to the Vedic views on social caste.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;Moore, Matthew J. (2015).[https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1026&amp;context=poli_fac ''&quot;Political theory in Canonical Buddhism.&quot;''] Philosophy East &amp; West 65 (1), 36–64&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early texts like the ''Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta'' and the ''Mahāsudassana Sutta'' focus on the figure of the righteous wheel turning leader ([[Chakravarti (Sanskrit term)|''Cakkavatti'']]). This ideal leader is one who promotes Dharma through his governance. He can only achieve his status through moral purity and must promote morality and Dharma to maintain his position. According to the ''Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta'', the key duties of a Cakkavatti are: &quot;establish guard, ward, and protection according to Dhamma for your own household, your troops, your nobles, and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and Brahmins, for beasts and birds. let no crime prevail in your kingdom, and to those who are in need, give property.”&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; The sutta explains the injunction to give to the needy by telling how a line of wheel-turning monarchs falls because they fail to give to the needy, and thus the kingdom falls into infighting as poverty increases, which then leads to stealing and violence.{{refn|group=note|&quot;thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased — and from the increase in the taking of life, people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and [as] a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, the children of those whose life-span had been eighty-thousand years lived for only forty thousand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Matthew J. ''&quot;Political theory in Canonical Buddhism.&quot;'' Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 65, Number 1 January 2015 36–64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''Mahāparinibbāna Sutta,'' the Buddha outlines several principles that he promoted among the Vajjian tribal federation, which had a quasi-republican form of government. He taught them to “hold regular and frequent assemblies”, live in harmony and maintain their traditions. The Buddha then goes on to promote a similar kind of republican style of government among the Buddhist Sangha, where all monks had equal rights to attend open meetings and there would be no single leader, since The Buddha also chose not to appoint one.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt; Some scholars have argued that this fact signals that the Buddha preferred a [[Republicanism|republican]] form of government, while others disagree with this position.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

=== Scholarly views on the earliest teachings ===
{{Main|Presectarian Buddhism}}
[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|150px|The Buddha on a coin of [[Kanishka I]], {{circa|130}} CE.]]

Numerous scholars of early Buddhism argue that most of the teachings found in the Early Buddhist texts date back to the Buddha himself. One of these is [[Richard Gombrich]], who argues that since the content of the earliest texts “presents such originality, intelligence, grandeur and—most relevantly—coherence...it is hard to see it as a composite work.&quot; Thus he concludes they are &quot;the work of one genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Richard (2006). ''&quot;Theravāda Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo,&quot;'' p. 21. The Library of Religious Beliefs and Practices Series. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Peter Harvey]] also agrees that “much” of the Pali Canon “must derive from his [the Buddha’s] teachings.”&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1990). ''&quot;An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices,&quot;'' p. 3. Introduction to Religion. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[A. K. Warder]] has written that “there is no evidence to suggest that it [the shared teaching of the early schools] was formulated by anyone other than the Buddha and his immediate followers.”&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K (2000). &quot;''Indian Buddhism,&quot;'' inside flap''.'' Buddhism Series. Motilal Banarsidass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Alexander Wynne argues that &quot;the internal evidence of the early Buddhist literature proves its historical authenticity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wynne, Alexander. “The Historical Authenticity of Early Buddhist Literature”. In: Vienna Journal of South Asian Studies XLIX (2005), pp. 35–70&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other scholars of Buddhist studies have disagreed with the mostly positive view that the early Buddhist texts reflect the teachings of the historical Buddha. For example, [[Edward Conze]] argued that the attempts of European scholars to reconstruct the original teachings of the Buddha were “all mere guesswork.”&lt;ref&gt;Conze, Edward (2000). &quot;Buddhism: A Short History.&quot; From Buddhism to Sufism Series. Oneworld.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars argue that some teachings contained in the early texts are the authentic teachings of the Buddha, but not others. For example, according to Tilmann Vetter, the earliest core of the Buddhist teachings is the meditative practice of ''dhyāna''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988b|p=xxx, xxxv–xxxvi, 4–5}}{{refn|group=note|Vetter: &quot;However, if we look at the last, and in my opinion the most important, component of this list [the noble eightfold path], we are still dealing with what according to me is the real content of the middle way, dhyana-meditation, at least the stages two to four, which are said to be free of contemplation and reflection. Everything preceding the eighth part, i.e. right samadhi, apparently has the function of preparing for the right samadhi.&quot;{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}}}} Vetter argues that &quot;liberating insight&quot; became an essential feature of the Buddhist tradition at a later date. He posits that the Fourth Noble Truths, the Eightfold path and Dependent Origination, which are commonly seen as essential to Buddhism, are later formulations which form part of the explanatory framework of this &quot;liberating insight&quot;.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv–xxxvii}}  

[[Lambert Schmithausen]] similarly argues that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting &quot;liberating insight&quot;, which is attained after mastering the four ''dhyānas'', is a later addition.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}} Also, according to [[Johannes Bronkhorst]], the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of &quot;liberating insight&quot;.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}}

== Physical characteristics ==
{{Main |Physical characteristics of the Buddha}}
=== In early sources ===
[[File:Mahapragya exiled 1926 wk.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks from Nepal. According to the earliest sources, the Buddha looked like a typical bald man from northeast India.]]

Early sources depict the Buddha's as similar to other Buddhist monks. Various discourses describe how he &quot;cut off his hair and beard&quot; when renouncing the world. Likewise, Digha Nikaya 3 has a Brahmin describe the Buddha as a shaved or bald (''mundaka'') man.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick (1974), ''&quot;The Origin and the Early Development of Buddhist Monachism&quot;'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Digha Nikaya 2 also describes how king Ajatasattu is unable to tell which of the monks is the Buddha when approaching the sangha and must ask his minister to point him out. Likewise, in MN 140, a mendicant who sees himself as a follower of the Buddha meets the Buddha in person but is unable to recognize him.&lt;ref&gt;Mazard, Eisel (2010). [https://www.newmandala.org/the-buddha-was-bald/ &quot;The Buddha was bald,&quot;] New Mandala.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Buddha is also described as being handsome and with a clear complexion (Digha I:115; Anguttara I:181), at least in his youth. In old age, however, he is described as having a stooped body, with slack and wrinkled limbs.&lt;ref&gt;S. Dhammika, &quot;The Buddha and his disciples.&quot; pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 32 Signs ===
Various Buddhist texts attribute to the Buddha a series of extraordinary physical characteristics, known as &quot;the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#32 Signs of a Great Man|32 Signs of the Great Man]]&quot; (Skt. ''mahāpuruṣa lakṣaṇa''). 

According to Analayo, when they first appear in the Buddhist texts, these physical marks were initially held to be imperceptible to the ordinary person, and required special training to detect. Later though, they are depicted as being visible by regular people and as inspiring faith in the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo (2017), &quot;Buddhapada and the Bodhisattva Path&quot;, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

These characteristics are described in the [[Digha Nikaya]]'s ''{{IAST |Lakkhaṇa Sutta}}'' (D, I:142).{{sfn|Walshe|1995|pp = 441–60}}

[[Classical Islam|Classical]] [[Sunnism|Sunni scholar]] [[Tabari]] reports that Buddhist idols were brought from [[Afghanistan]] to [[Baghdad]] in the ninth century. Such idols had been sold in Buddhist temples next to a mosque in [[Bukhara]], but he does not further discuss the role of Buddha. According to the works on Buddhism by [[Al-Biruni]] (973–after 1050), views regarding the exact identity of Buddha was diverse. Accordingly, some regarded him as the divine incarnate, others as an apostle of the angels or as an [[Ifrit]] and others as an apostle of God sent to human race. By the 12th century, [[al-Shahrastani]] even compared Buddha to [[Khidr]], described as an ideal human. [[Ibn Nadim]], who was also familiar with [[Manichaeism|Manichean teachings]], even identifies Buddha as a prophet, who taught a religion to &quot;banish [[Satan]]&quot;, although not mention it explicitly. However, most Classical scholars described Buddha in theistic terms, that is apart from Islamic teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Faizuddin Ramli1, Jaffary Awang, and Zaizul Ab Rahman ''Muslim scholar’s discourse on Buddhism: a literature on Buddha’s position'' SHS Web of Conferences 53, 04001 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/shsconf/20185304001 pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless the Buddha is regarded as a [[prophet]] by the minority [[Ahmadiyya]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat&quot;&gt;{{Citation |via = Google books |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q78O1mjX2tMC&amp;pg=PA26 |title = Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jamaʻat: History, Belief, Practice |page = 26 |accessdate = 15 November 2013|isbn = 9780231700948|last1 = Valentine|first1 = Simon Ross|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; sect, generally considered deviant and rejected as [[apostate]] by mainstream Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ousman Kobo|title=Unveiling Modernity in Twentieth-Century West African Islamic Reforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSQyAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|year=2012|publisher=Brill Academic|isbn=978-90-04-23313-3|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Eugene Smith|title=South Asian Politics and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dknWCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-7908-3|pages=403–04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of [[Laozi]].{{sfn |Twitchett| 1986}}

Disciples of the [[Cao Đài]] religion worship the Buddha as a major religious teacher.{{sfn|Janet|2012|p=3}} His image can be found in both their Holy See and on the home altar. He is revealed during communication with Divine Beings as son of their Supreme Being (God the Father) together with other major religious teachers and founders like [[Jesus]], [[Laozi]], and [[Confucius]].{{sfn |Janet |2012 |p = 9}}

The Christian [[Barlaam and Josaphat|Saint Josaphat]] is based on the Buddha. The name comes from the Sanskrit ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' via Arabic ''Būdhasaf'' and Georgian ''Iodasaph''.{{sfn |Macdonnel | 1900}} The only story in which St. Josaphat appears, ''Barlaam and Josaphat'', is based on the life of the Buddha.{{sfn |Mershman | 1913}} Josaphat was included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology (feast day 27 November)—though not in the Roman Missal—and in the Eastern Orthodox Church liturgical calendar (26 August).

In the ancient [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] sect of [[Manichaeism]], the Buddha is listed among the prophets who preached the word of God before [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnstone W &amp; Meyer M (2009). ''The Gnostic Bible: Gnostic texts of mystical wisdom from the ancient and medieval worlds''. Shambhala Publications: Boston &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], Buddha is regarded as one of the [[Manifestations of God]].

== Artistic depictions ==
{{Main |Buddhist art}}
Some of the earliest artistic depictions of the Buddha found at [[Bharhut]] and [[Sanchi]] are [[Aniconism|aniconic]] and symbolic. During this early aniconic period, the Buddha is depicted by other objects or symbols, such as an empty throne, a riderless horse, footprints, a [[Dharmachakra|Dharma wheel]] or a [[Bodhi Tree|Bodhi tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, Denise Patty (2008). ''&quot;The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History &amp; Meaning&quot;'', Shambhala Publications, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The art at Sanchi also depicts the Jataka narratives of the Buddha in his past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, Denise Patty (2008). ''&quot;The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History &amp; Meaning&quot;'', Shambhala Publications, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other styles of Indian Buddhist art depict the Buddha in human form, either standing, sitting crossed legged (often in the [[Lotus position|Lotus Pose]]) or laying down on one side. Iconic representations of the Buddha became particularly popular and widespread after the first century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, Denise Patty (2008). ''&quot;The Art of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its History &amp; Meaning&quot;'', Shambhala Publications, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these depictions of the Buddha, particularly those of [[Gandharan Buddhism]] and [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asian Buddhism]], were influenced by [[Hellenistic art]], a style known as [[Greco-Buddhist art]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Hubert Marshall (1960). &quot;The Buddhist art of Gandhāra: the story of the early school, its birth, growth and decline&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  

These various Indian and Central Asian styles would then go on to influence the art of [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian Buddhist]] Buddha images, as well as those of Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhism.
