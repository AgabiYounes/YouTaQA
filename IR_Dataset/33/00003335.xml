The '''Baltic Sea''' is a [[mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean sea]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], enclosed by [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Sweden]], northeast [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] and the [[North European Plain|North and Central European Plain]].

The sea stretches from [[53rd parallel north|53°N]] to [[66th parallel north|66°N]] [[latitude]] and from [[10th meridian east|10°E]] to [[30th meridian east|30°E]] [[longitude]]. A [[marginal sea]] of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two water bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the [[Denmark|Danish]] islands into the [[Kattegat]] by way of the straits of [[Øresund]], the [[Great Belt]] and the [[Little Belt]].  It includes the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], the [[Bay of Bothnia]], the [[Gulf of Finland]], the [[Gulf of Riga]] and the [[Bay of Gdańsk]].

The [[Baltic Proper]] is bordered on its northern edge, at the latitude [[60th parallel north|60°N]], by the [[Åland islands]] and the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], on its northeastern edge by the [[Gulf of Finland]], on its eastern edge by the [[Gulf of Riga]], and in the west by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] part of the southern Scandinavian Peninsula.

The Baltic Sea is connected by artificial waterways to the [[White Sea]] via the [[White Sea Canal]] and to the [[German Bight]] of the [[North Sea]] via the [[Kiel Canal]].

== Definitions ==
[[File:Belte inter.png|thumb|upright=1.34|Danish Straits and southwestern Baltic Sea]]
'''Administration'''

The [[Helsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area]] includes the Baltic Sea and the [[Kattegat]], without calling Kattegat a part of the Baltic Sea, &quot;For the purposes of this Convention the 'Baltic Sea Area' shall be the Baltic Sea and the Entrance to the Baltic Sea, bounded by the parallel of the Skaw in the Skagerrak at 57°44.43'N.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helcom.fi/Documents/About%20us/Convention%20and%20commitments/Helsinki%20Convention/|title=Text of Helsinki Convention|access-date=26 April 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140502201121/http://www.helcom.fi/Documents/About%20us/Convention%20and%20commitments/Helsinki%20Convention/|archive-date=2 May 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Traffic history'''

Historically, the Kingdom of Denmark collected [[Sound Dues]] from ships at the border between the ocean and the land-locked Baltic Sea, in tandem: in the [[Øresund]] at [[Kronborg]] castle near [[Helsingør]]; in the [[Great Belt]] at [[Nyborg]]; and in the [[Little Belt]] at its narrowest part then [[Fredericia]], after that stronghold was built. The narrowest part of Little Belt is the &quot;Middelfart Sund&quot; near [[Middelfart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.academic.ru/dic.nsf/pierer/66040/Sundzoll|title=Sundzoll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oceanography'''

Geographers widely agree that the preferred physical border of the Baltic is a line drawn through the southern Danish islands, [[Drogden]]-Sill and [[Langeland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.io-warnemuende.de/Antworten_Fragen_zum_Meer.html?frage=49|title=Fragen zum Meer (Antworten) - IOW|website=www.io-warnemuende.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drogden Sill is situated north of [[Køge Bugt]] and connects [[Dragør]] in the south of [[Copenhagen]] to [[Malmö]]; it is used by the [[Øresund Bridge]], including the ''Drogden Tunnel''. By this definition, the [[Danish Straits]] are part of the entrance, but the [[Bay of Mecklenburg]] and the [[Bay of Kiel]] are parts of the Baltic Sea.
Another usual border is the line between [[Falsterbo]], Sweden and [[Stevns Klint]], Denmark, as this is the southern border of [[Øresund]]. It's also the border between the shallow southern Øresund (with a typical depth of 5–10 meters only) and notably deeper water.

'''Hydrography and biology'''

[[Drogden]] Sill (depth of {{convert|7|m|abbr=on}}) sets a limit to Øresund and [[Darss]] Sill (depth of {{convert|18|m|abbr=on}}), and a limit to the Belt Sea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kemi.se/Documents/Publikationer/Trycksaker/PM/PM-9-12-BaltSens.pd Swedish Chemicals Agency (KEMI): The BaltSens Project – The sensitivity of the Baltic Sea ecosystems to hazardous compounds]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shallow [[Sill (geology)|sills]] are obstacles to the flow of heavy salt water from the Kattegat into the basins around [[Bornholm]] and [[Gotland]].

The Kattegat and the southwestern Baltic Sea are well oxygenated and have a rich biology. The remainder of the Sea is brackish, poor in oxygen and in species. Thus, statistically, the more of the entrance that is included in its definition, the healthier the Baltic appears; conversely, the more narrowly it is defined, the more endangered its biology appears.

== Etymology ==
[[Tacitus]] called it ''Mare Suebicum'' after the [[Germanic people]] of the [[Suebi]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, [[Germania (book)|''Germania'']]([http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tacitus/tac.ger.shtml#45 online text]): ''Ergo iam dextro Suebici maris litore Aestiorum gentes adluuntur, quibus ritus habitusque Sueborum, lingua Britannicae propior.''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the Æstyan nations reside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their language more resembles that of Britain.&quot; ([http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2995/2995-h/2995-h.htm English text online])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]] ''Sarmatian Ocean'' after the [[Sarmatians]],&lt;ref&gt;Ptolemy, ''Geography'' III, chapter 5: &quot;Sarmatia in Europe is bounded on the north by the Sarmatian ocean at the Venedic gulf&quot; ([http://topostext.org/work.php?work_id=209 online text]).&lt;/ref&gt; but the first to name it the ''Baltic Sea'' (''[[wikt:Mare Balticum|Mare Balticum]]'') was the eleventh-century German chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]]. The origin of the latter name is speculative and it was adopted into [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Finnic languages]] spoken around the sea, very likely due to the role of [[Medieval Latin]] in [[cartography]]. It might be connected to the Germanic word ''belt'', a name used for two of the Danish straits, [[the Belts]], while others claim it to be directly derived from the source of the Germanic word, [[Latin]] ''balteus'' &quot;belt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latin-etymology&quot;&gt;{{in lang|sv}} [http://runeberg.org/nfbb/0435.html Balteus] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam of Bremen]] himself compared the sea with a belt, stating that it is so named because it stretches through the land as a belt (''Balticus, eo quod in modum baltei longo tractu per Scithicas regiones tendatur usque in Greciam'').

He might also have been influenced by the name of a legendary island mentioned in the [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] of [[Pliny the Elder]]. Pliny mentions an island named [[Baltia]] (or Balcia) with reference to accounts of [[Pytheas]] and [[Xenophon]]. It is possible that Pliny refers to an island named Basilia (&quot;the royal&quot;) in ''On the Ocean'' by Pytheas. ''Baltia'' also might be derived from ''belt'' and mean &quot;near belt of sea, strait&quot;.

Meanwhile, others have suggested that the name of the island originates from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*bhel'' meaning &quot;white, fair&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=%2Fdata%2Fie%2Fpiet&amp;text_number=+129&amp;root=config|title=Indo-European etymology : Query result|date=25 February 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225150051/http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&amp;basename=%2Fdata%2Fie%2Fpiet&amp;text_number=+129&amp;root=config|archivedate=25 February 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This root and its basic meaning were retained in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (as ''baltas''), [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (as ''balts'') and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (as ''bely''). On this basis, a related hypothesis holds that the name originated from this Indo-European root via a [[Baltic language]] such as Lithuanian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Yet another explanation is that the name originally meant &quot;enclosed sea, bay&quot; as opposed to open sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;baltu valodas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Dini |first=Pietro Umberto | title=Le lingue baltiche |year=1997 |publisher=La Nuova Italia |location=Florence |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-221-2803-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Swedish historians believe the name derives from the god [[Baldr]] of Nordic mythology.

In the [[Middle Ages]] the sea was known by a variety of names. The name Baltic Sea became dominant only after 1600. Usage of ''Baltic'' and similar terms to denote the region east of the sea started only in 19th century.

===Name in other languages===
The Baltic Sea was known in ancient Latin language sources as ''Mare Suebicum'' or even ''Mare Germanicum''.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. [[Hartmann Schedel]]'s 1493 ([[:File:Schedelsche Weltchronik d 287.jpg|map]]), where the Baltic Sea is called ''Mare Germanicum'', whereas the Northern Sea is called ''Oceanus Germanicus''.&lt;/ref&gt; Older native names in languages that used to be spoken on the shores of the sea or near it usually indicate the geographical location of the sea (in Germanic languages), or its size in relation to smaller gulfs (in Old Latvian), or tribes associated with it (in Old Russian the sea was known as the Varanghian Sea). In modern languages it is known by the equivalents of &quot;East Sea&quot;, &quot;West Sea&quot;, or &quot;Baltic Sea&quot; in different languages:

* '''&quot;Baltic Sea&quot;''' is used in Modern English; in the [[Baltic languages]] [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (''Baltijas jūra''; in Old Latvian it was referred to as &quot;the Big Sea&quot;, while the present day Gulf of Riga was referred to as &quot;the Little Sea&quot;) and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (''Baltijos jūra''); in [[Latin]] (''Mare Balticum'') and the [[Romance languages]] [[French language|French]] (''Mer Baltique''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''Mar Baltico''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and  [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Mar Báltico'') and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (''Marea Baltică'') and; in [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{lang|el|Βαλτική Θάλασσα}} ''Valtikí Thálassa''); in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (''Deti Balltik''); in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (''Môr Baltig''); in the [[Slavic languages]] [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Morze Bałtyckie'' or ''Bałtyk''), [[Czech language|Czech]] (''Baltské moře'' or ''Balt''), [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] (''Baltsko morje''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ({{lang|bg|Балтийско море}} ''Baltijsko More''), [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] (''Bôłt''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (Балтичко Море ''Baltičko More''), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ({{lang|uk|Балтійське море}} ''Baltijs′ke More''), [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (Балтыйскае мора ''Baltyjskaje Mora''), [[Russian (language)|Russian]] ({{lang|ru|Балтийское море}} ''Baltiyskoye More'') and [[Serbo-Croatian]] (''Baltičko more'' / {{lang|sr-Cyrl|Балтичко море}}); in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] (Balti-tenger).
* In [[Germanic languages]], except English, '''&quot;East Sea&quot;''' is used, as in [[Afrikaans]] (''Oossee''), [[Danish language|Danish]] (''Østersøen'' {{IPA-da|ˈøstɐˌsøˀn̩|}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''Oostzee''), [[German language|German]] (''Ostsee''), [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] (''Eystrasalt''), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ([[Bokmål]]: ''Østersjøen'' {{IPA-no|ˈø̂stəˌʂøːn|}}; [[Nynorsk]]: ''Austersjøen''), and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (''Östersjön''). In [[Old English]] it was known as ''Ostsǣ''; also in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the former name was ''Keleti-tenger'' (&quot;East-sea&quot;, due to German influence). In addition, [[Finnish language|Finnish]], a [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]], uses the term term ''Itämeri'' &quot;East Sea&quot;, possibly a [[calque]] from a Germanic language. As the Baltic is not particularly eastward in relation to Finland, the use of this term may be a leftover from the period of Swedish rule.
* In another Finnic language, [[Estonian language|Estonian]], it is called the '''&quot;West Sea&quot;''' (''Läänemeri''), with the correct geography (the sea is west of Estonia). In [[South Estonian]], it has the meaning of both '''&quot;West Sea&quot;''' and '''&quot;Evening Sea&quot;''' (''Õdagumeri'').

== History ==

===Classical world===
At the time of the [[Roman Empire]], the Baltic Sea was known as the ''Mare Suebicum'' or ''Mare Sarmaticum''. [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]] in his AD&amp;nbsp;98 ''Agricola'' and ''Germania'' described the Mare Suebicum, named for the [[Suebi]] tribe, during the spring months, as a [[brackish]] sea where the ice broke apart and chunks floated about. The Suebi eventually migrated southwest to temporarily reside in the Rhineland area of modern Germany, where their name survives in the historic region known as [[Swabia]]. [[Jordanes]] called it the ''Germanic Sea'' in his work, the ''[[Getica]]''.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Putgarten, Kap Arkona (2011-05-21) 3.JPG|thumb|[[Cape Arkona]] on the island of [[Rügen]] in Germany, was a sacred site of the [[Rani (Slavic tribe)|Slavs]] before Christianization.]]
In the early [[Middle Ages]], Norse (Scandinavian) merchants built a trade empire all around the Baltic. Later, the Norse fought for control of the Baltic against [[Wends|Wendish tribes]] dwelling on the southern shore. The Norse also used the rivers of [[Russia]] for trade routes, finding their way eventually to the [[Black Sea]] and southern Russia. This Norse-dominated period is referred to as the [[Viking Age]].

Since the [[Viking age]], the Scandinavians have referred to the Baltic Sea as ''Austmarr'' (&quot;Eastern Lake&quot;). &quot;Eastern Sea&quot;, appears in the ''[[Heimskringla]]'' and ''Eystra salt'' appears in ''[[Sörla þáttr]]''. [[Saxo Grammaticus]] recorded in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' an older name, ''[[Gandvik]]'', ''-vik'' being [[Old Norse]] for &quot;bay&quot;, which implies that the Vikings correctly regarded it as an inlet of the sea. Another form of the name, &quot;Grandvik&quot;, attested in at least one English translation of ''Gesta Danorum'', is likely to be a misspelling.)

In addition to fish the sea also provides [[amber]], especially from its southern shores within today's borders of [[Poland]], [[Russia]] and [[Lithuania]]. First mentions of amber deposits on the South coast of the Baltic Sea date back to the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://leta.st/blog/2016/07/history-of-russian-amber-1/ &quot;The History of Russian Amber, Part 1: The Beginning&quot;], Leta.st&lt;/ref&gt; The bordering countries have also traditionally exported lumber, [[Pine tar|wood tar]], [[flax]], [[hemp]] and furs by ship across the Baltic. Sweden had from early medieval times exported [[iron]] and [[silver]] mined there, while Poland had and still has extensive [[salt]] mines. Thus the Baltic Sea has long been crossed by much merchant shipping.

The lands on the Baltic's eastern shore were among the last in Europe to be converted to [[Christianity]]. This finally happened during the [[Northern Crusades]]: [[Finland]] in the twelfth century by Swedes, and what are now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] in the early thirteenth century by Danes and Germans ([[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]]). The [[Teutonic Order]] gained control over parts of the southern and eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, where they set up [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|their monastic state]]. [[Lithuania]] was [[Christianization of Lithuania|the last European state to convert to Christianity]].

===An arena of conflict===
[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the [[Hanseatic League]] (''Hanse'').]]
[[File:Curonians kursenieki in 1649.png|thumb|right|In 1649 the settlement of the [[Latvian language|Latvian-speaking]] [[Kursenieki]] spanned from [[Klaipėda]] to [[Gdańsk]] along the coast of the Baltic Sea.]]

In the period between the 8th and 14th centuries, there was much piracy in the Baltic  from the coasts of [[Pomerania]] and [[Prussia]], and the [[Victual Brothers]] even held [[Gotland]].

Starting in the 11th century, the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic were settled by migrants mainly from [[Germany]], a movement called the ''[[Ostsiedlung]]'' (&quot;east settling&quot;). Other settlers were from the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], and [[Scotland]]. The [[Polabian Slavs]] were gradually assimilated by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/639735/Wend Wend – West Wend]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denmark]] gradually gained control over most of the Baltic coast, until she lost much of her possessions after being defeated in the 1227 [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)|Battle of Bornhöved]].
[[File:Eerste fase van de Zeeslag in de Sont - First phase of the Battle of the Sound - November 8 1658 (Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraten, 1660).jpg|thumb|right|The naval [[Battle of the Sound]] took place on 8 November 1658 during the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658–60)|Dano-Swedish War]].]]
[[File:Cap Arcona burning.jpg|thumb|The burning ''[[Cap Arcona]]'' shortly after the attacks, 3 May 1945. Only 350 survived of the 4,500 prisoners who had been aboard]]

In the 13th to 16th centuries, the strongest economic force in Northern Europe was the [[Hanseatic League]], a federation of merchant cities around the Baltic Sea and the [[North Sea]]. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]] fought wars for ''[[Dominium maris baltici]]'' (&quot;Lordship over the Baltic Sea&quot;). Eventually, it was Sweden that [[Swedish Empire|virtually encompassed the Baltic Sea]]. In Sweden the sea was then referred to as ''Mare Nostrum Balticum'' (&quot;Our Baltic Sea&quot;). The goal of Swedish warfare during the 17th century was to make the Baltic Sea an all-Swedish sea (''Ett Svenskt innanhav''), something that was accomplished except the part between Riga in Latvia and [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in Pomerania.  However, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] dominated Baltic trade in the seventeenth century.

In the eighteenth century, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] became the leading powers over the sea. Sweden's defeat in the [[Great Northern War]] brought Russia to the eastern coast. Russia became and remained a dominating power in the Baltic. Russia's [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] saw the strategic importance of the Baltic and decided to found his new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], at the mouth of the [[Neva]] river at the east end of the [[Gulf of Finland]]. There was much trading not just within the Baltic region but also with the North Sea region, especially eastern [[England]] and the [[Netherlands]]: their fleets needed the Baltic timber, tar, flax and hemp.

During the [[Crimean War]], a joint [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] fleet attacked the Russian fortresses in the Baltic. They bombarded [[Sveaborg]], which guards [[Helsinki]]; and [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]], which guards Saint Petersburg; and they destroyed [[Bomarsund, Åland|Bomarsund]] in the [[Åland Islands]]. After the unification of [[Germany]] in 1871, the whole southern coast became German. [[World War I]] was partly fought in the Baltic Sea. After 1920 [[Poland]] was connected to the Baltic Sea by the [[Polish Corridor]] and enlarged the port of [[Gdynia]] in rivalry with the port of the [[Free City of Danzig]].

During [[World War II]], Germany reclaimed all of the southern and much of the eastern shore by occupying Poland and the Baltic states. In 1945, the Baltic Sea became a mass grave for retreating soldiers and refugees on torpedoed [[Operation Hannibal|troop transports]]. The sinking of the ''[[Wilhelm Gustloff (ship)|Wilhelm Gustloff]]'' remains the worst maritime disaster in history, killing (very roughly) 9,000 people. In 2005, a Russian group of scientists found over five thousand airplane wrecks, sunken warships, and other material, mainly from World War II, on the bottom of the sea.

===Since World War II===
Since the end of [[World War II]], various nations, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, have disposed of [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]] in the Baltic Sea, raising concerns of environmental contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3102728,00.html Chemical Weapon Time Bomb Ticks in the Baltic Sea] ''Deutsche Welle'', 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Even now fishermen accidentally retrieve some of these materials: the most recent available report from the Helsinki Commission notes that four small scale catches of chemical munitions representing approximately {{convert|105|kg|abbr=on}} of material were reported in 2005. This is a reduction from the 25 incidents representing {{convert|1110|kg|abbr=on}} of material in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helcom.fi/stc/files/Publications/Proceedings/bsep112.pdf Activities 2006: Overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114011006/http://www.helcom.fi/stc/files/Publications/Proceedings/bsep112.pdf |date=14 January 2009 }} Baltic Sea Environment Proceedings No. 112. [[Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission|Helsinki Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Until now, the [[U.S. Government]] refuses to disclose the exact coordinates of the wreck sites. Rotting bottles leak [[mustard gas]] and other substances, thus slowly poisoning a substantial part of the Baltic Sea.

After 1945, the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)|German population was expelled]] from all areas east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], making room for displaced Poles and Russians. Poland [[Former eastern territories of Germany|gained most of the southern shore]]. The [[Soviet Union]] gained another access to the Baltic with the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. The Baltic states on the eastern shore were annexed by the Soviet Union. The Baltic then separated opposing military blocs: [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Had war broken out, the Polish navy was prepared to invade the Danish isles. This border status restricted trade and travel. It ended only after the collapse of the [[Communist]] regimes in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s.

Since May 2004, with the accession of the Baltic states and Poland, the Baltic Sea has been almost entirely surrounded by countries of the [[European Union]] (EU). The only remaining non-EU shore areas are Russian: the Saint Petersburg area and the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] [[exclave]].

Winter storms begin arriving in the region during October. These have caused numerous shipwrecks, and contributed to the extreme difficulties of rescuing passengers of the ferry ''[[M/S Estonia]]'' en route from [[Tallinn]], Estonia, to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, in September 1994, which claimed the lives of 852 people. Older, wood-based shipwrecks such as the ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'' tend to remain well-preserved, as the Baltic's cold and brackish water does not suit the [[shipworm]].

===Storm floods===
[[Storm surge]] floodings are generally taken to occur when the water level is more than one metre above normal. In Warnemünde about 110 floods occurred from 1950 to 2000, an average of just over two per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ikzm-d.de/infos/pdfs/129_Bericht_Sturmfluten.pdf |title=Sturmfluten in der südlichen Ostsee (Westlicher und mittlerer Teil) |trans-title=Storm floods in the Southern Baltic (western and central part) |language=German |year=2005 |issue=39 |journal=Berichte des Bundesamtes für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie |page=6 |first=Marzenna |last=Sztobryn |first2=Hans-Joachim |last2=Stigge |first3=Danuta |last3=Wielbińska |first4=Bärbel |last4=Weidig |first5=Ida |last5=Stanisławczyk |first6=Alicja |last6=Kańska |first7=Katarzyna |last7=Krzysztofik |first8=Beata |last8=Kowalska |first9=Beata |last9=Letkiewicz |first10=Monika |last10=Mykita |access-date=2 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028010502/http://www.ikzm-d.de/infos/pdfs/129_Bericht_Sturmfluten.pdf |archive-date=28 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historic flood events were the [[All Saints' Flood of 1304]] and other floods in the years 1320, 1449, 1625, 1694, 1784 and 1825.

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Baltic Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf |title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition |year=1953 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization |accessdate=6 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008191433/http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Bordered by the coasts of Germany, Denmark, Poland, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it extends north-eastward of the following limits:
:*''In the [[Little Belt]].'' A line joining [[Nieby|Falshöft]] ({{coord|54|47|N|9|57.5|E|display=inline}}) and Vejsnæs Nakke ([[Ærø]]: {{coord|54|49|N|10|26|E|display=inline}}).

The northern part of the Baltic Sea is known as the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], of which the northernmost part is the Bay of Bothnia &lt;!-- redirects to: --&gt; or [[Bothnian Bay]]. The more rounded southern basin of the gulf is called [[Bothnian Sea]] and immediately to the south of it lies the [[Sea of Åland]]. The [[Gulf of Finland]] connects the Baltic Sea with [[Saint Petersburg]]. The [[Gulf of Riga]] lies between the [[Latvia]]n capital city of [[Riga]] and the [[Estonia]]n island of [[Saaremaa]].

The Northern Baltic Sea lies between the [[Stockholm]] area, southwestern Finland and Estonia. The [[Gotland Basin|Western and Eastern Gotland basins]] form the major parts of the Central Baltic Sea or Baltic proper. The [[Bornholm]] Basin is the area east of Bornholm, and the shallower [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] Basin extends from Bornholm to the Danish isles of [[Falster]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].

In the south, the [[Bay of Gdańsk]] lies east of the [[Hel Peninsula]] on the Polish coast and west of the [[Sambia Peninsula]] in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]]. The [[Bay of Pomerania]] lies north of the islands of [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]], east of [[Rügen]]. Between Falster and the German coast lie the [[Bay of Mecklenburg]] and [[Bay of Lübeck]]. The westernmost part of the Baltic Sea is the [[Bay of Kiel]]. The three [[Danish straits]], the [[Great Belt]], the [[Little Belt]] and [[Öresund|The Sound]] (''Öresund''/''Øresund''), connect the Baltic Sea with the [[Kattegat]]  and [[Skagerrak]] strait in the [[North Sea]].

===Temperature and ice===
[[File:BalticSea March2000 NASA-S2000084115409.png|thumb|Satellite image of the Baltic Sea in a mild winter]]
[[File:Baltic Sea 1551 (5496745361).jpg|thumb|Traversing Baltic Sea and ice]]

The water temperature of the Baltic Sea varies significantly depending on exact location, season and depth. At the Bornholm Basin, which is located directly east of the island of the same name, the surface temperature typically falls to {{convert|0-5|C|F|abbr=on}} during the peak of the winter and rises to {{convert|15-20|C|F|abbr=on}} during the peak of the summer, with an annual average of around {{convert|9-10|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=OurBalticSea&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/in-brief/our-baltic-sea/ |title=Our Baltic Sea | publisher=HELCOM |accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern can be seen in the [[Gotland Basin]], which is located between the island of Gotland and Latvia. In the deep of these basins the temperature variations are smaller. At the bottom of the Bornholm Basin, deeper than {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the temperature typically is {{convert|1-10|C|F|abbr=on}}, and at the bottom of the Gotland Basin, at depths greater than {{convert|225|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the temperature typically is {{convert|4-7|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=OurBalticSea/&gt;

On the long-term average, the Baltic Sea is ice-covered at the annual maximum for about 45% of its surface area. The ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], the [[Gulf of Finland]], the [[Gulf of Riga]], the archipelago west of Estonia, the [[Stockholm archipelago]], and the [[Archipelago Sea]] southwest of Finland. The remainder of the Baltic does not freeze during a normal winter, except sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the [[Curonian Lagoon]]. The ice reaches its maximum extent in February or March; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the [[Bothnian Bay]], the northern basin of the Gulf of Bothnia, is about {{convert|70|cm|0|abbr=on}} for landfast sea ice. The thickness decreases farther south.

Freezing begins in the northern extremities of the Gulf of Bothnia typically in the middle of November, reaching the open waters of the Bothnian Bay in early January. The [[Bothnian Sea]], the basin south of [[Kvarken]], freezes on average in late February. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga freeze typically in late January. In 2011, the Gulf of Finland was completely frozen on 15 February.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 16 February 2011, p. A8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice extent depends on whether the winter is mild, moderate, or severe. In severe winters ice can form around southern [[Sweden]] and even in the [[Danish straits]]. According to the 18th-century natural historian [[William Derham]], during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708, the ice cover reached as far as the Danish straits.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, William ''Physico-Theology: Or, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God from His Works of Creation'' (London, 1713).&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, parts of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland are frozen, in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the Gulf of Riga. This description meant that the whole of the Baltic Sea was covered with ice.

Since 1720, the Baltic Sea has frozen over entirely 20 times, most recently in early 1987, which was the most severe winter in Scandinavia since 1720. The ice then covered {{convert|400,000|km2|abbr=on}}. During the winter of 2010–11, which was quite severe compared to those of the last decades, the maximum ice cover was {{convert|315,000|km2|abbr=on}}, which was reached on 25 February 2011. The ice then extended from the north down to the northern tip of [[Gotland]], with small ice-free areas on either side, and the east coast of the Baltic Sea was covered by an ice sheet about {{convert|25|to|100|km|0|abbr=on}} wide all the way to [[Gdańsk]]. This was brought about by a stagnant [[high-pressure area]] that lingered over central and northern Scandinavia from around 10 to 24 February. After this, strong southern winds pushed the ice further into the north, and much of the waters north of Gotland were again free of ice, which had then packed against the shores of southern Finland.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', 10 February 2011, p. A4; 25 February 2011, p. A5; 11 June 2011, p. A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of the afore-mentioned high-pressure area did not reach the southern parts of the Baltic Sea, and thus the entire sea did not freeze over. However, floating ice was additionally observed near [[Świnoujście]] harbour in January 2010.

In recent years before 2011, the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea were frozen with solid ice near the Baltic coast and dense floating ice far from it. In 2008, almost no ice formed except for a short period in March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/ Sea Ice Survey] Space Science and Engineering Center, University of Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jäämäed Puhtulaiul 1.JPG|thumb|Piles of drift ice on the shore of Puhtulaid, near [[Virtsu]], Estonia, in late April]]
During winter, [[fast ice]], which is attached to the shoreline, develops first, rendering ports unusable without the services of [[icebreaker]]s. [[Level ice]], [[ice sludge]], [[pancake ice]], and [[rafter ice]] form in the more open regions. The gleaming expanse of ice is similar to the [[Arctic]], with wind-driven pack ice and ridges up to {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}}. Offshore of the landfast ice, the ice remains very dynamic all year, and it is relatively easily moved around by winds and therefore forms [[pack ice]], made up of large piles and ridges pushed against the landfast ice and shores.

In spring, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia normally thaw in late April, with some ice ridges persisting until May in the eastern extremities of the Gulf of Finland. In the northernmost reaches of the Bothnian Bay, ice usually stays until late May; by early June it is practically always gone. However, in the famine year of [[Famine of 1866-68|1867]] remnants of ice were observed as late as July 17 near [[Uddskär]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nödåret 1867|url=http://byar.lulea.se/scripts/historia_visa.asp?By=79&amp;No=114|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727130208/http://byar.lulea.se/scripts/historia_visa.asp?By=79&amp;No=114|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-27|publisher=Byar i Luleå}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even as far south as [[Øresund]], remnants of ice have been observed in May on several occasions; near [[Taarbaek]] on May 15, 1942 and near Copenhagen on May 11, 1771. Drift ice was also observed on May 11, 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isvintrene i 40'erne|url=http://vejr.tv2.dk/artikel/id-10070756%3Aisvintrene-i-40erne.html/mraid.js|publisher=TV 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/temaer/militaerhistorie/soeofficeren-peter-schioennings-liv/kilder/peter-schioennings-dagbog/1771/|title=1771 - Nationalmuseet|access-date=15 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416044935/http://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/temaer/militaerhistorie/soeofficeren-peter-schioennings-liv/kilder/peter-schioennings-dagbog/1771/|archive-date=16 April 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is i de danske farvande i 1700-tallet|url=https://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/temaer/klima-i-historien/den-lille-istid-og-industrialiseringen/is-i-de-danske-farvande/|publisher=Nationalmuseet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ice cover is the main habitat for two large mammals, the [[grey seal]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') and the Baltic [[ringed seal]] (''Pusa hispida botnica''), both of which feed underneath the ice and breed on its surface. Of these two seals, only the Baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not adequate ice in the Baltic Sea, as it feeds its young only while on ice. The grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. The sea ice also harbours several species of algae that live in the bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice.

===Hydrography===
[[File:Ostseetiefen.png|thumb|Depths of the Baltic Sea in metres]]
The Baltic Sea flows out through the [[Danish straits]]; however, the flow is complex. A surface layer of brackish water discharges {{convert|940|km3|abbr=on}} per year into the [[North Sea]]. Due to the difference in [[salinity]], by salinity permeation principle, a sub-surface layer of more saline water moving in the opposite direction brings in {{convert|475|km3|abbr=on}} per year. It mixes very slowly with the upper waters, resulting in a salinity gradient from top to bottom, with most of the salt water remaining below {{convert|40|to|70|m|abbr=on}} deep. The general circulation is anti-clockwise: northwards along its eastern boundary, and south along the western one .&lt;ref name=Alhonen&gt;Alhonen, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the outflow and the inflow comes entirely from fresh [[water]]. More than 250 streams drain a basin of about {{convert|1600000|km2|abbr=on}}, contributing a volume of {{convert|660|km3|abbr=on}} per year to the Baltic. They include the major rivers of north Europe, such as the [[Oder]], the [[Vistula]], the [[Neman River|Neman]], the [[Daugava River|Daugava]] and the [[Neva]]. Additional fresh water comes from the difference of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] less evaporation, which is positive.

An important source of salty water are infrequent inflows of [[North Sea]] water into the Baltic. Such inflows, are important to the Baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the Baltic deeps, used to happen regularly until the 1980s. In recent decades they have become less frequent. The latest four occurred in 1983, 1993, 2003 and 2014 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.

The water level is generally far more dependent on the regional wind situation than on tidal effects. However, tidal currents occur in narrow passages in the western parts of the Baltic Sea.

The [[significant wave height]] is generally much lower than that of the [[North Sea]]. Quite violent, sudden storms sweep the surface ten or more times a year, due to large transient temperature differences and a long reach of wind. Seasonal winds also cause small changes in sea level, of the order of {{convert|0.5|m|abbr=on}} .&lt;ref name=Alhonen/&gt;

The Baltic Sea's [[salinity]] is much lower than that of ocean water (which averages 3.5%), as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land (rivers, streams and alike), combined with the shallowness of the sea itself; runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth its total volume per year, as the volume of the basin is about {{convert|21,000|km3|abbr=on}} and yearly runoff is about {{convert|500|km3|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The open surface waters of the Baltic Sea &quot;proper&quot; generally have a salinity of 0.3 to 0.9%, which is border-line [[freshwater]]. The flow of fresh water into the sea from approximately two hundred rivers and the introduction of salt from the southwest builds up a gradient of salinity in the Baltic Sea. The highest surface salinities, generally 0.7–0.9%, is in the southwestern-most part of the Baltic, in the Arkona and Bornholm basins (the former located roughly between southeast [[Zealand]] and Bornholm, and the latter directly east of Bornholm). It gradually falls further east and north, reaching the lowest in the [[Bothnian Bay]] at around 0.3%.&lt;ref name=Hydrogeography&amp;Oxygen&gt;{{cite web | author=Viktorsson, L. | date=16 April 2018 | url=http://www.helcom.fi/baltic-sea-trends/environment-fact-sheets/hydrography/hydrography-and-oxygen-in-the-deep-basins/ |title=Hydrogeography and oxygen in the deep basins | publisher=HELCOM | accessdate=27 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking the surface water of the Baltic as a means of survival would actually hydrate the body instead of [[dehydration|dehydrating]], as is the case with ocean water.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;A healthy serum concentration of sodium is around 0.8–0.85%, and healthy kidneys can concentrate salt in urine to at least 1.4%.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

As salt water is denser than fresh water, the bottom of the Baltic Sea is saltier than the surface. This creates a vertical stratification of the water column, a [[halocline]], that represents a barrier to the exchange of [[oxygen]] and nutrients, and fosters completely separate maritime environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ices.dk/projects/balticsea/baltic%20sea-rse%20thulin%20and%20andrusaitis.pdf |title=The Baltic Sea: Its Past, Present and Future |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606211738/http://www.ices.dk/projects/balticsea/baltic%20sea-rse%20thulin%20and%20andrusaitis.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2007 }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(352&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Jan Thulin and Andris Andrushaitis, Religion, Science and the Environment Symposium V on the Baltic Sea (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between the bottom and surface salinities vary depending on location. Overall it follows the same southwest to east and north pattern as the surface. At the bottom of the Arkona Basin (equalling depths greater than {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and Bornholm Basin (depths greater than {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) it is typically 1.4–1.8%. Further east and north the salinity at the bottom is consistently lower, being the lowest in Bothnian Bay (depths greater than {{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) where it is slightly below 0.4%, or only marginally higher than the surface in the same region.&lt;ref name=Hydrogeography&amp;Oxygen/&gt;

In contrast, the salinity of the [[Danish straits]], which connect the Baltic Sea and Kattegat, tends to be significantly higher, but with major variations from year to year. For example, the surface and bottom salinity in the [[Great Belt]] is typically around 2.0% and 2.8% respectively, which is only somewhat below that of the Kattegat.&lt;ref name=Hydrogeography&amp;Oxygen/&gt; The water surplus caused by the continuous inflow of rivers and streams to the Baltic Sea means that there generally is a flow of brackish water out though the Danish straits to the Kattegat (and eventually the Atlantic).&lt;ref name=Muus1999&gt;{{cite book |author1=Muus, B. |author2=J.G. Nielsen |author3=P. Dahlstrom |author4=B. Nystrom |year=1999 |title=Sea Fish |isbn=978-8790787004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant flows in the opposite direction, salt water from the Kattegat through the Danish straits to the Baltic Sea, are less regular. From 1880 to 1980 inflows occurred on average six to seven times per decade. Since 1980 it has been much less frequent, although a very large inflow occurred in 2014.&lt;ref name=OurBalticSea/&gt;

Countries that border the sea:

{{DEN}}, {{EST}}, {{FIN}}, {{DEU}}, {{LAT}}, {{LIT}}, {{POL}}, {{RUS}}, {{SWE}}.

Countries lands in the outer [[drainage basin]]:

{{BLR}}, {{CZE}}, {{NOR}}, {{SVK}}, {{UKR}}.

The Baltic sea drainage basin is roughly four times the surface area of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden and Finland containing the majority of the forest, especially around the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

About 20% of the land is used for agriculture and pasture, mainly in Poland and around the edge of the Baltic Proper, in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

The rest of the land is heavily populated. About 85 million people live in the Baltic drainage basin, 15 million within {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} of the coast and 29 million within {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} of the coast. Around 22 million live in population centers of over 250,000. 90% of these are concentrated in the {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} band around the coast. Of the nations containing all or part of the basin, Poland includes 45% of the 85 million, Russia 12%, Sweden 10% and the others less than 6% each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sweitzer|first=J|date=May 2019|title=Land Use and Population Density in the Baltic Sea Drainage Basin: A GIS Database|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237511351|journal=Ambio|volume=25|pages=20|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Evolution of the Baltic Sea}}
The Baltic Sea somewhat resembles a [[river]]bed, with two tributaries, the [[Gulf of Finland]] and [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. [[Geology|Geological]] surveys show that before the [[Pleistocene]], instead of the Baltic Sea, there was a wide plain around a great river that paleontologists call the [[Eridanos (geology)|Eridanos]]. Several Pleistocene [[glaciation|glacial]] episodes scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. By the time of the last, or [[Eemian Stage]] ([[Marine isotopic stage|MIS]]&amp;nbsp;5e), the Eemian Sea was in place. Instead of a true sea, the Baltic can even today also be understood as the common [[estuary]] of all rivers flowing into it.

From that time the waters underwent a geologic history summarized under the names listed below. Many of the stages are named after marine animals (e.g. the [[Littorina]] [[mollusk]]) that are clear markers of changing water temperatures and salinity.

The factors that determined the sea's characteristics were the submergence or emergence of the region due to the weight of ice and subsequent isostatic readjustment, and the connecting channels it found to the [[North Sea]]-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], either through the straits of [[Denmark]] or at what are now the large lakes of [[Sweden]], and the [[White Sea]]-[[Arctic Sea]].
* [[Eemian Sea]], 130,000–115,000 ([[Before present|years ago]])
* [[Baltic Ice Lake]], 12,600–10,300
* [[Yoldia Sea]], 10,300–9500
* [[Ancylus Lake]], 9,500–8,000
* [[Mastogloia Sea]] 8,000–7,500
* [[Littorina Sea]], 7,500–4,000
* Post-Littorina Sea 4,000–present

The land is still emerging [[isostasy|isostatically]] from its depressed state, which was caused by the weight of ice during the last glaciation. The phenomenon is known as [[post-glacial rebound]]. Consequently, the surface area and the depth of the sea are diminishing. The uplift is about eight millimetres per year on the Finnish coast of the northernmost Gulf of Bothnia. In the area, the former seabed is only gently sloping, leading to large areas of land being reclaimed in what are, geologically speaking, relatively short periods (decades and centuries).

===The &quot;Baltic Sea anomaly&quot;===
{{main|Baltic Sea anomaly}}
The &quot;Baltic Sea anomaly&quot; refers to interpretations of an indistinct [[sonar]] image taken by Swedish salvage divers on the floor of the northern Baltic Sea in June 2011. The treasure hunters suggested the image showed an object with unusual features of seemingly extraordinary origin. Speculation published in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid newspapers]] claimed that the object was a sunken [[UFO]].

===Fauna and flora===
{{see also|List of fish in Sweden}}
The fauna of the Baltic Sea is a mixture of marine and freshwater species. Among marine fishes are [[Atlantic cod]], [[Atlantic herring]], [[European hake]], [[European plaice]], [[European flounder]], [[shorthorn sculpin]] and [[turbot]], and examples of freshwater species include [[European perch]], [[northern pike]], [[Coregonus|whitefish]] and [[common roach]]. Freshwater species may occur at outflows of rivers or streams in all coastal sections of the Baltic Sea. Otherwise marine species dominate in most sections of the Baltic, at least as far north as [[Gävle]], where less than one-tenth are freshwater species. Further north the pattern is inverted. In the Bothnian Bay, roughly two-thirds of the species are freshwater. In the far north of this bay, saltwater species are almost entirely absent.&lt;ref name=OurBalticSea/&gt; For example, the [[common starfish]] and [[shore crab]], two species that are very widespread along European coasts, are both unable to cope with the significantly lower salinity. Their range limit is west of Bornholm, meaning that they are absent from the vast majority of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name=OurBalticSea/&gt; Some marine species, like the Atlantic cod and European flounder, can survive at relatively low salinities, but need higher salinities to breed, which therefore occurs in deeper parts of the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name=Nissling1997&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Nissling, L. |author2=A.

There is a decrease in species richness from the Danish belts to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. The decreasing salinity along this path causes restrictions in both physiology and habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oceanography: An Illustrated Guide |editor-first=C.

However, even the most diverse sections of the Baltic Sea have far less species than the almost-full saltwater Kattegat, which is home to more than 1600 species from these groups.&lt;ref name=OurBalticSea/&gt; The lack of [[tide]]s has affected the marine species as compared with the Atlantic.

Since the Baltic Sea is so young there are only two or three known [[Endemism|endemic]] species: the brown alga ''[[Fucus radicans]]'' and the flounder ''[[Platichthys solemdali]]''. Both appear to have evolved in the Baltic basin and were only recognized as species in 2005 and 2018 respectively, having formerly been confused with more widespread relatives.&lt;ref name=Momigliano2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pereyra2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pereyra, R.T. |author2=L.

A peculiar feature of the fauna is that it contains a number of glacial [[glacial relict|relict species]], isolated populations of arctic species which have remained in the Baltic Sea since the last [[glaciation]], such as the large isopod ''[[Saduria entomon]]'', the Baltic subspecies of [[ringed seal]], and the [[fourhorn sculpin]].

{{further|Baltic Sea hypoxia}}
[[File:Phytoplankton bloom in the Baltic Sea (July 3, 2001).jpg|thumb|[[Phytoplankton]] [[algal bloom]] in the Baltic Proper, July 2001]]
Satellite images taken in July 2010 revealed a massive [[algal bloom]] covering {{convert|377000|sqkm|mi2}} in the Baltic Sea. The area of the bloom extended from Germany and Poland to Finland. Researchers of the phenomenon have indicated that algal blooms have occurred every summer for decades. Fertilizer runoff from surrounding agricultural land has exacerbated the problem and led to increased [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite spies vast algal bloom in Baltic Sea|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10740097|accessdate=27 July 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726191305/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10740097| archivedate= 26 July 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately {{convert|100000|km2|0|abbr=on}} of the Baltic's seafloor (a quarter of its total area) is a variable [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]. The more saline (and therefore denser) water remains on the bottom, isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere. This leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone. It is mainly bacteria that grow in it, digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide. Because of this large anaerobic zone, the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring Atlantic.

Plans to artificially oxygenate areas of the Baltic that have experienced eutrophication have been proposed by the [[University of Gothenburg]] and Inocean AB. The proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxygenation at a Depth of 120 Meters Could Save the Baltic Sea, Researchers Demonstrate|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110418141617.htm|website=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], Germany had to be disarmed and large quantities of ammunition stockpiles were disposed directly into the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. Environmental experts and marine biologists warn that these ammunition dumps pose a major environmental threat with potentially life-threatening consequences to the health and safety of humans on the coastlines of these seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/ticking-time-bombs-on-the-bottom-of-the-north-and-baltic-sea/a-40200208|title=Ticking time bombs on the bottom of the North and Baltic Sea|last=|first=|date=2017-08-23|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the [[Great Belt Bridge]] in Denmark (completed 1997) and the [[Øresund Bridge]]-Tunnel (completed 1999), linking Denmark with Sweden, provided a highway and railroad connection between Sweden and the Danish mainland (the [[Jutland Peninsula]], precisely the [[Zealand]]). The undersea tunnel of the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships into and out of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned about [[oil pollution]].

Much shipbuilding is carried out in the shipyards around the Baltic Sea. The largest shipyards are at [[Gdańsk]], [[Gdynia]], and [[Szczecin]], Poland; [[Kiel]], Germany; [[Karlskrona]] and [[Malmö]], Sweden; [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Turku]], and [[Helsinki]], Finland; [[Riga]], [[Ventspils]], and [[Liepāja]], Latvia; [[Klaipėda]], Lithuania; and [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.

There are several cargo and passenger ferries that operate on the Baltic Sea, such as [[Scandlines]], [[Silja Line]], [[Polferries]], the [[Viking Line]], [[Tallink]], and [[Superfast Ferries]].

== The Helsinki Convention ==

===1974 Convention===
For the first time ever, all the sources of pollution around an entire sea were made subject to a single convention, signed in 1974 by the then seven Baltic coastal states. The 1974 Convention entered into force on 3 May 1980.

===1992 Convention===

{{main|Helsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area}}
In the light of political changes and developments in international environmental and maritime law, a new convention was signed in 1992 by all the states bordering on the Baltic Sea, and the European Community. After ratification the [[Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area|Convention]] entered into force on 17 January 2000. The Convention covers the whole of the Baltic Sea area, including inland waters and the water of the sea itself, as well as the seabed. Measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the Baltic Sea to reduce land-based pollution. The Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992, entered into force on 17 January 2000.

The governing body of the Convention is the [[HELCOM|Helsinki Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helcom.fi/home/en_GB/welcome/ Helcom : Welcome] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506161857/http://www.helcom.fi/home/en_GB/welcome/ |date=6 May 2007 }}. Helcom.fi. Retrieved on 23 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as HELCOM, or Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. The present contracting parties are Denmark, Estonia, the European Community, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden.

The ratification instruments were deposited by the European Community, Germany, Latvia and Sweden in 1994, by Estonia and Finland in 1995, by Denmark in 1996, by Lithuania in 1997 and by Poland and Russia in November 1999.
