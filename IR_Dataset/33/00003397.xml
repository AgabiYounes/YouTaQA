A '''bridge''' is a [[Nonbuilding structure|structure]] built to [[Span (engineering)|span]] a physical obstacle, such as a [[body of water]], [[valley]], or [[road]], without closing the way underneath.  It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the [[terrain]] where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and [[stepping stones]], while [[Neolithic]] people built [[boardwalk]] bridges across marshland. The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] dating from the 13th century BC, in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the origin of the word ''bridge'' to an [[Old English]] word ''brycg'', of the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Fowler|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary|date=1925|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be traced directly back to Proto-Indo-European ''*bʰrēw-.'' The word for the [[Contract bridge|card game of the same name]] has a different origin.

The simplest type of a bridge is [[stepping stones]], so this may have been one of the earliest types. [[Neolithic]] people also built a form of [[boardwalk]] across marshes, of which the [[Sweet Track]] and the [[Post Track]], are examples from England that are around 6000 years old.&lt;ref Name=&quot;Current_Archaeology_somerset-levels&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=The Somerset Levels|pages=139–143|volume=XV (4)|issue=172 (Special issue on Wetlands)|journal=Current Archaeology|date=February 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used [[log bridge]]s; that is a [[timber bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=National Parks Conference| first= Department of the Interior| title=Proceedings of the National parks conference held at Berkeley, California March 11, 12, and 13, 1915| url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsnati01confgoog| accessdate=March 14, 2010| year=1915| publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]| location=Washington, DC| page=60| quote=(A log bridge) is a bridge composed of log beams, the logs being in natural condition or hewn, which are thrown across two abutments, and over which traffic may pass.| ref=NPC}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams.

Among the oldest [[timber bridge]]s is the [[Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden]] crossing upper [[Lake Zürich]] in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the [[Seedamm]] date back to 1523 BC. The first wooden footbridge led across Lake Zürich, followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the [[Roman Empire]] built a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately {{convert|1450|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland.

The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] is one of four Mycenaean [[corbel arch]] bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate [[chariot]]s, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece. Dating to the Greek [[Bronze Age]] (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.
Several intact arched stone bridges from the [[Hellenistic age|Hellenistic era]] can be found in the Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kutz, Myer|title=Handbook of Transportation Engineering, Volume II: Applications and Technologies, Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-161477-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the [[Warring States period]], the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]], built from 595 to 605 AD during the [[Sui dynasty]]. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest [[Spandrel|open-spandrel]] stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the [[Alconétar Bridge]] (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era [[Trajan's Bridge]] (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Inca rope bridge|Rope bridges]], a simple type of [[suspension bridge]], were used by the [[Inca]] civilization in the [[Andes]] mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.

During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by [[Hans Ulrich Grubenmann]], [[Johannes Grubenmann]], and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by [[Hubert Gautier]] in 1716.

A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of [[the Iron Bridge]] in Shropshire, England in 1779. It used [[cast iron]] for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |title= Iron Bridge |author= &lt;!--&quot;ECPK&quot;--&gt; |date= |website= Engineering Timelines |publisher= Engineering Timelines |access-date= November 18, 2016 |quote= |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204815/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |archivedate= March 4, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, [[truss]] systems of [[wrought iron]] were developed for larger bridges, but iron does not have the [[tensile strength]] to support large loads.

In 1927 [[welding]] pioneer [[Stefan Bryła]] designed the first welded [[road bridge]] in the world, the [[Maurzyce Bridge]] which was later built across the river [[Słudwia River|Słudwia]] at Maurzyce near [[Łowicz]], Poland in 1929.

==Types of bridges==
Bridges can be categorized in several different ways. Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.

===Structure types===
Bridges may be classified by how the actions of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], [[compression (physical)|compression]], [[bending]], [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of these to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces and moments may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed bridge, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss.

|[[Beam bridges]] are horizontal beams supported at each end by substructure units and can be either ''[[simply supported]]'' when the beams only connect across a single span, or ''continuous'' when the beams are connected across two or more spans. When there are multiple spans, the intermediate supports are known as [[bridge pier|piers]]. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges can range from small, wooden beams to large, steel boxes. The vertical force on the bridge becomes a [[Shear stress|shear]] and [[Bending|flexural]] load on the beam which is transferred down its length to the substructures on either side&lt;ref name=&quot;beambridge&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | title=Beam bridges | publisher=Design Technology | access-date=May 14, 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518121256/http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | archivedate=May 18, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically made of steel, concrete or wood. [[Girder bridge]]s and [[plate girder bridge]]s, usually made from steel, are types of beam bridges. [[Box girder bridge]]s, made from steel, concrete, or both, are also beam bridges. Beam bridge spans rarely exceed {{convert|250|ft|m}} long, as the flexural stresses increase proportional to the square of the length (and deflection increases proportional to the 4th power of the length).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_bending/beam_bending1.htm Structural Beam Deflection Stress Bending Equations / Calculation Supported on Both Ends Uniform Loading] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122060213/http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_bending/beam_bending1.htm |date=January 22, 2013 }}.

| A [[truss bridge]] is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss. This truss is a structure of connected elements forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by nineteenth and early twentieth century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct owing to its efficient use of materials.

| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|[[File:CantileverBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Cantilever bridge'''{{br}}
|[[Cantilever bridge]]s are built using [[cantilever]]s—horizontal beams supported on only one end. Most cantilever bridges use a pair of [[continuous span]]s that extend from opposite sides of the supporting piers to meet at the center of the obstacle the bridge crosses. Cantilever bridges are constructed using much the same materials and techniques as beam bridges. The difference comes in the action of the forces through the bridge.

Some cantilever bridges also have a smaller beam connecting the two cantilevers, for extra strength.

The largest cantilever bridge is the {{convert|549|m|adj=on}} [[Quebec Bridge]] in Quebec, Canada.

| style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|[[File:ArchBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Arch bridge'''{{br}}
|[[Arch bridge]]s have [[abutments]] at each end. The weight of the bridge is thrust into the [[abutments]] at either side. The earliest known arch bridges were built by the Greeks, and include the [[Arkadiko Bridge]].

With the span of {{convert|220|m}}, the [[Solkan Bridge]] over the [[Soča]] River at [[Solkan]] in Slovenia is the second-largest stone bridge in the world and the longest railroad stone bridge.

|Tied arch bridges have an arch-shaped superstructure, but differ from conventional arch bridges. Instead of transferring the weight of the bridge and traffic loads into thrust forces into the abutments, the ends of the arches are restrained by tension in the bottom chord of the structure.

|Suspension bridges are suspended from cables. The earliest suspension bridges were made of ropes or vines covered with pieces of bamboo. In modern bridges, the cables hang from towers that are attached to caissons or cofferdams. The caissons or cofferdams are implanted deep into the bed of the lake, river or sea. Sub-types include the [[simple suspension bridge]], the [[stressed ribbon bridge]], the [[underspanned suspension bridge]], the [[suspended-deck suspension bridge]], and the [[self-anchored suspension bridge]]. There is also what is sometimes called a &quot;semi-suspension&quot; bridge, of which the [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge]] in Burton-upon-Trent is the only one of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''A.O.P.

Some Engineers sub-divide 'beam' bridges into slab, beam-and-slab and box girder on the basis of their cross-section.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; A slab can be solid or [[hollow-core slab|voided]] (though this is no longer favored for inspectability reasons) while beam-and-slab consists of concrete or steel girders connected by a concrete slab.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; A [[Box girder bridge|box-girder]] cross-section consists of a single-cell or multi-cellular box. In recent years, [[integral bridge]] construction has also become popular.[[File:New Champlain Bridge, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|New Champlain Bridge over the St Lawrence river, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Most bridges are fixed bridges, meaning they have no moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as [[Bailey bridge]]s, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. [[Movable bridge]]s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

{{See also|List of multi-level bridges}}
Double-decked (or double-decker) bridges have two levels, such as the [[George Washington Bridge]], connecting [[New York City]] to [[Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]], US, as the world's busiest bridge, carrying 102 million vehicles annually;&lt;ref name=&quot;panynj.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=abcgwb/&gt; [[truss]] work between the roadway levels provided stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when the lower level was installed three decades after the upper level. The [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] in [[Hong Kong]] have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for [[MTR]] metro trains. Some double-decked bridges only use one level for street traffic; the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] in [[Minneapolis]] reserves its lower level for automobile and light rail traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the [[University of Minnesota]]). Likewise, in [[Toronto]], the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the [[Bloor–Danforth line|Bloor–Danforth]] [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line]] on its lower deck. The western span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] also has two levels.

[[Robert Stephenson]]'s [[High Level Bridge]] across the [[River Tyne]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-decked bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include [[Britannia Bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] and [[Craigavon Bridge]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Øresund Bridge|Oresund Bridge]] between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]] consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level. [[Tower Bridge]] in London is different example of a double-decked bridge, with the central section consisting of a low-level [[Bascule bridge|bascule span]] and a high-level [[footbridge]].

===Viaducts===
{{main|Viaduct}}
A viaduct is made up of multiple bridges connected into one longer structure. The longest and some of the highest bridges are viaducts, such as the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] and [[Millau Viaduct]].

===Multi-way bridge===
[[File:Tridge Undercarriage.jpg|thumb|right|The [[The Tridge (Midland, Michigan)|Tridge]] is a type of [[multi-way bridge]]]]
{{main|Multi-way bridge}}
A multi-way bridge has three or more separate spans which meet near the center of the bridge. Multi-way bridges with only three spans appear as a &quot;T&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; when viewed from above. Multi-way bridges are extremely rare. [[The Tridge (Midland, Michigan)|The Tridge]], [[Margaret Bridge]], and [[Y-Bridge (Zanesville, Ohio)|Zanesville Y-Bridge]] are examples.

===Bridge types by use===
A bridge can be categorized by what it is designed to carry, such as trains, pedestrian or road traffic ('''road bridge'''), a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] is a bridge that carries water, resembling a viaduct, which is a bridge that connects points of equal height. A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic. Overway is a term for a bridge that separates incompatible intersecting traffic, especially road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170491612 |title=The Mile-End Crossing |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |volume=LXXXI |issue=6,004 |location=South Australia |date=February 23, 1924 |accessdate=March 26, 2018 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the [[Storstrøm Bridge]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of [[Nový Most]] Bridge in [[Bratislava]], which features a restaurant, or a [[bridge-restaurant]] which is a bridge built to serve as a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Conservationists use wildlife overpasses to stop habitat fragmentation and animal-vehicle collisions. The first [[Wildlife crossing|animal bridges]] sprung up in France in the 1950s, and these types of bridges are now used worldwide to protect both large and small wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals Need Infrastructure Too|author=Sarah Holder|date=31 July 2018|website=CityLab|accessdate=21 Feb 2019|url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/07/wildlife-crossings-bridges-tunnels-animals-roads-highways-roadkill/566210/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridges for Animals to Safely Cross Freeways Are Popping Up Around the World|date=9 Feb 2017|accessdate=21 Feb 2019|website=My Modern Met|author=Jessica Stewart|url=https://mymodernmet.com/wildlife-crossings/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Coolest Animal Bridges|author=Rachel Newer|date=23 July 2012|website=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=21 Feb 2019|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/worlds-coolest-animal-bridges-5774855/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undertimbers of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting [[suicide]], and become known as [[suicide bridge]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Marsh | first=Julia | title=Port Authority not liable for NYC bridge jumpers: judge | date=December 30, 2018 | url=https://nypost.com/2018/12/30/george-washington-bridge-jumpers-only-have-themselves-to-blame-judge/ | access-date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used to build the structure are also used to categorize bridges. Until the end of the 18th century, bridges were made out of timber, stone and masonry. Modern bridges are currently built in concrete, steel, fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), stainless steel or combinations of those materials.

===Military bridge===
[[File:AVLB 01.jpg|thumb|left|Tank bridge transporter of the United States Army. These are mobile bridges; tanks and other vehicles can use them to cross certain obstacles.]]

The Tank bridge transporter (TBT) has the same cross-country performance as a tank even when fully loaded. It can deploy, drop off and load bridges independently, but it cannot recover them.

== Analysis and design ==
Unlike buildings whose design is led by architects, bridges are usually designed by engineers. This follows from the importance of the engineering requirements; namely spanning the obstacle and having the durability to survive, with minimal maintenance, in an aggressive outdoor environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Bridges are first analysed; the bending moment and shear force distributions are calculated due to the applied loads. For this, the [[finite element method]] is the most popular. The analysis can be one, two or three-dimensional. For the majority of bridges, a two-dimensional plate model (often with stiffening beams) is sufficient or an upstand finite element model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Brien|first=E.J|last2=Keogh|first2=D.L|date=December 1998|title=Upstand finite element analysis of slab bridges|journal=Computers &amp; Structures|volume=69|issue=6|pages=671–683|doi=10.1016/S0045-7949(98)00148-5|hdl=10197/4054}}&lt;/ref&gt; On completion of the analysis, the bridge is designed to resist the applied bending moments and shear forces, section sizes are selected with sufficient capacity to resist the stresses. Many bridges are made of [[prestressed concrete]] which has good durability properties, either by pre-tensioning of beams prior to installation or post-tensioning on site.

In most countries, bridges, like other structures, are designed according to [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]] (LRFD) principles. In simple terms, this means that the load is factored up by a factor greater than unity, while the resistance or capacity of the structure is factored down, by a factor less than unity. The effect of the factored load (stress, bending moment) should be less than the factored resistance to that effect. Both of these factors allow for uncertainty and are greater when the uncertainty is greater.

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Utrecht 'Prins Claus brug'.jpg|thumb|The Prins Clausbrug across the [[Amsterdam–Rhine Canal]] in [[Utrecht]], [[Netherlands]]]]
[[File:Stari_Most22.jpg|thumb|The World Heritage Site of [[Stari Most]] (Old Bridge) gives its name to the city of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]]
Most bridges are utilitarian in appearance, but in some cases, the appearance of the bridge can have great importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bruc̈ken : Asthetik und Gestaltung |trans-title=Bridges : aesthetics and design |last=Leonhardt |first=Fritz |date=1984 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0262121050 |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=10821288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbor entrance. These are sometimes known as signature bridges. Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in New York.

[[File:Bridge to Pier 6, Gatwick North Terminal - geograph.org.uk - 74055.jpg|thumb|Bridge at [[Gatwick Airport]], under which planes can pass]]
To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a [[Moon bridge]], evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor and Empress, with their attendants.

==Bridge maintenance==
[[File:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg|thumb|Highway bridge treated with [[high-frequency impact treatment]]]]
Bridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is considerable&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Žnidarič|first=Aleš|last2=Pakrashi|first2=Vikram|last3=O'Brien|first3=Eugene|last4=O'Connor|first4=Alan|date=December 2011|title=A review of road structure data in six European countries|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Urban Design and Planning|volume=164|issue=4|pages=225–232|doi=10.1680/udap.900054|issn=1755-0793|hdl=10197/4877|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79be612f28b2acc303ba4a8882579abc0b553efe}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is higher in some countries than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by [[High Frequency Impact Treatment|aftertreatment of the weld transitions]]. This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.

== Bridge traffic loading ==
While the response of a bridge to the applied loading is well understood, the applied traffic loading itself is still the subject of research.&lt;ref name=&quot;engineer. 2015&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bridge deck analysis|last=OBrien|first=Eugene J. |last2=Keogh |first2=Damien L. |last3=O'Connor |first3=Alan |date=2015 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781482227239 |oclc=897489682}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a statistical problem as loading is highly variable, particularly for road bridges. Load Effects in bridges (stresses, bending moments) are designed for using the principles of [[Limit state design|Load and Resistance Factor Design]]. Before factoring to allow for uncertainty, the load effect is generally considered to be the maximum characteristic value in a specified [[return period]]. Notably, in Europe, it is the maximum value expected in 1000 years.

Bridge standards generally include a load model, deemed to represent the characteristic maximum load to be expected in the return period. In the past, these load models were agreed by standard drafting committees of experts but today, this situation is changing. It is now possible to measure the components of bridge traffic load, to weigh trucks, using [[Weigh in motion|weigh-in-motion]] (WIM) technologies. With extensive WIM databases, it is possible to calculate the maximum expected load effect in the specified return period. This is an active area of research, addressing issues of opposing direction lanes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enright|first=Bernard|last2=O'Brien|first2=Eugene J.|date=December 2013|title=Monte Carlo simulation of extreme traffic loading on short and medium span bridges|journal=Structure and Infrastructure Engineering|volume=9|issue=12|pages=1267–1282|doi=10.1080/15732479.2012.688753|issn=1573-2479|hdl=10197/4868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caprani|first=Colin C.|last2=OBrien|first2=Eugene J.|date=March 2010|title=The use of predictive likelihood to estimate the distribution of extreme bridge traffic load effect|journal=Structural Safety|volume=32|issue=2|pages=138–144|doi=10.1016/j.strusafe.2009.09.001|hdl=10197/2329}}&lt;/ref&gt; side-by-side (same direction) lanes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBrien|first=Eugene J.|last2=Enright|first2=Bernard|date=July 2011|title=Modeling same-direction two-lane traffic for bridge loading|journal=Structural Safety|volume=33|issue=4–5|pages=296–304|doi=10.1016/j.strusafe.2011.04.004|hdl=10197/3062|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/engschcivart/41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBrien|first=Eugene J.|last2=Leahy|first2=Cathal|last3=Enright|first3=Bernard|last4=Caprani|first4=Colin C.|date=2016-09-30|title=Validation of scenario modelling for bridge loading|journal=The Baltic Journal of Road and Bridge Engineering|volume=11|issue=3|pages=233–241|doi=10.3846/bjrbe.2016.27|issn=1822-427X|hdl=10197/9252}}&lt;/ref&gt; traffic growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBrien|first=E.J.|last2=Bordallo-Ruiz|first2=A.|last3=Enright|first3=B.|date=September 2014|title=Lifetime maximum load effects on short-span bridges subject to growing traffic volumes|journal=Structural Safety|volume=50|pages=113–122|doi=10.1016/j.strusafe.2014.05.005|hdl=10197/7069}}&lt;/ref&gt; permit/non-permit vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enright|first=Bernard|last2=OBrien|first2=Eugene J.|last3=Leahy|first3=Cathal|date=December 2016|title=Identifying and modelling permit trucks for bridge loading|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Bridge Engineering|volume=169|issue=4|pages=235–244|doi=10.1680/bren.14.00031|issn=1478-4637|hdl=10197/9246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long-span bridges (see below).

[[File:Forth from above.jpg|thumb|Traffic on [[Forth Road Bridge]], Scotland before it was closed to general traffic. Traffic has now been moved to the [[Queensferry Crossing]], that can be seen on the left.]]
Most bridge standards are only applicable for short and medium spans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.S|first=Nowak|last2=M|first2=Lutomirska|last3=F.I|first3=Sheikh Ibrahim|date=2010|title=The development of live load for long span bridges|journal=Bridge Structures|volume=6|issue=1, 2|pages=73–79|doi=10.3233/BRS-2010-006|issn=1573-2487}}&lt;/ref&gt; - for example, the Eurocode is only applicable for loaded lengths up to 200 m. Longer spans are dealt with on a case by case basis. It is generally accepted that the intensity of load reduces as span increases because the probability of many trucks being closely spaced and extremely heavy reduces as the number of trucks involved increases. It is also generally assumed that short spans are governed by a small number of trucks traveling at high speed, with an allowance for dynamics. Longer spans on the other hand, are governed by congested traffic and no allowance for dynamics is needed. Calculating the loading due to congested traffic remains a challenge as there is a paucity of data on inter-vehicle gaps, both within-lane and inter-lane, in congested conditions. [[Weigh in motion|Weigh-in-Motion]] (WIM) systems provide data on inter-vehicle gaps but only operate well in free flowing traffic conditions. Some authors have used cameras to measure gaps and vehicle lengths in jammed situations and have inferred weights from lengths using WIM data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Micu|first=Elena Alexandra|last2=Obrien|first2=Eugene John|last3=Malekjafarian|first3=Abdollah|last4=Quilligan|first4=Michael|date=2018-12-21|title=Estimation of Extreme Load Effects on Long-Span Bridges Using Traffic Image Data|journal=The Baltic Journal of Road and Bridge Engineering|volume=13|issue=4|pages=429–446|doi=10.7250/bjrbe.2018-13.427|issn=1822-4288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have used [[microsimulation]] to generate typical clusters of vehicles on the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBrien|first=E.

== Bridge vibration ==
Bridges vibrate under load and this contributes, to a greater or lesser extent, to the stresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Bridge deck analysis |last=O'Brien |first=Eugene J. |last2=Keogh |first2=Damien L. |last3=O'Connor |first3=Alan J. |isbn=9781482227246 |edition=Second |location=Boca Raton |oclc=892094185|date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibration and dynamics are generally more significant for slender structures such as pedestrian bridges and long-span road or rail bridges. One of the most famous examples is the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] that collapsed shortly after being constructed due to excessive vibration. More recently, the [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]] in London vibrated excessively under pedestrian loading and was closed and retrofitted with a system of dampers. For smaller bridges, dynamics is not catastrophic but can contribute an added amplification to the stresses due to static effects. For example, the Eurocode for bridge loading specifies amplifications of between 10% and 70%, depending on the span, the number of traffic lanes and the type of stress (bending moment or shear force).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Research perspectives : traffic loading on highway bridges |first=Peter |last=Dawe |date=2003 |publisher=Thomas Telford |isbn=0727732412 |location=London |oclc=53389159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bridge failures==

{{see also|List of bridge failures}}

The failure of bridges is of special concern for [[structural engineers]] in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the [[Victorian era]] when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.

In the United States, the [[National Bridge Inventory]] tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as &quot;structurally deficient&quot; and &quot;functionally obsolete&quot;.

==Bridge health monitoring==
There are several methods used to monitor the condition of large structures like bridges. Many long-span bridges are now routinely monitored with a range of sensors. Many types of sensors are used, including strain transducers, [[accelerometer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|title=The new Minnesota smart bridge|work=mnme.com|accessdate=January 30, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823002008/http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|archivedate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; tiltmeters, and GPS. Accelerometers have the advantage that they are inertial, i.e., they do not require a reference point to measure from. This is often a problem for distance or deflection measurement, especially if the bridge is over water.

An option for structural-integrity monitoring is &quot;non-contact monitoring&quot;, which uses the [[Doppler effect]] (Doppler shift). A [[laser]] beam from a [[Laser Doppler Vibrometer]] is directed at the point of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|title=Basic Principles of Vibrometry|work=polytec.com|accessdate=January 25, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610192737/http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|archivedate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible.  Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access. However, vibrometers are relatively expensive and have the disadvantage that a reference point is needed to measure from.

Snapshots in time of the external condition of a bridge can be recorded using [[Lidar]] to aid bridge inspection.&lt;ref name=&quot;omer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Omer | display-authors = et. al. | year = 2018 | title = Performance evaluation of bridges using virtual reality | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325194259 | journal = Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Computational Mechanics (ECCM 6) &amp; 7th European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics (ECFD 7), Glasgow, Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can provide measurement of the bridge geometry (to facilitate the building of a computer model) but the accuracy is generally insufficient to measure bridge deflections under load.

While larger modern bridges are routinely monitored electronically, smaller bridges are generally inspected visually by trained inspectors. There is considerable research interest in the challenge of smaller bridges as they are often remote and do not have electrical power on site. Possible solutions are the installation of sensors on a specialist inspection vehicle and the use of its measurements as it drives over the bridge to infer information about the bridge condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Y.-B.|last2=Lin|first2=C.W.|last3=Yau|first3=J.D.|date=May 2004|title=Extracting bridge frequencies from the dynamic response of a passing vehicle|journal=Journal of Sound and Vibration|volume=272 |issue=3–5|pages=471–493|doi=10.1016/S0022-460X(03)00378-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Y.
