Almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It is likely that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch, independently invented beer.

The process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a [[brewing company]]. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as [[homebrewing]] regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries, which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the US in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homebrew4u.co.uk/news-articles/breaking-homebrewing-law-in-alabama.asp|title=Breaking the Home Brewing Law in Alabama|publisher=Homebrew4u.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009023506/http://www.homebrew4u.co.uk/news-articles/breaking-homebrewing-law-in-alabama.asp|archivedate=9 October 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called [[wort]] and to convert the wort into the alcoholic drink known as beer in a fermentation process effected by [[Brewer's yeast|yeast]].

The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as &quot;[[mashing]]&quot;. Hot water (known as &quot;liquor&quot; in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as &quot;[[grist]]&quot;) in a [[mash tun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/protz-the-brewer.htm|title=Roger Protz tries his hand at brewing|publisher=Beer-pages.com|date=June 2007|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abgbrew.com/brewerslog.htm ABGbrew.com] Steve Parkes, ''British Brewing'', American Brewers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt; during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as &quot;sparging&quot;. This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called ''wort separation''. The traditional process for wort separation is [[lautering]], in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhammer, Ted (2008), ''The Brewer's Handbook'', 2nd ed., Apex, {{ISBN|978-0-9675212-3-7}} pp. 181 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Brewer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth. Century by J Amman.png|thumb|left|upright|A 16th-century brewery]]

Most modern breweries use a continuous sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://morebeer.com/brewingtechniques/library/backissues/issue2.2/mosher.html Brewingtechniques.com], Randy Mosher, &quot;Parti-Gyle Brewing&quot;, ''Brewing Techniques'', March/April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or &quot;copper&quot; (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2005/brewing.html|title=Copper Brewing Vessels|publisher=Msm.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. [[Hops]] are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=hops+boiled+brewing&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U20D5Blv8GqmsNXncZ7twjbH50Zxg#PPA275,M1 Books.google.co.uk], Michael Lewis, Tom W.

After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing [[ethanol]], fine [[Suspended solids|particulate matter]] suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 13: Beer Fermentation |chapter-url=http://www.beer-brewing.com/apex/beer_chapters/ch06_beer_adjuncts.htm |title=The Brewers Handbook |publisher=Apex Pub |author=Ted Goldammer |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-9675212-0-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During fermentation most of the [[carbon dioxide]] is allowed to escape through a [[trap (plumbing)|trap]] and the beer is left with carbonation of only about one atmosphere of pressure. The carbonation is often increased either by transferring the beer to a [[pressure vessel]] such as a [[keg]] and introducing pressurized carbon dioxide, or by transferring it before the fermentation is finished so that carbon dioxide pressure builds up inside the container as the fermentation finishes. Sometimes the beer is put unfiltered (so it still contains yeast) into bottles with some [[added sugar]], which then produces the desired amount of carbon dioxide inside the bottle.&lt;ref name=carbonated/&gt;

Fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of [[Brewing#Secondary fermentation|secondary fermentation]]. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=secondary+fermentation+brewing&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3T7G6RMyj_w9QtnLY9ZeANNuSshQ Google Books] Michael Lewis, Tom W.

The starch source, termed as the &quot;[[mash ingredients]]&quot;, in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:en:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''/Brewing/Chemistry.

After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the [[Mashing|mash]], and act as a filter bed during [[lautering]], when sweet [[wort]] is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, [[oats]], and [[rye]], and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used.

Top-fermented beers are most commonly produced with ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', a [[top-fermenting yeast]] which [[Yeast flocculation|clumps]] and rises to the surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=L8RwjqUKLygC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=top+fermenting&amp;q=top%20fermenting|title=Handbook of Brewing: Processes, Technology, Markets|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=7 August 2010|isbn=978-3-527-31674-8|date=4 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically between {{convert|15|and|25|C|F}}. At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of [[ester]]s and other secondary flavour and aroma products, and the result is often a beer with slightly &quot;fruity&quot; compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, [[Banana beer|banana]], plum, or prune, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/books?id=allg4XxlOM4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=beer+fruity+esters&amp;sig=ACfU3U3y2dmIwcGJCI9sZPpXzWfNHax3Vg Google Books] Lalli Nykänen, Heikki Suomalainen, ''Aroma of Beer, Wine and Distilled Alcoholic Beverages'' p. 13, Springer (1983), {{ISBN|90-277-1553-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of hops into England from Flanders in the 15th century, &quot;ale&quot; referred to an unhopped fermented drink, &quot;beer&quot; being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=term+ale+-+unhopped+beer&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7eZH_pGNRd&amp;sig=VT_3jQ8PaSpw_1dCfWvM1Y04hwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result Google books] F.

It is applied to [[bottle conditioned]] and [[cask conditioned]] beers.

[[Pale ale]] is a beer which uses a top-fermenting yeast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/ipa.htm|title=Roger Protz on India Pale ale|publisher=beer-pages.com|accessdate=3 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and predominantly pale malt. It is one of the world's major beer styles.

[[Stout]] and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley, and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast. There are a number of variations including Baltic porter, dry stout, and Imperial stout. The name &quot;porter&quot; was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.php?id=231 |title=Porter and Stout |publisher=CAMRA |accessdate=24 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319235233/http://www.camra.org.uk/page.php?id=231 |archivedate=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0937381446?p=S003#reader-page Amazon Online Reader : Stout (Classic Beer Style Series, 10)].&lt;/ref&gt; The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000041.html|title=Porter casts a long shadow on ale history|publisher=beerhunter.com|accessdate=24 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403081327/http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000041.html|archivedate=3 April 2010 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mild ale]] has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually dark coloured with an [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.

[[Wheat beer]] is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of [[malted barley]]. Wheat beers are usually [[top-fermented]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Eric Warner, ''German Wheat Beer''. Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-937381-34-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.

[[File:Kriek Beer 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kriek lambic|Kriek]], a variety of beer brewed with cherries]]
[[Lambic]], a beer of [[Belgian beers|Belgium]], is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are not strains of brewer's yeast (''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'') and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Brettanomyces lambicus]]'' are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Tim; Pollard, Chris; and Pattyn, Joris; ''Lambicland: Lambikland'', Rev Ed.

[[File:Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen 11.2oz bottle and beer mug.jpg|thumb|left|A [[marzen]] style lager]]

[[Lager]] is cool fermented beer. [[Pale lager]]s are the most commonly consumed beers in the world. Many are of the “[[pilsner]]” type. The name &quot;lager&quot; comes from the German &quot;lagern&quot; for &quot;to store&quot;, as brewers around Bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000255.html Beerhunter.com] Michael Jackson, ''BeerHunter'', &quot;The birth of lager&quot;, 1 March 1996. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast (''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'') and typically undergoes primary fermentation at {{convert|7|–|12|C|F}} (the fermentation phase), and then is given a long secondary fermentation at {{convert|0|–|4|C|F}} (the lagering phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of [[ester]]s and other byproducts, resulting in a &quot;cleaner&quot;-tasting beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-09/cshl-bbb090308.php Eurekalert.org] Gavin Sherlock, PhD, EurekAlert, ''Brewing better beer: Scientists determine the genomic origins of lager yeasts'', 10 September 2008. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.

==Measurement==
{{Main|Beer measurement}}

Beer is measured and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived [[bitter (taste)|bitterness]] is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists]] and the [[European Brewery Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanbreweryconvention.org/EBCmain/commiteesgroups/index.php|title=The Analysis Committee|accessdate=5 August 2009|author=European Brewery Convention|quote=The EBC Analysis Committee also works closely together with the 'American Society of Brewing Chemists' (ASBC) to establish so-called 'International methods' with world-wide recognition of applicability.

===Colour===
[[File:Paulaner.jpg|thumb|upright|Paulaner [[dunkel]]&amp;nbsp;– a dark lager]]

Beer colour is determined by the malt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5PVTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+color+of+beer+is+first+of+all+determined+by+the+malt+type.&amp;dq=The+color+of+beer+is+first+of+all+determined+by+the+malt+type.&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1 Google Books] Fritz Ullmann, ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' Vol A-11 pp455, VCH (1985), {{ISBN|3-527-20103-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. ''Pale lager'' and ''pale ale'' are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term ''pale ale'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer-News/Article-579.htm British Bitter] &quot;A beer style or a way of life?&quot;, RateBeer (January 2006).

Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as [[stout]], use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gtKOyU9ci1MC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=roasted+malts+color+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2RMwZBZ6rKkRnpNm-b9zevMVTffg Google Books] Costas Katsigris, Chris Thomas, ''The Bar and Beverage Book'' pp320, John Wiley and Sons (2006), {{ISBN|0-471-64799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QDpi_6VnhegC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=roasted+malts+color+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U1-949VOcJUnOwWvO82sgOZ4_dQ5w Google Books] J.

The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily &quot;light&quot; beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast in higher concentrations; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.

The weakest beers are [[dealcoholized beer]]s, which typically have less than 0.05% alcohol (also called &quot;near beer&quot;) and [[light beer]]s, which usually have 4% alcohol.

==Serving==

===Draught===
{{Main|Draught beer|Cask ale}}
[[File:Cask Ales.jpg|thumb|left|A selection of [[cask beer]]s]]

Draught (also spelled &quot;draft&quot;) beer from a pressurised [[keg]] using a lever-style dispenser and a spout is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing [[beer tap|tap]] or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. [[Nitrogen]] produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense [[Beer head|head]] and a creamy [[mouthfeel]]. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called [[beer ball]]s. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.

In the 1980s, Guinness introduced the [[Widget (beer)|beer widget]], a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question446.htm|title=How does the widget in a beer can work? |publisher= [[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate= 5 November 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102214918/http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question446.htm |archivedate= 2 November 2007 |url-status= live|date=2000-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''draft'' and ''draught'' can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or [[beer bottle|bottled]] beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.

Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed &quot;[[real ale]]&quot; by the [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a &quot;[[stillage]]&quot; which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between {{convert|11|–|13|C|F|disp=or}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cask-marque.co.uk/beer-information/beer-temperature?highlight=YToxOntpOjA7czoxMToidGVtcGVyYXR1cmUiO30= |title= Beer Temperature |publisher= cask-marque.co.uk |accessdate= 21 June 2012 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121027200750/http://www.cask-marque.co.uk/beer-information/beer-temperature?highlight=YToxOntpOjA7czoxMToidGVtcGVyYXR1cmUiO30= |archivedate= 27 October 2012 |df= dmy-all |date= 2014-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard [[spile]] or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to &quot;drop&quot; (clear) again, as well as to fully [[Brewing#Conditioning|condition]] — this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being &quot;gravity-fed&quot; directly into the glass.

Draught beer's environmental impact can be 68% lower than bottled beer due to packaging differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Draught Beats Bottled in Life Cycle Analysis |url= http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/draught-beer-beats-bottled-in-life-cycle-assessment.html#ch01 |publisher= treehugger.com |accessdate= 15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= LCA of an Italian lager |journal= The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment |volume= 13 |issue= 2 |pages= 133–139 |doi= 10.1065/lca2007.02.306 |year= 2007 |last1= Cordella |first1= Mauro |last2= Tugnoli |first2= Alessandro |last3= Spadoni |first3= Gigliola |last4= Santarelli |first4= Francesco |last5= Zangrando |first5= Tullio }}&lt;/ref&gt; A life cycle study of one beer brand, including grain production, brewing, bottling, distribution and waste management, shows that the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from a 6-pack of micro-brew beer is about 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds).&lt;ref name=&quot;newbelgium&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Carbon Footprint of Fat Tire Amber Ale |url= http://www.newbelgium.com/files/shared/the-carbon-footprint-of-fat-tire-amber-ale-2008-public-dist-rfs_0.pdf |publisher= newbelgium.com |accessdate= 15 January 2008 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224214330/http://www.newbelgium.com/files/shared/the-carbon-footprint-of-fat-tire-amber-ale-2008-public-dist-rfs_0.pdf |archivedate= 24 February 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of natural habitat potential from the 6-pack of micro-brew beer is estimated to be 2.5 square metres (26 square feet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ecological effects of beer |url= http://ecofx.org/wiki/index.php?title=Beer |publisher= ecofx.org |accessdate= 15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downstream emissions from distribution, retail, storage and disposal of waste can be over 45% of a bottled micro-brew beer's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;newbelgium&quot; /&gt; Where legal, the use of a refillable jug, reusable bottle or other reusable containers to transport draught beer from a store or a bar, rather than buying pre-bottled beer, can reduce the environmental impact of beer consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= When Passions Collide&amp;nbsp;…|url= http://terrapass.com/society/when-passions-c-1/|publisher= terrapass.com|accessdate= 15 January 2008|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121111200646/http://www.terrapass.com/society/when-passions-c-1/|archivedate= 11 November 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packaging===
{{Main|Beer bottle|Drink can}}
[[File:Dutch beers.jpg|thumb|Assortment of beer bottles]]

Most beers are cleared of yeast by [[filtered beer|filtering]] when packaged in bottles and cans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-FviAgcmo90C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=beer+classification+ale+lager&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0GLvHLLvTVL_knmgkSWkPt3iz_eA#PPA58,M1 Google books] Charles W.

Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[bottle conditioning|bottle conditioned]] beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GG-60Vtl81EC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=beer+bottle+conditioned&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3zLu6ExkPefZvEj5NVqZxQFH3kcQ Google Books] T.

Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with [[wheat beer]]s. Typically, when serving a [[Wheat beer#Weissbier|hefeweizen wheat beer]], 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.

Many beers are sold in cans, though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9% of beer was sold in cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Beer Statistics—beer sales by package type|publisher=European Beer Guide|url=http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm#package|accessdate=5 April 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426040130/http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm|archivedate=26 April 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass.

===Temperature===

The temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer [[pale lager]] to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength [[pale ale]] to be served cool, while a strong [[barley wine]] or [[imperial stout]] to be served at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/library/beerbreak/archives/beerbreak20000921.php RealBeer] ''Beyond the coldest beer in town'', 21 September 2000. Retrieved 11 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beer writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled ({{convert|7|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for &quot;light&quot; beers (pale lagers); chilled ({{convert|8|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for [[Berliner Weisse]] and other wheat beers; lightly chilled ({{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for all dark lagers, [[altbier]] and German wheat beers; cellar temperature ({{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for regular British [[ale]], [[stout]] and most [[Belgian beer|Belgian specialities]]; and room temperature ({{convert|15.5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} for strong dark ales (especially [[trappist beer]]) and [[barley wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jackson, ''Michael Jackson's Beer Companion'', Courage Books; 2 edition (27 February 2000), {{ISBN|0-7624-0772-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vessels===
{{Main|Beer glassware}}

Beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a [[beer stein]], a mug, a [[pewter]] [[tankard]], a beer bottle or a can; or at [[music festival]]s and some bars and nightclubs, from a plastic cup. The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style.&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Priest, Graham G. Stewart, ''Handbook of Brewing'' (2006), 48&lt;/ref&gt; Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales of their product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?storycode=64595|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020628/http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?storycode=64595|archivedate=24 July 2011|title=How Miller Brands partners with licensees to drive sales|publisher=thepublican.com|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pouring process has an influence on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the [[beer tap|tap]] or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of [[carbonation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xnLeJAPYzGkC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=pouring+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2vCrDBPoQzAIFMN2gjtxKYYQZW3Q Google Books] Ray Foley, Heather Dismore, ''Running a Bar For Dummies'' pp. 211–212, For Dummies (2007), {{ISBN|0-470-04919-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beer contains [[ethanol]], an [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], which has short and long-term effects on the user when consumed. Different concentrations of alcohol in the human body have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption has taken place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or [[street drugs]], among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03%–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]], increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]], impaired judgement and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious) and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. As with all alcoholic drinks, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.

It is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a [[beer belly]], rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between [[binge drinking]] and a beer belly.

A study published in the ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the [[flavour]] of beer alone could provoke [[dopamine]] activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to [[positron emission tomography]] scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a [[sports drink]] onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a [[dopamine]] release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beer on the brain: how taste alone can drive men to drink|url=http://theconversation.com/beer-on-the-brain-how-taste-alone-can-drive-men-to-drink-13509|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=18 April 2013|author=Carley Tonoli|author2=Liz Minchin|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
