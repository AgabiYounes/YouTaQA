'''Angst''' means [[fear]] or [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] (''[[anguish]]'' is its [[Romance languages|Latinate]] [[cognate|equivalent]], and ''anxious,'' ''anxiety'' are of similar origin). The dictionary definition for angst is a feeling of anxiety, apprehension, or insecurity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angst |title=Angst |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |access-date=2018-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''angst'' was introduced into English from the [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word {{lang|da|angst}} and the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|Angst}}. It is attested since the 19th century in English translations of the works of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/angst |title=Angst |dictionary=Dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=angst&amp;searchmode=none |title=Angst |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in English to describe an intense feeling of apprehension, anxiety, or inner turmoil.

In other languages, having the meaning of the Latin word {{lang|la|pavor}} for &quot;fear&quot;, the derived words differ in meaning; for example, as in the French {{lang|fr|anxiété}} and {{lang|fr|peur}}. The word ''angst'' has existed since the 8th century, from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] ''{{PIE|*anghu-}}'', &quot;restraint&quot; from which [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|angust}} developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/angst |title=Angst |publisher=The Free Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is pre-cognate with the Latin {{lang|la|angustia}}, &quot;tensity, tightness&quot; and {{wikt-lang|la|angor}}, &quot;choking, clogging&quot;; compare to the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|ἄγχω}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|ánkhō}}) &quot;strangle&quot;.

== Existentialist angst ==
{{See also|Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Dread or anxiety}}
In [[Existentialism|Existentialist]] [[philosophy]], the term ''angst'' carries a specific conceptual meaning. The use of the term was first attributed to [[Denmark|Danish]] [[philosopher]] [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813&amp;ndash;1855). In ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' (also known as ''The Concept of Dread'', depending on the translation), Kierkegaard used the word ''Angest'' (in common Danish, ''angst'', meaning &quot;dread&quot; or &quot;anxiety&quot;) to describe a profound and deep-seated condition. Where non-human animals are guided solely by [[instinct]], said Kierkegaard, human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying.&lt;ref name=Collins /&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Marino|title=The Danish Doctor of Dread|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/the-danish-doctor-of-dread/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of one's life and one's power of choice over them.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Backhouse|first1=Stephen|title=Kierkegaard: A Single Life|date=2016|publisher=HarperCollins Christian Publishing|isbn=9780310520894|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=MLTxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|accessdate=17 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kierkegaard's concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist [[philosopher]]s who followed, such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways. While Kierkegaard's angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a [[religion|religious personal belief system]], later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles, cultural norms, and [[existential despair]].

== Music ==
Existential angst makes its appearance in classical [[musical composition]] in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war-torn times. Notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]] (operas ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'' and ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]''), [[Claude-Achille Debussy]] (opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelleas et Melisande]]'', ballet ''[[Jeux]]'', other works), [[Jean Sibelius]] (especially the Fourth Symphony), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] ''([[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'', other works), [[Alban Berg]], [[Francis Poulenc]] (opera ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]]''), [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (opera ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District]]'', symphonies and chamber music), [[Béla Bartók]] (opera ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', other works), and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] (especially ''[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]'').
 
Angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid- to late 1950s amid widespread concerns over [[Cold War|international tensions]] and [[nuclear proliferation]]. [[Jeff Nuttall]]'s book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) traced angst in popular culture to [[Hiroshima]]. Dread was expressed in works of [[folk rock]] such as [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Masters of War]]'' (1963) and ''[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]''. The term often makes an appearance in reference to [[punk rock]], [[grunge]], [[nu metal]], and works of [[emo]] where expressions of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[existential despair]], or [[nihilism]] predominate.
