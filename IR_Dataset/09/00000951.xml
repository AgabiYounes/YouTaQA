It consists of two major islands, [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]], and a number of smaller islands (including [[Great Bird Island, Antigua|Great Bird]], [[Green Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|Green]], [[Guiana Island|Guiana]], [[Long Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|Long]], [[Maiden Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|Maiden]] and [[York Island (Antigua and Barbuda)|York Islands]] and further south, the island of [[Redonda]]).

The [[Antigua|island of Antigua]] was explored by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 and named for the [[Santa María La Antigua|Church of Santa María La Antigua]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crocker, John 1968&quot;&gt;Crocker, John. &quot;Barbuda Eyes Statehood and Tourists&quot;.

Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and [[Elizabeth II]] is the country's queen and [[head of state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/countries/antigua-barbuda|title=Antigua and Barbuda - Countries - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, [[Hurricane Irma]] damaged or destroyed 95% of Barbuda's buildings and infrastructure and as a result, all the island's inhabitants were evacuated to Antigua, leaving Barbuda empty for the first time in modern history.&lt;ref name=USATodayIrma&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Panzar |first1=Javier |last2=Willsher |first2=Kim |date=14 September 2017 |title=For first time in 300 years, there’s not a single living person on the island of Barbuda |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/14/barbuda-hurricane-irama-devastation/665950001/ |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''{{lang|es|Antigua}}'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;ancient&quot; and ''{{lang|es|barbuda}}'' is Spanish for &quot;bearded&quot;.&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt; The island of Antigua was originally called ''{{lang|tnq|Wadadli}}'' by [[Arawak]]s and is locally known by that name today; [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] possibly called Barbuda ''{{lang|crb|Wa'omoni}}''. [[Christopher Columbus]], while sailing by in 1493 may have named it Santa Maria la Antigua, after an icon in the Spanish [[Seville Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt; The &quot;bearded&quot; of Barbuda is thought to refer either to the male inhabitants of the island, or the bearded fig trees present there.&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Antigua and Barbuda}}

===Pre-colonial period===
Antigua was first settled by archaic age hunter-gatherer [[Amerindian]]s called the [[Ciboney]].&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Antigua-and-Barbuda |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |title= Antigua and Barbuda |authors= David Lawrence Niddrie Janet D. Momsen Richard Tolson |accessdate= 8 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Commonwealth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/antigua-and-barbuda/history |publisher=The Commonwealth |title= Antigua and Barbuda : History|accessdate= 8 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon dating]] has established the earliest settlements started around 3100 BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} They were succeeded by the ceramic age pre-Columbian [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]]-speaking [[Saladoid]] people who migrated from the lower [[Orinoco River]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} They introduced agriculture, raising, among other crops, the famous Antigua black pineapple (''[[Ananas comosus]]''), [[maize|corn]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[chili pepper|chiles]], [[guava]], [[tobacco]], and [[cotton]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Later on the more bellicose [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] also settled the island, possibly by force.

===European arrival and settlement===
[[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight the islands in 1493.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt; The Spanish did not colonise Antigua because it lacked fresh water but not aggressive Caribs. However a combination of European and African diseases, malnutrition, and slavery eventually killed most of the Caribbean's native population; [[smallpox]] was probably the greatest killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Austin Alchon| first = Suzanne| title = A pest in the land: new world epidemics in a global perspective| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YiHHnV08ebkC&amp;pg=PA62| year = 2003| publisher = University of New Mexico Press| isbn = 0-8263-2871-7| pages = 62–63 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The English settled on Antigua in 1632;&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Christopher Codrington settled on Barbuda in 1685.&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Tobacco and then sugar was grown, worked by a large population of slaves from West Africa who soon came to vastly outnumber the European settlers.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

===Colonial era===
The English maintained control of the islands, repulsing an attempted French attack in 1666.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; The brutal conditions endured by the slaves led to revolts in 1701, 1729 and most notably in 1736, the latter led by [[Prince Klaas]], though it was discovered before it began and the ringleaders were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/antiguas-disputed-slave-conspiracy-of-1736-117569/ |title=Antigua’s Disputed Slave Conspiracy of 1736 |accessdate= 8 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery]] was abolished in the British Empire in 1834, affecting the economy.&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; This was exacerbated by natural disasters such as the 1843 earthquake and the 1847 hurricane.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Mining occurred on the isle of Redonda, however this ceased in 1929 and the islands has since remained uninhabited.&lt;ref name=&quot;kras-2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TnItHSAgevMC&amp;pg=PA18|title=The History of Redonda|page=18|work=Antigua and Barbuda|first=Sara Louise|last=Kras|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|year=2008|isbn=9780761425700|series=Cultures of the World|volume=26|quote=a cableway using baskets was built to transfer the mined phosphate to a pier for shipping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Leeward Islands colony, Antigua and Barbuda became part of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 to 1962.&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Antigua and Barbuda subsequently became an associated state of the United Kingdom with full internal autonomy on 27 February 1967.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; The 1970s were dominated by discussions as to the islands' future and the rivalry between [[Vere Bird]] of the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) (Premier from 1967 to 1971 and 1976 to 1981) and the [[Progressive Labour Movement]] (PLM) of [[George Walter]] (Premier 1971–1976). Eventually Antigua and Barbuda gained full independence on 1 November 1981; Vere Bird became Prime Minister of the new country.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; The country opted to remain within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], retaining Queen Elizabeth as [[Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda|head of state]], with the last [[List of colonial governors and administrators of Antigua#Governors of Antigua and Barbuda (1967–1981)|Governor]], [[Wilfred Jacobs|Sir Wilfred Jacobs]], as [[Governor-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor-General]].

===Independence era===
The first two decades of Antigua's independence were dominated politically by the Bird family and the ALP, with Vere Bird ruling from 1981-1994, followed by his son [[Lester Bird]] from 1994-2004.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Though providing a degree of political stability, and boosting tourism to the country, the Bird governments were frequently accused of corruption, cronyism and financial malfeasance.&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; [[Vere Bird Jr.]], the elder son, was forced to leave politics in 1990 following a [[Guns for Antigua|scandal]] in which he was accused of smuggling Israeli weapons to Colombian drug-traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bAsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HmUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1313,5601929&amp;dq=vere+bird+jr&amp;hl=en|title=Antiguan Quits in Weapons Scandal|date=26 April 1990|work=Sun-Journal|publisher=Sun Media Group|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antigua-Barbuda: Government Finally Orders Probe of Arms Shipment|date=25 April 1990|work=IPS-Inter Press Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Commonwealth /&gt; Another son, [[Ivor Bird]], was convicted of selling [[cocaine]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Younger Brother Of Prime Minister Lester Bird Is Arrested On Cocaine Charges|last=Massiah|first=David|date=7 May 1995|work=Associated Press Worldstream|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime Minister Lester Bird Promises No Intervention In Brother's Arrest|last=Massiah|first=David|date=8 May 1995|work=Associated Press Worldstream|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 [[Hurricane Luis]] caused severe damage on Barbuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anumetservice.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/20th-anniversary-of-hurricane-luis/|title=20th Anniversary of Hurricane Luis|date=5 September 2015|website=Anumetservice.wordpress.com|accessdate=30 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912011401/https://anumetservice.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/20th-anniversary-of-hurricane-luis/|archive-date=12 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALP's dominance of Antiguan politics ended with the [[2004 Antiguan general election]], which was won by [[Baldwin Spencer]]'s [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] (UPP).&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; However the UPP lost the [[2014 Antiguan general election]], with the ALP returning to power under [[Gaston Browne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bald&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Charles |first=Jacqueline |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/13/4175779/antigua-prime-minister-baldwin.html |title=Browne becomes new prime minister of Antigua, youngest ever  |work=The Miami Herald |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Barbuda was devastated in early September 2017 by [[Hurricane Irma]], which brought winds with speeds reaching 295&amp;nbsp;km/h (185&amp;nbsp;mph). The storm damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings and infrastructure, leaving Barbuda &quot;barely habitable&quot; according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne. Nearly everyone on the island was evacuated to Antigua.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Panzar |first1=Javier |last2=Willsher |first2=Kim |date=9 September 2017 |title=Hurricane Irma leaves Caribbean Islands Devastated |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-irma-islands-20170909-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antigua and Barbuda both are generally low-lying islands whose terrain has been influenced more by [[limestone]] formations than [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]]. The highest point on Antigua is [[Boggy Peak]], the remnant of a [[volcanic]] crater rising {{convert|402|m|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

The shorelines of both islands are greatly indented with beaches, lagoons, and natural harbours. The islands are rimmed by reefs and shoals. There are few streams as rainfall is slight. Both islands lack adequate amounts of fresh groundwater.&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt;

About {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south-west of Antigua lies the small, rocky island of [[Redonda]], which is uninhabited.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

An estimate published by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' indicated that over $100 million would be required to rebuild homes and infrastructure. Philmore Mullin, Director of Barbuda's National Office of Disaster Services, said that &quot;all critical infrastructure and utilities are non-existent – food supply, medicine, shelter, electricity, water, communications, waste management&quot;. He summarised the situation as follows: &quot;Public utilities need to be rebuilt in their entirety... It is optimistic to think anything can be rebuilt in six months ... In my 25 years in disaster management, I have never seen something like this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4935433/hurricane-irma-barbuda-antigua-survivors-caribbean/|title='There Is No Home to Go Back to.'

{{Main|Demographics of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[File:Antigua-Barbuda-demography.png|thumb|450px|Antigua &amp; Barbuda's population (1961–2010). Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]

===Ethnic groups===
Antigua has a population of {{UN_Population|Antigua and Barbuda}},{{UN_Population|ref}} mostly made up of people of [[West African]], [[United Kingdom|British]], and [[Portuguese people|Madeiran]] descent. The ethnic distribution consists of 91% Black &amp; Mulatto, 4.4% mixed race, 1.7% White, and 2.9% other (primarily [[South Asians|East Indian]] and other Asian). Most Whites are of Irish or British descent. Christian Levantine Arabs, and a small number of [[Asians]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] make up the remainder of the population.

An increasingly large percentage of the population lives abroad, most notably in the United Kingdom ([[Antiguan British|Antiguan Britons]]), United States and [[Canada]]. A minority of Antiguan residents are immigrants from other countries, particularly from Dominica, Guyana and [[Jamaica]], and, increasingly, from the Dominican Republic, [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] and [[Nigeria]]. An estimated 4,500 American citizens also make their home in Antigua and Barbuda, making their numbers one of the largest American populations in the English-speaking Eastern Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2336.htm |title=Background Note: Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
English is the official language. The [[Barbuda]]n accent is slightly different from the [[Antigua]]n.

In the years before Antigua and Barbuda's independence, Standard English was widely spoken in preference to Antiguan Creole. Generally, the upper and middle classes shun Antiguan Creole. The educational system dissuades the use of Antiguan Creole and instruction is done in Standard (British) English.

Many of the words used in the Antiguan dialect are derived from [[British English|British]] as well as African languages. This can be easily seen in phrases such as: &quot;Ent it?&quot; meaning &quot;Ain't it?&quot; which is itself dialectal and means &quot;Isn't it?&quot;. Common island [[proverb]]s can often be traced to Africa.

Spanish is spoken by around 10,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Bernadette, [http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html &quot;The Spanish Language in Antigua and Barbuda: Implications for Language Planning and Language Research&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715015910/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/BNCCde/antigua/conference/papers/farquhar.html |date=15 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political system===
{{Main|Politics of Antigua and Barbuda}}

[[File:St Johns Antigua 2012.jpg|thumb|St. John's on Antigua.]]
The politics of Antigua and Barbuda take place within a framework of a [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[monarchy]], in which the [[head of State]] is the [[monarch]] who appoints the [[List of Governors-General of Antigua and Barbuda|Governor General]] as vice-regal representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigua and Barbuda 1981|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Antigua_and_Barbuda_1981?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth II]] is the present [[Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]], having served in that position since the islands' independence from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1981. The Queen is currently represented by Governor General [[Rodney Williams (politician)|Sir Rodney Williams]]. A council of ministers is appointed by the governor general on the advice of the [[List of Prime Ministers of Antigua and Barbuda|prime minister]], currently [[Gaston Browne]] (2014–). The prime minister is the [[head of government]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the two Chambers of [[Parliament of Antigua and Barbuda|Parliament]]. The [[bicameral]] Parliament consists of the Senate (17 members appointed by members of the government and the [[Official Opposition|opposition]] party, and approved by the Governor-General), and the House of Representatives (17 members elected by [[first past the post]]) to serve five-year terms.

The current Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition is the United Progressive Party Member of Parliament (MP), the Honourable [[Baldwin Spencer]].

===Elections===
[[File:Antigua.St.John.from west.wmt.jpg|thumb|St. John's parish on Antigua.]]

The last elections held were on 12 June 2014, during which the [[Antigua Labour Party]] won 14 seats, and the [[United Progressive Party (Antigua and Barbuda)|United Progressive Party]] 3 seats.

Since 1949, elections have been won by the [[populism|populist]] Antigua Labour Party. However, in the [[Antigua and Barbuda general election, 2004|Antigua and Barbuda legislative election of 2004]] saw the defeat of the longest-serving elected government in the Caribbean. Prime Minister [[Lester Bird|Lester Bryant Bird]], who had succeeded his father Vere Cornwall Bird Sr., and Deputy Robin Yearwood had been in office since 1976.

The elder Bird was Prime Minister from 1981 to 1994 and Chief Minister of Antigua from 1960 to 1981, except for the 1971–1976 period when the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM) defeated his party. Vere Cornwall Bird, the nation's first Prime Minister, is credited with having brought Antigua and Barbuda and the Caribbean into a new era of independence.

====Party elections====
[[Gaston Browne]] defeated his predecessor [[Lester Bryant Bird]] at the Antigua Labour Party's biennial convention in November 2012 held to elect a political leader and other officers. The party then altered its name from the [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP) to the Antigua and Barbuda Labour Party (ABLP). This was done to officially include the party's presence on the sister island of Barbuda in its organisation, the only political party on the mainland to have a physical branch in Barbuda.

|style=&quot;width:400px;&quot;|
{{Map of Antigua and Barbuda}}

Note: Though Barbuda and Redonda are called dependencies they are integral parts of the state, making them essentially administrative divisions. Dependency is simply a title.

===Human rights===
[[LGBT rights in Antigua and Barbuda|Same-sex sexual activity]] is illegal in Antigua and Barbuda and punishable by prison time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State-Sponsored Homophobia|url=https://ilga.org/state-sponsored-homophobia-report |website=International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association|date=20 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Antigua and Barbuda}}
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Antigua and Barbuda.jpeg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Antigua and Barbuda's exports.]]
[[Tourism]] dominates the economy, accounting for more than half of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Antigua is famous for its many luxury resorts. Weak tourist activity since early 2000 has slowed the economy, however, and squeezed the government into a tight fiscal corner.&lt;ref name=Factbook /&gt;

Investment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy. Major world banks with offices in Antigua include the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank. Financial-services corporations with offices in Antigua include PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The [[US Securities and Exchange Commission]] has accused the Antigua-based [[Stanford International Bank]], owned by Texas billionaire [[Allen Stanford]], of orchestrating a huge fraud which may have bilked investors of some $8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21stanford.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fraud Case Shakes a Billionaire's Caribbean Realm |first1=Clifford |last1=Krauss |first2=Julie |last2=Creswell |first3=Charlie |last3=Savage |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twin-island nation's [[agriculture|agricultural]] production is focused on its domestic market and constrained by a limited [[water supply]] and a [[labor (economics)|labour]] shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and construction work.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

[[Manufacturing]] is made up of enclave-type assembly for export, the major products being bedding, handicrafts and electronic components. Prospects for [[economic growth]] in the medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialised world, especially in the [[United States]], from which about one-third of all tourists come.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Following the opening of the American University of Antigua College of Medicine by investor and attorney Neil Simon in 2003, a new source of revenue was established. The university employs many local Antiguans and the approximate 1000 students consume a large amount of the goods and services.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Antigua and Barbuda also utilises an [[economic citizenship]] program to spur investment into the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cip.gov.ag |title=Antigua and Barbuda Citizenship by Investment Program |author=Citizenship by Investment Unit |publisher=Antigua and Barbuda |access-date=2 November 2019 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
