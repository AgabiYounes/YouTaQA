&lt;!--About the spelling of 'aluminium': this article is written using the IUPAC spelling of &quot;aluminium&quot; and so &quot;ium&quot; should be used. The article follows [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)#Element names]] for conventions on chemical names, so &quot;sulfur&quot;, etc. should be maintained.--&gt;

'''Aluminium''' ('''aluminum''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]) is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]]&amp;nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;13. It is a silvery-white, soft, [[Magnetism|non-magnetic]] and [[ductility|ductile]] [[metal]] in the [[boron group]]. By mass, aluminium makes up about 8% of the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], where it is the third most abundant element (after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]) and also the most abundant metal. Occurrence of aluminium decreases in the Earth's mantle below, however. The chief [[ore]] of aluminium is [[bauxite]]. Aluminium metal is highly reactive, such that [[Native metal|native specimens]] are rare and limited to extreme [[Redox|reducing]] environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Aluminium is remarkable for its low [[density]] and its ability to resist [[corrosion]] through the phenomenon of [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. Aluminium and its [[aluminium alloy|alloys]] are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rQqnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Aluminium+and+its+alloys+are+vital+to+the+aerospace+industry#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20and%20its%20alloys%20are%20vital%20to%20the%20aerospace%20industry|title=RSM: A Key to Optimize Machining: Multi-Response Optimization of CNC Turning with Al-7020 Alloy|last=Singh|first=Bikram Jit|date=2014|publisher=Anchor Academic Publishing (aap_verlag)|isbn=978-3-95489-209-9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important in [[transport]]ation and building industries, such as building facades and window frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxfOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|title=Environmental Degradation of Advanced and Traditional Engineering Materials|last=Hihara|first=Lloyd H.|last2=Adler|first2=Ralph P.I.|last3=Latanision|first3=Ronald M.|date=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1927-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oxides]] and [[sulfates]] are the most useful compounds of aluminium.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Despite its prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] [[metabolically]], but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last1=Frank|first1=W.B.|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-VCH|chapter=Aluminum|doi=10.1002/14356007.a01_459.pub2|title-link=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|isbn=978-3-527-30673-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these salts' abundance, the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest, and studies continue.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Nuclei and isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of aluminium}}

Of aluminium isotopes, only {{SimpleNuclide|Aluminium}} is stable. This is consistent with aluminium having an odd atomic number.{{efn|No elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes; even-numbered elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element 50) having the highest number of isotopes of all elements, ten.&lt;ref name=IAEA/&gt; See [[Even and odd atomic nuclei]] for more details.}} It is the only aluminium [[Primordial nuclide|isotope that has existed on Earth in its current form since the creation of the planet]]. Very nearly all the element on Earth is present as this isotope, which makes aluminium a [[mononuclidic element]] and means that its [[standard atomic weight]] practically equates to that of the isotope. The standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals,{{efn|Most other metals have greater standard atomic weights: for instance, that of iron is 55.8; copper 63.5; lead 207.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIAAW2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- defined by Template:Infobox Aluminum --&gt;}} which has consequences for the element's properties (see [[#Bulk|below]]). This makes aluminium very useful in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), as its single stable isotope has a high NMR sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Greenwood242/&gt;

All other isotopes of aluminium are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. The most stable of these is [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] ([[half-life]]&amp;nbsp;720,000 years) and therefore could not have survived since the formation of the planet. However, minute traces of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al are produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic ray]] protons. The ratio of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al to &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;[[beryllium|Be]] has been used for [[Radiometric dating|radiodating]] of geological processes over 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; year time scales, in particular transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.onafarawayday.com/Radiogenic/Ch14/Ch14-6.htm|title=Radiogenic Isotope Geology|last1=Dickin|first1=A.P.|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53017-0|chapter=''In situ'' Cosmogenic Isotopes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206010805/http://www.onafarawayday.com/Radiogenic/Ch14/Ch14-6.htm|archivedate=6 December 2008|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all|access-date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al was responsible for the melting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of some [[asteroids]] after their formation 4.55&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thunderstones and Shooting Stars|last1=Dodd|first1=R.T.|date=1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-89137-1|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining isotopes of aluminium, with mass numbers ranging from 22 to 43, all have half-lives well under an hour. Three [[metastable]] states are known, all with half-lives under a minute.&lt;ref name=IAEA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html |title=Livechart – Table of Nuclides – Nuclear structure and decay data |author=IAEA – Nuclear Data Section |year=2017 |website=www-nds.iaea.org |publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] |access-date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron shell ===

An aluminium atom has 13 electrons, arranged in an [[electron configuration]] of &amp;#91;[[Neon|Ne]]&amp;#93;3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.2}} with three electrons beyond a stable noble gas configuration. Accordingly, the combined first three [[ionization energy|ionization energies]] of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone.{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.6}} Such an electron configuration is shared with the other well-characterized members of its group, [[boron]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]; it is also expected for [[nihonium]]. Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions (see [[#Chemistry|below]]). The [[electronegativity]] of aluminium is 1.61 (Pauling scale).{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.29}}
[[File:Aluminium Atomic lattice.png|alt=M. Tunes &amp; S. Pogatscher, Montanuniversität Leoben 2019 No copyrights =)|left|thumb|upright=1.2|High-resolution [[Scanning transmission electron microscopy|STEM]]-[[Annular dark-field imaging|HAADF]] micrograph of Al atoms viewed along the [001] zone axis.]]
A free aluminium atom has a [[atomic radius|radius]] of 143&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]].{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.30}} With the three outermost electrons removed, the [[ionic radius|radius]] shrinks to 39&amp;nbsp;pm for a 4-coordinated atom or 53.5&amp;nbsp;pm for a 6-coordinated atom.{{sfn|Dean|1999|p=4.30}} At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], aluminium atoms (when not affected by atoms of other elements) form a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic crystal system]] bound by [[metallic bonding]] provided by atoms' outermost electrons; hence aluminium (at these conditions) is a metal.&lt;ref name=Enghag2008/&gt; This crystal system is shared by many other metals, such as [[lead]] and [[copper]]; the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those other metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enghag2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Enghag|first=Per|title=Encyclopedia of the Elements: Technical Data – History – Processing – Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUmTX8yKU4gC|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-61234-5|pages=139, 819, 949}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is however not shared by the other members of its group; boron has ionization energies too high to allow metallization, thallium has a [[face-centered cubic]] structure, and gallium and indium have unusual structures that are not close-packed like those of aluminium and thallium. Since few electrons are available for [[metallic bonding]], aluminium metal is soft with a low melting point and low [[electrical resistivity]], as is common for [[post-transition metal]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 222–4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulk ===

Aluminium metal has an appearance ranging from silvery white to dull gray, depending on the [[surface roughness]]. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good [[Reflectance|reflector]] (approximately 92%) of [[visible light]] and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far [[infrared]] radiation.

The density of aluminium is 2.70&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 1/3 that of steel, much lower than other commonly encountered metals, making aluminium parts easily identifiable through their lightness.{{sfn|Lide|2004|p=4-3}} Aluminium's low density compared to most other metals arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter, while difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference. The only lighter metals are the metals of [[alkali metal|groups 1]] and [[alkaline earth metal|2]], which apart from [[beryllium]] and [[magnesium]] are too reactive for structural use (and beryllium is very toxic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nchem.1033|title=A brighter beryllium|date=2011|last1=Puchta|first1=Ralph|journal=Nature Chemistry|volume=3|issue=5|pages=416|pmid=21505503|bibcode=2011NatCh...3..416P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium is not as strong or stiff as steel, but the low density makes up for this in the [[aerospace]] industry and for many other applications where light weight and relatively high strength are crucial.

Pure aluminium is quite soft and lacking in strength. In most applications various [[aluminium alloys]] are used instead because of their higher strength and hardness. The [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of pure aluminium is 7–11 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], while [[aluminium alloy]]s have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polmear1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Polmear |first1=I.J. |date=1995 |title=Light Alloys: Metallurgy of the Light Metals |edition=3 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |isbn=978-0-340-63207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium is [[ductility|ductile]], and [[malleable]] allowing it to be easily [[drawing (metalworking)|drawn]] and [[extrusion|extruded]]. It is also easily [[machining|machined]], and the low melting temperature of 660&amp;nbsp;°C allows for easy [[casting (metalworking)|casting]].

Aluminium is an excellent [[Heat conduction|thermal]] and [[electrical conductor]], having 59% the conductivity of [[copper]], both thermal and electrical, while having only 30% of copper's density. Aluminium is capable of [[superconductor|superconductivity]], with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [[kelvin]] and a critical magnetic field of about 100 [[gauss (unit)|gauss]] (10 [[millitesla]]s).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[paramagnetic]] and thus essentially unaffected by static magnetic fields. The high electrical conductivity, however, means that it is strongly affected by changing magnetic field through the induction of [[eddy currents]].

{{main|Compounds of aluminium}}
Aluminium combines characteristics of pre- and post-transition metals. Since it has few available electrons for metallic bonding, like its heavier group 13 congeners, it has the characteristic physical properties of a post-transition metal, with longer-than-expected interatomic distances.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222/&gt; Furthermore, as Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is a small and highly charged cation, it is strongly polarizing and aluminium compounds tend towards covalency;&lt;ref name=Greenwood224&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 224–7&lt;/ref&gt; this behaviour is similar to that of [[beryllium]] (Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), an example of a [[diagonal relationship]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood112&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike all other post-transition metals, the underlying core under aluminium's valence shell is that of the preceding [[noble gas]], whereas for gallium and indium it is that of the preceding noble gas plus a filled d-subshell, and for thallium and nihonium it is that of the preceding noble gas plus filled d- and f-subshells. Hence, aluminium does not suffer the effects of incomplete shielding of valence electrons by inner electrons from the nucleus that its heavier congeners do. Aluminium's electropositive behavior, high affinity for oxygen, and highly negative [[standard electrode potential]] are all more similar to those of [[scandium]], [[yttrium]], [[lanthanum]], and [[actinium]], which have ds&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configurations of three valence electrons outside a noble gas core: aluminium is the most electropositive metal in its group.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222/&gt; Aluminium also bears minor similarities to the metalloid boron in the same group; AlX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds are valence [[isoelectronic]] to BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; compounds (they have the same valence electronic structure), and both behave as [[Lewis acid]]s and readily from [[adduct]]s.&lt;ref name=King241&gt;King, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the main motifs of boron chemistry is [[regular icosahedron|regular icosahedral]] structures, and aluminium forms an important part of many icosahedral [[quasicrystal]] alloys, including the Al–Zn–Mg class.&lt;ref name=King235&gt;King, pp. 235–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium reacts with most nonmetals upon heating, forming compounds such as [[aluminium nitride]] (AlN), [[aluminium sulfide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and the aluminium halides (AlX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It also forms a wide range of [[intermetallic compound]]s involving metals from every group on the periodic table. Aluminium has a high [[chemical affinity]] to oxygen, which renders it suitable for use as a [[reducing agent]] in the [[thermite]] reaction. A fine powder of aluminium metal reacts explosively on contact with [[liquid oxygen]]; under normal conditions, however, aluminium forms a thin oxide layer that protects the metal from further corrosion by oxygen, water, or dilute acid, a process termed [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CorrAl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&amp;pg=PA81|title=Corrosion of Aluminium|last=Vargel|first=Christian|date=2004|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044495-6|origyear=French edition published 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521212331/https://books.google.com/books?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&amp;pg=PA81|archivedate=21 May 2016|url-status = live|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layer is destroyed by contact with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] due to [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgamation]] or with salts of some electropositive metals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt; As such, the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion-resistant due to [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions with alloyed [[copper]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Polmear1995&quot;/&gt; and aluminium's corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood222/&gt; In addition, although the reaction of aluminium with water at temperatures below 280&amp;nbsp;°C is of interest for the production of hydrogen, commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer, which inhibits the reaction, and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf|title=Reaction of Aluminum with Water to Produce Hydrogen|date=1 January 2008|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914043825/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf|archivedate=14 September 2012|url-status = dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily because it is corroded by dissolved [[chlorides]], such as common [[sodium chloride]], household plumbing is never made from aluminium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beal1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Askwi3lXdlcC&amp;pg=PA90|title=Engine Coolant Testing : Fourth Volume|last=Beal|first=Roy E.|year=1999|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2610-7|page=90|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424071051/https://books.google.com/books?id=Askwi3lXdlcC&amp;pg=PA90|archivedate=24 April 2016|url-status = live|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its general resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [[silver (color)|silver-colored]] paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest [[reflectance]] of any metal in the 200–400&amp;nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet|UV]]) and the 3,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;nm (far [[infrared|IR]]) regions; in the 400–700&amp;nbsp;nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by [[tin]] and [[silver]] and in the 700–3000&amp;nbsp;nm (near IR) by silver, [[gold]], and [[copper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thin-film optical filters|last=Macleod|first1=H.A.|date=2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0688-1|pages=158159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In hot concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]], aluminium reacts with water with evolution of hydrogen, and in aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]] at room temperature to form [[aluminates]]—protective passivation under these conditions is negligible.&lt;ref name=Beal1999/&gt; The reaction with aqueous alkali is often written:&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;
:Al + NaOH + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → NaAlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|3|2}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
although the aluminium species in solution is probably instead the hydrated tetrahydroxoaluminate anion, [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;

Oxidizing acids do not effectively attack high-purity aluminium because an oxide layer forms and protects the metal; [[aqua regia]] will nevertheless dissolve aluminium. This allows aluminium to be used to store reagents such as [[nitric acid]], concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], and some organic acids.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

=== Inorganic compounds ===

The vast majority of compounds, including all aluminium-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The [[coordination number]] of such compounds varies, but generally Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is either six- or four-coordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless.&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;

[[File:AlHydrolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Aluminium hydrolysis as a function of pH. Coordinated water molecules are omitted. (Data from Baes and Mesmer)&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Baes |first1=C.F. |last2=Mesmer |first2=R.E. |title=The Hydrolysis of Cations |year=1986 |origyear=1976 |publisher=Robert E. Krieger |location=Malabar, FL |isbn=978-0-89874-892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In aqueous solution, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; exists as the hexaaqua cation [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which has an approximate [[pKa|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood242/&gt; Such solutions are acidic as this cation can act as a proton donor, progressively [[hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] to [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on. As pH increases these mononuclear species begin to aggregate together by the formation of hydroxide bridges,&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt; forming many oligomeric ions, such as the [[Keggin structure|Keggin ion]] [Al&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood242/&gt; The process ends with precipitation of [[aluminium hydroxide]], Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This is useful for [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|clarification]] of water, as the precipitate nucleates on [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] particles in the water, hence removing them. Increasing the pH even further leads to the hydroxide dissolving again as [[aluminate]], [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, is formed. Aluminium hydroxide forms both salts and aluminates and dissolves in acid and alkali, as well as on fusion with acidic and basic oxides:&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|→|fuse|&amp;nbsp;}} Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CaO {{overunderset|→|fuse|&amp;nbsp;}} Ca(AlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This behaviour of Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is termed [[amphoterism]], and is characteristic of weakly basic cations that form insoluble hydroxides and whose hydrated species can also donate their protons. Further examples include Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; indeed, gallium in the same group is slightly more acidic than aluminium. One effect of this is that aluminium salts with weak acids are hydrolysed in water to the aquated hydroxide and the corresponding nonmetal hydride: [[aluminium sulfide]] yields [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[aluminium nitride]] yields [[ammonia]], and [[aluminium carbide]] yields [[methane]]. [[Aluminium cyanide]], [[aluminium acetate|acetate]], and [[aluminium carbonate|carbonate]] exist in aqueous solution but are unstable as such; only incomplete hydrolysis takes place for salts with strong acids, such as the halides, [[aluminium nitrate|nitrate]], and [[aluminium sulfate|sulfate]]. For similar reasons, anhydrous aluminium salts cannot be made by heating their &quot;hydrates&quot;: hydrated aluminium chloride is in fact not AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O but [Al(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Al–O bonds are so strong that heating is not sufficient to break them and form Al–Cl bonds instead:&lt;ref name=Greenwood224/&gt;

All four [[Halide|trihalides]] are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [[aluminium fluoride]] (AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) features six-coordinate aluminium, which explains its involatility and insolubility as well as high [[heat of formation]]. Each aluminium atom is surrounded by six fluorine atoms in a distorted [[octahedron|octahedral]] arrangement, with each fluorine atom being shared between the corners of two octahedra in a structure related to but distorted from that of [[rhenium trioxide|ReO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Such {AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;} units also exist in complex fluorides such as [[cryolite]], Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, but should not be considered as [AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; complex anions as the Al–F bonds are not significantly different in type from the other M–F bonds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood233/&gt; Such differences in coordination between the fluorides and heavier halides are not unusual, occurring in Sn&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and Bi&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; as well for example; even bigger differences occur between [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood233/&gt; AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; melts at {{convert|1290|°C|0|abbr=on}} and is made by reaction of [[aluminium oxide]] with [[hydrogen fluoride]] gas at {{convert|700|°C|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Greenwood233/&gt;

With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimeric]] or [[polymer]]ic with tetrahedral four-coordinate aluminium centers. [[Aluminium trichloride]] (AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has a layered polymeric structure below its melting point of {{convert|192.4|°C|0|abbr=on}}, but transforms on melting to Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dimers with a concomitant increase in volume by 85% and a near-total loss of electrical conductivity. These still predominate in the gas phase at low temperatures (150–200&amp;nbsp;°C), but at higher temperatures increasingly dissociate into trigonal planar AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; monomers similar to the structure of [[boron trichloride|BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Aluminium tribromide]] and [[aluminium triiodide]] form Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; dimers in all three phases and hence do not show such significant changes of properties upon phase change.&lt;ref name=Greenwood233/&gt; These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen. The aluminium trihalides form many [[addition compound]]s or complexes; their [[Lewis acid]]ic nature makes them useful as catalysts for the [[Friedel–Crafts reaction]]s. Aluminium trichloride has major industrial uses involving this reaction, such as in the manufacture of [[anthraquinone]]s and [[styrene]]; it is also often used as the precursor for many other aluminium compounds and as a reagent for converting nonmetal fluorides into the corresponding chlorides (a [[Transhalogenation|transhalogenation reaction]]).&lt;ref name=Greenwood233/&gt;

Aluminium forms one stable oxide with the [[chemical formula]] Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, commonly called [[alumina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MYAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20forms%20one%20stable%20oxide,%20known%20by%20its%20mineral%20name%20corundum|title=Pigment Compendium|last=Eastaugh|first=Nicholas|last2=Walsh|first2=Valentine|last3=Chaplin|first3=Tracey|last4=Siddall|first4=Ruth|date=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-37393-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in nature in the mineral [[corundum]], α-alumina;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X2NZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA718&amp;dq=Aluminium+forms+one+stable+oxide,+known+by+its+mineral+name+corundum#v=onepage&amp;q=Aluminium%20forms%20one%20stable%20oxide,%20known%20by%20its%20mineral%20name%20corundum|title=A treatise on chemistry|last=Roscoe|first=Henry Enfield|last2=Schorlemmer|first2=Carl|date=1913|publisher=Macmillan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is also a γ-alumina phase.&lt;ref name=Greenwood242/&gt; As corundum is very hard ([[Mohs hardness]] 9), has a high melting point of {{convert|2045|°C|0|abbr=on}}, has very low volatility, is chemically inert, and a good electrical insulator, it is often used in abrasives (such as toothpaste), as a refractory material, and in cermanics, as well as being the starting material for the electrolytic production of aluminium metal. [[Sapphire]] and [[ruby]] are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood242&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 242–52&lt;/ref&gt; The two main oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [[boehmite]] and [[diaspore]]. There are three main trihydroxides: [[bayerite]], [[gibbsite]], and [[nordstrandite]], which differ in their crystalline structure ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). Many other intermediate and related structures are also known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood242/&gt; Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful. Some mixed oxide phases are also very useful, such as [[spinel]] (MgAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), Na-β-alumina (NaAl&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[tricalcium aluminate]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, an important mineral phase in [[Portland cement]]).&lt;ref name=Greenwood242/&gt;

The only stable [[chalcogenide]]s under normal conditions are [[aluminium sulfide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[aluminium selenide|selenide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[aluminium telluride|telluride]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). All three are prepared by direct reaction of their elements at about {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}} and quickly hydrolyse completely in water to yield aluminium hydroxide and the respective [[hydrogen chalcogenide]]. As aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens, these have four-coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to [[wurtzite]], with two-thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly (α) or random (β) fashion; the sulfide also has a γ form related to γ-alumina, and an unusual high-temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium atoms have tetrahedral four-coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five-coordination.&lt;ref name=Greenwood252&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 252–7&lt;/ref&gt; Four [[pnictide]]s, [[aluminium nitride]] (AlN), [[aluminium phosphide]] (AlP), [[aluminium arsenide]] (AlAs), and [[aluminium antimonide]] (AlSb), are known. They are all [[III-V semiconductor]]s isoelectronic to [[silicon]] and [[germanium]], all of which but AlN have the [[zinc blende]] structure. All four can be made by high-temperature (and possibly high-pressure) direct reaction of their component elements.&lt;ref name=Greenwood252/&gt;
&lt;!--
[[Aluminium carbide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The [[metal acetylide|acetylide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.

[[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides, it features tetrahedral Al centers. It can be made from the elements at {{convert|800|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is air-stable material with a usefully high [[thermal conductivity]]. [[Aluminium phosphide]] (AlP) is made similarly; it hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]]:

: AlP + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;--&gt;
==== Rarer oxidation states ====
Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and are sometimes of significance as precursors to the Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species.

===== Aluminium(I) =====
{{main|Aluminium(I)}}
AlF, AlCl, AlBr, and {{math|AlI}} exist in the gaseous phase when the respective trihalide is heated with aluminium, and at cryogenic temperatures. Their instability in the condensed phase is due to their ready [[disproportionation]] to aluminium and the respective trihalide: the reverse reaction is favored at high temperature (although even then they are still short-lived), explaining why AlF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is more volatile when heated in the presence of aluminium metal, as is aluminium metal when heated in the presence of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood233&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 233–7&lt;/ref&gt;

A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic [[adduct]] formed with [[triethylamine]], {{math|Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(NEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with silicon at {{convert|1800|°C|0|abbr=on}} in a [[vacuum]].

They catch fire spontaneously in air and react with water, thus necessitating precautions when handling them. They often form dimers, unlike their boron analogues, but this tendency diminishes for branched-chain alkyls (e.g. [[isopropyl|Pr&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[isobutyl|Bu&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;]], Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); for example, [[triisobutylaluminium]] exists as an equilibrium mixture of the monomer and dimer.&lt;ref name=Greenwood257&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 257–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin B.

They are [[HSAB theory|hard acid]]s and react readily with ligands, forming adducts. In industry, they are mostly used in alkene insertion reactions, as discovered by [[Karl Ziegler]], most importantly in &quot;growth reactions&quot; that form long-chain unbranched primary alkenes and alcohols, and in the low-pressure polymerization of [[ethene]] and [[propene]]. There are also some [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] and cluster organoaluminium compounds involving Al–N bonds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood257/&gt;

The industrially most important aluminium hydride is [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which is used in as a reducing agent in [[organic chemistry]]. It can be produced from [[lithium hydride]] and [[Aluminium chloride|aluminium trichloride]]:&lt;ref name=Greenwood227&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 227–32&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest hydride, [[aluminium hydride]] or alane, is not as important. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula (BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Greenwood227/&gt;

Bauxite occurs as a [[weathering]] product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Geology of Ore Deposits|last1=Guilbert|first1=J.F.|last2=Park|first2=C.F.|date=1986|publisher=W.H.

The history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of [[alum]]. The first written record of alum, made by [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], dates back to the 5th century BCE.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=12}} The ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing [[mordant]] and for city defense.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=12}} After the [[Crusades]], alum, an indispensable good in the European fabric industry,&lt;ref name=&quot;ClaphamPower1941&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clapham|first1=John Harold|last2=Power|first2=Eileen Edna|title=The Cambridge Economic History of Europe: From the Decline of the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA682|year=1941|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-08710-0|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a subject of international commerce;{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=16}} it was imported to Europe from the eastern Mediterranean until the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The papacy and the Levant: 1204-1571. 1 The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries|last=Setton|first=Kenneth M.|date=1976|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-127-9|oclc=165383496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of alum remained unknown. Around 1530, Swiss physician [[Paracelsus]] suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=25}} In 1595, German doctor and chemist [[Andreas Libavius]] experimentally confirmed this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Mary Elvira|title=Discovery of the elements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6kPAQAAMAAJ|year=1968|volume=1|edition=7|publisher=Journal of chemical education|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1722, German chemist [[Friedrich Hoffmann]] announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}} In 1754, German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding [[potash]].{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=2}}

Attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to 1760.{{sfn|Richards|1896|p=3}} The first successful attempt, however, was completed in 1824 by Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. He reacted anhydrous [[aluminium chloride]] with potassium [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Örsted|first1=H.

As Wöhler's method could not yield great quantities of aluminium, the metal remained rare; its cost exceeded that of gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venetski&quot; /&gt; The first industrial production of aluminium was established in 1856 by French chemist [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] and companions.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=39}} Deville had discovered that aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium, which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium, which Wöhler had used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sainte-Claire Deville |first=H.E. |date=1859 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCoKAAAAIAAJ |title=De l'aluminium, ses propriétés, sa fabrication |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430001812/https://books.google.com/books?id=rCoKAAAAIAAJ |archivedate=30 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even then, aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=46}}

The first industrial large-scale production method was independently developed in 1886 by French engineer [[Paul Héroult]] and American engineer [[Charles Martin Hall]]; it is now known as the [[Hall–Héroult process]].{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=55–61}} The Hall–Héroult process converts alumina into the metal. Austrian chemist [[Carl Josef Bayer|Carl Joseph Bayer]] discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina, now known as the [[Bayer process]], in 1889.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=74}} Modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the Bayer and Hall–Héroult processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;aluminiumleader&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aluminiumleader.com/history/industry_history/|title=Aluminium history|last=|first=|date=|website=All about aluminium|access-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry, everyday items, eyeglass frames, optical instruments, tableware, and [[Aluminium foil|foil]] in the 1890s and early 20th century. Aluminium's ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses at the time.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=64–69}} During [[World War I]], major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingulstad |first=Mats |year=2012 |chapter='We Want Aluminum, No Excuses': Business-Government Relations in the American Aluminum Industry, 1917–1957 |pp=33–68 |title=From Warfare to Welfare: Business-Government Relations in the Aluminium Industry |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/From_Warfare_to_Welfare.html?id=TFS6NAEACAAJ |editor-first1=Mats |editor-last1=Ingulstad |editor-first2=Hans Otto |editor-last2=Frøland |publisher=Tapir Academic Press |isbn=978-82-321-0049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=69–70}} During the mid-20th century, aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material, with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work,{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|pp=165–166}} and increasingly being used in military engineering, for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=85}} [[Sputnik 1|Earth's first artificial satellite]], launched in 1957, consisted of two separate aluminium semi-spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have used aluminium to some extent.&lt;ref name=&quot;aluminiumleader&quot;/&gt; The [[aluminium can]] was invented in 1956 and employed as a storage for drinks in 1958.{{sfn|Drozdov|2007|p=135}}

[[File:Aluminium - world production trend.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|lang=en|World production of aluminium since 1900]]

Throughout the 20th century, the production of aluminium rose rapidly: while the world production of aluminium in 1900 was 6,800 metric tons, the annual production first exceeded 100,000 metric tons in 1916; 1,000,000 tons in 1941; 10,000,000 tons in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/historical-statistics/|title=Historical Statistics for Mineral Commodities in the United States|chapter=Aluminum|year=2017|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|language=en|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity; it entered the [[London Metal Exchange]], the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world, in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;aluminiumleader&quot;/&gt; The output continued to grow: the annual production of aluminium exceeded 50,000,000 metric tons in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;/&gt;

The [[real price]] for aluminium declined from $14,000 per metric ton in 1900 to $2,340 in 1948 (in 1998 United States dollars).&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;/&gt; Extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies. However, the need to exploit lower-grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs (above all, energy) increased the net cost of aluminium;{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=9}} the real price began to grow in the 1970s with the rise of energy cost.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|pp=9–10}} Production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=10}} Production costs in the late 20th century changed because of advances in technology, lower energy prices, exchange rates of the United States dollar, and alumina prices.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|pp=14–15}} The [[BRIC]] countries' combined share in primary production and primary consumption grew substantially in the first decade of the 21st century.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=17}} China is accumulating an especially large share of world's production thanks to abundance of resources, cheap energy, and governmental stimuli;{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=20}} it also increased its consumption share from 2% in 1972 to 40% in 2010.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=22}} In the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, most aluminium was consumed in transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging.{{sfn|Nappi|2013|p=23}}

== Etymology ==

Aluminium is named after alumina, or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature. The word &quot;alumina&quot; comes from &quot;alum&quot;, the mineral from which it was collected. The word &quot;alum&quot; comes from ''alumen'', a [[Latin language|Latin]] word meaning &quot;bitter salt&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=alum|title=Alum|website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|last=Harper |first=Douglas|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alumen'' stems from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*alu-'' meaning &quot;bitter&quot; or &quot;beer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pokorny |first=Julius |authorlink=Julius Pokorny |title=Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch |trans-title=Indo-European etymological dictionary |language=de |url=https://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/whnjs.htm |date=1959 |publisher=A.

British chemist [[Humphry Davy]], who performed a number of experiments aimed to isolate the metal, is credited as the person who named the element. In 1808, he suggested the metal be named ''alumium''.&lt;ref name=Davy1808&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Davy|first1=Humphry|date=1808|title=Electro Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the Earths; with Observations on the Metals obtained from the alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam procured from Ammonia|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kg9GAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA353|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=98|page=353|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023|accessdate=10 December 2009|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from France, Germany, and Sweden, who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide, alumina, from which it would be isolated.{{sfn|Richards|1896|pp=3–4}} In 1812, Davy chose ''aluminum'', thus producing the modern name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy1812&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjMwAAAAYAAJ|title=Elements of Chemical Philosophy: Part 1|last=Davy|first=Humphry|publisher=Bradford and Inskeep|year=1812|volume=1|page=201|chapter=Of metals; their primary compositions with other uncompounded bodies, and with each other|authorlink=Humphry Davy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its spelling and pronunciation varies: ''aluminum'' is in use in the United States and Canada while ''aluminium'' is in use elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powell2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Mike |title=Amglish: Two Nations Divided by a Common Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5hXDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT138|year=2015|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=978-1-4835-5100-5|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling ===

The ''{{nobreak|-ium}}'' suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, element names ending in ''{{nobreak|-um}}'' were known at the time; for example, [[platinum]] (known to Europeans since the 16th century), [[molybdenum]] (discovered in 1778), and [[tantalum]] (discovered in 1802). The ''{{nobreak|-um}}'' suffix is consistent with the universal spelling [[alumina]] for the [[oxide]] (as opposed to aluminia); compare to [[lanthana]], the oxide of [[lanthanum]], and [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[ceria]], and [[thoria]], the oxides of [[magnesium]], [[cerium]], and [[thorium]], respectively.

=== Bayer process ===
{{Main|Bayer process}}

Bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide by the Bayer process. Bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground. The resulting [[slurry]] is mixed with a hot solution of [[sodium hydroxide]]; the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric, dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into a relatively insoluble compounds:&lt;ref name=&quot;UllmannOxide&quot;/&gt;

{{block indent|Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}}

After this reaction, the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point. It is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced. The bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded. The solution, free of solids, is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide; this causes decomposition of the [Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions to aluminium hydroxide. After about half of aluminium has precipitated, the mixture is sent to classifiers. Small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents; coarse particles are converted to aluminium oxide by heating; excess solution is removed by evaporation, (if needed) purified, and recycled.&lt;ref name=&quot;UllmannOxide&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last1=Hudson|first1=L.

=== Hall–Héroult process ===
{{Main|Hall–Héroult process|Aluminium smelting}}
The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a molten ({{convert|950|and|980|C|F}}) mixture of [[cryolite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) with [[calcium fluoride]] is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]] to produce metallic aluminium. The liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off, and usually cast into large blocks called [[Bar stock|aluminium billets]] for further processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Tovarna glinice in aluminija Kidričevo - kupi aluminija 1968.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|[[Extrusion]] billets of aluminium]]

Anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon—the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion—and either bake at the process or are prebaked. The former, also called Söderberg anodes, are less power-efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect, which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power, energy, and labor to prebake the cathodes. Carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash. Despite carbon's resistivity against corrosion, it is still consumed at a rate of 0.4–0.5&amp;nbsp;kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. Cathodes are made of [[anthracite]]; high purity for them is not required because impurities [[Leaching (chemistry)|leach]] only very slowly. Cathode is consumed at a rate of 0.02–0.04&amp;nbsp;kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. A cell is usually a terminated after 2–6 years following a failure of the cathode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;

The Hall–Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the [[Hoopes process]]. This process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium, and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpgTrFloOq0C&amp;pg=PA40|title=Handbook of Aluminum|last1=Totten|first1=G.E.|last2=Mackenzie|first2=D.S.|date=2003|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]]|isbn=978-0-8247-4843-2|page=40|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615132126/https://books.google.com/books?id=KpgTrFloOq0C&amp;pg=PA40|archivedate=15 June 2016|url-status = live|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric power represents about 20 to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emsley2011&quot; /&gt; Because of this, alternatives to the Hall–Héroult process have been researched, but none has turned out to be economically feasible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot; /&gt;

White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be [[Aluminium dross recycling|extracted industrially]].

* Transportation ([[automobile]]s, aircraft, [[truck]]s, [[railway car]]s, marine vessels, [[bicycle]]s, spacecraft, etc.). Aluminium is used because of its low density;
* Packaging ([[aluminium can|cans]], foil, frame etc.). Aluminium is used because it is non-toxic {{cite needed|date=December 2019}}, non-[[Adsorption|adsorptive]], and [[splinter]]-proof;
* Building and construction ([[window]]s, [[door]]s, [[siding]], building wire, sheathing, roofing, etc.). Since steel is cheaper, aluminium is used when lightness, corrosion resistance, or engineering features are important;
* Electricity-related uses (conductor alloys, motors and generators, transformers, capacitors, etc.). Aluminium is used because it is relatively cheap, highly conductive, has adequate mechanical strength and low density, and resists corrosion;
* A wide range of [[household]] items, from [[cooking utensil]]s to [[furniture]]. Low density, good appearance, ease of fabrication, and durability are the key factors of aluminium usage;

Aluminium is classified as a non-carcinogen by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dolara|first=Piero|date=21 July 2014|title=Occurrence, exposure, effects, recommended intake and possible dietary use of selected trace compounds (aluminium, bismuth, cobalt, gold, lithium, nickel, silver)|journal=International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition|volume=65|issue=8|pages=911–924|doi=10.3109/09637486.2014.937801|issn=1465-3478|pmid=25045935}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult,&lt;ref name=&quot;gitelman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRnOytsi8boC&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Physiology of Aluminum in Man |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519101650/https://books.google.com/books?id=wRnOytsi8boC&amp;pg=PA90|archivedate=19 May 2016 |work=Aluminum and Health |publisher=CRC Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8247-8026-4 |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence of no toxicity if it is consumed in amounts not greater than 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day per kg of [[body weight|body mass]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt; Most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces; most of the small part of it that enters the bloodstream, will be excreted via urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1076&amp;tid=34|title=ATSDR – Public Health Statement: Aluminum|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects ===

Aluminium, although rarely, can cause vitamin D-resistant [[osteomalacia]], [[erythropoietin]]-resistant [[microcytic anemia]], and central nervous system alterations. People with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt; Chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates (for excess gastric acidity control) may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals, such as [[iron]] or [[zinc]]; sufficiently high doses (&gt;50 g/day) can cause anemia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Al transport across human cells.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|There are five major aluminium forms absorbed by human body: the free solvated trivalent cation (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); low-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (LMW-Al&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); high-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble complexes (HMW-Al&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); low-molecular-weight, charged, soluble complexes (LMW-Al(L)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;); nano and micro-particulates (Al(L)&lt;sub&gt;n(s)&lt;/sub&gt;). They are transported across cell membranes or cell epi-/[[endothelia]] through five major routes: (1) [[paracellular]]; (2) [[transcellular]]; (3) [[active transport]]; (4) channels; (5) adsorptive or receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;health1&quot; /&gt;]]

During the 1988 [[Camelford water pollution incident]] people in [[Camelford]] had their drinking water contaminated with [[aluminium sulfate]] for several weeks. A final report into the incident in 2013 concluded it was unlikely that this had caused long-term health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lowermoor Water Pollution incident 'unlikely' to have caused long term health effects |publisher=Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment |date=18 April 2013 |url=https://cot.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/cot/cotpnlwpirv2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium has been suspected of being a possible cause of [[Alzheimer's disease]], but research into this for over 40 years has found, {{asof|2018|lc=yes}}, no good evidence of causal effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=24 August 2018 |title=Aluminum and dementia: Is there a link? |publisher=Alzheimer Society Canada |url=https://alzheimer.ca/en/Home/About-dementia/Alzheimer-s-disease/Risk-factors/Aluminum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aluminium increases [[estrogen]]-related [[gene expression]] in human [[breast cancer]] cells cultured in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jat.1135 |title=Metalloestrogens: an emerging class of inorganic xenoestrogens with potential to add to the oestrogenic burden of the human breast |date=2006 |last1=Darbre |first1=P.D. |journal=Journal of Applied Toxicology |volume=26 |pages=191–197 |pmid=16489580 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In very high doses, aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood–brain barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Banks, W.A. |date = 1989 |title = Aluminum-induced neurotoxicity: alterations in membrane function at the blood–brain barrier |journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume = 13 |issue = 1 |pages = 47–53 |doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(89)80051-X |pmid = 2671833 |last2 = Kastin |first2 = A.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of people&lt;ref name=&quot;BinghamCohrssen2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mk3lFVtBSQC&amp;pg=PA244|title=Patty's Toxicology, 6 Volume Set|last1=Bingham|first1=Eula|last2=Cohrssen|first2=Barbara|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-41081-3|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; have contact [[allergy|allergies]] to aluminium and experience itchy red rashes, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, poor memory, insomnia, depression, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allergy-symptoms.org/aluminum-allergy/|title=Aluminum Allergy Symptoms and Diagnosis |date=2016-09-20|work=Allergy-symptoms.org|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposure routes ===

Food is the main source of aluminium. Drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food;&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt; however, aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yokel2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yokel R.A.|author2=Hicks C.L.|author3=Florence R.L.|date=2008|title=Aluminum bioavailability from basic sodium aluminum phosphate, an approved food additive emulsifying agent, incorporated in cheese|journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]]|volume=46|issue=6|pages=2261–2266|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2008.03.004|pmc=2449821|pmid=18436363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food (due to its use in food additives, food and beverage packaging, and cooking utensils), drinking water (due to its use in municipal water treatment), and aluminium-containing medications (particularly antacid/antiulcer and buffered aspirin formulations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|author=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|url=http://abcmt.org/tp22.pdf|title=Toxicological profile for aluminum|last=|first=|date=1999|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary exposure in Europeans averages to 0.2–1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/week but can be as high as 2.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt; Higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to miners, aluminium production workers, and [[dialysis]] patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://enviroliteracy.org/special-features/its-element-ary/aluminum/|title=Aluminum |work=The Environmental Literacy Council|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of [[antacid]]s, [[antiperspirants]], [[vaccine]]s, and cosmetics provide possible routes of exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChenThyssen2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKlVDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA333|title=Metal Allergy: From Dermatitis to Implant and Device Failure|last1=Chen|first1=Jennifer K.|last2=Thyssen|first2=Jacob P.|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=978-3-319-58503-1|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Slanina, P.|last2=French|first2=W.|last3=Ekström|first3=L.G.|last4=Lööf|first4=L.|last5=Slorach|first5=S.|last6=Cedergren|first6=A.|date=1986|title=Dietary citric acid enhances absorption of aluminum in antacids|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=32|issue=3|pages=539–541|pmid=3948402|doi=10.1093/clinchem/32.3.539}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[maltol]] has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Ginkel|first1=M.F.|last2=Van Der Voet|first2=G.B.|last3=D'haese|first3=P.C.|last4=De Broe|first4=M.E.|last5=De Wolff|first5=F.A.|date=1993|title=Effect of citric acid and maltol on the accumulation of aluminum in rat brain and bone|journal=The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine|volume=121|issue=3|pages=453–460|pmid=8445293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===

In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium, the only treatment is [[deferoxamine mesylate]] which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by [[chelation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arltma.com/Articles/AlumToxDoc.htm|title=ARL: Aluminum Toxicity|website=www.arltma.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=164929 Aluminum Toxicity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203055539/http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=164929|date=3 February 2014}} from [[NYU Langone Medical Center]]. Last reviewed November 2012 by Igor Puzanov, MD&lt;/ref&gt; However, this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels, but also those of other metals such as copper or iron.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; 

==Environmental effects==
[[File:Luftaufnahmen Nordseekueste 2012-05-by-RaBoe-478.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|&quot;[[Bauxite tailings]]&quot; storage facility in [[Stade]], Germany. The aluminium industry generates about 70 million tons of this waste annually.]]High levels of aluminium occur near mining sites; small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal-fired power plants or [[Incineration|incinerators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=1076&amp;tid=34|title=ATSDR – Public Health Statement: Aluminum|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Acidic [[precipitation]] is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt; and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium;&lt;ref name=&quot;RosselandEldhuset1990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosseland|first1=B.O.|last2=Eldhuset|first2=T.D.|last3=Staurnes|first3=M.|year=1990|title=Environmental effects of aluminium|journal=Environmental Geochemistry and Health|volume=12|issue=1–2|pages=17–27|doi=10.1007/BF01734045|pmid=24202562|issn=0269-4042}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piero3&quot;/&gt;

In water, aluminium acts as a toxiс agent on [[gill]]-breathing animals such as [[fish]] by causing loss of [[Blood plasma|plasma]]- and [[hemolymph]] ions leading to [[Osmoregulation|osmoregulatory]] failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;RosselandEldhuset1990&quot; /&gt; Organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with metabolism in mammals and birds, even though this rarely happens in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;RosselandEldhuset1990&quot; /&gt;

Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils. Although it is generally harmless to plant growth in pH-neutral soils, in acid soils the concentration of toxic Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; [[cation]]s increases and disturbs root growth and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process. The major challenge is the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; These gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing. The most potent of these gases are [[Fluorocarbon|perfluorocarbons]] from the smelting process.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Released [[sulfur dioxide]] is one of the primary precursors of [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;
