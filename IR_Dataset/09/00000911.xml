[[File:Aegeansea.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Aegean Sea]] with its large number of islands is the origin of the term ''archipelago''.]]

An '''archipelago''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-archipelago.ogg|ˌ|ɑːr|k|ɪ|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|ə|ɡ|oʊ}} {{respell|ARK|ih|PEL|ə|goh}}), sometimes called an '''island group''' or '''island chain''', is a chain, cluster or collection of [[island]]s, or sometimes a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.

[[Indonesia]], [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Maldives]], the [[Balearic Isles]], [[the Bahamas]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Hawaii]], the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Azores]], [[Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] and the [[Archipelago Sea]] (Finland) are all examples of well-known archipelagos.

==Etymology==
The word ''archipelago'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἄρχι- (''arkhi-'', &quot;chief&quot;) and πέλαγος (''pélagos'', &quot;sea&quot;) through the Italian ''arcipelago''. In [[Italian language|Italian]], possibly following a tradition of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], &quot;Archipelago&quot; (from [[medieval Greek]] [[Linguistic reconstruction|*]]ἀρχιπέλαγος and [[medieval Latin|Latin]] ''archipelagus'') was the proper name for the [[Aegean Sea]]. Later, usage shifted to refer to the [[Aegean Islands]] (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands).

==Geographic types==
Archipelagos may be found isolated in large amounts of water or neighbouring a large land mass. For example, [[Scotland]] has more than 700&amp;nbsp;islands surrounding its mainland which form an archipelago

Archipelagos are often volcanic, forming along island arcs generated by subduction zones or hotspots, but may also be the result of [[erosion]], [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]], and [[land elevation]]. Depending on their geological origin, islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as ''oceanic islands'', ''continental fragments'', and ''continental islands''.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker R. J. &amp; Fernández-Palacios J. M. (2007) ''Island Biogeography: Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation''. New York, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanic islands===
Oceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin, and widely separated from any adjacent continent. The [[Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Easter Island]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Île Amsterdam]] in the south [[Indian Ocean]] are examples.

===Continental fragments===
Continental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from a continental mass due to [[tectonic]] displacement. The [[Farallon Islands]] off the coast of [[California]] are an example.

===Continental archipelagos===
Sets of islands formed close to the coast of a continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf, when those islands are above-water extensions of the shelf. The islands of the [[Inside Passage|Inland passage]] off the coast of [[British Columbia]] and the [[Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] are examples.

==Further examples==
The largest archipelagic state in the world by area, and by population, is [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indonesia |work=The World Factbook |date=4 December 2008 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html |access-date=7 December 2008 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] of the [[United States]] |location=[[Washington, DC]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210041527/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html |archive-date=10 December 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
