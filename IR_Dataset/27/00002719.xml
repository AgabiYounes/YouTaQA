'''Abettor''' (from ''to abet,'' [[Old French]] ''abeter'', ''à'' and ''beter'', to bait, urge dogs upon any one; this word is probably of Scandinavian origin, meaning to cause to bite), is a legal term implying one who instigates, encourages or assists another to commit an offence.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abettor|volume=1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An abettor differs from an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] in that he must be present at the commission of the crime; in addition they are equally guilty as they knowingly and voluntarily assist in the commission of that crime.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=abettor |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/30 30] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All abettors (with certain exceptions) are principals, and, in the absence of specific statutory provision to the contrary, are punishable to the same extent as the actual perpetrator of the offence.  A person may in certain cases be convicted as an abettor in the commission of an offence in which he or she could not be a principal, e.g. a woman or boy under fourteen years of age in aiding rape, or a solvent person in aiding and abetting a bankrupt to commit offences against the bankruptcy laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

More recently, an abettor is generally known as an [[accomplice]].
