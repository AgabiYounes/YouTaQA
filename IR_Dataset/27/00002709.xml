Aberdeen is the principal city of the Aberdeen Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Brown and [[Edmunds County, South Dakota|Edmunds]] counties and has a population of 40,602 in 2010. Aberdeen is considered a college town, being the home of both [[Northern State University]] and [[Presentation College, South Dakota|Presentation College]].

==History==

===Settlement===
Before Aberdeen or Brown County was inhabited by European settlers, it was inhabited by the [[Lakota people|Sioux Indians]] from approximately 1700 to 1879. Europeans entered the region for business, founding [[fur trading]] posts during the 1820s; these trading posts operated until the mid-1830s. The first &quot;settlers&quot; of this region were the [[Arikara|Arikara Indians]], but they would later be joined by others.

The first group of Euro-American settlers to reach the area that is now Brown County was a party of four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and, eventually, more settlers migrated toward this general area, currently known as [[Columbia, South Dakota]]. This town was established on June 15, 1879. The town was settled in 1880,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Aberdeen |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/28 28] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporated in 1882.

===Creation of the town===
[[File:Aberdeen 1883.jpg|thumb|right|1883 illustration of Aberdeen]]
Aberdeen, like many towns of the Midwest, was built around the newly developing railroad systems. Aberdeen was first officially plotted as a town site on January 3, 1881, by Charles Prior, the superintendent of the Minneapolis office of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad]], or the Milwaukee Road for short, which was presided over by [[Alexander Mitchell (Wisconsin politician)|Alexander Mitchell]]. Mitchell, Charles Prior's boss, was responsible for the choice of town names, was born in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, after which the town of Aberdeen, South Dakota, was named.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Aberdeen was officially founded on July 6, 1881, the date of the first arrival of a Milwaukee Railroad train. Aberdeen then operated under a city charter granted by the Territorial Legislature in March 1883.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

As Aberdeen grew, many businesses and buildings were constructed along Aberdeen's Main Street. However, this soon became a problem due to Aberdeen's periodic flooding, which led to it being referred to as &quot;The Town in the Frog Pond&quot;. At first, this unique condition presented no problem to the newly constructed buildings because it had not rained very much but, when heavy rains fell, the Pond reappeared and flooded the basements of every building on Main Street, causing many business owners and home owners much turmoil. When this flooding happened, the city had one steam-powered pump that had to be used to dry out the entire area that had been flooded, which would take days, if not weeks – and more often than not, it would have rained again in this time period and caused even more flooding, even in the basements that had already been emptied of the water. When the water was gone from the basements, the city still had to deal with the mud that also resulted from the heavy rains.

The city decided in 1882 to build an artesian ditch to control the &quot;Frog Pond&quot; effects; the plan was later upgraded and developed into an artesian well in 1884 to combat the heavy rains and keep the basements from flooding. The artesian well was designed by the city engineers to prevent flooding and develop a water system. However, during the digging of the well, the water stream that was found underground was too powerful to be contained. The water came blasting out with violent force and had the entire Main Street submerged in up to four feet of water. The engineers realized the previous flaws of the artesian well plan and soon added a gate valve to the well to control the flow of water, giving Aberdeen its first working water supply.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Aberdeen had four different railroad companies with depots built in the newly developing town. With these four railroads intersecting here, Aberdeen soon became known as the &quot;Hub City of the Dakotas&quot;. When looking down on Aberdeen from above, the railroad tracks converging in Aberdeen resembled the spokes of a wheel converging at a hub, hence the name &quot;Hub City of the Dakotas&quot;. These four railroad companies are the reason why Aberdeen was able to grow and flourish as it did. The only railroad still running through Aberdeen is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

===1999 South Dakota Learjet crash===
On October 25, 1999, a Learjet 35 carrying golfing star [[Payne Stewart]] crashed in a field near Mina, {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} west of Aberdeen. All on board died.

==Geography==
Aberdeen is located in northeastern South Dakota, in the [[James River (Dakotas)|James River]] valley, approximately {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} west of the river. The James River enters northeastern South Dakota in Brown County, where it is dammed to form two reservoirs northeast of Aberdeen. The city is bisected by ''Moccasin Creek'', a slow-moving waterway which flows south and then northeast to the James River.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|15.60|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|15.50|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=June 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aberdeen has been assigned the [[ZIP code]] range 57401−57402.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zipcode.org/city/SD/ABERDEEN|title=City of Aberdeen, SD Zip Codes – ZipCode.org|website=zipcode.org|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Aberdeen experiences a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb/Dfa'') influenced by its position far from moderating bodies of water. This brings four distinct seasons, a phenomenon that is characterized by hot, relatively humid summers and cold, dry winters, and it lies in [[Hardiness zone|USDA Hardiness Zone]] 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=57401&amp;submit=Look+it+up%21 |title=facebook-circle |website=Arborday.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|12.0|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|71.3|°F|1}} in July, while there are 13 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs and 37 days with sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually.&lt;ref name = &quot;NOAA txt&quot;/&gt; Snowfall occurs mostly in light to moderate amounts during the winter, totaling {{convert|38|in|cm|0}}. Precipitation, at {{convert|21.7|in|mm|0}} annually, is concentrated in the warmer months. Extreme temperatures have ranged from {{convert|−46|°F|0}} on January 12, 1912, and February 8, 1895, to {{convert|115|°F|0}} on July 6 and 15, 1936, although a {{convert|−42|°F|0}} reading occurred as recently as January 15, 2009.&lt;ref name = ThreadEx/&gt;

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a National Weather Service office in Aberdeen. Their area of responsibility includes northern and eastern South Dakota and two counties in west-central Minnesota.

Aberdeen is the county seat of Brown County. The original county seat was, however, [[Columbia, South Dakota|Columbia]]. During the days of the railroad construction, plans were laid to bring the railroad through Columbia, then the county seat. When word of this spread, land in and around Columbia soared in price due to speculation. When the time came for the railroads to purchase land, the increase in land prices led them to change their decision and instead to route the rail lines through Aberdeen. However, once Aberdeen became a town in 1881, there was a long-running controversy concerning which town would be the county seat, which continued until 1890, when it was declared by the newly formed South Dakota state constitution in 1889 that a majority vote could move the county seat if the county seat in question had originally been established by less than a majority vote. The result of the vote declared that Aberdeen would be the county seat once and for all, so all of the records were once again transferred to Aberdeen's courthouse; during the battle for county seat, the records had been moved from Columbia's courthouse to Aberdeen's courthouse (which was built from 1886 to 1887), and back again to Columbia's in what seemed to be a never-ending cycle of the transferring of records. This was typically done in the form of nighttime raids from the two towns.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
