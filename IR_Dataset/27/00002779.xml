The '''Atari 2600''', originally branded as the '''Atari Video Computer System''' or '''Atari VCS''' for short until November 1982, is a [[home video game console]] from [[Atari, Inc.]] Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of [[microprocessor]]-based hardware and games stored on [[ROM cartridge]]s (a format first used with the [[Fairchild Channel F]] in 1976) instead of [[dedicated console|dedicated]] hardware with games physically built into the unit. The 2600 was bundled with two [[joystick]] [[game controller|controllers]], a conjoined pair of [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]] controllers, and a game cartridge: initially ''[[Combat (1977 video game)|Combat]]'',&lt;ref name=combat&gt;{{cite web | last = Weesner | first = Jason | title =On Game Design: A History of Video Games | date= January 11, 2007 | url =http://www.gamecareerguide.com/features/327/on_game_design_a_history_of_video_.php?page=3 | accessdate = November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]''.&lt;ref name=2600pacman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mr-atari.com/afbeeldingen/systems/2600pacmanblue.jpg|title=Image of box with Pac-Man sticker|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atari VCS launched with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 [[kibibyte|KiB]] cartridges. The system found its [[killer app]] with its version of Taito's ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1980 and became widely successful, leading to the creation of [[Activision]] and other third-party game developers as well as competition from home console manufacturers [[Mattel]] and [[Coleco]]. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983–84, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the ROM of the launch titles&lt;ref name=horton/&gt; with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as ''[[Pitfall!]]'' and its scrolling sequel ''[[Pitfall II: Lost Caverns]]''.

Atari invested heavily in two games for the 2600, ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', the latter being a commercial failure that contributed to the [[video game crash of 1983]] which ended the market relevance of the 2600. Warner sold off the home console division of Atari to [[Commodore International|Commodore]] CEO [[Jack Tramiel]]. In 1986, the new [[Atari Corporation]] under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backwards-compatible [[Atari 7800]], but these were not enough to turn things around, and ultimately it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry. Atari finally ended production of the Atari 2600 on January 1, 1992. Across the system's lifetime, an estimated 30 million units were sold.

==History==
Atari was founded by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]] in 1972.  Their first major product was ''[[Pong]]'', one of the first successful [[arcade game]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;inc bushnell&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/20090401/the-gamer.html  |title = Nolan Busnell is Back in the Game|last = Chafkin, Max|date = April 1, 2009|magazine = [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1975, Atari had released a ''Pong'' home console, competing against [[Magnavox]], the only other major producer of home consoles at the time. Bushnell recognized, however, the limitation of custom [[logic programming|logic]] burned onto the circuit board; this allowed only one game (and its variants), meaning that any new game would require a completely different console.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespy history p1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&amp;id=401 | title = The 2600 Story - Part I | first=  Marty | last=  Goldberg | date = January 4, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131013220343/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Articles.Detail&amp;id=401 | archivedate = October 13, 2013 | accessdate = September 11, 2018 | work = [[GameSpy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because development of a console cost at least {{USD|100,000}} and time to complete, and had only about a three-month shelf life before becoming outdated, it was a risky business model.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/130414/the_history_of_atari_19711977.php?print=1 | title = The History of Atari: 1971-1977 | first=  Steve | last =Fulton | date = November 6, 2007 | accessdate = September 11, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, Atari had acquired [[Cyan Engineering]], an electronics company founded by Steve Mayer and Larry Emmons (both former colleagues of Bushnell and Dabney from [[Ampex]]), and started Atari's [[Grass Valley, Oakland, California|Grass Valley]] Think Tank, where they developed new ideas for arcade games. Due to Bushnell's concern about single-game consoles, the Grass Valley team started working on a home console with multi-game support. Mayer and Emmons determined that a home console would require newly invented [[microprocessor]]s to support multiple games, but such microprocessors cost {{USD|100–300}} at the time, far outside the range that their market would support.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespy history p1&quot;/&gt; In September 1975, [[Chuck Peddle]] of [[MOS Technology]] created a low-cost replacement for the [[Motorola 6800]], the [[MOS Technology 6502]], and introduced it at the 1975 Wescon trade show in San Francisco. Mayer and Ron Milner attended the show, met with Peddle, and later invited Peddle to Cyan's headquarters to discuss using MOS's microprocessors for a game console. Mayer and Milner negotiated a deal for the 6502 chips at {{USD|8}} each, which was sufficient to begin development of a console;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt; however, further discussions determined that the better solution would be the [[MOS Technology 6507]], a more restrictive but lower-cost version of the 6502. Cyan and MOS also enlisted [[Synertek]], a semiconductor manufacturer whose co-founder, Bob Schreiner, was good friends with Peddle, to act as a second source for the 6507.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespy history p1&quot;/&gt;

By December 1975, Atari hired [[Joseph C. Decuir|Joe Decuir]] to help design the first prototype, codenamed &quot;Stella&quot; (the name of Decuir's bicycle).&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt; A second prototype was completed by March 1976 with the help of [[Jay Miner]], who had managed to fit the entire [[Television Interface Adaptor]] (TIA), to send graphics and audio to the television display, into a single chip.&lt;ref name=&quot;proto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/proto2600.html |title=The Atari VCS Prototype |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2014 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20130117094934/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/proto2600.html |archivedate = January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second prototype included the 6507, the TIA, and a [[ROM cartridge]] slot and adapter, each cartridge holding a ROM game image.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt; Believing that Stella would be a success, Bushnell acquired the entire Grass Valley Think Tank and relocated them to Atari's new headquarters in [[Sunnyvale, California]] by mid-1976, putting Steve Mayer in charge of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt; Bushnell feared that once this unit was released, competitors would try to copy it, and preemptively arranged with all integrated chip manufacturers who were interested in the games market to deny sales to his competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt;

[[Fairchild Semiconductor]] introduced its [[Fairchild Channel F]] home console in November 1976, beating Atari to the market with ROM cartridge technology. This pressured Atari to finish Stella more quickly, but the company lacked the funds to do so. Bushnell considered taking Atari public but instead sold the company to [[Warner Communications]] for {{USD|28 million}}; subsequently, Warner provided approximately {{USD|100 million}} in new funding, allowing Stella to be prioritized and fast-tracked.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt; By 1977, the product had advanced far enough to brand it as the &quot;Atari Video Computer System&quot; (VCS) and engage Atari's programmers to develop games for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt;

The unit was showcased in mid-1977 at the Summer [[Consumer Electronics Show]] with plans for retail release in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt; However, Atari encountered production problems during its first batch, and its testing was complicated by the use of cartridges. Ultimately, the consoles were shipped to retailers in November 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra history atari&quot;/&gt;

===Launch and success===
[[File:Atari-2600-Heavy-Sixer-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The second VCS model has lighter plastic molding and shielding, and a more angular shape, than the 1977 launch model.]]
[[File:Atari-2600-Woody-FL.jpg|thumb|Beginning in 1980, the VCS had only four front switches and a capital-letters logotype.]]
At release in September 1977, the unit was originally priced at {{USD|199}} (${{Inflation|US|199|1977}} adjusted for inflation), and shipped with two joysticks and a ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'' cartridge (eight additional games were available at launch and sold separately).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forster |first=Winnie |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds &amp; home computers 1972-2005 |year=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari sold between 350,000 and 400,000 Atari VCS units during 1977, attributed to the delay in shipping the units and consumers' unfamiliarity with non-dedicated consoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra atari 2&quot;/&gt;

1978 was a challenging year.  About 800,000 units were manufactured, but only 550,000 were sold by year's end. This required further financial support from Warner to cover losses and caused Bushnell to leave the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra atari 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3766/atari_the_golden_years__a_.php?print=1 | title = Atari: The Golden Years – A History, 1978–1981 | first = Steve | last =  Fulton | date = August 21, 2008 | accessdate = September 11, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Warren Robinett invented in this year the first [[action-adventure]] game, ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'',  changing the fundamentals of gaming with the first game featuring a &quot;virtual space bigger than the screen&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Racing The Beam|author1=Monfort, Nick |author2=Bogost, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = MIT Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari had suffered the loss of programmers David Crane, Bob Whitehead, Larry Kaplan, and Alan Miller, the company's &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, who had programmed most of the successful VCS games to that point. The four left Atari, disgruntled over Warner's oversight of the company and treatment of programmers, and formed [[Activision]], which introduced third-party software to the VCS.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra atari 2&quot;/&gt;

The VCS was the best-selling console during the 1979 holiday season, with more than 1 million units sold, but Atari saw new competition from the [[Mattel Intellivision]] and [[Magnavox Odyssey²]], which also used ROM cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qsa-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP10&amp;dq=atari+vcs+christmas+1979&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj76cfKlODRAhWjslQKHeYJA1IQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=atari%20vcs%20christmas%201979&amp;f=false|title=101 Amazing Atari 2600 Facts|last=Russell|first=Jimmy|date=December 3, 2012|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|isbn=9781782344957|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atari licensed the [[Arcade game|arcade]] hit ''[[Space Invaders]]'' by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]].  Its release in January 1980 doubled console sales to more than 2 million units. The VCS and its cartridges helped Atari earn more than $2 billion in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra atari 2&quot;/&gt; Sales then doubled again for the next two years; by 1982, the console had sold 10 million units, while its best-selling game ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'' sold 7 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition]] |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |year=2008 |isbn=1-904994-21-0 &lt;!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJQFSlyMEfAC --&gt; |page=24 |quote=10 million – number of Atari 2600 consoles sold by 1982. 7 million – estimated number of copies of Pac-Man for the Atari 2600 sold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console also sold 450,000 units in [[West Germany]] by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=EG Goes Continental: Europe Joins the Game World |magazine=[[Electronic Games]] |date=January 1984 |volume=2 |issue=23 |pages=46–7 |url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1984-01/Electronic_Games_Issue_23_Vol_02_11_1984_Jan#page/n45/mode/2up|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Atari launched its second home console, which it named the [[Atari 5200]]; to standardize its naming, the VCS was renamed to the &quot;Atari 2600 Video Computer System&quot;, or &quot;Atari 2600&quot; for short, derived from the manufacture part number CX2600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3551/a_history_of_gaming_platforms_.php?print=1 | title = A History of Gaming Platforms: Atari 2600 Video Computer System/VCS | first1 = Matt | last1= Barton | first2 = Bill | last2=  Loguidice | date = February 28, 2008 | accessdate = September 11, 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982 the 2600 console cost Atari about $40 to make and sold for an average of $125. The company spent $4.50 to $6 to manufacture its cartridges, plus $1 to $2 for advertising, and sold them for $18.95 wholesale.&lt;ref name=&quot;hubner19831128&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=ray%20kassar%20insider%20trading&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title=What went wrong at Atari? | work=InfoWorld | date=November 28, 1983 | agency=San Jose Mercury News | accessdate=March 5, 2012 |author1=Hubner, John |author2=Kistner, William F.

===Third party development===
Activision, formed by four former Atari VCS programmers, started developing third-party games to be used on cartridge systems, including the VCS, in 1979. Atari attempted to block the sale of the Activision cartridges, but lost in court, allowing other third-party VCS game developers to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZD4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=atari+activision&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F7aCUc3mMsvMqQHNgoCADg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA |title=Atari Sues to k.o.

Wolf |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2012 |isbn=9780313379369 |page=6 |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such developer was Rob Fulop, who had created the VCS version of ''[[Missile Command]]''. More than two million copies of ''Missile Command'' were sold&lt;ref name=&quot;top10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Levi|title=Top 10 Best-Selling Atari 2600 Games|url=https://ign.com/articles/2008/08/26/top-10-best-selling-atari-2600-games|website=IGN|date=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, for this milestone, Atari rewarded him with a gift certificate for a free turkey. Fulop promptly left Atari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari VCS/2600 FAQ|url=http://www.ataricompendium.com/faq/faq.html#general25|website=Atari Compendium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fulop co-founded [[Imagic]], and his first game for the company, ''[[Demon Attack]]'', became a hit in 1982.

Other VCS-focused game development companies that sprang up in the early 1980s include [[US Games]], [[Telesys]], [[Games by Apollo]], [[Data Age]], [[Zimag]], [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]], and [[CommaVid]]. Mattel and Coleco, each already producing its own more advanced console, created simplified versions of their existing titles for the 2600. Mattel used the [[M Network]] brand name for its cartridges. Third-party titles competed with Atari's share of VCS games, accounting for half of VCS game sales by 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Ron|title=Competitors Claim Role in Warner Setback |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/666912291.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Dec+11%2C+1982&amp;author=Ron+Rosenberg+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=COMPETITORS+CLAIM+ROLE+IN+WARNER+SETBACK&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=March 6, 2012|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=December 11, 1982|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and redesign===
With third-parties competing for market share, Atari worked to maintain dominance in the market by acquiring licenses for popular arcade games and other properties to make games from.

Warner, tired of supporting Atari, started looking for buyers in 1984.

The North American video game market did not recover until about 1986, after [[Nintendo]] had introduced the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in North America. [[Atari Corporation]] released a redesigned model of the 2600 in 1986, supported by an ad campaign touting a price of &quot;under 50 bucks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari 2600 1986 Commercial &quot;The Fun is Back&quot;|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m752qiGqSm4|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a large library of games and a low price point, the 2600 continued to sell into the late 1980s. Atari released a final batch of titles in 1989–90 including ''[[Secret Quest]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret Quest|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-secret-quest_7464.html|website=Atari Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Fatal Run''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fatal Run|url=http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-2600-vcs-fatal-run_16746.html|website=Atari Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final Atari-licensed release is the PAL-only port of the arcade game ''[[Klax (video game)|KLAX]]'' in 1990.

After more than 14 years on the market, the 2600 line was formally discontinued on January 1, 1992,&lt;ref name=&quot;Racing the Beam&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Racing the Beam|author1=Monfort, Nick |author2=Bogost, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = MIT Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Atari 7800]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]] of home computers.

===Console===
{{Main|Atari 2600 hardware}}
The Atari 2600's CPU is the [[MOS Technology 6507]], a version of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EGM62&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=When Pac Ruled the Earth|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=62|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=September 1994|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; running at 1.19 [[megahertz|MHz]] in the 2600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gallery/2017/feb/24/10-most-influential-games-consoles-in-pictures | title = 10 most influential games consoles – in pictures | first = Keith  |last= Stewart | date = February 24, 2017 | accessdate = September 17, 2018 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though their internal silicon was identical, the 6507 was cheaper than the 6502 because its package included fewer [[Memory address|memory-address]] pins—13 instead of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System]]|author1=Monfort, Nick |author2=Bogost, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = [[MIT Press]]|year = 2009|isbn = 0-262-01257-X|location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designers of the Atari 2600 selected an inexpensive cartridge interface&lt;ref name=&quot;cartridge-socket&quot;&gt;The cartridge connector's 24 pins are allocated to one supply-voltage line, two ground lines, 8 data lines, and 13 address lines. The uppermost address line is used as a so-called [[chip select]] for the cartridge's ROM chip, however, leaving only 12 address lines for the chip's game program. Thus, without special &quot;hardware tricks&quot; built into the cartridge, an Atari 2600 game can occupy a maximum address space of 4 kiB. {{Cite book|title = [[Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System]]|author1=Monfort, Nick |author2=Bogost, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = [[MIT Press]]|year = 2009|isbn = 0-262-01257-X|location = |pages = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has one fewer address than the 13 allowed by the 6507, further reducing the already limited addressable memory to 4&amp;nbsp;[[kibibyte|kiB]] (2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; = 4096). This was believed to be sufficient as ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'' is itself only 2&amp;nbsp;[[kibibyte|kiB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System]]|author1=Monfort, Nick |author2=Bogost, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = [[MIT Press]]|year = 2009|isbn = 0-262-01257-X|location = |pages = 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later games circumvented this limitation with [[bank switching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System]]|author1=Monfort, Nick |author2=Bogost, Ian |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = [[MIT Press]]|year = 2009|isbn = 0-262-01257-X|location = |pages = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The console has 128 [[byte]]s of [[random-access memory|RAM]] for scratch space, the [[call stack]], and the state of the game environment.

The top bezel of the console originally included six switches: power, TV type selection (color or black-and-white), game selection, player difficulty, and game reset. The difficulty switches were later moved to the back of the top bezel. The back bezel also included the controller ports, television output, and power adapter outlets.

===Graphics===
{{Main|Television Interface Adaptor}}
The 2600 does not have a [[framebuffer|frame buffer]]. Instead the video device provides two 8-pixel [[bitmap]]ped [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], two 1-pixel &quot;missile&quot; sprites, a 1-pixel &quot;ball&quot;, and a 40-pixel &quot;playfield&quot; that is drawn by writing a bit pattern for each line into a register just before the television scans that line. As each line is scanned, a game must identify the non-sprite objects that overlap the next line, assemble the appropriate bit patterns to draw for those objects, and write the pattern into the register. Similar to its predecessor ''Pong'', the right side of the screen is a mirrored duplicate of the left; to control it separately, the software may modify the patterns as the scan line is drawn. After the controller scans the last active line, a slower [[vertical blanking interval]] begins, during which the game can process inputs and update the positions and states of objects in the game world. Any mistake in timing produces visual artifacts, a problem that programmers call &quot;racing the beam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RacingTheBeam&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The 2600's video hardware is therefore highly flexible, but also challenging to program. One advantage the 2600 has over more powerful contemporary competitors such as the [[ColecoVision]] is that the 2600 has no protection against altering settings in mid-line. For example, although each sprite nominally has only one color, it is possible to color the rows differently by changing the sprite's color as it is drawn. If the two hardware sprites are not enough for a game, a developer may share one sprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'') or draw software sprites, which is only a little more difficult than drawing a fixed playfield. The ''[[Pitfall!]]'' screenshot demonstrates some of these tricks: the player is a multi-color sprite, one sprite is multiplexed for the logs and the scorpion, and the swinging vine is drawn by shifting the position of the &quot;ball&quot; on each scan line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014632/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PITFALL|title=GDC 2011 Panel: Pitfall Classic Postmortem With David Crane |publisher=GDC Vault|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Robinett]], the programmer for ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'', described numerous tricks that he had to do to complete ''Adventure'' to both fit it within the memory limitations of the Atari 2600, as well as creatively use the graphics capability to create a multi-screen maze for players to navigate, using the &quot;missile&quot; sprite to create the maze's walls.{{sfn|Bogost, Montfort|2009|p=52|ref=Beam}}

The Atari 2600 was designed to be compatible with the cathode-ray tube television sets produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arceneaux |first1=Noah |title=Review Article: Game theories, technologies and techniques of play |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=19 February 2010 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=161–166 |doi=10.1177/1461444809350996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses different color palettes depending on the television signal format.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIA color chart&quot;&gt;Atari 2600 [http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html &quot;TIA color chart&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707234118/http://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/200109/msg00285.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[NTSC]] format, a 128-color palette was available;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yearofcodes.tumblr.com/what-is-rgb | title=What is RGB colour? | accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[PAL]], only 104 colors;&lt;ref name=&quot;TIA color chart&quot;/&gt; in [[SECAM]], only 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIA color chart&quot;/&gt;

A side effect of how graphics work on the 2600 is that all games are required to run at either 60 frames per second (NTSC) or 50 frames per second (PAL).

===Controllers===
[[File:Atari-2600-Joystick.jpg|thumb|upright|CX40 joystick]]
The VCS originally shipped with two types of controllers: a joystick (part number CX10) and pair of rotary paddle controllers (CX30). Driving controllers, which are similar to paddle controllers but can be continuously rotated, shipped with the ''[[Indy 500 (1977 video game)|Indy 500]]'' launch game. After less than a year, the CX10 joystick was replaced with the CX40 model&lt;ref name=&quot;current&quot;/&gt; designed by James C. Asher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Patent 4,349,708|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/1ae0e2937613724a0e9f/US4349708.pdf|date=September 14, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Atari joystick port]] and [[CX40 joystick]] became industry standards, 2600 joysticks and some other peripherals work with later systems, including the [[MSX]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari 8-bit family]], and [[Atari ST]]. The CX40 joystick can be used with the [[Master System]] and [[Sega Genesis]], but does not provide all the buttons of a native controller. Third-party controllers include Wico's Command Control joystick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/31885/gamertell-review-wicos-command-control-joystick/|title=Gamertell Review: Wico's Command Control Joystick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the CX42 Remote Control Joysticks, similar in appearance but using wireless technology, were released, together with a receiver whose wires could be inserted in the controller jacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://atariage.com/controller_page.php?SystemID=2600&amp;ControllerID=27|title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 - Controllers - Remote Control Joysticks|website=atariage.com|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atari introduced the CX50 Keyboard Controller in June 1978 along with two games that required it: ''Codebreaker'' and ''Hunt &amp; Score''.&lt;ref name=&quot;current&quot;/&gt; The similar, but simpler, CX23 Kid's Controller was released later for a series of games aimed at a younger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://atariage.com/controller_page.php?SystemID=2600&amp;ControllerID=6|title=AtariAge - Atari 2600 - Controllers - Kid's Controller|website=atariage.com|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CX22 Trak-Ball controller was announced in January 1983 and was compatible with the Atari 8-bit family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Current|first1=Michael D.|title=Atari 8-Bit Computers FAQ|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/atari-8-bit/faq/section-102.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two attempts to turn the Atari 2600 into a keyboard-equipped [[home computer]]: Atari's never-released CX3000 &quot;Graduate&quot; keyboard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Atari &quot;Graduate&quot; Computer CX-3000 |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/a3000.html |website=Atari Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[CompuMate]] keyboard by [[Spectravideo]] which was released in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Spectravideo &quot;Compumate&quot; Keyboard |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2600/compumat.html |website=Atari Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor revisions===
[[File:Atari-2600-Vader-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The all-black model that first used the Atari 2600 name (released in November 1982)]]
The initial production of the VCS was made in Sunnyvale, using thick plastic for the casing, and with all six console switches on the front panel. Production of the unit was moved to Hong Kong in 1979, where a thinner plastic was used for the casing, reducing the system's weight. These two versions are commonly referred to as &quot;Heavy Sixers&quot; and &quot;Light Sixers&quot; respectively, representing the six front switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.digitalgamemuseum.org/you-can-judge-a-2600-by-its-cover/ |  title = You Can Judge a 2600 By Its Cover | first= Dave | last = Beaudoin | date =  May 31, 2016 | accessdate = September 11, 2018 | work = Digital Game Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the difficulty switches were moved to the back of the console, leaving four switches on the front. Other than this, these four-switch consoles looked nearly identical to the earlier six-switch models. In 1982 Atari rebranded the console as the &quot;Atari 2600&quot;, a name first used on a version of the four-switch model without woodgrain, giving it an all-black appearance.

===Sears Video Arcade===

Atari continued their [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] relationship with [[Sears]] under the latter's Tele-Games brand, which started in 1975 with the original ''[[Pong]]''.

[[File:Atari-2600-Video-Arcade-II-FL.jpg|thumb|The design of the Japan-only Atari 2800 was later used in the US for the Sears Video Arcade II.]]
The Atari 2800 is the Japanese version of the 2600 released in October 1983. It was the first release of a 2600 designed specifically for the Japanese market, though companies like [[Epoch Co.|Epoch]] had distributed the 2600 in Japan previously. It was released a short time after [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]], which became the dominant console in  Japan, and the 2800 did not gain a significant share of the market. Sears released the 2800 in the US in 1983 as the Sears Video Arcade II packaged with two  controllers and ''[[Space Invaders]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarimuseum&quot; /&gt; Around 30 specially branded games were released for the 2800.

Designed by engineer Joe Tilly, the 2800 has four controller ports instead of the two of the 2600. The controllers are an all-in one design using a combination of an 8-direction digital [[joystick]] and a 270-degree [[paddle (game controller)|paddle]], designed by John Amber.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarimuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2800/A2800.html |title=The Atari 2800 System |first=Curt |last=Vendel |website=arquivo.pt |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523171925/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2800/A2800.html |archivedate=May 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2800's case design departed from the 2600, using a wedge shape with non-protruding switches. The case style was used as the basis for the [[Atari 7800]]'s case designed by Barney Huang.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarimuseum&quot; /&gt;

The 1986 model, unofficially referred to as &quot;the 2600 Jr.&quot;, features a smaller, cost-reduced form factor with a modernized, [[Atari 7800]]-like appearance. The redesigned 2600 was advertised as a budget gaming system (under US$49.99) with the ability to run a large collection of classic games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Atari 7800 and 2600|journal=Sears Catalog|date=1988|url=https://atariage.com/forums/topic/233960-7800-2600-jr-ad-in-sears-1988-catalog/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though released after the video game crash of 1983, and after the North American launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the 2600 was supported with new games and television commercials promoting &quot;The fun is back!&quot; Later European versions of the 2600 Jr. include a joypad, which is also featured with the European 7800.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Atari released several minor stylistic variations of the 2600 Jr. design: the &quot;large rainbow&quot; (shown at right), &quot;short rainbow&quot;, and an all-black version sold only in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2600 Consoles and Clones | url = https://atariage.com/2600/archives/consoles.html | accessdate = August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Maurer's port of Taito's ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released in 1980, is the first VCS title to have more than one million copies sold&amp;mdash;eventually doubling that.&lt;ref name=&quot;7best&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kevin Day |first1=Patrick |title=Atari bankruptcy: Remembering the 2600, 7 bestselling games |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/games/atari-bankruptcy-remembering-the-2600-7-bestselling-games/#/0 |website=Hero Complex |date=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the [[killer app]] to drive console sales. Versions of Atari's own ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' and ''[[Missile Command]]'' arcade games, released the following year, were also major hits.

Each early VCS game is in a 2K ROM. Later games like ''Space Invaders'', and even ''River Raid'' from 1982, increased this capacity to 4K.&lt;ref name=&quot;horton&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Horton |first1=Kevin |title=Info about cart sizes and bankswitching methods |url=http://www.classic-games.com/atari2600/bankswitch.html |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VCS port of ''Asteroids'' (1981) is the first game for the system to have used 8K via a [[bank switching]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grand |first1=Joe |title=Hardware Hacking |date=2004 |publisher=Syngress Publishing |isbn=978-1932266832 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hardwarehackingh00gran }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later releases, including Atari's ports of ''[[Dig Dug]]'' and ''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'', are 16K cartridges.&lt;ref name=horton/&gt;

Two Atari published games, both from 1982, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;1up&quot; /&gt; and ''[[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Pac-Man]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are frequently blamed for contributing to the [[video game crash of 1983]]. To clear inventory and save money in wake of the crash, Atari shipped about 700,000 Atari 2600 games, including unsold lots of ''Pac-Man'' and ''E.T.'', to a landfill in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]] in 1983. Until 2014, there was skepticism of how much Atari had buried there, in some cases estimates of millions of cartridges, creating an urban legend of an [[Atari video game burial]]. The legend was verified in 2014 when interested parties were able to dig up a portion of the landfill and confirmed the presence of unsold Atari games.

A company named [[Mystique (company)|Mystique]] produced a number of [[pornography|pornographic]] games for the 2600. The most notorious of these, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'', was protested by women's and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/2678/3party/mystique.html |title=AGH - Third Party Profile: Mystique |publisher=AtariHQ.com |date= |accessdate=July 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it depicted [[George Armstrong Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]] raping a bound Native American woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fragmaster |url=http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&amp;id=282 |title=Custer's Revenge |publisher=Classic Gaming |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416185618/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&amp;id=282 |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Atari sued Mystique in court over the release of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lauren |last=Gonzalez |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-3.html |title=When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy |page=3 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709233617/http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-3.html |archivedate=July 9, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atari VCS&amp;mdash;and later as the 2600&amp;mdash;was so successful in the late 1970s and early 1980s that &quot;Atari&quot; was a synonym for the system in mainstream media and, [[metonymy|by extension]], for video games in general.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news | last = Edgers | first = Geoff | title =Atari and the deep history of video games| date= March 8, 2009 | work= [[The Boston Globe]] |url =http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/03/08/a_talk_with_nick_montfort/ | accessdate = April 13, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416221945/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/03/08/a_talk_with_nick_montfort/| archivedate= April 16, 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay Miner directed the creation of the successors to the 2600's TIA chip&amp;mdash;[[Color Television Interface Adaptor|CTIA]] and [[ANTIC]]&amp;mdash;which were central to the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 8-bit computers]] released in 1979 and later the [[Atari 5200]] console.

The Atari 2600 was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]], in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2007/11/09/toy_hall_of_fame/|title=The Atari 2600 makes the Toy Hall of Fame|author=Farhad Manjoo|publisher=|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Atari 2600 was named the number two console of all time by [[IGN]], who cited its remarkable role as the console behind both the first video game boom and the video game crash of 1983, and called it &quot;the console that our entire industry is built upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ign.com/top-25-consoles/2.html |title=Atari 2600 is number 2 |website=IGN |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clones and reissues===
Modern Atari 2600 clones remain on the market. The Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game, manufactured by [[Jakks Pacific]], [[Video game console emulator|emulates]] the 2600 console and includes converted versions of 10 games into a single Atari-brand-lookalike joystick with [[composite video|composite-video]] outputs for connecting directly to modern televisions or VCRs. The [[TV Boy]] includes 127 games in an enlarged joypad.

The [[Atari Flashback 2]] console, released in 2005, contains 40 games (with four additional programs unlocked by a [[cheat code]]). The console implements the original 2600 architecture and can be modified to play original 2600 cartridges by adding a cartridge port, and is also compatible with original 2600 controllers.

In 2017, Hyperkin announced the RetroN 77, a clone of the Atari 2600 that plays original cartridges instead of pre-installed games.&lt;ref&gt;Engadget.  &quot;Atari 2600 fans get the revival console they deserve.&quot;  URL: https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/13/atari-2600-retron-77/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atari VCS (2019 console)|Atari VCS microconsole]], planned for release from [[Atari Interactive]] by 2019, is designed on a miniaturization of the Atari 2600, including the option for its faux wood paneling. This microconsole is designed to play several Atari 2600 games under emulation on a [[Linux]] operating system, as well as potentially other games for computers and other gaming systems.

==Unreleased prototypes==
The [[Atari 2700]] is a version of the 2600 which uses wireless controllers.

An Atari 2600 variant, known by its production code &quot;CX2000&quot; and nickname &quot;Val&quot;, was found as two 1982 prototypes at the New York and Sunnyvale Atari facilities, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/2000/a2000.html|title=The Atari CX-2000 Prototype|website=www.atarimuseum.com|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an attempt to make a new version of the aging 2600. Its design, with two integrated joystick controllers, was the result of human factor analysis by [[Henry Dreyfuss Associates]]. The project never saw market production.

Atari started work on a 2600 successor called the &quot;Atari 3200&quot;. It was to be compatible with 2600 cartridges, and was rumored to be based on a 10-bit processor, although design documents show it was to be based on the 8-bit [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]. It was unfinished when preliminary game developers discovered that it was difficult to program. Atari cloned the Atari 3200 into the Sears Super Arcade II, but this was never released.&lt;ref name=&quot;sylvia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/sylvia/sylvia.html |title=The Atari 3200: Super-Stella/Sylvia |publisher=AtarL Museum |accessdate=July 6, 2009 |archiveurl = https://archive.today/20130118010922/http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/sylvia/sylvia.html |archivedate = January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
