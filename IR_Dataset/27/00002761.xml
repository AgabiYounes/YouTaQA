[[Image:Ethylene-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|120px|A 3D model of [[ethylene]], the simplest alkene.]]

In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkene''' is an [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]] that contains a [[carbon]]–carbon [[double bond]] (unsaturated hydrocarbons containing two or more double bonds and are known as [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/alkadiene alkadienes], [http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/tax_nodes/C0002841 alkatrienes], [http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/tax_nodes/C0002842 alkatetraenes], and so on, the suffix denoting the number of double bonds).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Wade | first = L.G. | title = Organic Chemistry | publisher = Pearson [[Prentice Hall]] | date = 2006 |edition=6th| pages = 279 | isbn = 978-1-4058-5345-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see [[Alkene#Nomenclature|nomenclature]] section below).  Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other [[functional group]]s, known as mono-enes, form a [[homologous series]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s with the general formula {{Carbon}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;{{Hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAC1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title=Glossary of Class Names of Organic Compounds and Reactive Intermediates Based on Structure (IUPAC Recommendations 1995)  | last = Moss | first = G.

S.| last3=Tavernier| first3=D.| issue=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkenes have two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s fewer than the corresponding [[alkane]] (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, [[ethylene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), with the [[IUPAC name]] ''ethene'', is the [[organic compound]] produced on the largest scale industrially.&lt;ref name=&quot;cenews&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Production: Growth is the Norm |journal=Chemical and Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=28 |pages=59–236 |date=July 10, 2006 |doi=10.1021/cen-v084n034.p059}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aromatic]] compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAC1995&quot;/&gt;

== Structure ==

===Bonding===
[[Image:Ethylene 3D.png|200px|thumb|Ethylene (ethene), showing the pi bond in green.]]
Like a single [[covalent bond]], double bonds can be described in terms of overlapping [[atom]]ic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single [[sigma bond]]), a carbon–carbon double bond consists of one [[sigma bond]] and one [[pi bond]]. This double bond is stronger than a single [[covalent bond]] (611&amp;nbsp;[[joule|kJ]]/[[Mole (unit)|mol]] for C=C vs. 347&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol for C–C)&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;/&gt; and also shorter, with an average [[bond length]] of 1.33 [[ångström]]s (133 [[picometre|pm]]).

Each carbon of the double bond uses its three sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[orbital hybridization|hybrid orbitals]] to form sigma bonds to three atoms (the other carbon and two hydrogen atoms). The unhybridized 2p atomic orbitals, which lie perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three sp² hybrid orbitals, combine to form the pi bond. This bond lies outside the main C–C axis, with half of the bond on one side of the molecule and half on the other.  With a strength of 65 kcal/mol, the pi bond is significantly weaker than the sigma bond.

Rotation about the carbon–carbon double bond is restricted because it incurs an energetic cost to break the alignment of the [[p orbital]]s on the two carbon atoms. As a consequence, substituted alkenes may exist as one of two [[isomer]]s, called ''cis'' or ''trans'' isomers. More complex alkenes may be named with the [[E-Z notation|''E''–''Z'' notation]] for molecules with three or four different [[substituent]]s (side groups). For example, of the [[Butene#Isomers|isomers of butene]], the two methyl groups of (''Z'')-but-2[[-ene]] (a.k.a. ''cis''-2-butene) appear on the same side of the double bond, and in (''E'')-but-2-ene (a.k.a. ''trans''-2-butene) the methyl groups appear on opposite sides. These two isomers of butene are slightly different in their chemical and physical properties.

Twisting to a 90° dihedral angle between two of the groups on the carbons requires less energy than the strength of a [[pi bond]], and the bond still holds. The carbons of the double bond become [[pyramidalization|pyramidal]], which allows preserving some [[p orbital]] alignment—and hence pi bonding. The other two attached groups remain at a larger dihedral angle. This contradicts a common textbook assertion that the two carbons retain their planar nature when twisting, in which case the p orbitals would rotate enough away from each other to be unable to sustain a pi bond. In a 90°-twisted alkene, the p orbitals are only misaligned by 42° and the strain energy is only around 40 kcal/mol.  In contrast, a fully broken pi bond has an energetic cost of around 65 kcal/mol.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrows|first=Susan E.|last2=Eberlein|first2=Thomas H.|year=2005|title=Understanding Rotation about a C=C Double Bond|journal=J. Chem. Educ.|volume=82|issue=9|pages=1329|bibcode=2005JChEd..82.1329B|doi=10.1021/ed082p1329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[pyramidal alkene]]s are stable. For example, ''trans''-[[cyclooctene]] is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19°, despite having a significant [[dihedral angle]] of 137° (a planar system has a dihedral angle of 180°) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18°. Even ''trans''-[[cycloheptene]] is stable at low temperatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Shape ===
As predicted by the [[VSEPR theory|VSEPR]] model of [[electron]] pair repulsion, the [[molecular geometry]] of alkenes includes [[bond angle]]s about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of [[steric strain]] introduced by [[nonbonded interactions]] between [[functional group]]s attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C–C–C bond angle in [[propylene]] is 123.9°.

For bridged alkenes, [[Bredt's rule]] states that a double bond cannot occur at the bridgehead of a bridged ring system unless the rings are large enough.&lt;ref name = Bansal /&gt;  Following Fawcett and defining ''S'' as the total number of non-bridgehead atoms in the rings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Bredt's Rule of Double Bonds in Atomic-Bridged-Ring Structures|first = Frank S.|last = Fawcett|journal = [[Chem.

==Physical properties==
Many of the physical properties of alkenes and [[alkane]]s are similar: they are colourless, nonpolar, and combustable.  The [[physical state]] depends on [[molecular mass]]: like the corresponding saturated hydrocarbons, the simplest alkenes, [[Ethylene|ethene]], [[propene]], and [[butene]] are gases at room temperature. Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids. The melting point of the solids also increases with increase in molecular mass.

Alkenes generally have stronger smells than the corresponding alkane.  Ethylene is described to have a &quot;sweet&quot; odor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-07-17|title=New evidence of the geological origins of the ancient Delphic oracle (Greece)|url=https://www.nature.com/news/2001/010717/full/news010719-10.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news010719-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ethane is odorless, for example.  The binding of cupric ion to the olefin in the mammalian olfactory receptor MOR244-3 is implicated in the smell of alkenes (as well as thiols).  Strained alkenes, in particular, like norbornene and ''trans''-cyclooctene are known to have strong, unpleasant odors, a fact consistent with the stronger π complexes they form with metal ions including copper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duan|first=Xufang|last2=Block|first2=Eric|last3=Li|first3=Zhen|last4=Connelly|first4=Timothy|last5=Zhang|first5=Jian|last6=Huang|first6=Zhimin|last7=Su|first7=Xubo|last8=Pan|first8=Yi|last9=Wu|first9=Lifang|date=2012-02-28|title=Crucial role of copper in detection of metal-coordinating odorants|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=9|pages=3492–3497|doi=10.1073/pnas.1111297109|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3295281|pmid=22328155|bibcode=2012PNAS..109.3492D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Alkenes are relatively stable compounds, but are more reactive than [[alkane]]s, either because of the reactivity of the carbon–carbon pi-bond or the presence of [[allylic]] CH centers. Most reactions of alkenes involve additions to this pi bond, forming new [[sigma bond|single bonds]].  Alkenes serve as a feedstock for the [[petrochemical industry]] because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions, prominently polymerization and alkylation.

===Addition reactions===
Alkenes react in many [[addition reaction]]s, which occur by opening up the double-bond. Most of these addition reactions follow the mechanism of [[electrophilic addition]]. Examples are [[hydrohalogenation]], [[halogenation]], [[halohydrin formation]], [[oxymercuration]], [[Hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], [[dichlorocarbene addition]], [[Simmons–Smith reaction]], [[catalytic hydrogenation]], [[epoxidation]], [[radical polymerization]] and [[hydroxylation]].
:[[File:Ear.png|400px|alt=Electrophilic addition|Electrophilic addition of X–Y to an alkene]]

====Hydrogenation====
[[Hydrogenation]] of alkenes produces the corresponding [[alkane]]s. The reaction is carried out under pressure at a temperature of 200&amp;nbsp;°C in the presence of a metallic [[catalyst]]. Common industrial catalysts are based on [[platinum]], [[nickel]] or [[palladium]]. For laboratory syntheses, [[Raney nickel]] (an [[alloy]] of nickel and aluminium) is often employed. The simplest example of this reaction is the catalytic hydrogenation of [[ethylene]] to yield [[ethane]]:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

====Hydration====
[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]], the addition of water across the double bond of alkenes, yields [[alcohol]]s. The reaction is catalyzed by strong [[acids]] such as [[sulfuric acid]]. This reaction is carried out on an industrial scale to produce [[ethanol]].

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

Alkenes can also be converted into alcohols via the [[oxymercuration–demercuration reaction]] , the [[hydroboration–oxidation reaction]] or by [[Mukaiyama hydration]].

====Halogenation====
In [[electrophilic halogenation]] the addition of elemental [[bromine]] or [[chlorine]] to alkenes yields [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] dibromo- and dichloroalkanes (1,2-dihalides or ethylene dihalides), respectively. The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BrCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br

Related reactions are also used as quantitative measures of unsaturation, expressed as the [[bromine number]] and [[iodine number]] of a compound or mixture.

====Hydrohalogenation====
[[Hydrohalogenation]] is the addition of [[hydrogen halide]]s such as [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]] or [[hydrogen iodide|HI]] to alkenes to yield the corresponding [[haloalkane]]s:
:{{Methyl}}–CH={{chem|CH|2}} + HI → {{Methyl}}–CH'''I'''&amp;minus;{{chem|CH|2}}–'''H'''

If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents.  This patterns is known as [[Markovnikov's rule]]. The use of [[Free-radical addition|radical initiators]] or other compounds can lead to the opposite product result. [[Hydrobromic acid]] in particular is prone to forming radicals in the presence of various impurities or even atmospheric oxygen, leading to the reversal of the Markovnikov result:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Introduction to Organic Chemistry |edition= 4th |first1= A. |last1= Streiwieser |authorlink1= Andrew Streitwieser |first2= C.H. |last2= Heathcock |authorlink2= Clayton Heathcock |first3= E.M. |last3= Kosower |publisher= Macmillan |location= New York |year= 1992 |chapter= 11.6.G. Alkenes: Reactions: Free Radical Additions |page= 288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{Methyl}}–CH={{chem|CH|2}} + HBr → {{Methyl}}–CH'''H'''–{{chem|CH|2}}–'''Br'''

====Halohydrin formation====
Alkenes react with water and halogens to form [[halohydrin]]s by an addition reaction. [[Markovnikov's rule|Markovnikov regiochemistry]] and anti stereochemistry occur.

: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → XCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH + HX

==== Oxidation ====
Alkenes are [[organic oxidation|oxidized]] with a large number of [[oxidizing agent]]s. In the presence of [[oxygen]], alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Catalysis|Catalytic]] oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with [[Peroxy acid|percarboxylic acids]] yields [[epoxide]]s. Reaction with ozone in [[ozonolysis]] leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s. Reaction with concentrated, hot [[potassium permanganate|KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield [[ketone]]s or [[carboxylic acid]]s.

:R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;–CH=CH–R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;–CHO + R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;–CHO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.

The oxidation can be stopped at the [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diol]] rather than full cleavage of the alkene by using milder (dilute,lower temperature) KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or with [[osmium tetroxide]] or other oxidants.

==== Photooxygenation ====
In the presence of an appropriate [[photosensitiser]], such as [[methylene blue]] and light, alkenes can undergo reaction with reactive oxygen species generated by the photosensitiser, such as [[hydroxyl radical]]s, [[singlet oxygen]] or [[superoxide]] ion. These reactive [[photochemical]] intermediates are generated in what are known as Type I, Type II, and Type III processes, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These various alternative processes and reactions can be controlled by choice of specific reaction conditions, leading to a wide range of different products. A common example is the [4+2]-[[cycloaddition]] of singlet oxygen with a [[diene]] such as [[cyclopentadiene]] to yield an [[endoperoxide]]:

[[File:4+2 cycloaddition cyclopentadiene O2.svg|350px|center|alt=Generation of singlet oxygen and its [4+2]-cycloaddition with cyclopentadiene]]

Another example is the [[Ene reaction#Singlet-oxygen ene reaction|Schenck ene reaction]], in which singlet oxygen reacts with an [[allyl]]ic structure to give a transposed allyl [[peroxide]]:

[[File:Schenck ene reaction.svg|200px|center|alt=Reaction of singlet oxygen with an allyl structure to give allyl peroxide]]

===Polymerization===
{{main|polyolefin}}
[[Polymerization]] of alkenes is a reaction that yields [[polymer]]s of high industrial value at great economy, such as the plastics [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]. Polymers from alkene [[monomer]]s are referred to in a general way as ''[[polyolefin]]s'' or in rare instances as ''polyalkenes''. A polymer from [[alpha-olefin]]s is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-[[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] [[diene]]s such as [[buta-1,3-diene]] or [[isoprene]] (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.

===Metal complexation===
:[[Image:Ni(cod)2.png|thumb|right|220px|Structure of [[bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)]], a metal–alkene complex]]
Alkenes are [[ligand]]s in [[transition metal alkene complex]]es. The two carbon centres bond to the metal using the C–C pi- and pi*-orbitals. Mono- and diolefins are often used as ligands in stable complexes. [[Cyclooctadiene]] and [[norbornadiene]] are popular chelating agents, and even [[ethylene]] itself is sometimes used as a ligand, for example, in [[Zeise's salt]]. In addition, metal–alkene complexes are intermediates in many metal-catalyzed reactions including hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and polymerization.

==Synthesis==

===Industrial methods===
Alkenes are produced by hydrocarbon [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]]. Raw materials are mostly [[natural gas condensate]] components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and [[naphtha]] in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often in the presence of a [[zeolite]] catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Wade | first = L.G. | title = Organic Chemistry | publisher = Pearson [[Prentice Hall]] | date = 2006 |edition=6th| pages = 309 | isbn = 978-1-4058-5345-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:OctaneCracking.svg|500px|center|Cracking of ''n''-octane to give pentane and propene]]

Related to this is catalytic [[dehydrogenation]], where an alkane loses hydrogen at high temperatures to produce a corresponding alkene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade&quot;/&gt; This is the reverse of the [[catalytic hydrogenation]] of alkenes.
[[Image:ButaneDehydrogenation.svg|600px|center|Dehydrogenation of butane to give butadiene and isomers of butene]]
This process is also known as [[Catalytic reforming|reforming]].  Both processes are endothermic and are driven towards the alkene at high temperatures by [[entropy]].

[[Catalytic]] synthesis of higher α-alkenes (of the type RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can also be achieved by a reaction of ethylene with the [[organometallic compound]] [[triethylaluminium]] in the presence of [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], or [[platinum]].

===Elimination reactions===
One of the principal methods for alkene synthesis in the laboratory is the room [[elimination reaction|elimination]] of alkyl halides, alcohols, and similar compounds. Most common is the β-elimination via the E2 or E1 mechanism,&lt;ref name=&quot;PataiBook1964&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Saunders | first = W. H.  | editor = Patai, Saul | title = The Chemistry of Alkenes| publisher = Wiley Interscience | year = 1964 | pages = 149–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but α-eliminations are also known.

The E2 mechanism provides a more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a [[tosylate]] or [[triflate]]). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a [[dehydrohalogenation]]. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see [[Zaitsev's rule]]). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is ''anti'' to the leaving group, even though this leads to the less stable ''Z''-isomer.&lt;ref name=Cram1956&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:E2EliminationExample.png|500px|center|An example of an E2 Elimination]]

Alkenes can be synthesized from alcohols via [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]], in which case water is lost via the E1 mechanism. For example, the dehydration of [[ethanol]] produces ethene:
:[[Ethanol|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH]] + [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]  →  [[Ethene|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] +  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + {{chem|HSO|4|−}}

An alcohol may also be converted to a better leaving group (e.g., [[xanthate]]), so as to allow a milder ''syn''-elimination such as the [[Chugaev elimination]] and the [[Grieco elimination]]. Related reactions include eliminations by β-haloethers (the [[Boord olefin synthesis]]) and esters ([[ester pyrolysis]]).

Alkenes can be prepared indirectly from alkyl [[amine]]s. The amine or ammonia is not a suitable leaving group, so the amine is first either [[alkylation|alkylated]] (as in the [[Hofmann elimination]]) or oxidized to an [[amine oxide]] (the [[Cope reaction]]) to render a smooth elimination possible. The Cope reaction is a ''syn''-elimination that occurs at or below 150&amp;nbsp;°C, for example:&lt;ref name=&quot;CopeElimination1973&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bach, R.D. | title=Mechanism of the Cope elimination | journal=J. Org. Chem. | year=1973| volume=38| pages=1742–3 | doi=10.1021/jo00949a029 | last2 = Andrzejewski | first2 = Denis | last3 = Dusold | first3 = Laurence R. | issue = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CopeEliminationExample.svg|300px|center|Synthesis of cyclooctene via Cope elimination]]

The Hofmann elimination is unusual in that the ''less'' substituted (non-[[Saytzeff's rule|Saytseff]]) alkene is usually the major product.

Alkenes are generated from α-halo[[sulfone]]s in the [[Ramberg–Bäcklund reaction]], via a three-membered ring sulfone intermediate.

===Synthesis from carbonyl compounds===
Another important method for alkene synthesis involves construction of a new carbon–carbon double bond by coupling of a carbonyl compound (such as an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]) to a [[carbanion]] equivalent. Such reactions are sometimes called ''olefinations''. The most well-known of these methods is the [[Wittig reaction]], but other related methods are known, including the [[Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction]].

The Wittig reaction involves reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a [[Wittig reagent]] (or phosphorane) of the type Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=CHR to produce an alkene and [[Triphenylphosphine oxide|Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P=O]]. The Wittig reagent is itself prepared easily from [[triphenylphosphine]] and an alkyl halide. The reaction is quite general and many functional groups are tolerated, even esters, as in this example:&lt;ref name=&quot;Snider2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last=Snider| first=Barry B. | title=Synthesis of ent-Thallusin | journal=Org. Lett.| year=2006| volume=8| pages=2123–6|doi=10.1021/ol0605777| pmid=16671797| last2=Matsuo| first2=Y| last3=Snider| first3=BB| issue=10| pmc=2518398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WittigReactionExample.png|350px|center|A typical example of the Wittig reaction]]

Related to the Wittig reaction is the [[Peterson olefination]], which uses silicon-based reagents in place of the phosphorane.  This reaction allows for the selection of ''E''- or ''Z''-products. If an ''E''-product is desired, another alternative is the [[Julia olefination]], which uses the carbanion generated from a [[phenyl]] [[sulfone]]. The [[Takai olefination]] based on an organochromium intermediate also delivers E-products. A titanium compound, [[Tebbe's reagent]], is useful for the synthesis of methylene compounds; in this case, even esters and amides react.

A pair of carbonyl compounds can also be reductively coupled together (with reduction) to generate an alkene. Symmetrical alkenes can be prepared from a single aldehyde or ketone coupling with itself, using [[titanium]] metal reduction (the [[McMurry reaction]]). If two different ketones are to be coupled, a more complex, indirect method such as the [[Barton–Kellogg reaction]] may be used.

A single ketone can also be converted to the corresponding alkene via its tosylhydrazone, using [[sodium methoxide]] (the [[Bamford–Stevens reaction]]) or an alkyllithium (the [[Shapiro reaction]]).

===Synthesis from alkenes: olefin metathesis and hydrovinylation===
{{main|Olefin metathesis}}
Alkenes can be prepared by exchange with other alkenes, in a reaction known as [[olefin metathesis]]. In the implementations, formation of ethene gas is used to drive the reaction towards a desired product. In other cases, ethylene is used to convert internal alkenes into two terminal alkenes, a process referred to as [[ethenolysis]]. Olefin methathsis tolerates many functional groups. The method is particularly effective for the preparation of cyclic alkenes, as in this synthesis of [[muscone]]:
[[Image:MusconeViaRCM.svg|550px|center|Ring-closing metathesis used in synthesis of muscone]]

Transition metal catalyzed [[hydrovinylation]] is another important alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself.&lt;ref name=Vogt2010&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Vogt, D.  | year = 2010  | pages = 7166–8  | title = Cobalt-Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrovinylation  | issue = 40  | pmid = 20672269  | journal = Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  | volume = 49  | doi = 10.1002/anie.201003133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the addition of a hydrogen and a vinyl group (or an alkenyl group) across a double bond.

===From alkynes===
Reduction of [[alkyne]]s is a useful method for the [[stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] synthesis of disubstituted alkenes. If the ''cis''-alkene is desired, [[hydrogenation]] in the presence of [[Lindlar's catalyst]] (a heterogeneous catalyst that consists of palladium deposited on calcium carbonate and treated with various forms of lead) is commonly used, though hydroboration followed by hydrolysis provides an alternative approach. Reduction of the alkyne by [[sodium]] metal in liquid [[ammonia]] gives the ''trans''-alkene.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZweifelNantz&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Zweifel | first = George S. |author2=Nantz, Michael H.| title = Modern Organic Synthesis: An Introduction  |  publisher = W. H. Freeman &amp; Co. | location = New York | year = 2007 | pages = 366 | isbn = 978-0-7167-7266-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AlkyneToAlkene.png|600px|center|Synthesis of ''cis''- and ''trans''-alkenes from alkynes]]

For the preparation multisubstituted alkenes, [[carbometalation]] of alkynes can give rise to a large variety of alkene derivatives.

===Rearrangements and related reactions===
Alkenes can be synthesized from other alkenes via [[rearrangement reaction]]s. Besides [[olefin metathesis]] (described [[#Olefin metathesis|above]]), a large number of [[pericyclic reaction]]s can be used such as the [[ene reaction]] and the [[Cope rearrangement]].

[[Image:3,3copeexpansion.svg|180px|center|Cope rearrangement of divinylcyclobutane to cyclooctadiene]]

In the [[Diels–Alder reaction]], a [[cyclohexene]] derivative is prepared from a diene and a reactive or electron-deficient alkene.

==Nomenclature==
Although the nomenclature is not followed widely, according to IUPAC, alkenes are acyclic hydrocarbons with one double bond between carbon centers.  Olefins comprise a larger collection of cyclic and acyclic alkenes as well as dienes and polyenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=olefins |file=O04281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IUPAC names===
To form the root of the [[IUPAC nomenclature|IUPAC]] names for alkenes, simply change the ''-an-'' infix of the parent to ''-en-''. For example, '''CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the [[alkane]] ''ethANe''. The name of '''CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is therefore ''ethENe''.

In higher alkenes, where [[isomer]]s exist that differ in location of the double bond, the following numbering system is used:
# Number the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond in the direction that gives the carbon atoms of the double bond the lowest possible numbers.
# Indicate the location of the double bond by the location of its first carbon.
# Name branched or substituted alkenes in a manner similar to [[alkane]]s.
# Number the carbon atoms, locate and name substituent groups, locate the double bond, and name the main chain.

===''Cis''–''trans'' notation===
{{main|Cis–trans isomerism}}
In the specific case of disubstituted alkenes where the two carbons have one substituent each, [[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis''–''trans'']] notation may be used. If both substituents are on the same side of the bond, it is defined as ''cis''-. If the substituents are on either side of the bond, it is defined as ''trans''-.
[[Image:Cis-trans example.svg|thumb|300px|center|The difference between ''cis-'' and ''trans-'' isomers]]

===''E''–''Z'' notation===
{{main|E-Z notation}}
When an alkene has more than one substituent (especially necessary with 3 or 4 substituents), the double bond geometry is described using the labels ''E'' and ''Z''. These labels come from the German words ''entgegen'', meaning &quot;opposite&quot;, and ''zusammen'', meaning &quot;together&quot;. Alkenes with the higher priority groups (as determined by [[Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule|CIP rules]]) on the same side of the double bond have these groups together and are designated ''Z''. Alkenes with the higher priority groups on opposite sides are designated ''E''. A mnemonic to remember this:  ''Z'' notation has the higher priority groups on &quot;ze zame zide.&quot;

[[Image:EZalkenes2.png|400px|center|thumb|The difference between ''E'' and ''Z'' isomers]]

===Groups containing C=C double bonds===
IUPAC recognizes two names for hydrocarbon groups containing carbon–carbon double bonds, the [[vinyl group]] and the [[allyl]] group.&lt;ref name=&quot;PAC1995&quot;/&gt;
