}}

The '''Atari Jaguar''' is a [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|64-bit]] [[home video game console]] that was developed by [[Atari Corporation]], originally released in [[North America]] in November 1993.

The Jaguar is Atari's sixth programmable console. Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaguar_NA_RD&quot;/&gt; while competing with the existing [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit]] consoles ([[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]) and the 32-bit [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] platform (which launched the same year). Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s by [[Flare Technology]]. The Jaguar shipped with ''[[Cybermorph]]'' as the [[pack-in game|pack-in]] game.&lt;ref name=&quot;atariage.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html|title=AtariAge - Atari Jaguar History|website=www.atariage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-chip architecture, hardware bugs, and lacking developer support tools made game development difficult. Underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third-party support.&lt;ref name=&quot;atariage.com&quot;/&gt; This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a games library comprising only [[List of Atari Jaguar games|50 licensed titles]], plus another [[Atari Jaguar CD#Game library|13 games on the Jaguar CD]].

Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the system with the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] [[Video game accessory|add-on]] and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Once and Future Kings|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=80|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the release of the [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996. The [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]] of the Jaguar prompted Atari to leave the video game console market.

After [[Hasbro Interactive]] acquired all Atari properties in 1998,&lt;ref name=&quot;atarigoestohasbro&quot;/&gt; the patents to the Jaguar were released into the [[public domain]], with the console being declared an open platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;hasbro&quot;/&gt; Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew games]] for the console.&lt;ref name=&quot;redundant&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Development===
The Jaguar was developed by the members of [[Flare Technology]], a company formed by [[Martin Brennan (engineer)|Martin Brennan]] and [[John Mathieson (computer scientist)|John Mathieson]]. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] or the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], but they could also be cost-effective.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Impressed by their work on the [[Konix Multisystem]], Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called [[Flare Technology|Flare II]], with Atari providing the funding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed &quot;[[Atari Panther|Panther]]&quot;), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed &quot;Jaguar&quot;); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.

The Jaguar was unveiled in August 1993 at the Chicago Consumer Entertainment Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari: From Boom to Bust and Back Again |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Launch===
The Jaguar was launched on November 23, 1993, at a price of $249.99,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;/&gt; under a $500 million manufacturing deal with [[IBM]]. The system was initially available only in the [[Test market|test markets]] of [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], under the slogan &quot;Do the Math&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;/&gt; claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems. A U.S.-wide release followed six months later, in early 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Letters |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1995|page=107 |quote=The fact is that occasionally products do launch in some 'test' markets before making it national. Atari's Jaguar is a prime example (it was available in San Francisco and New York six months before anywhere else).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' wrote in January 1994 that the Jaguar was &quot;a great machine in search of a developer/customer base&quot;, as Atari had to &quot;overcome the stigma of its name (lack of marketing and customer support, as well as poor developer relations in the past)&quot;. The company &quot;ventured late into third party software support&quot; while competing console [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]]'s &quot;18 month public relations blitz&quot; would result in &quot;an avalanche of software support&quot;, the magazine reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199401&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Miller |first=Chuck |last2=Dille |first2=H. E. |last3=Wilson |first3=Johnny L. |date=January 1994 |title=Battle Of The New Machines |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&amp;pub=2&amp;id=114 |magazine=Computer Gaming World |pages=64–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base right after launch, however. Atari reported that it had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993. pp 14.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1994, it reported that it had sold approximately 100,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;Atari Corporation Annual Report. pp 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Saturn and PlayStation===
In early 1995, Atari announced that they had dropped the price of the Jaguar to $149.99 in order to improve its competitive nature. Atari even ran [[infomercial|early morning infomercials]], with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system, in order to gain even more attention. These infomercials would run for most of 1995, but would not significantly increase sales even further.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen24&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Thomas|first=Don |title=Atari's Historic Road to Nowhere|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=24 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1996|pages=97–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Tramiel, Atari's President, was a little worried about the upcoming [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] consoles. In a 1995 interview with ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', he declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the Sega Saturn, and slightly weaker than the PlayStation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Atari's President Talks Back |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=7 |date=July 1995|pages=6–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Next Generation'' received a deluge of letters in response to Tramiel's comments, particularly his threat to bring Sony to court for [[dumping (pricing policy)|price dumping]] if the PlayStation entered the U.S. market at a retail price below $300{{refn|group=aj|Many readers found this threat hollow and hypocritical, since Tramiel noted in the same interview that Atari were themselves selling the Jaguar at a loss. However, as noted by the editor in response to the letters, price dumping does not have to do with a product being priced below cost, but its being priced much lower in one country than another (which, as Tramiel said, is illegal). Tramiel and ''Next Generation'' agreed that the PlayStation's Japanese price converts to approximately $500.}} and his remark that the small number of third party Jaguar games was good for Atari's profitability, which angered Jaguar owners who were already frustrated at how few games were coming out for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Letters|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Atari had severely limited financial resources, and so could not create the level of marketing which has historically backed successful gaming consoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen24&quot;/&gt;

In May and September of 1995, [[Sega]] and [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]] came out with the Saturn and PlayStation, respectively, and both those consoles began to outsell the Jaguar rapidly. In Atari's 1995 annual report, it noted: {{quote|''Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/802019/0000891618-96-000213.txt Atari Corporation Annual Report, 1993]. pp 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Sales of the 3DO system, if not high, even placed the Jaguar into the rear-view mirror. The ability of bringing select Sega games to the Jaguar, as part of a settlement on Atari's lawsuit in August 1994 that Sega had infringed its patents, didn't even get to see the light of day as well.

===Decline===
By the end of 1995, Atari's revenues had declined by more than half, from $38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996&quot;/&gt; Beginning on October 31, 1995, a series of mass layoffs and insider statements began to fuel journalistic speculation that Atari had ceased development for the Jaguar and was simply trying to liquidate all remaining consoles, by slashing its price to the liquidation value of $99.99, before going into PC software development.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen13&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari Drops Jaguar?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=21|quote=Then in November, UK newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' ... put forward that Atari plans to give up on the Jaguar in favor of PC development ... ''The Sunday Times'' article is not the only piece of speculation regarding Atari's commitment to hardware to have appeared in the media over the last two weeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Atari Teeters on Grave's Edge|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Atari continued to deny these theories going into 1996, core Jaguar developers such as [[High Voltage Software]] and [[Beyond Games]] stated that they were no longer receiving communications from Atari regarding future Jaguar projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Crumbling Atari Still Defiant |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=16|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=April 1996|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1995, Sam Tramiel suffered a heart attack, forcing him to step down as President of Atari but he would later recover; Sam's father, [[Jack Tramiel]], who founded Atari Corporation by acquiring the consumer assets of [[Atari, Inc.]] from [[WarnerMedia#Warner Communications (1972–1990)|Warner Communications]] in 1984, would assume that position. Unfortunately, in January 1996, with production of the Jaguar now halted, and with no new products to sell at all, the Tramiel family decided to sell themselves out of the electronics business. In its [[Form 10-K405|10-K405 SEC Filing]], filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar: {{quote|''From the introduction of Jaguar in late 1993 through the end of 1995, Atari sold approximately 125,000 units of Jaguar. As of December 31, 1995, Atari had approximately 100,000 units of Jaguar in inventory.''&lt;ref name=&quot;10-K405 SEC Filing, filed by ATARI CORP on 4/12/1996&quot;/&gt;}} The filing also confirmed the theory that Atari had begun giving up on the Jaguar in October 1995 and in the subsequent months were concerned chiefly with laying off the entire Jaguar development team and liquidating its entire inventory of Jaguar products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Stop Press: Ashes to Ashes... |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 1996, Atari Corporation merged with [[JT Storage|JTS, Inc.]] in a [[reverse takeover]],&lt;ref name=&quot;jtmerger&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml | title=Atari and JT Storage Reorganisation Plan | publisher=One Cle | accessdate=November 25, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061209123854/http://contracts.onecle.com/atari/jt.mer.1996.04.08.shtml| archivedate= December 9, 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus forming JTS Corporation. As a result, Atari all but vanished from the consumer gaming market for good.

After the Atari/JTS merger, the bulk of the remaining Jaguar inventory remained unsold; on December 23, 1996, JTS Corporation finally moved all of the Jaguar's pallets out to Tiger Software, a private [[Liquidation|liquidator]], for $20 each console with software products sold for $1.00 apiece. By the end of 1997, however, JTS quickly found itself out of money. On February 23, 1998, the company sold the [[Atari|Atari brand]] and all Atari-related assets, including the Jaguar, to [[Hasbro Interactive]] for $5 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;atarigoestohasbro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-goes-to-hasbro/1100-2462915/ | title=Atari goes to Hasbro | publisher=GameSpot | date=April 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. JTS would later declare itself [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]] - and [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|out of business]] - on February 28, 1999.

==Technical issues==
===Hardware Bugs===
The Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's [[memory controller]], which prevented code execution out of system [[Random-access memory|RAM]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Less severe defects included a buggy [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. Atari's Leonard Tramiel also specifically suggested that the 68000 not be used by developers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atariowlproject.blogspot.com/2009/10/atari-jaguar-homebrew-whats-this-lay.html |title=What's this &quot;Lay off the 68k&quot; and &quot;GPU in Main&quot; Malarkey? (TECHNICAL) |author=Joe Venor |publisher=The Owl Project |date=2009 |accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic due to the greater developer familiarity with the 68000, bugs that made using the custom chips difficult, lacking developer support tools (particularly early on), and the adequacy of the 68000 for certain types of games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owl&quot;/&gt;

===Bit count controversy===
Atari tried to play down competing consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only &quot;64-bit&quot; system. This claim is questioned by some, because the ([[Motorola 68000]]) [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the &quot;Tom&quot; [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] executes a 32-bit instruction-set, but sends control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors. Atari's reasoning that the 32-bit &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Jerry&quot; chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', which commented that &quot;If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Hot Number: 112|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=71|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=June 1995|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', while giving a mostly negative review of the Jaguar, maintained that it is a true 64-bit system, since the data path from the [[DRAM]] to the CPU and Tom and Jerry chips is 64 bits wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen12&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Which Game System is the Best!?|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1995|pages=36–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer. It may also be used as a graphics accelerator in more complex systems, and applied to workstation and business uses. As well as a general purpose CPU, Jaguar contains four processing units. These are the Object Processor, Graphics Processor, Blitter, and Digital Sound Processor. Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===COJAG arcade games===
[[Atari Games]] licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games. The system, named '''COJAG''' (for &quot;Coin-Op Jaguar&quot;), replaced the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] with a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]] [[R3000]]-based CPU (depending on the board version), added more RAM, a full 64-bit wide ROM bus (Jaguar ROM bus being 32-bit), and optionally a hard drive (some titles such as ''Freeze'' are ROM only). It ran the lightgun games ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' and ''[[Maximum Force]]'', which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine. Other games (''3 On 3 Basketball''; ''Fishin' Frenzy''; ''Freeze''; ''Vicious Circle'') were developed but never released.

===Atari Jaguar Duo===
The '''Atari Jaguar Duo''' was a proposed console similar to the [[TurboDuo]] and [[Sega Genesis#Variations|Genesis CDX]]. It was an attempt by [[Atari]] to combine the Atari Jaguar and [[Atari Jaguar CD]] to make a new console. A prototype model, described by journalists as resembling a [[bathroom scale]], was unveiled at the 1995 Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=WCES: The Calm Before the Storm |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the console was cancelled before production could begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Edwards |first=Benj |url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3 |title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995) - Slideshow from |magazine=PCMag.com |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the launch of the console in November 1993, Atari had announced a variety of peripherals and add-ons for the Jaguar to be released over the console's lifespan. This included a [[CD-ROM]]-based add-on console, a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up internet link]] with support for online gaming, a [[virtual reality]] headset, and an [[MPEG-2]] video card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Atari's 64-bit Jaguar Stalks the Competition|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=51|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=October 1993|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199311&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=112 | title=Atari Jaguar Unveiled—Stalks 3DO | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1993 | accessdate=28 March 2016 | pages=10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the poor sales and eventual commercial failure of the Jaguar, most of the peripherals in development were scrapped. The only peripherals and add-ons released by Atari for the Jaguar were a redesigned controller, an adapter for [[Multiplayer video game|four players]], a CD console add-on, and a link cable for [[local area network]] (LAN) gaming.

The redesigned second controller for the Jaguar, the ProController by Atari, added three more face buttons and two triggers.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPro89&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Feline Friends |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=89 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1996|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controller was created in response to the criticism of the original controller that the console came with, which was said to not possess enough buttons for fighting games in particular. Sold independently, however, it was never bundled with the system after its release. A peripheral that allowed 4 controllers to be plugged into the console was also released. Dubbed the &quot;Team Tap&quot;, it was released independently and as a bundle with ''[[White Men Can't Jump (video game)|White Men Can't Jump]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;computinghistory.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari Team Tap Multi-Player Adapter|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/34799/Atari-Team-Tap-Multi-Player-Adapter/|website=[[The Centre for Computing History]]|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Team Tap was compatible with  ''White Men Can't Jump'' and ''[[NBA Jam Tournament Edition]]'' only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Jam Tournament Edition (Jaguar) - Manual|url=https://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareID=2512|website=[[Atari Age#AtariAge (website)|AtariAge]]|publisher=[Original publisher: [[Midway Games]]]|date=February 1995|accessdate=June 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173718/http://atariage.com/manual_html_page.html?SoftwareID=2512|archive-date=April 25, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight player gameplay with the Team Tap peripheral is also possible if a second Team Tap is plugged into the second controller port on the console,&lt;ref name=&quot;computinghistory.org.uk&quot;/&gt; but neither of the compatible games supports eight players.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPro89&quot;/&gt; Local area network multiplayer gameplay was achieved through the use of the Jaglink Interface, which allowed two Jaguar consoles to be linked together&lt;ref name=&quot;GPro89&quot;/&gt; through a modular extension and a [[Twisted pair#Unshielded twisted pair|UTP]] phone cable. The Jaglink was compatible with three games: ''[[AirCars]]'', ''[[BattleSphere]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.

In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it had partnered with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled, but not before an estimated 100 units were produced. The Jaguar Voice Modem or JVM, as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is ''[[Ultra Vortek]]''; the modem is initialized in the ''Ultra Vortek'' start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vinciguerra|first=Robert|title=A Complete History of Online Console Gaming in the United States|url=http://www.revrob.com/sci-a-tech-topmenu-52/38-a-complete-history-of-online-console-gaming-in-the-united-states|work=The Rev.

The Atari Jaguar CD is an add-on to the Jaguar that made use of [[CD-ROM]]s to distribute games. It was released in September 1995, two years after the Jaguar's launch. Twelve games were released for the system during its manufacturing lifetime, with more being made later by [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] developers. Each Jaguar CD unit came with a [[Virtual Light Machine]], which displayed light patterns corresponding to music, if the user inserts an audio CD into the console. It was developed by [[Jeff Minter]], who had created the program after experimenting with graphics during the development of ''[[Tempest 2000]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minter|first1=Jeff|title=VLM - History|url=http://www.minotaurproject.co.uk/vlm.php|publisher=[[Jeff Minter|Llamasoft]]|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was deemed a spiritual successor to the [[Atari Video Music]], a system which served a similar purpose, released in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J.

An additional accessory for the Jaguar CD, which allowed Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games, was also released.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPro89&quot;/&gt; Known as the Memory Track, it was a cartridge that contained a 128&amp;nbsp;K [[EEPROM]], and was to be inserted into the cartridge slot on the Jaguar CD while the user played a Jaguar CD game. The program manager for the Memory Track is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari Memory Track - User Manual|url=http://kick-ass.asuscomm.com/html/library/documents/mt.pdf|publisher=[[Atari Corporation]]|date=1995|accessdate=June 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193646/http://kick-ass.asuscomm.com/html/library/documents/mt.pdf|archive-date=May 9, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were plans to make a second model of the Jaguar console that combined both the Jaguar and the Jaguar CD into one unit, a la the [[TurboDuo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Mowatt|title=Atari to Unleash New Jaguar CD and Jaguar III|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=70|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1995|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally codenamed the Jaguar III, and later the Jaguar Duo, the proposed model was scrapped after the discontinuation of the Jaguar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Benj|url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/264435/10-unreleased-video-game-consoles/3|title=10 Unreleased Video Game Consoles - Atari Jaguar Duo (1995)|website=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis|Ziff Davis LLC]]|date=May 14, 2011|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jaguar VR===
A [[virtual reality]] headset compatible with the console, tentatively titled the Jaguar VR, was unveiled by Atari at the 1995 Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Iida|first1=Keita|last2=Goldberg|first2=Marty|title=Atari Jaguar VR Headset|url=http://www.atarihq.com/museum/jaglynx/jagvr.html|website=AGH Museum|publisher=Atari Gaming Headquarters|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the peripheral was a response to [[Nintendo]]'s virtual reality console, the [[Virtual Boy]], which had been announced the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetvb.com/modules/advertising/?r17|title=Nintendo introduces video game players to three-dimensional worlds with new virtual reality video game system|publisher=[[Business Wire]] / Planet Virtual Boy|date=November 14, 1994|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headset was developed in cooperation with [[Virtuality (gaming)|Virtuality]], who had previously created many virtual reality [[arcade game|arcade systems]], and was already developing a similar headset for practical purposes, named [[Virtuality (gaming)#Project Elysium|Project Elysium]], for [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dye|first1=Lee|title=The Cutting Edge: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION : Virtual Reality Applications Expand : Imaging: Technology is finding important places in medicine, engineering and many other realms.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-22/business/fi-34851_1_virtual-reality|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 22, 1995|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peripheral was targeted for a commercial release before Christmas 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=&quot;Quartermann&quot;|title=Gaming Gossip|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=70|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1995|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the deal with Virtuality was abandoned in October 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=1995: The Calm Before the Storm?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Clint|title=Jaguar VR|url=http://jagcube.atari.org/jaguarvr.html|website=JagCube |publisher=Atari.org|accessdate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Atari's merger with [[JT Storage|JTS]] in 1996, all prototypes of the headset were allegedly destroyed. However, two working units, one low-resolution prototype with red and grey-colored graphics and one high-resolution prototype with blue and grey-colored graphics, have since been recovered, and are regularly showcased at [[retrogaming]]-themed conventions and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incredibly Rare Working Prototype 'Atari Jaguar Virtual Reality Headset' Hardware Surfaces On eBay|url=http://www.retrocollect.com/News/incredibly-rare-working-prototype-atari-jaguar-virtual-reality-headset-hardware-surfaces-on-ebay.html|website=RetroCollect|date=January 23, 2015|accessdate=June 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323200514/http://www.retrocollect.com/News/incredibly-rare-working-prototype-atari-jaguar-virtual-reality-headset-hardware-surfaces-on-ebay.html|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plafke|first1=James|title=Atari Jaguar had a VR headset?!

===Unlicensed peripherals===
An unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar dubbed the &quot;Catbox&quot; was released by the [[Rockford, Illinois]] company ICD. It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, in the second quarter of 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Jaguar's Cat Box|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=69|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1994|pages=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not actually released until mid-1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPro83&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=No Litterbox|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=83|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1995|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions. These are audio, video, and communications. It features six output formats, three for audio ([[Line level|line level stereo]], RGB monitor, [[Headphones|headphone]] jack with volume control) and three for video ([[Composite video|composite]], [[S-Video]], and [[Component video|RGB analog component video]]) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time. It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and [[RS-232]] as well as [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multiplayer games either directly or with modems. The ICD CatBox features a polished stainless steel casing&lt;ref name=&quot;GPro83&quot;/&gt; and red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity. An [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM AT]]-type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together.&lt;ref&gt;Official CatBox Manual - Final Version 1.01c - May 8, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.

An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for [[MSN TV|WebTV]] access was revealed in 1998; one prototype is known to exist.

==Reception==
[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|The original controller.]]
Reviewing the Jaguar just a few weeks prior to its launch, ''[[GamePro]]'' gave it a &quot;thumbs sideways&quot;. They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as [[Capcom]] was a bad sign. They concluded that &quot;Like the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], the Jaguar is a risky investment – just not quite as expensive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=System Shopper|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=63|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1993|pages=46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jaguar won ''[[GameFan]]'''s &quot;Best New System&quot; award for 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=GameFan's 2nd Annual Megawards|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamefanVolume2Issue02/GamefanVolume2Issue02February1994#page/n57/mode/2up|magazine=[[GameFan]]|issue=Volume 2, Issue 2|publisher=Shinno Media|date=January 1994|page=58|quote=Best New System: Winner: The Atari Jaguar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small size and poor quality of the Jaguar's game library became the most commonly cited reason for its failure in the marketplace. The pack-in game ''[[Cybermorph]]'', despite being an impressive polygonal game for its time, was criticized for design flaws and a weak color palette, and compared unfavorably with the SNES's ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]''. Other early releases like ''[[Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy]]'', ''[[Raiden (video game)|Raiden]]'', and ''[[Evolution: Dino Dudes]]'' also received poor reviews, the latter two for failing to take full advantage of the Jaguar's hardware.  Jaguar did eventually earn praise with titles such as ''[[Tempest 2000]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', and ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/history.html Atari Jaguar History]''. [[AtariAge]]. Retrieved December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The most successful title during the Jaguar's first year was ''[[Alien vs Predator (Jaguar game)|Alien vs. Predator]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Atari Corporation 1994 annual report, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Alien vs. Predator'' and ''Tempest 2000'' were named among the system's defining titles by ''GamePro'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;/&gt; However, these occasional successes were seen as insufficient while the Jaguar's competitors were receiving a continual stream of critically acclaimed software; ''GamePro'' concluded their rave review of ''Alien vs. Predator'' by remarking &quot;If Atari can turn out a dozen more games like AvP, Jaguar owners could truly rest easy and enjoy their purchase.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=ProReview: Alien vs. Predator|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=75|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1994|pages=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a late 1995 review of the Jaguar, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' commented that &quot;thus far, Atari has spectacularly failed to deliver on the software side, leaving many to question the actual quality and capability of the hardware. With only one or two exceptions – ''Tempest 2000'' is cited most frequently – there have just been no truly great games for the Jaguar up to now.&quot; They further noted that while Atari is well known by older gamers, the company had much less overall [[brand recognition]] than Sega, Sony, Nintendo, or even The 3DO Company. However, they argued that with its low price point, the Jaguar might still compete if Atari could improve the software situation. They gave the system two out of five stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGen12&quot;/&gt; With such a small library of games&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history?slide=28&amp;slideView=7|title=Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming|accessdate=March 23, 2008|author=Greg Orlando|date=May 15, 2007|work=[[Wired (website)|Wired News]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience. Digital Spy commented: &quot;Like many failed hardware ventures, it still maintains something of a cult following but can only be considered a misstep for Atari.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Langshaw. &quot;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a453849/atari-retrospective-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-gaming-giant.html Atari retrospective: The rise and fall of a gaming giant]&quot;. ''Digital Spy'', January 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris rated the standard Jaguar controller as the worst game controller ever, criticizing the unwarranted recycling of the 1980s &quot;phone keypad&quot; format and the small number of action buttons, which he found particularly unwise given that Atari was actively trying to court fighting game fans to the system.&lt;ref name =harris&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html|website=IGN|accessdate=August 7, 2009|date=February 21, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114141120/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html|archive-date=January 14, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Semrad of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that many Jaguar games gratuitously used all of the controller's phone keypad buttons, making the controls much more difficult than they needed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Syndicate|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=69|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=April 1995|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro''{{'}}s The Watch Dog remarked, &quot;The controller usually doesn't use the keypad, and for games that use the keypad extensively (''Alien vs. Predator'', ''Doom''), a keypad overlay is used to minimize confusion.

On May 14, 1999, [[Hasbro]] declared the Atari Jaguar an open platform by announcing that it had released all rights to the console,&lt;ref name=&quot;hasbro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atariage.com/Jaguar/archives/HasbroRights.html | title=Hasbro Releases Jaguar Publishing Rights | publisher=Hasbro Interactive | accessdate=May 14, 2008 | quote=Beverly, MA (May 14, 1999) – Leading entertainment software publisher, Hasbro Interactive announced today it has released all rights that it may have to the vintage Atari hardware platform, the Jaguar.}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus opening the doors for [[homebrew (video games)|extensive homebrew development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;redundant&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Goss | first = Patrick | title = Redundant gadgets (Atari Jaguar entry) | url=http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=6171299&amp;imageindex=5  | accessdate = October 23, 2007| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011200651/http://tech.uk.msn.com/features/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=6171299&amp;imageindex=5 | archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few developers, including [[Telegames]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Tidbits... | magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] | issue=94 | publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] | date=May 1997 | page=24 | quote=Atari Jaguar game maker Telegames refuses to desert loyal owners of the 64-Bit machine ... and remains the lone third-party publisher. The company has six new games in the works, according to its online site ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Songbird Productions, released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past and several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.

===Game sells the Jaguar in the UK===
In the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets. The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and software prices ranged between £9.99 for more common games such as ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Ruiner Pinball]]'', and £39.99 for more sought-after releases such as ''[[Defender 2000]]'' and ''[[Checkered Flag (1994 video game)|Checkered Flag]]''. The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Molds moving everywhere===
Eventually, the molding plates for the Jaguar's console and cartridge casing had moved from one point to another.

In 1997, Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, purchased the molds from JTS. As with minor modification, the console molds were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Atari Jaguar Revived As Dental Camera | date = January 1, 2010 | work = 1UP | url = http://www.1up.com/news/atari-jaguar-revived-dental-camera | accessdate = October 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the cartridge molds being reused to create an optional memory expansion card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HotRod | publisher = Imagin | url = http://www.imaginsystems.com/Graphics/HotRod%20DS-final.pdf | accessdate = October 24, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101117020347/http://www.imaginsystems.com/Graphics/HotRod%20DS-final.pdf | archive-date = November 17, 2010 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the molds were purchased from Imagin Systems by Mike Kennedy, owner of the [[Kickstarter]] funded ''Retro Videogame Magazine'', to propose a new crowdfunded video game console called the ''[[Chameleon (video game console)|Retro VGS]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrovgs.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703182244/http://www.retrovgs.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-07-03|title=Home|date=2015-07-03|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; later rebranded the ''Coleco Chameleon''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.retrovgs.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114164829/http://www.retrovgs.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2016-01-14|title=Home|date=2016-01-14|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; after entering a licensing agreement with [[Coleco]]. The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and Kennedy described their acquisition as &quot;the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrovgs.com/media.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729185157/http://www.retrovgs.com/media.html |archivedate=July 29, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was terminated in March 2016 following criticism of Kennedy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-05-coleco-chameleon-boss-i-am-officially-tabling-the-console-venture-for-good|title=Coleco Chameleon boss: &quot;I am officially tabling the console venture for good&quot;|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=2016-04-05|website=Eurogamer|language=en-UK|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doubts regarding demand for the proposed console. Two &quot;prototypes&quot; were discovered to be fakes and Coleco withdrew from the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/03/coleco_removes_its_name_from_the_chameleon_console_but_aims_to_produce_new_products_in_the_future|title=Coleco Removes Its Name From The Chameleon Console, But Aims To Produce &quot;New Products&quot; In The Future|last=Life|first=Nintendo|date=2016-03-09|newspaper=Nintendo Life|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the project's termination, the molds have since been sold to Albert Yarusso, the founder of [[AtariAge|the AtariAge website]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/247145-coleco-chameleon-hardware-speculations/?p=3484385|title=Coleco Chameleon .... hardware speculations? - Page 318 - Modern Gaming|newspaper=AtariAge Forums|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
