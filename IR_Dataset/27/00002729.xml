'''Arthur J. Stone''' (1847–1938), a leading American silversmith, was born, trained and worked in [[Sheffield]], England, and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], before travelling to the United States in 1884. He was one of the last silversmiths in America to train apprentices to carry out designs in hand-wrought silver. In 1901, Stone set up a workshop in [[Gardner, Massachusetts|Gardner]], [[Massachusetts]] which operated under his name until its sale in 1937 to Henry Heywood. Heywood was a Gardner businessman, who renamed it The Stone Silver Shop, and later, Stone Associates. Heywood died in 1945. His sons Henry, Jr. and Jerome ran Stone Associates until 1957.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur J. Stone 1847–1938: Designer and Silversmith'' by Elenita C. Chickering, 1994, Boston Athenaeum.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the silversmiths in Arthur Stone's shop was George Porter Blanchard, father of silversmith [[Porter Blanchard]].
