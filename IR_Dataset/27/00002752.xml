'''Aspartame''' is an [[chemical synthesis|artificial]] non-[[saccharide]] [[sweeteners|sweetener]] 200 times sweeter than [[sucrose]], and is commonly used as a [[sugar substitute]] in foods and beverages.&lt;ref name=pubch/&gt; It is a [[Methyl group|methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[aspartic acid]]/[[phenylalanine]] [[dipeptide]] with the [[trade name]]s, ''NutraSweet'', ''Equal'', and ''Canderel''.&lt;ref name=pubch/&gt; Aspartame was first made in 1965 and approved for use in food products by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot;/&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Uses==

Aspartame is around 180 to 200 times as sweet as [[sucrose]] (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces {{cvt|4|kcal|kJ|0}} of energy per gram when metabolized, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;  The taste of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners differs from that of table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest to sugar's taste profile among approved artificial sweeteners.&lt;ref name=odonnell /&gt;&lt;!-- Section 6.1.2 pp. 87–88 --&gt; The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as [[acesulfame potassium]] to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2007/05/new-products-weigh-in.aspx |title=New Products Weigh In |publisher=foodproductdesign.com |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many other [[peptide]]s, aspartame may [[hydrolyze]] (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high [[pH]]. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in [[maltodextrin]]. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on [[pH]]. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its [[half-life]] is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its [[half-life]] is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as [[syrups]] for [[soda fountain|fountain beverages]], aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as [[saccharin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/mail/goodanswer/us_fountain_beverages.pdf |publisher=[[The Coca-Cola Company]] |title=Fountain Beverages in the US |date=May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320175404/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/mail/goodanswer/us_fountain_beverages.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Descriptive statistics|Descriptive analyses]] of solutions containing aspartame report a sweet aftertaste as well as bitter and off-flavor aftertastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nahon DF, Roozen JP, de Graaf C | title = Sensory evaluation of mixtures of maltitol or aspartame, sucrose and an orange aroma | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9530970 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/23.1.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In products such as [[powdered beverage]]s, the [[amine]] in aspartame can undergo a [[Maillard reaction]] with the [[aldehyde]] groups present in certain [[aroma compound]]s. The ensuing loss of both flavor and sweetness can be prevented by protecting the aldehyde as an [[acetal]].

==Safety and health effects==

The safety of aspartame has been studied since its discovery&lt;ref name=EFSAExperts&gt;{{cite web | author = EFSA National Experts | title = Report of the meetings on aspartame with national experts | publisher=EFSA | date = May 2010 | url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/zn-002 | accessdate = 9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most rigorously tested food ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Helen | name-list-format = vanc | title = Sweeteners and sugar alternatives in food technology | place = Oxford, UK | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | year = 2006 | page = 94| isbn = 978-1-4051-3434-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries,&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt; including the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cfr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.804|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 172: Food additives permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption.

A 2017 review of [[metabolism|metabolic]] effects by consuming aspartame found that it did not affect [[blood glucose]], [[insulin]], [[total cholesterol]], [[triglyceride]]s, calorie intake, or body weight, while [[high-density lipoprotein]] levels were higher.&lt;ref name=San2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santos NC, de Araujo LM, De Luca Canto G, Guerra EN, Coelho MS, Borin MF | title = Metabolic effects of aspartame in adulthood: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 58 | issue = 12 | pages = 2068–2081 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28394643 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2017.1304358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenylalanine===

High levels of the naturally occurring [[essential amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] are a health hazard to those born with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubchem&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Phenylalanine |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Phenylalanine |publisher=PubChem, National Library of Medicine, US National Institutes of Health |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=17 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because aspartame contains a small amount of phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the United States must state: &quot;Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine&quot; on product labels.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;

In the UK, foods that contain aspartame are required by the [[Food Standards Agency]] to list the substance as an ingredient, with the warning, &quot;Contains a source of phenylalanine&quot;. Manufacturers are also required to print '&quot;with sweetener(s)&quot; on the label close to the main product name on foods that contain &quot;sweeteners such as aspartame&quot; or &quot;with sugar and sweetener(s)&quot; on &quot;foods that contain both sugar and sweetener&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FSA2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.food.gov.uk/science/additives/aspartame |title=Aspartame |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=19 March 2015 |website=UK Food Standards Agency |access-date=28 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711201731/https://www.food.gov.uk/science/additives/aspartame |archivedate=11 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, foods that contain aspartame are required to list aspartame among the ingredients, include the amount of aspartame per serving, and state that the product contains phenylalanine.&lt;ref name=&quot;hc2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Mandatory Labelling of Sweeteners |url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/requirements-and-guidance/labelling/industry/sweeteners/eng/1387749708758/1387750396304?chap=2 |publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Health Canada |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenylalanine is one of the [[essential amino acid]]s and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life.&lt;ref name=pubchem/&gt; Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in [[neurotransmitter]] levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters to each other in the blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns,&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt; and while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function.&lt;ref name=pubchem/&gt; As with methanol and aspartic acid, common foods in the typical diet such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption.&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt;

=== Neurological and psychiatric symptoms ===

Numerous allegations have been made via the Internet and in consumer magazines purporting neurotoxic effects of aspartame leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as [[seizures]], [[headache]]s, and [[Mood swing|mood changes]].&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; Review of the biochemistry of aspartame has found no evidence that low doses consumed would plausibly lead to neurotoxic effects.&lt;ref name=Lathja&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Lajtha A | title =Aspartame consumption: lack of effects on neural function |journal=The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry| volume =5 |issue=6|pages=266–83 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0955-2863(94)90032-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Comprehensive reviews have not found any evidence for aspartame as a cause for these symptoms.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSAExperts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt; A review of studies on children did not show any significant findings for safety concerns with regard to neuropsychiatric conditions such as [[panic attack]]s, mood changes, [[hallucination]]s, [[ADHD]], or seizures by consuming aspartame.&lt;ref name=PediatricsReview/&gt;

===Headaches===

Headaches are the most common symptom reported by consumers.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; While one small review noted aspartame is likely one of many dietary triggers of [[migraine]]s, in a list that includes &quot;cheese, chocolate, [[Citrus|citrus fruits]], [[hot dog]]s, [[monosodium glutamate]], aspartame, fatty foods, [[ice cream]], [[caffeine withdrawal]], and alcoholic drinks, especially [[red wine]] and beer,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Millichap-2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Millichap JG, Yee MM | title = The diet factor in pediatric and adolescent migraine | journal = Pediatric Neurology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12657413 | doi = 10.1016/S0887-8994(02)00466-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived sweetness of aspartame (and other sweet substances like [[acesulfame K]]) in humans is due to its binding of the heterodimer G-protein coupled receptor formed by the proteins [[TAS1R2]] and [[TAS1R3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li X, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title = Human receptors for sweet and umami taste | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 4692–6 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11917125 | pmc = 123709 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.072090199 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.4692L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metabolites ===

Aspartame is rapidly [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] in the [[small intestine]]s. Even with ingestion of very high doses of aspartame (over 200&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), no aspartame is found in the blood due to the rapid breakdown.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into residual components, including [[aspartic acid]], [[phenylalanine]], [[methanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts HJ | title = Aspartame disease: a possible cause for concomitant Graves' disease and pulmonary hypertension | journal = Texas Heart Institute Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 105; author reply 105–6 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15061638 | pmc = 387446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further breakdown products including [[formaldehyde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trocho C, Pardo R, Rafecas I, Virgili J, Remesar X, Fernández-López JA, Alemany M | title = Formaldehyde derived from dietary aspartame binds to tissue components in vivo | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 63 | issue = 5 | pages = 337–49 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9714421 | doi = 10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00282-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[formic acid]]. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartame. In some [[fruit juice]]s, ''higher'' concentrations of methanol can be found than the amount produced from aspartame in beverages.&lt;ref name=stegink1987 /&gt;

Aspartame's major decomposition products are its [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] [[dipeptide]] (in a [[2,5-Diketopiperazine|2,5-diketopiperazine]], or DKP, form), the non-esterified dipeptide (aspartylphenylalanine), and its constituent components, [[phenylalanine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Prodolliet-&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prodolliet J, Bruelhart M | title = Determination of aspartame and its major decomposition products in foods | journal = Journal of AOAC International | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 275–82 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8471853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[aspartic acid]],&lt;ref name=stegink1987&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stegink LD | title = The aspartame story: a model for the clinical testing of a food additive | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 46 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 204–15 | date = July 1987 | pmid = 3300262 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/46.1.204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin-2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin SY, Cheng YD | title = Simultaneous formation and detection of the reaction product of solid-state aspartame sweetener by FT-IR/DSC microscopic system | journal = Food Additives and Contaminants | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 821–7 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11103265 | doi = 10.1080/026520300420385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 180&amp;nbsp;°C, aspartame undergoes decomposition to form a diketopiperazine derivative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rastogi-2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rastogi S, Zakrzewski M, Suryanarayanan R | title = Investigation of solid-state reactions using variable temperature X-ray powder diffractrometry.

====Aspartate====

Aspartic acid (aspartate) is one of the most common [[amino acid]]s in the typical diet. As with methanol and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. There has been some speculation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olney JW | title = Excitotoxic food additives--relevance of animal studies to human safety | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 455–62 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6152304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rycerz K, Jaworska-Adamu JE | title = Effects of aspartame metabolites on astrocytes and neurons | journal = Folia Neuropathologica | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–7 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23553132 | doi = 10.5114/fn.2013.34191 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that aspartame, in conjunction with other amino acids like [[glutamate]], may lead to [[excitotoxicity]], inflicting damage on brain and nerve cells. However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects,&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt;

====Methanol====

The [[methanol]] produced by the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into [[formaldehyde]] and then completely oxidized to [[formic acid]]. The methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons.  Fruit juices and citrus fruits contain methanol, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] beverages and the amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from these and other sources that are already in people's diets.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid,&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic.&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt;

==Chemistry==

Aspartame is a [[Methyl group|methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the natural [[amino acid]]s &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[aspartic acid]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[phenylalanine]].&lt;ref name=pubch/&gt; Under strongly [[acid]]ic or [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] conditions, aspartame may generate [[methanol]] by [[hydrolysis]]. Under more severe conditions, the [[peptide bond]]s are also [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]], resulting in free amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;

In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is [[protective group|protected]] with a [[formyl group]] as the formamide, by treatment of aspartic acid with a mixture of formic acid and acetic anhydride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|title=Process for producing N-formylamino acid and use thereof|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040137559A1/en|country=US|number=20040137559A|issue-date=2003-10-20|access-date=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the ''N''-formyl aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid anhydride links to phenylalanine, with desired and undesired isomer forming in a 4:1 ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chemistryviews.org/details/ezine/9138171/The_Saccharin_Saga__Part_6.html|title=The Saccharin Saga – Part 6 :: ChemViews Magazine :: ChemistryViews|website=chemistryviews.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process using an [[Thermolysin|enzyme from ''Bacillus thermoproteolyticus'']] to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yagasaki M, Hashimoto S | title = Synthesis and application of dipeptides; current status and perspectives | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18795289 | doi = 10.1007/s00253-008-1590-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intake==

The [[acceptable daily intake]] (ADI) value for aspartame, as well as other food additives studied, is defined as the &quot;amount of a food additive, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk.&quot;&lt;ref name=WHO1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = WHO | title = Principles for the safety assessment of food additives and contaminants in food | journal = Environmental Health Criteria 70 | year = 1987 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc70.htm | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035319/http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc70.htm | archivedate = 30 April 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives]] (JECFA) and the [[European Commission|European Commission's]] [[Scientific Committee on Food]] has determined this value is 40&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of body weight for aspartame,&lt;ref name=Renwick&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Renwick AG | title = The intake of intense sweeteners - an update review | journal = Food Additives and Contaminants | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 327–38 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16546879 | doi = 10.1080/02652030500442532 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00577562/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; while FDA has set its ADI for aspartame at 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=NCIFAQ&gt;{{cite web | title = Aspartame and Cancer: Questions and Answers | publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] | date = 12 September 2006 | url = http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/AspartameQandA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212130028/http://cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/AspartameQandA|archivedate=12 February 2009|accessdate = 29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for exposure to aspartame in the United States is diet [[soft drink]]s, though it can be consumed in other products, such as pharmaceutical preparations, fruit drinks, and chewing gum among others in smaller quantities.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt; A 12 US fluid ounce (355 ml) can of diet soda contains {{convert|0.18|g|oz}} of aspartame, and for a {{convert|75|kg|lb|abbr=on}} adult, it takes approximately 21 cans of diet soda daily to consume the {{convert|3.75|g|oz}} of aspartame that would surpass the FDA's 50&amp;nbsp;milligrams per kilogram of body weight ADI of aspartame from diet soda alone.&lt;ref name=NCIFAQ/&gt;

Reviews have analyzed studies which have looked at the consumption of aspartame in countries worldwide, including the United States, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSAExperts/&gt;&lt;ref name=Butchko/&gt;&lt;ref name=Renwick/&gt; Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of aspartame such as children and diabetics are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption.&lt;ref name=Magnuson/&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSAExperts/&gt;

In a report released on 10 December 2013, the EFSA said that, after an extensive examination of evidence, it ruled out the &quot;potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer,&quot; and deemed the amount found in diet sodas an amount safe to consume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aspartame in Soda is Safe: European Review|url=http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/Health-News/artificial-sweeteners-aspartame-food-safety-diet-soft-drinks/2013/12/10/id/541046|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=16 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217041236/http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/Health-News/artificial-sweeteners-aspartame-food-safety-diet-soft-drinks/2013/12/10/id/541046|archivedate=17 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for [[Searle (company)|G.D. Searle &amp; Company]]. Schlatter had [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone [[gastrin]], for use in assessing an anti-[[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] drug candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mazur |first= Robert H. |editor1-last= Inglett |editor1-first= George E. |name-list-format= vanc |title= Symposium: sweeteners |year= 1974 |publisher= AVI Publishing |location= Westport, CT |isbn= 978-0-87055-153-6 |lccn= 73-94092 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/symposiumsweeten0000unse/page/159 159–163] |chapter= Aspartic acid-based sweeteners |url= https://archive.org/details/symposiumsweeten0000unse/page/159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper.&lt;ref name=Magnuson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magnuson BA, Burdock GA, Doull J, Kroes RM, Marsh GM, Pariza MW, Spencer PS, Waddell WJ, Walker R, Williams GM | title = Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies | journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology | volume = 37 | issue = 8 | pages = 629–727 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17828671 | doi = 10.1080/10408440701516184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-632-04452-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Ricki | name-list-format = vanc |title=Discovery: windows on the life sciences |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2001 |page=4 |isbn=978-0-632-04452-8 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazur, R.H.

In 1975, prompted by issues regarding [[Flagyl]] and [[Aldactone]], a U.S. FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported &quot;serious deficiencies in Searle's operations and practices&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot; /&gt; The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot; /&gt;

In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and [[brain cancer]]. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause [[Human brain|brain]] damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. GAO – HRD-87-46 Food and Drug Administration: Food Additive Approval Process Followed for Aspartame, 18 June 1987 |issue =HRD-87-46 |accessdate =5 September 2008 | url = http://www.gao.gov/docdblite/info.php?rptno=HRD-87-46|date =1987-07-17 |last1 =Office |first1 =U.

Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The European Commission [[Scientific Committee on Food]] reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002.

==Commercial uses==

Under the trade names [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]], [[NutraSweet]], and [[Canderel]], aspartame is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, [[instant coffee]]s, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt. It is provided as a table [[condiment]] in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for [[baking]] than other sweeteners, because it [[chemical decomposition|breaks down]] when heated and loses much of its sweetness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130717-sugar-substitutes-nutrasweet-splenda-stevia-baking/|title=How Sugar Substitutes Stack Up|date=2013-07-17|website=National Geographic News|access-date=2019-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Struck|first=Susanne|last2=Jaros|first2=Doris|last3=Brennan|first3=Charles S.|last4=Rohm|first4=Harald|date=2014|title=Sugar replacement in sweetened bakery goods|journal=International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology|language=en|volume=49|issue=9|pages=1963–1976|doi=10.1111/ijfs.12617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of industrial synthesis of aspartame were established by Ajinomoto.&lt;ref name=odonnell /&gt; In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which [[Ajinomoto]], the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40 percent share, was 14,000 metric tons a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2 percent a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1rBnsdDJnM8 |title=Ajinomoto May Exceed Full-Year Forecasts on Amino Acid Products – Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=23 June 2010 |date=18 November 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130620035625/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1rBnsdDJnM8 |archivedate=20 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from [[Monsanto]] for $67M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2000/06/05/114953/sweetener-sale.html |title=Sweetener sale-05/06/2000-ECN |publisher=icis.com |accessdate=9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British supermarket chain [[Asda]], part of [[Wal-Mart]], for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the substance was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other &quot;nasties&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;asda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=441128&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=Asda gears up for additives battle/ aspartame |work=Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2010 |quote=This is Money }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, a British court found in favour of Asda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Products-Marketing/Asda-claims-victory-in-aspartame-nasty-case |title=Asda claims victory in aspartame 'nasty' case |publisher=foodanddrinkeurope.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103050234/http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Products-Marketing/Asda-claims-victory-in-aspartame-nasty-case |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodbev.com/news/court-of-appeal-rules-in-ajinomotoasda-aspartame-case |title=FoodBev.com |publisher=foodbev.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 |quote=Court of Appeal rules in Ajinomoto/Asda aspartame case |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015104/http://www.foodbev.com/news/court-of-appeal-rules-in-ajinomotoasda-aspartame-case |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |date=2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asda said that it would continue to use the term &quot;no nasties&quot; on its own-label products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle |title=Radical new twist in Ajinomoto vs Asda 'nasty' battle |publisher=foodnavigator.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100606185621/http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle| archivedate= 6 June 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the suit was settled in 2011 with Asda choosing to remove references to aspartame from its packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Asda settles 'nasty' aspartame legal battle with Ajinomoto |first= Ben |last= Bouckley |name-list-format= vanc |url= http://www.foodnavigator.com/Financial-Industry/Asda-settles-nasty-aspartame-legal-battle-with-Ajinomoto |agency= FoodNavigator.com |publisher= William Reed Business Media SAS |date= 18 May 2011 |accessdate= 18 July 2011 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110731051352/http://www.foodnavigator.com/Financial-Industry/Asda-settles-nasty-aspartame-legal-battle-with-Ajinomoto |archivedate= 31 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holland Sweetener Company===

A joint venture of [[DSM (company)|DSM]] and [[Tosoh]], the Holland Sweetener Company manufactured aspartame using the enzymatic process developed by Toyo Soda (Tosoh) and sold as the brand Sanecta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lee |first= Thomas D. | name-list-format = vanc |title= Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |edition= 5th |volume= 24 |year= 2007 |publisher= Wiley |isbn= 978-0-471-48496-7 |pages= 224–252 |chapter= Sweetners |doi=10.1002/0471238961.19230505120505.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, they developed a combination [[aspartame-acesulfame salt]] under the brand name Twinsweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Holland Sweetener rolls out Twinsweet |url= http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Processing-Packaging/Holland-Sweetener-rolls-out-Twinsweet |accessdate= 29 July 2011 |newspaper= BakeryAndSnacks.com |publisher= William Reed Business Media |date= 19 November 2003 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110929113951/http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Processing-Packaging/Holland-Sweetener-rolls-out-Twinsweet |archivedate= 29 September 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They left the sweetener industry in late 2006, because &quot;global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years&quot;, making the business &quot;persistently unprofitable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/06/9999999997-06-013522 &quot;Holland Sweetener Company to exit from aspartame business&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507075849/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/06/9999999997-06-013522 |date=7 May 2013 }}.

===Competing products===

Because [[sucralose]], unlike aspartame, retains its sweetness after being heated, and has at least twice the shelf life of aspartame, it has become more popular as an ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/22/business/a-something-among-the-sweet-nothings.html|title=A Something Among the Sweet Nothings; Splenda Is Leaving Other Sugar Substitutes With That Empty Feeling|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Melanie|last=Warner|name-list-format=vanc|date=22 December 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421130808/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6DC1030F931A15751C1A9629C8B63|archivedate=21 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to sucralose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = John Schmeltzer | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-12-02/business/0412020391_1_splenda-merisant-worldwide-equal | title = Equal fights to get even as Splenda looks sweet | work = Chicago Tribune | date = 2 December 2004 | accessdate = 4 July 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101204063027/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-12-02/business/0412020391_1_splenda-merisant-worldwide-equal | archivedate = 4 December 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Carney | first = Beth | title = It's Not All Sweetness for Splenda | work = BusinessWeek: Daily Briefing | accessdate =5 September 2008 | date = 19 January 2005 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2005/nf20050119_5391_db014.htm | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081007062929/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2005/nf20050119_5391_db014.htm| archivedate= 7 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30/kg and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beveragedaily.com/Markets/Aspartame-defence-courts-reaction |title=Aspartame defence courts reaction |publisher=beveragedaily.com |date=7 October 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707231126/http://www.beveragedaily.com/Markets/Aspartame-defence-courts-reaction |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
