'''Abergavenny''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|b|ər|ɡ|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|n|i}}; {{lang-cy|Y Fenni}} {{IPA-cy|ə ˈvɛnɪ|pron}}, archaically ''Abergafenni'' meaning &quot;Mouth of the [[River Gavenny]]&quot;) is a [[market town]] and [[Community (Wales)|community]] in [[Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]].

Originally the site of a [[Castra|Roman fort]], [[Gobannium]], it became a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Defensive wall|walled town]] within the [[Welsh Marches]]. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone [[castle]] built soon after the [[Norman invasion of Wales|Norman conquest of Wales]].

Abergavenny is situated at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Usk]] and a [[tributary]] stream, the Gavenny.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abergavenny |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/29 29] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost entirely surrounded by mountains and hills: the [[Blorenge]] ({{convert|559|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}),&lt;ref&gt;Geograph British Isles – [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/498684 The Blorenge from the B4598 road at Ty'r-pwll]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sugar Loaf Mountain, Wales|Sugar Loaf]],({{convert|596|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), [[Ysgyryd Fawr]] (Great Skirrid), [[Ysgyryd Fach]] (Little Skirrid), Deri, Rholben and Mynydd Llanwenarth, known locally as &quot;[[Llanwenarth]] Breast&quot;.

In the UK 2011 census, the six relevant wards (Lansdown, Grofield, [[Castle (Abergavenny ward)|Castle]], Croesonen, Cantref and [[Priory (Abergavenny ward)|Priory]]) collectively listed Abergavenny's population as 12,515.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/lansdown-w05000804#sthash.HygKHVZV.dpbs|title=Lansdown - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/grofield-w05000803#sthash.HOTIDnyK.dpbs|title=Grofield - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/castle-w05000794#sthash.knocoV1p.dpbs|title=Castle - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/croesonen-w05000795#sthash.XmKkhauU.dpbs|title=Croesonen - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/cantref-w05000793#sthash.j9V632qF.dpbs|title=Cantref - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/priory-w05000818#sthash.ycr8FMLn.dpbs|title=Priory - UK Census Data 2011|first=Good Stuff IT|last=Services|date=|website=UK Census Data|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town hosted the 2016 [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]].

==Toponymy==
The town derives its name from a [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] word ''Gobannia'' meaning &quot;river of the blacksmiths&quot;, and relates to the town's pre-Roman importance in iron [[smelting|smelt]]ing. The name is related to the modern Welsh word ''gof'' ([[blacksmith]]), and so is also associated with the Welsh smith [[Gofannon]] from folklore. The river later became, in Welsh, ''Gafenni'', and the town's name became ''Abergafenni'', meaning &quot;mouth of (Welsh: ''Aber'') the Gavenny (''Gafenni'')&quot;.  In Welsh, the shortened form ''Y Fenni'' may have come into use after about the 15th century, and is now used as the Welsh name. Abergavenny, the English spelling, is in general use.&lt;ref&gt;Hywel Wyn Owen, ''The Place-Names of Wales'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-7083-1458-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Roman period ===
Gobannium was a Roman fort guarding the road along the valley of the River Usk,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; which linked the legionary fortress of [[Burrium]] ([[Usk]]) and later [[Isca Augusta]] or Isca Silurum ([[Caerleon]]) in the south with [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] and [[Mid Wales]]. It was also built to keep the peace among the local [[British Iron Age]] tribe, the [[Silures]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Remains of the walls of this fort were discovered west of the castle when excavating the foundations for a new [[post office]] and [[telephone exchange]] building in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abergavennystreetsurvey.co.uk/portfolio/flannel-street/|title=Flannel Street {{!}} Abergavenny Local History Society Street Survey|website=abergavennystreetsurvey.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 11th century ===

[[File:St Mary's Priory Church, Abergavenny - geograph.org.uk - 1328170.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Priory Church]]
Abergavenny grew as a town in early [[Normans|Norman]] times under the protection of the [[Baron Bergavenny|Lords of Abergavenny]]. The first Baron was [[Hamelin de Balun]], from [[Ballon, Sarthe|Ballon]], a small town and castle in [[Maine-Anjou]] called &quot;Gateway to Maine&quot;, near [[Le Mans]], today in the [[Sarthe (département)|Sarthe département]] of France. He founded the [[Benedictine]] [[priory]], now the [[Priory Church of St Mary, Abergavenny|Priory Church of St Mary]], in the late 11th century. The Priory belonged originally to the [[Benedictine]] foundation of St. Vincent Abbaye at Le Mans. It was subsequently endowed by [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]], with a [[tithe]] of the profits of the castle and town.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abergavenny|volume=1|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church contains some unique [[alabaster]] [[Effigy|effigies]], [[church monument]]s and unique medieval wood carving, such as the [[Tree of Jesse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmarys-priory.org/stmaryschurch/monuments.php|title=HISTORIC MONUMENTS AT ST MARY'S PARISH CHURCH: St Mary's Priory, Abergavenny|website=stmarys-priory.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 12th and 13th centuries ===
Owing to its geographical location, the town was frequently embroiled in the border warfare and power play of the 12th and 13th centuries in the Welsh Marches. In 1175, [[Abergavenny Castle]] was the site of a massacre of [[Seisyll ap Dyfnwal]] and his associates by [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carradice|first1=Phil|title=Treachery, stealth and slaughter at Abergavenny Castle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/a112ee9c-43cc-3e76-bc40-4974dd1be9ae|publisher=BBC blogs|date=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reference to a market at Abergavenny is found in a charter granted to the Prior by William de Braose.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

=== 15th to 17th centuries ===
[[File:Abergavenny and Holy Mountain, Wales, 1890-1900.jpg|thumb|Abergavenny and [[Ysgyryd Fawr|Holy Mountain]] in the 1890s]]
[[Owain Glyndŵr]] attacked Abergavenny in 1404. According to popular legend, his raiders gained access to the walled town with the aid of a local woman who sympathised with the rebellion, letting a small party in via the Market Street gate at midnight. They were able to open the gate and allow a much larger party who set fire to the town and plundered its churches and homes leaving Abergavenny Castle intact. Market Street has been referred to as &quot;Traitors' Lane&quot; thereafter. In 1404 Abergavenny was declared its own nation by [[Ieuan ab Owain Glyndŵr]], illegitimate son of [[Owain Glyndŵr]]. The arrangement lasted approximately two weeks.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

At the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1541, the priory's endowment went towards the foundation of a free [[grammar school]], [[King Henry VIII Grammar School]], the site itself passing to the Gunter family.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

During the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], prior to the siege of [[Raglan Castle]] in 1645, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] visited Abergavenny and presided in person over the trial of [[Sir Trevor Williams, 1st Baronet|Sir Trefor Williams, 1st Baronet]] of [[Llangybi, Monmouthshire|Llangibby]], a [[Royalist]] who changed sides, and other [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

In 1639, Abergavenny received a [[charter]] of incorporation under the title of [[bailiff]] and [[Burgess (word)|burgesses]]. A charter with extended privileges was drafted in 1657, but appears never to have been enrolled or to have come into effect. Owing to the refusal of the chief officers of the corporation to take the [[oath of allegiance]] to [[William III of England|William III]] in 1688, the charter was annulled, and the town subsequently declined in prosperity. Chapter 28 of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542|1535 Act of Henry VIII]], which provided that Monmouth, as [[county town]], should return one burgess to Parliament, further stated that other [[Monmouthshire (historic)|ancient Monmouthshire boroughs]] were to contribute towards the payment of the member. In consequence of this clause Abergavenny on various occasions shared in the election, the last instance being in 1685.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The right to hold two weekly markets and three yearly [[fair]]s, beginning in the 13th century, was held ever since as confirmed in 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chisholm|first1=Hugh|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica:a Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature, and General Information|date=1922|publisher=New York: Encyclopaedia Britannica|pages=53|edition=11|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hgOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=The+right+to+hold+two+weekly+markets+and+three+yearly+fairs,+beginning+in+the+13th+century,+was+held+ever+since+as+confirmed+in+1657&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OWiWpAM2cI&amp;sig=_OP36PxVPm-peP0cFonfEjm1KoY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjG9Omc7MbUAhUUXGMKHZZwDs8Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20right%20to%20hold%20two%20weekly%20markets%20and%20three%20yearly%20fairs%2C%20beginning%20in%20the%2013th%20century%2C%20was%20held%20ever%20since%20as%20confirmed%20in%201657&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abergavenny was celebrated for the production of Welsh [[flannel]], and also for the manufacture, whilst the fashion prevailed, of goats' hair [[periwig]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[Abergavenny railway station]], situated southeast of the town centre, opened on 2 January 1854 as part of the [[Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway]]. The [[London North Western Railway]] sponsored the construction of the railway linking [[Newport railway station|Newport station]] to [[Hereford railway station|Hereford station]]. The line was taken over by the [[West Midland Railway]] in 1860 before becoming part of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1863. The station is on the [[Welsh Marches Line]] and is mostly served by [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/16981149.transport-for-wales-set-for-rail-network-takeover/|title=All change this weekend as Transport for Wales takes over rail network|website=South Wales Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A railway line also ran up the valley towards [[Brynmawr]] and to [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This line was closed following the [[Beeching cuts]] and the line to [[Clydach Gorge]] is now a cycle track and footpath.

The [[Baker Street drill hall, Abergavenny|Baker Street drill hall]] was completed in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drillhalls.org/TownAbergavenny.htm|title= Abergavenny|publisher=The Drill Hall Project|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]]'s deputy [[Rudolf Hess]] was kept under escort at [[Maindiff Court Hospital]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]], after his flight to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;BBC.

== Baron of Abergavenny ==
The title of [[Baron Bergavenny|Baron Abergavenny]], in the Nevill family, dates from the 15th century with [[Edward Nevill, 3rd Baron Bergavenny]], who was the youngest son of [[Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]] by his second wife [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]], daughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], first [[Duke of Lancaster]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} He married the heiress of [[Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester]], whose father had inherited the castle and estate of Abergavenny, and was summoned in 1392 to parliament as Lord Bergavenny.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Edward Nevill was summoned to parliament with this title in 1450.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} His direct male descendants ended in 1587 in [[Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny]], but a cousin, [[Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny]], was confirmed in the barony in 1604.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} From him it has descended continuously, through fifteen individuals, the title being increased to an [[earl]]dom in 1784; and in 1876 [[William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny|William Nevill]] {{sic}} 5th Earl, an indefatigable and powerful supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory Party]], was created 1st [[Marquess of Abergavenny]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Coldbrook Park was a country house in an estate some {{convert|2|km|mi|frac=4|order=flip}} southeast of the town. The house was originally built in the 14th century and belonged to the Herbert family for many generations until purchased by John Hanbury for his son, the diplomat Sir [[Charles Hanbury Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire |volume =2|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Charles reconstructed the house in 1746 with the addition of a nine-[[bay window|bay]] two-storey [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[façade]] with a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]]. It subsequently passed down in the Hanbury Williams family until it was demolished in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/36701/details/COLDBROOK+HOUSE+%28DEMOLISHED%29/|title= COLDBROOK HOUSE (DEMOLISHED)|publisher= Royal Commission on the Ancient and Histoorical Sites of Wales|accessdate= 3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Held during the first week of August every year, the [[National Eisteddfod]] is a celebration of the culture and language in Wales. The festival travels from place to place, alternating between north and south Wales, attracting around 150,000 visitors and over 250 tradestands and stalls.

== Cattle market ==
A [[cattle]] market was held in Abergavenny from 1863 to December 2013.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/10873217.end-of-an-era-as-abergavennys-livestock-market-closes/|title=End of an era as Abergavenny's livestock market closes|website=South Wales Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period 1825–1863 a [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] market was held at a site in Castle Street, to stop the sale of sheep on the streets of the town. At the time of its closure the market was leased and operated by Abergavenny Market Auctioneers Ltd, who held regular livestock auctions on the site. Market days were held on Tuesdays for the auction sale of finished sheep, cull ewe/store and fodder (hay and straw), and some Fridays for the auction sale of cattle.  Following the closure of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]'s cattle market in 2009 for redevelopment, Newport’s sales were held at Abergavenny every Wednesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/4169726.newport-cattle-market-finds-new-home/|title=Newport cattle market finds new home|website=South Wales Argus|language=en|access-date=2019-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, doubts about the future of Abergavenny Cattle Market were raised following the granting of planning permission by [[Monmouthshire County Council]] for its demolition and replacement with a supermarket, car park, and library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/4017/planning_committee_minutes_dated_14th_june_2011.pdf Minutes of the Planning Committee held at County Hall, Cwmbran on 14 June 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524065404/http://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/4017/planning_committee_minutes_dated_14th_june_2011.pdf |date=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
