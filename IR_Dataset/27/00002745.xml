Administered by India are the southern and southeastern portions, which constitute the state of Jammu and Kashmir but are slated to be split into two union territories.

To the east, Azad Kashmir is separated from the [[Indian administered Kashmir]] by the [[Line of Control]], the ''de facto'' border between India and Pakistan. Azad Kashmir has a total area of {{convert|13297|km2|sqmi}}, and a total population of 4,045,366 as per the 2017 Census.

The territory has a parliamentary form of government modelled after the [[Westminster system]], with its capital located at [[Muzaffarabad]]. The [[President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir|President]] is the constitutional head of state, while the [[Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir|Prime Minister]], supported by a Council of Ministers, is the chief executive. The unicameral [[Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly]] elects both the Prime Minister and President. The state has its own Supreme Court and a High Court, while the [[Government of Pakistan]]'s [[Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan]] serves as a link with Azad Kashmir's government, although Azad Kashmir is not represented in the [[Parliament of Pakistan]].

An [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|earthquake in 2005]] killed 100,000 people and left another three million people displaced, with widespread devastation. Since then, with help from the Government of Pakistan and foreign donors, reconstruction of infrastructure is underway. Azad Kashmir's economy largely depends on agriculture, services, tourism, and remittances sent by members of the [[British Mirpuri]] community. Nearly 87% of the households own farms in Azad Kashmir,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/48195-underdevelopment-in-ajk|title=Underdevelopment in AJK|website=www.thenews.com.pk|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the region has a literacy rate of approximately 72% and has the highest school enrollment in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/526323/education-emergency-ajk-leading-in-enrolment-lagging-in-quality/|title=Education emergency: AJK leading in enrolment, lagging in quality  – The Express Tribune|date=March 26, 2013|website=The Express Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The northern part of Azad Jammu and Kashmir encompasses the lower area of the [[Himalayas]], including Jamgarh Peak ({{convert|4734|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). However, [[Hari Parbat]] peak in [[Neelum Valley]] is the highest peak in the state.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

The region receives rainfall in both the winter and the summer. [[Muzaffarabad]] and Pattan are among the wettest areas of Pakistan. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400&amp;nbsp;mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800&amp;nbsp;mm). During the summer season, monsoon floods of the rivers [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] and [[Leepa River|Leepa]] are common due to extreme rains and snow melting.

At the time of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the British abandoned their [[suzerainty]] over the [[princely states]], which were left with the options of joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent. [[Hari Singh]], the [[maharaja]] of Jammu and Kashmir, wanted his state to remain independent.&lt;ref&gt;

In Spring 1947, an uprising against the Maharaja broke out in [[Poonch district, Pakistan|Poonch]], an area bordering the [[Rawalpindi division]] of [[West Punjab]]. Maharaja's administration is said to have started levying punitive taxes on the peasantry which provoked a local revolt and the administration resorted to brutal suppression. The area's population, swelled by recently demobilised soldiers following [[World War II]], rebelled against the Maharaja's forces and gained control of almost the entire district. Following this victory, the pro-Pakistan chieftains of the western districts of [[Muzaffarabad district|Muzaffarabad]], [[History of Poonch District|Poonch]] and [[Mirpur district|Mirpur]] proclaimed a provisional Azad Jammu and Kashmir government in Rawalpindi on October 3, 1947.{{sfn|Bose|2003|pp=32–33}}{{refn|group=note|Officially, Mirpur and Poonch districts were in the Jammu province of the state and Muzaffarabad was in the Kashmir province.

However, this government quickly fizzled out with the arrest of Anwar in Srinagar.{{sfn|Snedden|2013|p=59}} On October 24, a second provisional government of Azad Kashmir was established at [[Palandri]] under the leadership of [[Sardar Ibrahim Khan]].{{sfn|Snedden|2013|p=61}}

On October 21, several thousand [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen from [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] poured into Jammu and Kashmir to liberate it from the Maharaja's rule. They were led by experienced military leaders and were equipped with modern arms. The Maharaja's crumbling forces were unable to withstand the onslaught. The raiders captured the towns of Muzaffarabad and [[Baramulla]], the latter {{convert|20|mi}} northwest of the state capital [[Srinagar]]. On October 24, the Maharaja requested military assistance from India, which responded that it was unable to help him unless he acceded to India. Accordingly, on October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed an [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]], handing over control of defence, external affairs and communications to the Government of India in return for military aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10537286|title=Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it|date=November 23, 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian troops were immediately airlifted into Srinagar.{{sfn|Bose|2003|pp=35–36}} Pakistan intervened subsequently.&lt;ref name = britannica /&gt; Fighting ensued between the Indian and Pakistani armies, with the two areas of control more or less stabilised around what is now known as the &quot;[[Line of Control]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

India later approached the United Nations, asking it to resolve the dispute, and resolutions were passed in favour of the holding of a plebiscite with regard to Kashmir's future. However, no such plebiscite has ever been held on either side, since there was a precondition which required the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army along with the non-state elements and the subsequent partial withdrawal of the Indian Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Resolution 47&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, a formal cease-fire line separating the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir came into effect.

Following the [[Karachi Agreement|1949 cease-fire agreement]] with India, the government of Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir that it controlled at the time of cease-fire into the following two separately-controlled political entities:
* Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)&amp;nbsp;– the narrow, southern part, {{convert|250|mi|km}} long, with a width varying from {{convert|10|to|40|mi|km}}.
* [[Gilgit–Baltistan]] formerly called the [[Federally Administered Northern Areas]] (FANA)&amp;nbsp;– the much larger political entity to the north of AJK with an area of {{convert|72496|km2|sqmi}}.

At one time under Pakistani control, Kashmir's [[Trans-Karakoram Tract|Shaksgam tract]], a small region along the northeastern border of Gilgit–Baltistan, was provisionally ceded by Pakistan to the People's Republic of China in 1963 and now forms part of China's [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region.

In 1972, the then current border between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kashmir was designated as the &quot;[[Line of Control]]&quot;. This line has remained unchanged&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Pakistan - Azad Kashmir - Muzaffarabad.svg|thumb|150px|Districts of Azad Kashmir]]
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a self-governing state under Pakistani control, but under [[Constitution of Pakistan|Pakistan's constitution]], the state is informally part of the country. Pakistan is administering the region as a self-governing territory rather than incorporating it in the federation since the UN-mandated ceasefire.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/46696/Azad-Kashmir | title = Azad Kashmir | website = britannica.com | accessdate = 14 November 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajk144&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajk.gov.pk/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2257&amp;Itemid=144|title=Azad Jammu and Kashmir&amp;nbsp;– Introduction|accessdate=June 22, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000235/http://www.ajk.gov.pk/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2257&amp;Itemid=144|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Azad Kashmir has its own elected [[President (government title)|President]], [[Prime Minister]], [[Legislative Assembly]], [[High Court]], with Azam Khan as its present chief justice, and official flag.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajk.gov.pk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajk.gov.pk/history.php|title=AJ&amp;K Portal|website=ajk.gov.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azad Kashmir's financial matters, i.e., budget and tax affairs, are dealt with by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council rather than by Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council is a supreme body consisting of 14 members, 8 from the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and 6 from the government of Pakistan. Its chairman/chief executive is the prime minister of Pakistan. Other members of the council are the president and the prime minister of Azad Kashmir (or and individual nominated by her/him) and 6 members of the AJK Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajk.gov.pk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajk144&quot; /&gt; Azad Kashmir Day is celebrated in Azad Jammu and Kashmir on October 24, which is the day that the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government was created in 1947. Pakistan has celebrated [[Kashmir Solidarity Day]] on February 5 of each year since 1990 as a day of protest against [[India]]'s ''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty over its State of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/05/stories/2007020503731300.htm|title=Pakistan to observe Kashmir Solidarity Day today|date=February 5, 2007|work=The Hindu|accessdate=February 5, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; That day is a [[Public holidays in Pakistan|national holiday]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=36715 |title=Kashmir Day being observed today |date=February 5, 2008 |work=[[The News International]] |accessdate=February 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir observe the Kashmir [[Accession Day (Jammu and Kashmir)|Black Day]] on October 27 of each year since 1947 as a day of protest against military occupation in Indian controlled Jammu and Kashmir.

[[Brad Adams]] the Asia director at the U.S.-based [[NGO]] [[Human Rights Watch]] has said in 2006; &quot;Although 'azad' means 'free,' the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but, the Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir government with tight controls on basic freedoms.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Brad|title=Pakistan: 'Free Kashmir' Far From Free|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/09/20/pakistan-free-kashmir-far-free|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Christopher Snedden]] has observed that despite tight controls the people of Azad Kashmir have generally accepted whatever Pakistan has done to them, which in any case has varied little from how most Pakistanis have been treated (by Pakistan). According to [[Christopher Snedden]], one of the reasons for this was that the people of Azad Kashmir had always wanted to be a part of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snedden 2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0cPjAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT93|title=Kashmir-The Untold Story|last=Snedden|first=Christopher|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers India|year=2013|isbn=978-93-5029-898-5|page=93|quote=Second, Azad Kashmiris had always wanted to be part of this nation.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, having little to fear from a pro-Pakistan population devoid of options,&lt;ref name=&quot;Snedden 2013&quot;/&gt; Pakistan imposed its will through the Federal [[Ministry of Kashmir Affairs (Pakistan)|Ministry of Kashmir Affairs]] and failed to empower the people of Azad Kashmir, allowing genuine self-government for only a short period in the 1970s. The Interim Constitution of the 1970s only allows the political parties that pay allegiance to Pakistan: &quot;No person or political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir shall be permitted... activities prejudicial or detrimental to the State's accession to Pakistan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Snedden 2013&quot;/&gt; The pro-independence [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] has never been allowed to contest elections in Azad Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Sumantra |last=Bose |authorlink=Sumantra Bose |title=Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-674-01173-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC |p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Interim Constitution does not give them a choice, the people of Azad Kashmir have not considered any option other than joining Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snedden 2013&quot;/&gt; Except in the legal sense, Azad Kashmir has been fully integrated into Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snedden 2013&quot;/&gt;

==Development==
According to the project report by the [[Asian Development Bank]], the bank has set out development goals for Azad Kashmir in the areas of health, education, nutrition, and social development. The whole project is estimated to cost US$76 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/69690/rrp-pak-38135.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germany]], between 2006 and 2014, has also donated $38 million towards the AJK Health Infrastructure Programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pakistan-Donor-Profile-and-Mapping-by-UN.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215181230/http://www.un.org.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pakistan-Donor-Profile-and-Mapping-by-UN.pdf |archive-date=December 15, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Azad Kashmir Landscape.JPG|thumbnail|Landscape of Azad Kashmir]]
The southern parts of Azad Kashmir including Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts has extremely hot weather in summers and moderate cold weather in winters. It receives rains mostly in [[monsoon]] weather.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

[[File:Rice Cultivaiton in Leepa AJK.jpg|thumbnail|Paddy field in Leepa valley]]
In the central and northern parts of state weather remains moderate hot in summers and very cold and chilly in winter. Snow fall also occurs there in December and January.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

This region receives rainfall in both winters and summers. [[Muzaffarabad]] and Pattan are among the wettest areas of the state. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400&amp;nbsp;mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800&amp;nbsp;mm). During summer, monsoon floods of the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]] and Leepa rivers are common, due to high rainfall and melting snow.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Population==
The population of Azad Kashmir, according to the preliminary results of [[2017 Census of Pakistan|the 2017 Census]], is 4.45 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| date = 2017-08-26| title = Census 2017: AJK population rises to over 4m| work = The Nation| url = https://nation.com.pk/27-Aug-2017/census-2017-ajk-population-rises-to-over-4m| accessdate = 2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website of the AJK government reports the literacy rate to be 74%, with the enrolment rate in primary school being 98% and 90% for boys and girls respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ajk.gov.pk/qStatus.php |title= AJ&amp;K at a Glance |access-date= 2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Azad Kashmir is almost entirely Muslim. The people of this region culturally differ from the [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiris]] living in the [[Kashmir Valley]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], and are closer to the culture of [[Jammu Division|Jammu]].

Bhimber is home to most of them, followed by Mirpur and Muzaffarabad. A few dozen families also live in Kotli, Poonch and Bagh.
However, the Christian community has been struggling to get residential status and property rights in AJK. There is no official data on the total number of Bahais in AJK. Only six families are known to be living in Muzaffarabad while some of them live in rural areas.
The followers of the Ahmadi faith is estimated to be somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 and most of them live in Kotli, Mirpur Bhimber and Muzaffarabad.&lt;ref&gt;https://asianlite.com/news/asia-diaspora-news/the-plight-of-minorities-in-azad-kashmir/&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of Azad Kashmir has many similarities to that of northern Punjabi ([[Pothohar Plateau|Potohar]]) culture in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province, while the [[Sudhans]] have oral tradition of [[Pashtuns]]. The [[Peshawari turban]] is worn by some [[Sudhans]] in the area.{{fact|date=November 2019}}

The traditional dress of the women is the [[shalwar kameez]] in Pahari style. The shalwar kameez is commonly worn by both men and women. Women use shawl to cover their head and upper body.

===Languages===
The official language of Azad Kashmir is [[Urdu]],{{sfn|Rahman|1996|p=226}}&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Snedden|2013|p=176}}: On p.&amp;nbsp;29, the census report states that Urdu is the official language of the Government of Azad Kashmir, with Kashmiri, Pahari, Gojri, Punjabi, Kohistani, Pushto and Sheena 'frequently spoken in Azad Kashmir'. Yet, when surveyed about their 'Mother Tongue', Azad Kashmiris' choices were limited to selecting from Pakistan's major languages: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Pushto, Balochi, Saraiki and 'Others'; not surprisingly, 2.18 million of Azad Kashmir's 2.97 million people chose 'Others'.&lt;/ref&gt; while English is used in higher [[Domain of language use|domains]]. The majority of the population, however, are native speakers of other languages. The foremost among these is [[Pahari–Pothwari]], with its various dialects. There are also sizeable communities speaking [[Gujari language|Gujari]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], as well as pockets of speakers of [[Shina language|Shina]], [[Pashto]] and [[Kundal Shahi language|Kundal Shahi]]. With the exception of Pashto and English, these languages belong to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language family.

The dialects of the [[Pahari-Pothwari]] language complex cover most of the territory of Azad Kashmir. These are also spoken across the Line of Control in neighbouring areas of Indian Jammu and Kashmir, and are closely related both to [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to the south and [[Northern Hindko|Hinko]] to the northwest. The language variety in the southern districts of Azad Kashmir is known by a variety of names – including ''Mirpuri'', ''Pothwari'' and ''Pahari'' – and is closely related to the Pothwari proper spoken to the east in the [[Pothohar region]] of Punjab. The dialects of the central districts of Azad Kashmir are occasionally referred to in the literature as ''Chibhali'' or ''Punchi'', but the speakers themselves usually call them ''Pahari'', an ambiguous name that is also used for [[Pahari language (name)|several unrelated languages]] of the Lower Himalayas. Going north, the speech forms gradually change into Hindko. Already in [[Muzaffarabad District]] the preferred local name for the language is ''Hindko'', although it is still apparently more closely related to the core dialects of Pahari.&lt;ref&gt;The preceding paragraph is mostly based on {{harvtxt|Lothers|Lothers|2010}}. For further references, see the bibliography in [[Pahari-Pothwari]].&lt;/ref&gt; Further north in the [[Neelam Valley]] the dialect, locally also known as ''Parmi'', can more unambiguously be subsumed under Hindko.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|p=68|ps = . The conclusion is based on lexical similarity and the comparison is with the Hindko of the [[Kaghan Valley]] and with the Pahari of the Murre Hills.}}

Another major language of Azad Kashmir is [[Gujari language|Gujari]]. It is spoken by several hundred thousand&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|p=96}} report two rough estimates for the total population of Gujari speakes in Azad Kashmir: 200,000 and 700,000, both from the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; people among the traditionally nomadic [[Gujars]], many of whom are nowadays settled. Not all ethnic Gujars speak Gujari, the proportion of those who have shifted to other languages is probably higher in southern Azad Kashmir.{{sfn|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|pp=96, 98, 100}} Gujari is most closely related to the [[Rajasthani languages]] (particularly [[Mewati language|Mewati]]), although it also shares features with Punjabi.{{sfn|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|pp=93–94}} It is dispersed over large areas in northern Pakistan and India. Within Pakistan, the Gujari dialects of Azad Kashmir are more similar, in terms of shared basic vocabulary and mutual intelligibility, to the Gujar varieties of the neighbouring [[Hazara region]] than to the dialects spoken further to the northwest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and north in [[Gilgit District|Gilgit]].{{sfn|Hallberg|O'Leary|1992|pp=111–12, 126}}

There are scattered communities of [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|2002|p=449}}; {{harvnb|Rahman|1996|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the [[Neelam Valley]], where they form the second-largest language group after speakers of Hindko.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|p=70}} There have been calls for the teaching of Kashmiri (particularly in order to counter India's claim of promoting the culture of Kashmir), but the limited attempts at introducing the language at the secondary school level have not been successful, and it is Urdu, rather than Kashmiri, that Kashmiri Muslims have seen as their identity symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1996|p=226}}; {{harvnb|Rahman|2002|pp=449–50}}. The discussion in both cases is in the broader context of Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing process of gradual [[language shift|shift]] to larger local languages,{{sfn|Rahman|1996|p=226}} but at least in the Neelam Valley there still exist communities for whom Kashmiri is the sole mother tongue.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007|pp=70, 75}}

In the northernmost [[Neelum District#Languages|district of Neelam]], there are pockets of other languages. [[Shina language|Shina]], which like Kashmiri belongs to the [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] group, is present in two distinct varieties spoken altogether in three villages. The [[Iranian language|Iranian]] language [[Pashto]], the major language of the neighbouring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is spoken in two villages in Azad Kashmir, both situated on the Line of Control. The endangered [[Kundal Shahi language|Kundal Shahi]] is native to the eponymous village and it is the only language not found outside Azad Kashmir.{{sfn|Akhtar|Rehman|2007}}

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Azad Kashmir}}
[[File:Sharda Kashmir.jpg|thumb|Neelum valley is a tourist destination in Azad Kashmir.]]
Historically the economy of Azad Kashmir has been agricultural which meant that land was the main source or mean of production. This means that all food for immediate and long term consumption was produced from land. The produce included various crops, fruits, vegetables, etc. Land was also the source of other livelihood necessities such as wood, fuel, grazing for animals which then turned into dairy products. Because of this land was also the main source of revenue for the governments whose primary purpose for centuries was to accumulate revenue.&lt;ref&gt;

Agriculture is a major part of Azad Kashmir's economy. Low-lying areas that have high populations grow crops like [[barley]], [[mango]]es, [[millet]], [[maize|corn]] (maize), and [[wheat]], and also raise cattle. In the elevated areas that are less populated and more spread-out, forestry, corn, and livestock are the main sources of income. There are mineral and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Muzaffarabad]]. There are also graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are also reservoirs of low-grade coal, [[chalk]], [[bauxite]], and [[zircon]]. Local household industries produce carved wooden objects, textiles, and dhurrie carpets.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt; There is also an arts and crafts industry that produces such cultural goods as namdas, shawls, pashmina, pherans, [[Papier-mâché]], basketry copper, rugs, wood carving, silk and woolen clothing, patto, carpets, namda gubba, and silverware. Agricultural goods produced in the region include mushrooms, honey, walnuts, apples, cherries, medicinal herbs and plants, resin, deodar, kail, chir, fir, maple, and ash timber.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajk144/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The migration to UK was accelerated and by the completion of [[Mangla Dam]] in 1967 the process of '[[chain migration]]' became in full flow. Today, remittances from [[British Mirpuri]] community make a critical role in AJK's economy. In the mid-1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in Azad Kashmir. In the 1960s, with the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]] in [[Mirpur District]], the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government began to receive royalties from the Pakistani government for the electricity that the dam provided to Pakistan. During the mid-2000s, a multibillion-dollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn.com&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to agriculture, textiles, and arts and crafts, remittances have played a major role in the economy of Azad Kashmir. One analyst estimated that the figure for Azad Kashmir was 25.1% in 2001. With regard to annual household income, people living in the higher areas are more dependent on remittances than are those living in the lower areas.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter part of 2006, billions of dollars for development were mooted by [[international aid agencies]] for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake-hit zones in Azad Kashmir, though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels, leading to considerable delays in help getting to the most neediest. Hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake.&lt;ref name=&quot;dawn.com&quot;/&gt; A land-use plan for the city of [[Muzaffarabad]] was prepared by the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]].
