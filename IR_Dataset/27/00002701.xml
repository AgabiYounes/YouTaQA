During the 19th century it became a thriving industrial settlement, which was also notable for the vitality of its cultural life and as an important publishing centre.

==History==
The settlement of Aberdare dates from at least the Middle Ages, with the first known reference being in a monastic chapter of 1203 concerning grazing right on [[Hirwaun]] Common.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVHistSoc-Intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology of the History of the Cynon Valley |url=http://www.cvhs.org.uk/timeline/chron.html |website=Cynon Valley History Society |accessdate=19 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally a small village in an agricultural district, centred around the [[St John's Church, Aberdare|Church of St John the Baptist]], said to date from 1189. By the middle of the 15th century, Aberdare contained a water mill in addition to a number of thatched cottages, of which no evidence remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservation Rep&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Aberdare Conservation Area. Appraisal and Management Plan |url=http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/en/relateddocuments/publications/planning/aberdareconservationarea/aberdareconservationareaappraisalandmanagementplan.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20151202082041/http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/en/relateddocuments/publications/planning/aberdareconservationarea/aberdareconservationareaappraisalandmanagementplan.pdf |url-status = dead|archive-date=2 December 2015 |publisher=Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council |accessdate=20 November 2013 }}, pp.9–11&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century the population grew rapidly, owing to the abundance of coal and iron ore,: the population of the whole parish, 1,486 in 1801, increased tenfold during the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Aberdare|inline=1|volume=1|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major industries supported the growth of the community: first iron, then coal. A branch of the [[Glamorganshire Canal]] (1811) was used to transport these products; then the railway became the main means of transport to the South Wales coast.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Aberdare |edition=15th |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/27 27] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1870s onwards, the economy of the town was dominated by the coal mining industry, with only a small [[tinplate]] works. There were also several brickworks and breweries.  During the latter half of the 19th century, considerable improvements were made to the town, which became a pleasant place to live, despite the nearby collieries. A postgraduate theological college opened in connection with the Church of England in 1892, but in 1907 it moved to [[Llandaff]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
[[File:Aberdare 1910s.jpg|thumb|left|Aberdare in the 1910s]]
With the ecclesiastical parishes of St Fagan's (Trecynon) and Aberaman carved out of the ancient parish, Aberdare had 12 [[Anglican]] churches and one [[Catholic]] church, built in 1866 in Monk Street near the site of a cell attached to [[Penrhys#Medieval monastery|Penrhys monastery]]; and at one time there were over 50 [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] chapels (including those in surrounding settlements such as [[Cwmaman]] and [[Llwydcoed]]). The services in the majority of the chapels were in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Most of these chapels have now closed, with many converted to other uses. The urban district includes what were once the separate villages of [[Aberaman]], [[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Abernant]], [[Cwmaman]], [[Cwmbach]], [[Cwmdare]], [[Llwydcoed]], [[Penywaun]] and [[Trecynon]]. There are several [[cairn]]s and the remains of a circular [[Brython|British]] encampment on the mountain between Aberdare and [[Merthyr]]. [[Hirwaun]] moor, 4 miles to the north west of Aberdare, was according to tradition the scene of a battle at which [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], prince of [[Dyfed]], was defeated by the allied forces of the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Robert Fitzhamon]] and [[Iestyn ap Gwrgant]], the last Welsh prince of [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Population growth==
The parish population was 1,486 in 1801, but expanded fast, especially during the 1840s and 1850s: the population of the Aberdare District, centred on the town, was 9,322 in 1841; 18,774 in 1851; and 37,487 in 1861. This population growth, a result of the growth of the [[steam coal]] trade (see below) was increasingly concentrated in the previously agricultural areas of Blaengwawr and Cefnpennar to the south of the town. Many of the migrants came from the rural parts of west Wales which had been affected by an agricultural depression.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=149–52}} Population levels continued to increase over the next forty years, albeit with a small decline in the 1870s. The first decade of the 20th century saw a further sharp increase, largely as a result of the steam coal trade, reaching 53,779 in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Statistical Evidence|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has since declined owing to the loss of most of the heavy industry.

The Aberdare population at the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] was 31,705 (ranked 13th largest in Wales).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Office for National Statistics.| publisher=clickonwales.org| title=Settlements| url=http://www.clickonwales.org/wp-content/uploads/4_Factfile_Settlements.pdf| page=1| accessdate=8 January 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923204659/http://www.clickonwales.org/wp-content/uploads/4_Factfile_Settlements.pdf| archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status = dead| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 it was 29,748, though the figure includes the surrounding populations of [[Aberaman]], [[Abercwmboi]], [[Cwmbach]] and [[Llwydcoed]].&lt;ref name=2011census&gt;{{NOMIS2011|id=1119885767|title=Aberdare Built-up area |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
On 1 December 2016, following ''The Rhondda Cynon Taf (Communities) Order 2016'', the [[Community (Wales)|community]] of Aberdare was split into two new communities, [[Aberdare East]] and [[Aberdare West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2016/1156/pdfs/wsi_20161156_mi.pdf |title=The Rhondda Cynon Taf (Communities) Order 2016 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=1 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are coterminous with the [[electoral ward]]s of the same names. Aberdare East includes Aberdare town centre and the village of [[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Abernant]]. Aberdare West includes [[Cwmdare]], Cwm Sian and [[Trecynon]].

==Language==
Welsh was the prominent language until the mid 20th century and Aberdare was an important centre of Welsh language publishing. A large proportion of the early migrant population were Welsh speaking, and in 1851 only ten per cent of the population had been born outside of Wales.{{sfn|Turner|1984|p=6}}

In his controversial evidence to the [[Treason of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]] (known in Wales as the ''Brad y Llyfrau Gleision'' or ''Treachery of the Blue Books''), the Anglican vicar of Aberdare, [[John Griffith (Anglican priest)|John Griffith]], stated that the English language was &quot;generally understood&quot; and referred to the arrival of people from anglicised areas such as Radnorshire and south Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1847 Report into the State of Education in Wales|url=http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/SEW00002g/frames?div=1&amp;subdiv=0&amp;locale=en&amp;mode=reference}}, p.489&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith also made allegations about the Welsh speaking population and what he considered to be the degraded character of the women of Aberdare, alleging sexual promiscuity was an accepted social convention, that drunkenness and improvidence amongst the miners was common and attacking what he saw as exaggerated emotion in the religious practices of the Nonconformists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones 272&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rev Thomas Price.jpg|thumbnail|right|Rev Thomas Price (1820–88), minister of Capel Calfaria]]

This evidence helped inform the findings of the report which would go on to stigmatise Welsh people as &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; and found the reason for this was the continued use of the Welsh language, which it described as &quot;evil&quot;. The controversial reports allowed the local non-conformist minister [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] of [[Calfaria, Aberdare|Calfaria]] to arrange public meetings, from which he would emerge as a leading critic of the vicar's evidence and, by implication, a defender of both the Welsh language and the morality of the local population,&lt;ref name=CMG48&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Meeting at Aberdare|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3089159/3089162/21|accessdate=20 November 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=26 February 1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still contended that Griffiths was made vicar of [[Merthyr Tydfil|Merthyr]] in the neighbouring valley to escape local anger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Elvan's Church Aberdare|url=http://www.stelvanschurchaberdare.com/church-architecture.html|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though it was over ten years before he left Aberdare. The reports and subsequent defence would maintain the perceptions of Aberdare, the [[Cynon Valley]] and even the [[South Wales Valleys|wider area]] as proudly nonconformist and defiantly Welsh speaking throughout its industrialised history.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=155–6}}

By 1901, the census recorded that 71.5% of the population of Aberdare Urban District spoke Welsh, but this fell to 65.2% in 1911.&lt;ref name=stat&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Statistical Evidence}}, p.229&lt;/ref&gt; The 1911 data shows that Welsh was more widely spoken among the older generation compared to the young, and amongst women compared to men. A shift in language was expedited with the loss of men during the [[First World War]] and the resulting economic turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Statistical Evidence|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; English gradually began to replace Welsh as the community language, as shown by the decline of the Welsh language press in the town. This pattern continued after the [[Second World War]] despite the advent of Welsh medium education. [[Ysgol Gymraeg Aberdâr]], the Welsh-medium primary school, was established in the 1950s with Idwal Rees as head teacher.

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], 97.7%{{clarify|date=July 2018}} of Aberdare residents aged three years and over can speak Welsh, with 24.8% of 3–15 year olds stating that they can speak it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/Policy,%20research%20and%20data/Census%20Data/Pages/2011CensusresultsbyCommunity.aspx|title=Comisiynydd y Gymraeg – 2011 Census results by Community|website=www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru|access-date=2018-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914001036/http://www.comisiynyddygymraeg.cymru/English/Policy,%20research%20and%20data/Census%20Data/Pages/2011CensusresultsbyCommunity.aspx|archive-date=14 September 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==

===Iron Industry===
[[Ironworks]] were established at [[Llwydcoed]] and [[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taff|Abernant]] in 1799&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and 1800 respectively, followed by others at Gadlys and [[Aberaman]] in 1827 and 1847. The iron industry began to expand in a significant way around 1818 when the Crawshay family of Merthyr purchased the [[Hirwaun]] ironworks and place them under independent management. In the following year, [[Rowland Fothergill]] took over the ironworks at [[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Abernant]] and a few years later did the same at [[Llwydcoed]]. Both concerns later fell into the hands of his nephew [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]]. The Gadlys Ironworks was established in 1827 by Matthew Wayne, who had previously managed the [[Cyfarthfa]] ironworks at Merthyr.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=150}} The Gadlys works, now considered an important archaeological site, originally comprised four blast furnaces, inner forges, rowing mills and puddling furnaces. The development of these works provided impetus to the growth of Aberdare as a nucleated town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservation Rep&quot; /&gt; The iron industry was gradually superseded by coal and all the five iron works had closed by 1875, as the local supply of iron ore was inadequate to meet the ever-increasing demand created by the invention of steel, and as a result the importing of ore proved more profitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservation Rep&quot; /&gt;

===Coal industry===
The iron industry had a relatively small impact upon the economy of Aberdare and in 1831 only 1.2% of the population was employed in manufacturing, as opposed to 19.8% in neighbouring Merthyr Tydfil.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=150}} In the early years of Aberdare's development, most of the coal worked in the parish was coking coal, and was consumed locally, chiefly in the [[ironworks]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Although the [[Gadlys]] works was small in comparison with the other ironworks it became significant as the Waynes also became involved in the production of sale coal.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=149–50}} In 1836, this activity led to the exploitation of the &quot;Four-foot Seam&quot; of high-[[heating value|calorific value]] [[steam coal]] began, and pits were sunk in rapid succession.

In 1840, Thomas Powell sank a pit at [[Cwmbach]], and during the next few years he opened another four pits. In the next few years, other local entrepreneurs now became involved in the expansion of the coal trade, including [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams]] at Ynysgynon and [[David Davis, Blaengwawr (coal owner)|David Davis]] at Blaengwawr, as well as the latter's son [[David Davis, Maesyffynnon (coal owner)|David Davis, Maesyffynnon]]. They were joined by newcomers such as [[Crawshay Bailey]] at Aberaman and, in due course, [[Sir George Elliot, 1st Baronet|George Elliot]] in the lower part of the valley.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=150–1}} This coal was valuable for steam railways and [[steam ship]]s, and an export trade began,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; via the [[Taff Vale Railway]] and the port of [[Cardiff]]. The population of the parish rose from 6,471 in 1841 to 14,999 in 1851 and 32,299 in 1861 and John Davies&lt;ref&gt;Davies, John, ''A History of Wales'', Penguin, 1994, {{ISBN|0-14-014581-8}}, p 400&lt;/ref&gt; described it as &quot;the most dynamic place in Wales&quot;. In 1851, the [[Admiralty]] decided to use Welsh steam coal in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], and this decision boosted the reputation of Aberdare's product and launched a huge international export market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, ''op cit'', p 400&quot;&gt;Davies, ''op cit'', p 400&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mined in Aberdare parish rose from {{convert|177000|LT|t}} in 1844 to {{convert|477000|LT|t}} in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''op cit'', p 384&lt;/ref&gt; and the coal trade, which after 1875 was the chief support of the town, soon reached huge dimensions.

The growth of the coal trade inevitably led to a number of industrial disputes, some of which were local and others which affected the wider coalfield. Trade unionism began to appear in the Aberdare Valley at intervals from the 1830s onwards but the first significant manifestation occurred during the [[Aberdare Strike 1857-8|Aberdare Strike of 1857–8]]. The dispute was initiated by the depression in trade which followed the [[Crimean War]] and saw the local coal owners successfully impose a reduction in wages. The dispute did, however, witness an early manifestation of mass trade unionism amongst the miners of the valley and although unsuccessful the dispute saw the emergence of a stronger sense of solidarity amongst the miners.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=166–8}}

Steam coal was subsequently found in the [[Ystradyfodwg|Rhondda]] and further west, but many of the great companies of the Welsh coal industry's Gilded Age started operation in Aberdare and the lower Cynon Valley, including those of [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|Samuel Thomas]], [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies and Sons]], [[John Nixon (mining engineer)|Nixon's Navigation]] and [[Powell Duffryn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies, ''op cit'', p 400&quot;/&gt;

In common with the rest of the South Wales coalfield, Aberdare's coal industry commenced a long decline after [[World War I]], and the last two deep mines still in operation in the 1960s were the small Aberaman and Fforchaman collieries, which closed in 1962 and 1965 respectively.

[[File:Aberdare Co-operative store fire, May 11th 1919.jpg|thumb|right|Aberdare Co-operative store fire, 11 May 1919]]
On 11 May 1919, an extensive fire broke out on Cardiff Street, Aberdare.

With the decline of both iron and coal, Aberdare has become reliant on commercial businesses as a major source of employment. Its industries include cable manufacture, smokeless fuels, and tourism.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==Government==
As a small village in the upland valleys of Glamorgan, Aberdare did not play any significant part in political life until its development as an industrial settlement. It was part of the lordship of Miskin, and the ancient office of High Constable continued in ceremonial form until relatively recent times.

===Parliamentary elections===
In 1832, Aberdare was removed from the county of Glamorgan and became part of the parliamentary borough of [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]]. For much of the nineteenth century, the representation was initially controlled by the ironmasters of Merthyr, notably the Guest family. From 1852 until 1868 the seat was held by [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Austen Bruce]] whose main industrial interests lay in the Aberdare valley. Bruce was a Liberal but was viewed with suspicion by the more [[Radicals (UK)|radical]] faction which became increasingly influential within Welsh Liberalism in the 1860s. The radicals supported such policies as the disestablishment of the Church of England and were closely allied to the [[Liberation Society]].

====1868 general election====
Nonconformist ministers played a prominent role in this new politics and, at Aberdare, they found an effective spokesman in the Rev [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] minister of [[Calfaria, Aberdare]]. Following the granting of a second parliamentary seat to the borough of Merthyr Tydfil in 1867, the Liberals of Aberdare sought to ensure that a candidate from their part of the constituency was returned alongside the sitting member, [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Henry Austen Bruce]]. Their choice fell upon [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]], owner of the ironworks at Abernant, who was enthusiastically supported by the Rev Thomas Price. Shortly before the election, however, [[Henry Richard]] intervened as a radical Liberal candidate, invited by the radicals of Merthyr. To many people's surprise, Price was lukewarm about his candidature and continued to support Fothergill. Ultimately, [[Henry Richard]] won a celebrated victory with Fothergill in second place and Bruce losing his seat. Richard thus became one of the-first radical MPs from Wales.{{sfn|Morgan|1991|pp=23–5}}

====1874–1914====
At the 1874 General Election, both Richard and Fothergill were again returned, although the former was criticised for his apparent lack of sympathy towards the miners during the industrial disputes of the early 1870s. This led to the emergence of Thomas Halliday as the first [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|labour]] or working-class candidate to contest a Welsh constituency. Although he polled well, Halliday fell short of being elected. For the remainder of the nineteenth century, the constituency was represented by industrialists, most notably [[David Alfred Thomas]]. In 1900, however, Thomas was joined by [[Keir Hardie]], the [[Independent Labour Party|ILP]] candidate, who became the first labour representative to be returned for a Welsh constituency independent of the Liberal Party.

====Twentieth century====
The [[Aberdare (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdare]] constituency came into being at the 1918 election. The first representative was [[Charles Butt Stanton]] who had been elected at a by-election following Hardie's death in 1915. However, in 1922, Stanton was defeated by a Labour candidate and the party has held the seat ever since. The only significant challenge came from [[Plaid Cymru]] at the 1970 and February 1974 General Elections but this performance has not since been repeated. Since 1984 the parliamentary seat, now known as [[Cynon Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Cynon Valley]] has been held by [[Ann Clwyd]].

===Local government===
Until the mid-nineteenth century the local government of Aberdare and its locality remained in the hands of traditional structures such as the parish vestry and the High Constable, who was chosen on an annual basis. However, the rapid industrial development of the parsing resulted in the situation where these traditional bodies could not cope with the realities of an urbanised, industrial community which had developed without any planning or facilities. During the early decades of the century the iron masters gradually imposed their influence over local affairs and this remained the case following the formation of the Merthyr Board of Guardians in 1836. During the 1850s and early 1860s, however, as coal displaced iron as the main industry in the valley, the ironmasters were displaced as the dominant group in local government and administration by an alliance between mostly indigenous coal owners, shopkeepers and tradesmen, professional men and dissenting ministers. A central figure in this development was the Rev [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]]. The growth of this alliance was rooted in the reaction to the [[Treason of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]] and the subsequent efforts to establish a British School at Aberdare.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=156–60}}

In the 1840s there were no adequate sanitary facilities or water supply and life expectancy was low. Outbreaks of cholera and typhus were commonplace.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=152}} Against this background, [[Thomas Webster Rammell]] prepared a report for the General Board of Health on the sanitary condition of the parish, which concluded that a [[Aberdare Lpcal Board of Health|Local Board of Health]] be established.{{sfn|Rammell|1853|pp=28–9}}  This happened in 1854. Its first chairman was [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]] and the members included [[David Davis, Blaengwawr (coal owner)|David Davis, Blaengwawr]], [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams (''Alaw Goch'')]], [[Rees Hopkin Rhys (industrialist and local politician)|Rees Hopkin Rhys]] and the [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Rev. Thomas Price]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMG 54 B Health election&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Aberdare Board of Health|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3090874/ART17|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=22 September 1854}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the [[Aberdare School Board]] in 1871.

By 1889, the Local Board of Health had initiated a number of developments which included the purchase of local reservoirs from the Aberdare Waterworks Company for £97,000, a sewerage scheme costing £35,000, as well as the opening of [[Aberdare Park|Aberdare Public Park]] and a local fever hospital. The lack of a Free Library, however, remained a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|title=Labour Leaders and Local Politics|pages=400, 402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the formation of the [[Glamorgan County Council]] (upon which Aberdare had five elected members) in 1889, followed by the [[Aberdare Urban District Council]], which replaced the Local Board in 1889, transformed the local politics of the Aberdare valley.
[[File:Aberdare January 2013 snow.jpg|thumb|Aberdare in January 2013]]
At the [[1889 Glamorgan County Council Elections]] most of the elected representatives were coalowners and industrialists and the only exception in the earlier period was the miners' agent [[David Morgan (trade unionist)|David Morgan]] (Dai o'r Nant), elected in 1892 as a labour representative. From the early 1900s, however, Labour candidates began to gain ground and dominated local government from the 1920s onwards. The same pattern was seen on the Aberdare UDC.

In 1974, following local government re-organization, Aberdare became part of the county of [[Mid Glamorgan]] and the [[Cynon Valley Borough Council]]. Labour members held a majority of seats on both authorities until their abolition in 1996. Since the latest re-organization, Aberdare has been part of the [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] unitary authority. Once again, Labour has been the majority party although [[Plaid Cymru]] controlled the authority from 1999 until 2003.

Since 1995 Aberdare has elected county councillors to [[Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council]]. The town lies mainly in the [[Aberdare East]] ward, represented by two county councillors. Nearby [[Cwmdare]], [[Llwydcoed]] and [[Trecynon]] are represented by the Aberdare West/Llwydcoed ward. Both wards have been represented by the [[Welsh Labour Party|Labour Party]] since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rhondda-Cyon-Taff-1995-2012.pdf Rhondda Cyon Taff County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012], The Election Centre.

[[File:CaradogStatueAberdare.jpg|thumb|left| [[Griffith Rhys Jones|Caradog]] statue in Victoria Square]]
Aberdare, during its boom years, was considered a centre of [[Welsh culture]]: it hosted the first [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1861, with which [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams (Alaw Goch)]] was closely associated. A number of local eisteddfodau had long been held in the locality, associated with figures such as [[William Williams (Carw Coch)]] The Eisteddfod was again held in Aberdare in 1885, and also in 1956 at [[Aberdare Park]] where the [[Gorsedd stones|Gorsedd standing stones]] still exist. At the last National Eisteddfod held in Aberdare in 1956 Mathonwy Hughes won the chair. From the mid nineteenth century, Aberdare was an important publishing centre where a large number of books and journals were produced, the majority of which were in the Welsh language. A newspaper entitled [[Y Gwladgarwr]] (the Patriot) was published at Aberdare from 1856 until 1882 and was circulated widely throughout the South Wales valleys.  From 1875 a more successful newspaper, [[Tarian y Gweithiwr]] (the Workman's Shield) was published at Aberdare by John Mills. Y Darian, as it was known, strongly supported the trade union movements among the miners and ironworkers of the valleys. The miners' leader, [[William Abraham (trade unionist)|William Abraham]], derived support from the newspaper, which was also aligned with radical nonconformist liberalism. The rise of the political labour movement and the subsequent decline of the Welsh language in the valleys, ultimately led to its decline and closure in 1934.

The [[Coliseum Theatre (Aberdare)|Coliseum Theatre]] is Aberdare's main arts venue, containing a 600-seat [[auditorium]] and cinema. It is situated in nearby [[Trecynon]] and was built in 1938 using [[miner]]s' subscriptions.

The [[Second World War]] poet [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]], was born near Aberdare in the village [[Cwmaman]] and there is a plaque commemorating him, including a quotation from his poem ''The Mountain over Aberdare''.

The founding members of the rock band [[Stereophonics]] originated from the nearby village of [[Cwmaman]].  It is also the hometown of guitarist [[Mark Parry (musician)|Mark Parry]] of Vancouver rock band [[The Manvils]].  Famed [[anarcho-punk|anarchist-punk]] band [[Crass]] played their last live show for striking miners in Aberdare during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|UK miners' strike]].

[[Griffith Rhys Jones|Griffith Rhys Jones − or Caradog]] as he was commonly known − was the Conductor of the famous 'Côr Mawr' of some 460 voices (the South Wales Choral Union), which twice won first prize at Crystal Palace choral competitions in London in the 1870s.  He is depicted in the town's most prominent statue by sculptor [[Sir William Goscombe John|Goscombe John]], unveiled on Victoria Square in 1920.

Aberdare was culturally twinned with the German town of [[Ravensburg]].

==Religion==

===Anglican Church===
The original parish church of [[St John's Church, Aberdare|St John the Baptist]] was originally built in 1189. Some of its original architecture is still intact.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman133&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Aberdare St John the Baptist Church.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist's Church]]

With the development of Aberdare as an industrial centre in the nineteenth century it became increasingly apparent that the ancient church was far too small to service the perceived spiritual needs of an urban community, particularly in view of the rapid growth of nonconformity from the 1830s onwards. Eventually, [[John Griffith (Anglican priest)|John Griffith]], the rector of Aberdare undertook to raise funds to build a new church, leading to the rapid construction of [[St Elvan's Church, Aberdare|St Elvan's Church]] in the town centre between 1851 and 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|pages=88–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Church in Wales]] church still stands the heart of the parish of Aberdare and has had extensive work since its erection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman133&quot;&gt;Newman (1995), p.133&lt;/ref&gt; The church has a modern electrical, two-manual and pedal board pipe organ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&amp;rec_index=P00388|title=Glamorgan (Glamorgan, Mid), Aberdare, St. Elvan, Church Street, Victoria Square|work=The British Institute of Organ Studies2005 |publisher=National Pipe Organ Register |year=2005 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is still used in services.
[[File:Aberdare St Elvan's church.jpg|thumb|right| St Elvan's Church]]

John Griffith, vicar of Aberdare, who built St Elvan's, transformed the role of the Anglican church in the valley by building a number of other churches, including [[St Fagan's Church|St Fagan's]], [[Trecynon]]. Other churches in the parish are St Luke's ([[Cwmdare]]), St James's ([[Llwydcoed]]) and St Matthew's Church (1891) ([[Abernant, Rhondda Cynon Taf|Abernant]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman134&quot;&gt;Newman (1995), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parish of Aberaman and Cwmaman is St Margaret's Church, with an old, but beautiful, pipe organ with two manuals and a pedal board. Also in this parish is St Joseph's Church, Cwmaman. St Joseph's has recently undergone much recreational work, almost converting the church into a community centre. However, regular church services still take place. Here, there is a two-manual and pedal board electric organ, with speakers at the front and sides of the church.

In 1910 there were 34 Anglican churches in the Urban District of Aberdare. A survey of the attendance at places of worship on a particular Sunday in that year recorded that 17.8% of worshippers attended church services, with the remainder attending nonconformist chapels.&lt;ref name=statrel /&gt;

===Nonconformity===
The Aberdare Valley was a stronghold of [[Nonconformity in Wales|Nonconformity]] from the mid-nineteenth century until the inter-war years. In the aftermath of the [[Treachery of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]] nonconformists became increasingly active in the political and educational life of Wales and in few places was this as prevalent as at Aberdare. The leading figure was [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]], minister of Calfaria, Aberdare.

Aberdare was a major centre of the [[1904–1905 Welsh Revival|1904–05 Religious Revival]], which had begun at [[Loughor]] near Swansea. The revival aroused alarm among ministers for the revolutionary, even anarchistic, impact it had upon chapel congregations and denominational organisation. In particular, it was seen as drawing attention away from pulpit preaching and the role of the minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|title=Rebirth of a Nation|pages=134–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local newspaper, the ''Aberdare Leader'', regarded the revival with suspicion from the outset, objecting to the 'abnormal heat' which it engendered.&lt;ref name=&quot;AL 19-11-04 edit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial.|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3576279/3576283/29
|accessdate=11 February 2016|newspaper=Aberdare Leader|date=19 November 1904|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trecynon]] was particularly affected by the revival, and the meetings held there were sais to have aroused more emotion and excitement than the more restrained meetings in Aberdare itself. The impact of the revival was significant in the short term, but in the longer term was fairly transient.

Once the immediate impact of the revival had faded, it was clear from the early twentieth century that there was a gradual decline in the influence of the chapels. This can be explained by several factors, including the rise of socialism and the process of linguistic change which saw the younger generation increasingly turn to the English language. There were also theological controversies such as that over the New Theology propounded by [[R.J. Campbell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AL 7-11-08 NT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Old v New Theology. Conflict at Abercwmboi.|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3578004/ART31|accessdate=14 March 2015|newspaper=Aberdare Leader|date=7 November 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the many chapels, few are still used for their original purpose and a number of closed since the turn of the millennium. Many have been converted for housing or other purposes (including one at Robertstown which has become a mosque), and others demolished. Among the notable chapels were [[Calfaria, Aberdare]] and [[Seion, Cwmaman]] (Baptist); [[Saron, Aberaman]] and [[Siloa, Aberdare]] (Independent); and [[Bethania, Aberdare]] (Calvinistic Methodist).

====Independents====
The earliest Welsh Independent, or Congregationalist chapel in the Aberdare area was Ebenezer, trecynon, although meetings had been held from the latter years of the eighteenth century in dwelling houses in the locality, for example at Hirwaun.&lt;ref name=&quot;AL OA 25-10-13&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Old Aberdare. History of Congregationalism|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3578920/ART17|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=Aberdare Leader|date=25 October 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, the Independents showed the biggest increases in terms of places of worship: from two in 1837 to twenty-five (four of them being English causes), in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees, Chapels in the Valley&quot;&gt;Rees, Chapels in the Valley, p.169&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1910 there were 35 Independent chapels, with a total membership of 8,612.&lt;ref name=statrel /&gt; [[Siloa, Aberdare|Siloa Chapel]] was the largest of the Independent chapels in Aberdare and is one of the few that remain open today, having been 're-established' as a Welsh language chapel. The Independent ministers of nineteenth-century Aberdare included some powerful personalities but none had the kind of wider social authority which Thomas Price enjoyed amongst the Baptists.
[[File:Siloa Chapel, Aberdare - geograph.org.uk - 679638.jpg|thumb|right|Siloa Chapel, Aberdare]]

Of the other Independent chapels in the valley [[Saron, Aberaman|Saron]], in Davis Street, Aberaman, was used for regular services by a small group of members until 2011. For many years, these were held in a small side-room, and not the chapel itself. The chapel has a large vestry comprising rows of two-way-facing wooden benches and a stage, with a side entrance onto Beddoe Street and back entrance to Lewis Street. Although the building is not in good repair, the interior, including pulpit and balcony seating area (back &amp; sides), was in good order but the chapel eventually closed due to the very small number of members remaining. In February 1999, Saron was made a Grade II Listed Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-21368-saron-independent-chapel-aberaman| title=Saron Independent Chapel, Aberaman |publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baptists====
The Baptists were the most influential of the nonconformist denominations in Aberdare and their development was led by the Rev. [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] who came to Aberdare in the early 1840s as minister of [[Calfaria, Aberdare|Calfaria]] Chapel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones, Explorations and Explanations&quot;&gt;Jones, Explorations and Explanations, p.197−8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837 the Baptists had three chapels, but in 1897 there were twenty, seventeen of them being Welsh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rees, Chapels in the Valley&quot;/&gt; By 1910 the number of chapels had increased to 30, with a total membership of 7,422.&lt;ref name=statrel&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Statistical Evidence|page=447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these Baptist chapels were established under the influence of Thomas Price who encouraged members to establish branch chapels to attract migrants who flocked to the town and locality from rural Wales. The chapels came together for regular gatherings, including baptismal services which were held in the [[River Cynon]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AL OA 5-4-1913&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=D.T.|title=Old Aberdare.

====Calvinistic Methodists====
By 1910 there were 24 Calvinistic Methodist chapels in the Aberdare Urban District with a total membership of 4,879.&lt;ref name=statrel /&gt; The most prominent of these was [[Bethania, Aberdare]], once the largest chapel in Aberdare. Derelict for many years, it was demolished in 2015. The Methodists were numerically powerful and while some of their ministers such as William James of [[Bethania, Aberdare|Bethania]] served on the [[Aberdare School Board]] and other public bodies, their constitution militated against the sort of active political action which came more naturally to the Baptists and Independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other denominations====
The other denominations were weaker, including the Wesleyan Methodists who had 14 places of worship by 1910.&lt;ref name=statrel /&gt; There was also a significant Unitarian tradition in the valley and three places of worship by 1910.&lt;ref name=statrel /&gt; Highland Place Unitarian Church celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukunitarians.org.uk/aberdare/history.htm |title=Aberdare Unitarian Church |publisher=Ukunitarians.org.uk |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number of lectures on its history and the history of Unitarianism in Wales taking place there. The church has a two-manual pipe organ with pedal board that is used to accompany all services. The current organist is Grace Jones, the sister of the former organist Jacob Jones. The connected schoolroom is used for post-service meetings and socialising.

===Judaism===
Seymour Street was once home to a synagogue which opened its doors in the late 1800s and which closed in 1957. The site now has a [[blue plaque]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/once-thriving-aberdare-jewish-community-recognised-8549278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

The state of education in the parish was a cause for concern during the early industrial period as is illustrated by the reaction to the [[Treachery of the Blue Books|1847 Education Reports]]. Initially, there was an outcry, led by the Rev [[Thomas Price (Baptist minister)|Thomas Price]] against the comments made by the vicar of Aberdare in his submission to the commissioners. However, on closer reflection, the reports related the deficiencies of educational provision, not only in Aberdare itself but also in the communities of the valleys generally. In so doing they not only criticised the ironmasters for their failure to provide schools for workers' children but also the nonconformists for not establishing [[British and Foreign School Society|British Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|title=Communities|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ten schools in Aberdare there was accommodation for only 1,317 children, a small proportion of the population. Largely as a result of these criticisms, the main nonconformist denominations worked together to establish a British School, known locally as Ysgol y Comin, which was opened in 1848, accommodating 200 pupils. Funds were raised which largely cleared the debts and the opening of the school was marked by a public meeting addressed by Price and [[David Williams (coal owner)|David Williams (''Alaw Goch'')]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMG 48 Brit school&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Aberdare British Schools|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3089330/ART23|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=14 October 1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much energy was expended during this period on conflicts between Anglicans and nonconformists over education. The establishment of the [[Aberdare School Board]] in 1871 brought about an extension of educational provision but also intensified religious rivalries. School Board elections were invariably fought on religious grounds. Despite these tensions the Board took over a number of existing schools and established new ones. By 1889, fourteen schools were operated by the Board but truancy and lack of attendance remained a problem, as in many industrial districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|title=Labour Leaders and Local Politics|pages=401–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other public bodies at the time (see 'Local Government' above), membership of the School Board was dominated by coal owners and colliery officials, nonconformist ministers, professional men and tradesmen. Only occasionally was an Anglican clergyman elected and, with the exception of [[David Morgan (trade unionist)|David Morgan (''Dai o'r Nant'')]], no working class candidates were elected for more than one term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parry|title=Labour Leaders and Local Politics|pages=401–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
