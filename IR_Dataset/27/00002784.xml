Ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], where it is first of the Pancha Mahavrata and [[Hinduism]], and in [[Buddhism]] where it is the first of the [[five precepts]]. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept,&lt;ref name=&quot;arapura&quot;&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and refined the principles of Ahimsa, the concept also reached an extraordinary development in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.&lt;ref name=&quot;evpc&quot;&gt;Stephen H.

==Etymology==
The word ''Ahimsa''—sometimes spelled ''Ahinsa''&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanskrit dictionary&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0125-ahalyA.jpg|title=Sanskrit Dictionary Reference|website=www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Standing, E. M. (1924). THE SUPER‐VEGETARIANS. New Blackfriars, 5(50), pages 103–108&lt;/ref&gt;—is derived from the Sanskrit root ''hiṃs'', meaning to strike; ''hiṃsā'' is injury or harm, while ''a-hiṃsā'', its opposite, is ''non-harming'' or ''[[nonviolence]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanskrit dictionary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shukavak N. Dasa&quot;&gt;[http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html A Hindu Primer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408135457/http://www.sanskrit.org/www/Hindu%20Primer/nonharming_ahimsa.html |date=8 April 2011 }}, by [http://www.sanskrit.org/www/shukavak.htm Shukavak N.

==Hinduism==

===Ancient Vedic texts===

Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in the Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scriptures indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasize it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasized, until Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br/&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br/&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, &quot;may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend&quot;.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br/&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of &quot;non-injury&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;houben 1999&quot;&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in &quot;South Asian&quot; cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals (&quot;pashu-Ahimsa&quot;), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C. Eppert &amp; H. Wang (Eds.), Cross cultural studies in curriculum: Eastern thought, educational insights, pages 171–192, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5673-6}}, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars&lt;ref name=&quot;arapura&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izawa, A. (2008). Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against &quot;all creatures&quot; (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=I. B.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Indian religions)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandilya [[Upanishad]] lists ten forbearances: ''Ahimsa'', ''Satya'', ''Asteya'', ''Brahmacharya'', ''Daya'', ''Arjava'', ''Kshama'', ''Dhriti'', ''Mitahara'' and ''Saucha''.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000). Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upaniṣads: SZ (Vol. 3). Sarup &amp; Sons; see pages 630–631&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, J. R., &amp; Yogīndra, S. (1850). A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

===The Epics===
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, 
Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, 
Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, 
Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, 
Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-defence, criminal law, and war===
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K. Klostermaier]] (1996), in Harvey Leonard Dyck and Peter Brock (Ed), The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective, see ''Chapter on Himsa and Ahimsa Traditions in Hinduism'', {{ISBN|978-0-8020-0777-3}}, University of Toronto Press, pages 230–234&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthashastra]] discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003&gt;Paul F. Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about the death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

===Non-human life===
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas (1500–1000 BCE), but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas in post-Vedic period.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest layer of the Vedas, such as the ''Rigveda'', ritual sacrifices of animals and cooking of meat to feed guests are mentioned. This included goat, ox, horse and others.&lt;ref name=brown1&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; However, the text is not uniform in the prescriptive sense. Some verses praise meat as food, while other verses in the Vedas also recommend &quot;abstention from meat&quot;, in particular, &quot;beef&quot;.&lt;ref name=brown1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), ''Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights'', {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marvin Harris, the Vedic literature is inconsistent, with some verses suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption, while others suggesting a taboo on meat-eating.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris (1990), [http://academic.regis.edu/rlumpp/PDF%20files/RT%20201%20India%27s%20Sacred%20Cow.pdf India's sacred cow], ''Anthropology: contemporary perspectives'', 6th edition, Editors: Phillip Whitten &amp; David Hunter, Scott Foresman, {{ISBN|0-673-52074-9}}, pages 201-204&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu texts dated to 1st millennium BC, initially mention meat as food, then evolve to suggestions that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, thereafter evolving to the stance that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt; The late Vedic era literature (pre-500 BCE) condemns all killings of men, cattle, birds and horses, and prays to god [[Agni]] to punish those who kill.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC&amp;pg=PT107 |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books |ISBN=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=15, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:திருவள்ளுவர் கலைப் படைப்பு.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The 5th-century CE Tamil scholar [[Valluvar]], in his ''[[Tirukkural]]'', taught ahimsa and vegetarianism as a personal virtue.]]
Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C.

Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of the Indian religions, such as Hinduism and Jainism, exists in many Indian languages. For example, the ''[[Tirukkural]],'' written in three volumes, likely between 450–500 CE, dedicates verses 251–260 and 321–333 of its [[Aram (Kural book)|first volume]] to the virtue of Ahimsa, particularly [[vegetarianism]] and [[non-killing]] (''kollamai'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamil Zvelebil|title=The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=degUAAAAIAAJ|year=1973|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-03591-5|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Tirukkural'' also glorifies soldiers and their valour during war, and states that it is king's duty to punish criminals and implement &quot;death sentence for the wicked&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ananthanathan315&gt;{{cite journal|title= Theory and Functions of the State The Concept of aṟam (virtue) in Tirukkural| author= A.K.

===Yoga===
Ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of [[Patañjali]]'s eight limb [[Raja yoga]] system. It is included in the first limb and is the first of five [[Yamas]] (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy.&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

The significance of Ahimsa as the very first restraint in the very first limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word, and deed]] through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.

In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] &quot;Great Vows&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' (or, &quot;'''Non-injury'''/nonviolence/harmlessness '''is the supreme'''/ultimate/paramount/highest/absolute '''duty'''/virtue/attribute/religion&quot; — slashes are used here to present alternative denotations) is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the &quot;Fourfold Restraint&quot; (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is prescribed.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jain monks and nuns go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the renouncers and the laypeople of Jain faith reject meat, fish, alcohol and honey as these are believed to harm large or minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaina scholars have debated the potential injury to other life forms during one's occupation. Certain Jain texts, states Padmannabh Jaini – a Jainism scholar, forbid people of its faith from husbandry, agriculture and trade in animal-derived products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sethia2004p51&quot;/&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; These teachings, in part, have led the Jain community to focus on trade, merchant, clerical and administrative occupations to minimize ''arambhaja-himsa'' (occupational violence against all life forms).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sethia2004p51&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmannabh Jaini|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jaininsm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn= 978-81-208-2036-4|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the layperson, the teaching has been of ahimsa with ''pramada'' – that is, reducing violence through proper intention and being careful in every action on a daily basis to minimize violence to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002), pp. 161-162&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts, unlike most Hindu and Buddhist texts on just war, have been inconsistent. For its monastic community – ''sadhu'' and ''sadhvi'' – the historically accepted practice has been to &quot;willingly sacrifice one's own life&quot; to the attacker, to not retaliate, so that the mendicant may keep the First Great Vow of &quot;total nonviolence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sethia2004p51&quot;/&gt; Jain literature of the 10th century, for example, describes a king ready for war and being given lessons about non-violence by the Jain acharya (spiritual teacher).&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw (1995), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century and thereafter, in an era of violent raids, destruction of temples, the slaughter of agrarian communities and ascetics by Islamic armies, Jain scholars reconsidered the First Great Vow of mendicants and its parallel for the laypeople. The medieval texts of this era, such as by Jinadatta Suri, recommended both the mendicants and the laypeople to fight and kill if that would prevent greater and continued violence on humans and other life forms (''virodhi-himsa'').&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002), pp. 162-163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Padmannabh Jaini|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jaininsm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn= 978-81-208-2036-4|pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exemptions to ahimsa is a relatively rare teaching in Jain texts, states Dundas.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas (2002), pp. 162-163&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] stated, &quot;No religion in the World has explained the principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism. As and when the benevolent principle of ''Ahiṃsā'' or non-violence will be ascribed for practice by the people of the world to achieve their end of life in this world and beyond, Jainism is sure to have the uppermost status and Mahāvīra is sure to be respected as the greatest authority on ''Ahiṃsā''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pandey|first=Janardan|title=Gandhi and 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmJnWrjnfjMC&amp;pg=PA50|year=1998|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-672-7|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism}}
In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams2005p398&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br/&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55&quot;&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for laypersons, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

{{Quote|

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

===War===
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raaflaub|first=Kurt A.|title=War and Peace in the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61|date=2006-12-18|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-4051-4525-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pāli Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal queen/king as a pacifist, such a queen/king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41&quot;&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41&quot;/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as she/he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if she/he is killed in battle while her/his mind is seized with the intention to kill, she/he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi &quot;is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue&quot;, while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''&quot;Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any.&quot;'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

==Modern times==
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] promoted the principle of Ahimsa very successfully by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics.]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as [[Shrimad Rajchandra|Shrimad Rajchandraji]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pyarelal|title=Mahatma Gandhi-the Early Phase|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8P0KAQAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Navajivan Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Swami Vivekananda]]&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasised the importance of Ahimsa.

[[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] successfully promoted the principle of Ahimsa to all spheres of life, in particular to politics ([[Swaraj]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 116–124.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent resistance movement [[satyagraha]] had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various [[civil and political rights]] movements such as the American civil rights movement's [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[James Bevel]]. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa.&lt;ref name=&quot;XXII-XLVII 1986, p. 11-12&quot;&gt;Walli pp. XXII-XLVII; Borman, William: ''Gandhi and Non-Violence'', Albany 1986, p. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, &quot;Divine Truth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson pp. 39–54. Religion East &amp; West. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Aurobindo]] criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gandhi stated his belief that &quot;Ahimsa is in Hinduism, it is in Christianity as well as in Islam.&quot;&lt;ref name=par/&gt; He added, &quot;Nonviolence is common to all religions, but it has found the highest expression and application in Hinduism (I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism).&quot;&lt;ref name=par/&gt; When questioned whether violence and non-violence is both taught in Quran, he stated, &quot;I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence. (...&amp;nbsp;The) argument about non-violence in the Holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis.&quot;&lt;ref name=par&gt;Prabhu and Rao (1966), [http://gandhiashramsevagram.org/pdf-books/mind-of-mahatma-gandhi.pdf The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi], Encyclopedia of Gandhi's Thoughts, p. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mgarat&gt;Gandhi, Mahatma. 1962. ''All Religions are True.'' Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. p. 128.; Banshlal Ramnauth, Dev. 1989. ''Mahatma Gandhi: Insight and Impact.'' Indira Gandhi Centre for Indian Culture &amp; Mahatma Gandhi Institute. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical and philosophical study of Ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s principle of &quot;reverence for life&quot;. Schweitzer praised Indian philosophical and religious traditions for the ethics of Ahimsa: &quot;the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of humankind&quot;, but suggested that &quot;not-killing and not-harming&quot; is not always practically possible as in self-defence, nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Albert: [https://archive.org/stream/indianthoughtsan027860mbp#page/n95/mode/2up Indian Thought and its Development], London 1956, pages 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;
