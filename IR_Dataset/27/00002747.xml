The '''Arabian Sea''' is a region of the northern [[Indian Ocean]] bounded on the north by [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]], on the west by the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Guardafui Channel]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], on the southeast by the [[Laccadive Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Banse, Karl, and Charles R. McClain. &quot;Winter blooms of phytoplankton in the Arabian Sea as observed by the Coastal Zone Color Scanner.&quot; Marine Ecology Progress Series (1986): 201-211.&lt;/ref&gt; on the southwest by the [[Somali Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;Pham, J. Peter. &quot;Putting Somali piracy in context.&quot; Journal of Contemporary African Studies 28.3 (2010): 325-341.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the east by [[India]]. Its total area is 3,862,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,491,000&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) and its maximum depth is 4,652 meters (15,262&amp;nbsp;ft). The [[Gulf of Aden]] in the west connects the Arabian Sea to the [[Red Sea]] through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], and the [[Gulf of Oman]] is in the northwest, connecting it to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Arabian Sea has been crossed by many important marine trade routes since the third or second millennium BCE. Major seaports include [[Kandla|Kandla Port]], [[Okha Port]], [[Mumbai Port Trust|Mumbai Port]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru Port|Nhava Sheva Port (Navi Mumbai)]], [[Mormugao|Mormugão Port (Goa)]], [[New Mangalore Port]] and [[Cochin Port|Kochi Port]] in [[India]], the [[Port of Karachi]], [[Port Qasim]], and the [[Gwadar Port]] in [[Pakistan]], [[Chabahar Port]] in [[Iran]] and the [[Port of Salalah]] in [[Salalah]], [[Oman]]. The largest islands in the Arabian Sea include [[Socotra]] (Yemen), [[Masirah Island]] (Oman), [[Lakshadweep]] (India) and [[Astola Island]] (Pakistan).

==Geography==
[[File:Arabian Sea - October 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Arabian Sea from space]]
The Arabian Sea's surface area is about {{convert|3862000|km2|sqmi|-1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31653/Arabian-Sea Arabian Sea], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum width of the Sea is approximately {{convert|2400|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}}, and its maximum depth is {{convert|4652|m|ft|0}}. The biggest river flowing into the Sea is the [[Indus River]].

The Arabian Sea has two important branches&amp;nbsp;— the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the southwest, connecting with the [[Red Sea]] through the strait of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]; and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to the northwest, connecting with the [[Persian Gulf]]. There are also the gulfs of [[Gulf of Khambhat|Khambhat]] and [[Gulf of Kutch|Kutch]] on the [[Coastal South West India|Indian Coast]].

[[File:PeriplusAncientMap.jpg|thumb|right|17th century map depicting the locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]
The countries with coastlines on the Arabian Sea are [[Somalia]], [[Yemen]], [[Oman]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and the [[Maldives]]. There are several large cities on the sea's coast including [[Malé]], [[Kavaratti]], [[Kanyakumari|Cape Comorin (Kanyakumari)]], [[Colachel]], [[Kovalam]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Kollam]], [[Alappuzha]], [[Kochi]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Kannur]], [[Kasaragod]],  [[Mangalore]], [[Bhatkal]], [[Karwar]], [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco]], [[Panjim]], [[Malvan]],  [[Ratnagiri]], [[Alibag]], [[Mumbai]], [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], [[Valsad]], [[Surat]], [[Bharuch]], [[Khambhat]], [[Bhavnagar]], [[Diu, India|Diu]], [[Somnath]], [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]], [[Porbandar]], [[Dwarka]], [[Okha, Gujarat|Okha]], [[Jamnagar]], [[Kandla]], [[Gandhidham]], [[Mundra]], [[Koteshwar, Kutch|Koteshwar]], [[Keti Bandar]], [[Karachi]], [[Ormara]], [[Pasni City|Pasni]], [[Gwadar]], [[Chabahar]], [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Duqm]], [[Salalah]], [[Al Ghaydah]], [[Aden]], [[Bargal]], and [[Hafun]].&lt;!-- Some of these are not &quot;large cities&quot; by any reasonable definition of the term. --&gt;

===Limits===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Arabian Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf |title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition |year=1953 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization |accessdate=7 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008191433/http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On the west: the eastern limit of the [[Gulf of Aden]] [the meridian of [[Cape Guardafui]] (Ras Asir, 51°16'E)].
*On the north: a line joining [[Ras al Hadd|Ràs al Hadd]], east point of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (22°32'N) and [[Jiwani|Ràs Jiyùni]] (61°43'E) on the coast of [[Pakistan]].
*On the south: a line running from the southern extremity of [[Addu Atoll]] in the [[Maldives]], to the eastern extremity of [[Ras Hafun|Ràs Hafun]] (the easternmost point of Africa, 10°26'N).
*On the east: the western limit of the [[Laccadive Sea]] a line running from [[Sadashivgad]] on the west coast of India ({{coord|14|48|N|74|07|E}}) to [[Cora Divh]] ({{coord|13|42|N|72|10|E}}) and thence down the west side of the [[Lakshadweep|Laccadive]] and [[Maldives|Maldive]] archipelagos to the most southerly point of [[Addu Atoll]] in the Maldives.

==Alternative names==
The Arabian Sea historically and geographically has been referred to with many different names by [[Arabian]] and European geographers and travelers, including Indian Sea, [[Sindh]]u Sagar,&lt;ref name=Kamat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/indica/geography/arabian_sea.htm|title=Kamat's Potpourri: The Arabian Sea|work=kamat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darya, Sindhu Sagar, and Arab Samudra,&lt;ref name=Kamat /&gt; Erythraean Sea,&lt;ref name=Periplus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/periplus.html|title=The Voyage around the Erythraean Sea|work=washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sindh Sea, and Akhzar Sea. In Indian folklore, it is referred to as Darya, Sindhu Sagar, and Arab Samudra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kamat.com/indica/geography/arabian_sea.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/periplus.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/8583367/The-Periplus-of-the-Erythraean-Sea&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scribd.com/doc/8583367/The-Periplus-of-the-Erythraean-Sea&lt;/ref&gt;

About 70 percent of coastline and 90 percent of population of Arabian Sea area isn't Arab. There is no historical map of more than 300 years with the Arabian Sea name.

==Trade routes==

The Arabian Sea has been an important [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[trade route]] since the era of the ''coastal sailing vessels'' from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, certainly the late 2nd millennium BCE through the later days known as the [[Age of Sail]]. By the time of [[Julius Caesar]], several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon [[water transport]] through the Sea around the rough inland [[terrain feature]]s to its north.
[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|left|thumb|Names, routes and locations of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'']]
These routes usually began in the [[Far East]] or down river from [[Madhya Pradesh]] with [[transshipment]] via historic [[Bharuch]] (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's [[Iran]] then split around [[Hadhramaut]] into two streams north into the [[Gulf of Aden]] and thence into the [[Levant]], or south into [[Alexandria]] via [[Red Sea]] ports such as [[Axum]]. Each major route involved transhipping to [[camel train|pack animal caravan]], travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentates.

This southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]] ([[Yemen]] and [[Oman]] today) was significant, and the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]]s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's [[Suez canal]], and another from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Nile River]], both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge [[sand storm]]s in antiquity. Later the [[kingdom of Axum]] arose in [[Ethiopia]] to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.

===Major ports===
[[File:Container terminal.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Kochi Port]] located on the south-west coast of India is the nearest Indian port to the international shipping routes, as well as one of the largest and busiest ports serving the Arabian Sea. Seen here is the [[International Container Transshipment Terminal, Kochi|International Container Transshipment Terminal]], the only such facility in India.]]

The [[Port of Karachi]] is [[Pakistan]]'s largest and busiest seaport. It is located between the Karachi towns of [[Kiamari]] and [[Saddar]].

The [[Gwadar Port]] is a warm-water, deep-sea port situated at [[Gwadar]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]] at the apex of the Arabian Sea and at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, about 460&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Karachi]] and approximately 75&amp;nbsp;km (47&amp;nbsp;mi) east of Pakistan's border with [[Iran]]. The port is located on the eastern bay of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula jutting out into the Arabian Sea from the coastline.

[[Port of Salalah]] in [[Salalah]], [[Oman]] is also a major port in the area. The International Task Force often uses the port as a base. There is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port, which makes it a very safe bubble. The port handled just under 3.5m teu (twenty-foot equivalent unit, a measure used for capacity in container transportation) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portofsalalah.com/port_news_item.aspx?id=16655 Salalah’s versatility beats the slump] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025024826/http://www.portofsalalah.com/port_news_item.aspx?id=16655 |date=October 25, 2012 }}, Port of Salalah&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jawaharlal Nehru Port]] in [[Mumbai]] is the largest port in the Arabian Sea, and the largest container port in India.
Major [[India]]n ports in the Arabian Sea are [[Mundra Port]], [[Kandla Port]], [[Nava Sheva]], [[Kochi Port]], [[Mumbai Port]], and  [[Mormugão]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shipping.gov.in/writereaddata/l892s/7yearsTRAFFIC-42175832.pdf|title=TRAFFIC HANDLED AT MAJOR PORTS (LAST 7 YEARS)|website=shipping.gov.in}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aapa.files.cms-plus.com/PDFs/WORLD%20PORT%20RANKINGS%202009.pdf|title=WORLD PORT RANKINGS|year=2009|website=aapa.files.cms-plus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islands==
There are several islands in the Arabian Sea, with the most important ones being [[Lakshadweep Islands]] ([[India]]), [[Socotra]] ([[Yemen]]), [[Masirah]] ([[Oman]]) and [[Astola Island]] ([[Pakistan]]).

The [[Lakshadweep]] Islands (formerly known as the Laccadive, Minicoy, and Aminidivi Islands) is a group of islands in the Laccadive Sea region of Arabian Sea, 200 to 440&amp;nbsp;km (120 to 270&amp;nbsp;mi) off the southwestern coast of India. The [[archipelago]] is a [[Union Territory]] and is governed by the [[Union Government of India]]. The islands form the smallest Union Territory of India: their total surface area is just {{convert|32|km2|abbr=on}}. The lagoon area covers about {{convert|4200|km2|abbr=on}}, the territorial waters area {{convert|20000|km2|abbr=on}} and the exclusive economic zone area {{convert|400000|km2|abbr=on}}. The islands are the northernmost of the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge|Lakshadweep-Maldives-Chagos]] group of islands.

Astola Island, also known as ''Jezira Haft Talar'' in [[Balochi language|Balochi]], or 'Island of the Seven Hills', is a small, uninhabited island in the northern tip of the Arabian Sea in Pakistan's territorial waters.

[[File:Socotra satview.jpg|thumb|right|Landsat view over [[Socotra]], a Yemeni island.]]
[[Socotra]], also spelled ''Soqotra'', is the largest island, being part of a small [[archipelago]] of four islands. It lies some {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and {{convert|380|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

[[Masirah]] is an [[island]] off the east coast of [[Oman]].

==Dead zone==
The [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]] is an area in the Gulf of Oman that is completely depleted of oxygen, as a result of which it does not support marine life. It is the world's largest-known dead zone with an area larger than that of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/environment/index.ssf/2018/05/worlds_largest_dead_zone_disco.html|title=World's largest 'dead zone' discovered, and it's not in the Gulf of Mexico|author=|date=|website=nola.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
