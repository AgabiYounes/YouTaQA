'''AutoCAD''' is a [[commercial software|commercial]] [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[technical drawing|drafting]] software application. Developed and marketed by [[Autodesk]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lendio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Autodesk, Inc |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Autodesk-Inc-company-History.html| publisher= Lendio | accessdate = 29 March 2012| work =FundingUniverse| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop app running on [[microcomputer]]s with internal [[graphics controller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadhistory.net/08%20Autodesk%20and%20AutoCAD.pdf |title=Chapter 8 : Autodesk and AutoCAD |website=Cadhistory.net |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before AutoCAD was introduced, most commercial CAD programs ran on [[mainframe computer]]s or [[minicomputer]]s, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate [[graphics terminal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadhistory.net/02%20Brief%20Overview.pdf |title=Chapter 2 : A Brief Overview of the History of CAD |website=Cadhistory.net |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, AutoCAD was released as a [[Mobile app|mobile-]] and [[web app]] as well, marketed as AutoCAD 360.

AutoCAD is used in industry, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, city planners and  other professionals. It was supported by 750 training centers worldwide in 1994.&lt;ref name=Lendio /&gt;

== Introduction ==
AutoCAD was derived from a program that began in 1977, and then released in 1979&lt;ref name=RiddleAbout&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle|first=Michael|title=About|url=http://www.michaelriddle.com/?page_id=2|accessdate=24 January 2014|quote=I’ve been building CAD products for over 29 years now, starting with Interact for the Marinchip 9900 released back in 1979, one of the first PC-based CAD programs available. Interact went on to become the architectural basis for the early versions of AutoCAD. I was one of the original 18 founders of that company.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  called [[Interact CAD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2012/01/the-fascinating-story-of-how-autodesk-came-to-be-part-1/ |title = The Fascinating Story of How Autodesk Came to be (Part 1)|date = 2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.michaelriddle.com/?page_id=2 | title=Michael Riddle's Thoughts » About}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.retrothing.com/2007/05/mike_riddles_pr.html | title=Mike Riddle's Prehistoric AutoCAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD, which was written prior to Autodesk's (then Marinchip Software Partners) formation by Autodesk cofounder Michael Riddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=John|title=Information letter #5|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_9_7.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=1 May 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=3DCADWorld&gt;{{cite web|last=Yare|first=Evan|title=AutoCAD's Ancestor|url=http://www.3dcadworld.com/autocads-ancestor/|publisher=3D CAD World|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=17 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version by Autodesk was demonstrated at the 1982 [[Comdex]] and released that December. AutoCAD supported [[CP/M]]-80 computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=One Company's CAD Success Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39|publisher=InfoWorld|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=3 December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Autodesk's flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=25 Year retrospective|chapter-url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2002/Volume-25-Issue-2-Feb-2002-/25-YEAR-RETROSPECTIVE-br-Part-2-CAD-CAM-CAE.aspx|year=2011|chapter=Part 2 CAD/CAM/CAE|publisher=Computer Graphics World|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2020 release marked the 34th major release of AutoCAD for [[Windows]]. The 2019 release marked the ninth consecutive year of AutoCAD for [[macOS|Mac]]. The native file format of AutoCAD is [[.dwg]]. This and, to a lesser extent, its interchange file format ''[[DXF]]'', have become de facto, if proprietary, standards for CAD data [[interoperability]], particularly for 2D drawing exchange.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} AutoCAD has included support for [[Design Web Format|.dwf]], a format developed and promoted by Autodesk, for publishing CAD data.

== Features ==
=== Compatibility with other software ===
ESRI ArcMap 10 permits export as AutoCAD drawing files. Civil 3D permits export as AutoCAD objects and as [[LandXML]]. Third-party [[file converter]]s exist for specific formats such as Bentley MX GENIO Extension, PISTE Extension (France), ISYBAU (Germany), OKSTRA and [[Microdrainage]] (UK);&lt;ref name=&quot;autodesk civil3d ug 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/civil_users_guide0.pdf | title=AutoCAD Civil 3D 2011 Drawing Compatibility | publisher=[[Autodesk]] | work=AutoCAD Civil 3D 2011 User's Guide | date=April 2010 | accessdate=January 29, 2013 | pages=141{{ndash}}142}}&lt;/ref&gt; also, conversion of [[.pdf]] files is feasible, however, the accuracy of the results may be unpredictable or distorted. For example, jagged edges may appear. Several vendors provide online conversions for free such as Cometdocs.

=== Language ===
Auto CAD and AutoCAD LT are available for English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Chinese Simplified]], [[Chinese Traditional]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (also through additional language packs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autocad-2016-language-packs.html|title=AutoCAD 2016 Language Packs {{!}} AutoCAD {{!}} Autodesk Knowledge Network|website=knowledge.autodesk.com|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of localization varies from full translation of the product to documentation only. The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization.

=== Extensions ===
AutoCAD supports a number of [[application program interface|API]]s for customization and automation. These include [[AutoLISP]], [[Visual LISP]], [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] and [[ObjectARX]]. ObjectARX is a [[C++]] class library, which was also the base for:
* products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields
* creating products such as [[AutoCAD Architecture]], AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Civil 3D
* third-party AutoCAD-based application
There are a large number of AutoCAD plugins (add-on applications) available on the application store Autodesk Exchange Apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Exchange Apps|url=http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
AutoCAD's [[DXF]], drawing exchange format, allows importing and exporting drawing information.

=== Vertical integration ===
Autodesk has also developed a few vertical programs for discipline-specific enhancements such as:

* AutoCAD Advance Steel
* [[AutoCAD Architecture]]
* AutoCAD CIVIL 3D
* AutoCAD Electrical
* AutoCAD ecscad
* AutoCAD Map 3D
* AutoCAD Mech
* AutoCAD MEP
* AutoCAD Structural Detailing
* AutoCAD Utility Design
* AutoCAD P&amp;ID
* AutoCAD Plant 3D

Since AutoCAD 2019 several verticals are included with AutoCAD subscription as Industry-Specific Toolset. 

For example, [[AutoCAD Architecture]] (formerly Architectural Desktop) permits architectural designers to draw 3D objects, such as walls, doors, and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them rather than simple objects, such as lines and circles. The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented.

Additional tools generate standard 2D drawings, such as elevations and sections, from a 3D architectural model. Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional support data-specific objects facilitating easy standard civil engineering calculations and representations.

Softdesk Civil was developed as an AutoCAD add-on by a company in New Hampshire called Softdesk (originally DCA).  Softdesk was acquired by Autodesk, and Civil became Land Development Desktop (LDD), later renamed Land Desktop. Civil 3D was later developed and Land Desktop was retired.

== Variants ==
=== AutoCAD LT ===
AutoCAD LT is the lower cost version of AutoCAD, with reduced capabilities, first released in November 1993. Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT to have an entry-level CAD package to compete in the lower price level. Priced at $495, it became the first AutoCAD product priced below $1000. It was sold directly by Autodesk and in computer stores unlike the full version of AutoCAD, which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers. AutoCAD LT 2015 introduced Desktop Subscription from $360 per year; as of 2018, three subscription plans were available, from $50 a month to a 3-year, $1170 license.

While there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT, there are a few recognized major differences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_lt_2011_faq.pdf |title=Questions and Answers |website=Images.autodesk.com |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the software's features:

* 3D Capabilities: AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create, visualize and render 3D models as well as 3D printing.
* Network Licensing: AutoCAD LT cannot be used on multiple machines over a network.
* Customization: AutoCAD LT does not support customization with LISP, ARX, .NET and VBA.
* Management and automation capabilities with Sheet Set Manager and Action Recorder.
* CAD standards management tools.

=== AutoCAD 360 ===
Formerly marketed as AutoCAD WS, AutoCAD 360 is an account-based mobile and web application enabling registered users to view, edit, and share AutoCAD files via mobile device and web&lt;ref name=iTgunes&gt;{{cite web|last=Autodesk|title=AutoCAD WS|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autocad-ws/id393149734?mt=8|work=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a limited AutoCAD feature set &amp;mdash; and using cloud-stored drawing files.  The program, which is an evolution and combination of previous products, uses a [[freemium]] business model with a free plan and two paid levels &amp;mdash; marketed as Pro ($4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly) and Pro Plus ($99.99 yearly) &amp;mdash; including various amounts of storage, tools, and online access to drawings. 360 includes new features such as a &quot;Smart Pen&quot; mode and linking to third-party cloud-based storage such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Having evolved from Flash-based software, AutoCAD 360 uses [[HTML5]] browser technology available in newer browsers including Firefox and Google Chrome.

AutoCAD WS began with a version for the [[iPhone]] and subsequently expanded to include versions for the [[iPod Touch]], [[iPad]], Android phones, and Android tablets.&lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac and AutoCAD WS application for iPad and iPhone|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/21266|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk released the [[iOS]] version in September 2010,&lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac 2012: Built for Mac OS X Lion|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/23640|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; following with the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version on April 20, 2011.&lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD WS for Android|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/22874|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is available via download at no cost from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] ([[iOS]]), [[Google Play]] ([[Android (operating system)|Android]]) and [[Amazon Appstore]] (Android).

In its initial iOS version, AutoCAD WS supported drawing of lines, circles, and other shapes; creation of text and comment boxes; and management of color, layer, and measurements &amp;mdash; in both landscape and portrait modes. Version 1.3, released August 17, 2011, added support for unit typing, layer visibility, area measurement and file management.&lt;ref name=&quot;iTgunes&quot; /&gt; The Android variant includes the iOS feature set along with such unique features as the ability to insert text or captions by voice command as well as manually.&lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/&gt; Both Android and iOS versions allow the user to save files on-line &amp;mdash; or off-line in the absence of an Internet connection.&lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/&gt;

In 2011, Autodesk announced plans to migrate the majority of its software to &quot;[[cloud computing|the cloud]]&quot;, starting with the AutoCAD WS mobile application.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Autodesk Shifts Design Apps to the Cloud|url=https://www.dexigner.com/news/23929|work=The A Register|publisher=The A Register|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 interview with Ilai Rotbaein, an AutoCAD WS [[Application software|Product]] Manager for Autodesk, the name '''''AutoCAD WS''''' had no definitive meaning, and was interpreted variously as ''Autodesk Web Service'', ''White Sheet'' or ''Work Space.''&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student versions ===
AutoCAD is licensed, for free, to students, educators, and educational institutions, with a 36-month renewable license available. The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception: DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the &quot;educational flag&quot;). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD (commercial or student) older than AutoCAD 2014 SP1 or AutoCAD 2019 and newer, the output includes a plot stamp/banner on all four sides. Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use. Student Version objects &quot;infect&quot; a commercial version DWG file if they are imported in versions older than AutoCAD 2015 or newer than AutoCAD 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2011/ENU/filesAUG/WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-6050.htm|title=Overview of Plotting|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ports ==

===  Windows ===
[[File:Detail Autocad.jpg|thumb|An architectural detail drafted in AutoCAD (Windows)]]
AutoCAD is a software package created for Windows and usually, any new AutoCAD version supports the current Windows version and some older ones. AutoCAD 2016 to 2020 support Windows 7 up to Windows 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-AutoCAD-2016.html|title=System requirements for AutoCAD 2016 &amp;#124; AutoCAD &amp;#124; Autodesk Knowledge Network|date=2015-12-16|publisher=Knowledge.autodesk.com|accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mac  ===
Autodesk stopped supporting Apple's [[Macintosh]] computers in 1994. Over the next several years, no compatible versions for the Mac were released. In 2010 Autodesk announced that it would once again support Apple's Mac OS X software in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/16/autodesk-adopts-apple-app-store-for-mac-software/?KEYWORDS=AutoCAD|title=Autodesk Adopts Apple App Store for Mac Software|last=Clark|first=Don|date=16 August 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the features found in the 2012 Windows version can be found in the 2012 Mac version. The main difference is the user interface and layout of the program. The interface is designed so that users who are already familiar with Apple's [[macOS]] software will find it similar to other Mac applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;OzlerBuiltForMac&quot; /&gt; Autodesk has also built in various features in order to take full advantage of Apple's Trackpad capabilities as well as the full-screen mode in Apple's [[OS X Lion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OzlerMaciPadiPhone&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OzlerBuiltForMac&quot; /&gt; AutoCAD 2012 for Mac supports both the editing and saving of files in DWG formatting that will allow the file to be compatible with other platforms besides the OS X.&lt;ref name=&quot;OzlerMaciPadiPhone&quot; /&gt; AutoCAD 2019 for Mac requires Apple OS X v10.11 (El Capitan) or later.

AutoCAD LT 2013 was available through the [[Mac App Store]] for $899.99. The full-featured version of AutoCAD 2013 for Mac, however, wasn't available through the Mac App Store due to the price limit of $999 set by Apple. AutoCAD 2014 for Mac was available for purchase from Autodesk's Web site for $4,195 and AutoCAD LT 2014 for Mac for $1,200, or from an Autodesk Authorized Reseller.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/16/autodesk-adopts-apple-app-store-for-mac-software/?KEYWORDS=AutoCAD|title=Autodesk Adopts Apple App Store for Mac Software|last=Clark|first=Don|date=16 August 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version available for Mac is AutoCAD 2019 as of December 2018. As of 2019, no AutoCAD release is listed for purchase on the Mac App Store.
