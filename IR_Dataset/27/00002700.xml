==History==
The district was traditionally associated with the [[coal mining]] collieries, [[ironworks]] and [[tinplate]] works of the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[South Wales Valleys]], although all have now &lt;span style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;closed;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/199469 Post Office: Abercarn Royal Mail Sorting Office:: OS grid ST2194 :: Geograph British Isles - photograph every grid square!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the town, which lies in the middle portion of the [[Ebbw River|Ebbw]] valley, being situated on the south-eastern flank of the once great mining region of [[Glamorgan]] and [[Monmouthshire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abercarn|volume=1|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/423436 Jamesville, Abercarn:: OS grid ST2193 :: Geograph British Isles - photograph every grid square!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local government==
The area was part of the ancient [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] [[parish]] of [[Mynyddislwyn]] until the late 19th century. In 1892 a [[local board of health]] and local government district of Abercarn was formed.&lt;ref&gt;Formed as Newbridge local board and local government district on 17 March 1892, renamed Abercarn on 4 July that year. County Census Report 1670, Monmouthshire&lt;/ref&gt; This became Abercarn urban district in 1894, governed by an urban district council of twelve members. Under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] the urban district was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the borough of [[Islwyn]], [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. Further local government organisation in 1996 placed the area in the county borough of Caerphilly. The former urban district corresponds to the three communities of Abercarn, [[Crumlin, Caerphilly|Crumlin]] and [[Newbridge, Caerphilly|Newbridge]].

Abercarn is home to [[Abercarn RFC|Abercarn Rugby Club]] which is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union, and to Abercarn United Football Club which plays in division one of the [[Gwent County League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abercarn United AFC|url=http://www.abercarnunited.co.uk/club/Home|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 the company was affiliated with the new formed 1st Cadet Battalion, [[The Monmouthshire Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/780443267|title=The Territorials : 1908-1914 : a guide for military and family historians|last=Westlake, Ray.|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781848843608|location=Barnsley, South Yorkshire|oclc=780443267}}&lt;/ref&gt;
