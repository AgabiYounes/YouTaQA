'''Astrobiology''', formerly known as '''exobiology''', is an interdisciplinary scientific field concerned with the [[abiogenesis|origins]], [[Protocell|early evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]].

== Overview ==
The term was first proposed by the Russian ([[Soviet]]) astronomer [[Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov|Gavriil Tikhov]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cockell |first=Charles S. |title='Astrobiology' and the ethics of new science |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42790151 |date=2001 |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews  |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=90–96 |doi=10.1179/0308018012772533}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Astrobiology'' is etymologically derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}}, ''astron'', &quot;constellation, star&quot;; {{lang|grc|βίος}}, ''bios'', &quot;life&quot;; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', ''study''. The synonyms of astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: [[astronomy]] and [[biology]]. A close synonym is ''exobiology'' from the Greek {{lang|grc|Έξω}}, &quot;external&quot;; Βίος, ''bios'', &quot;life&quot;; and λογία, -logia, ''study''. The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist and Nobel Prize winner [[Joshua Lederberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/BB/p-nid/32 Launching a New Science: Exobiology and the Exploration of Space] ''The National Library of Medicine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth, whereas subject area of astrobiology is wider and investigates the link between life and the [[universe]], which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes the study of life on Earth, its origin, evolution and limits.

Another term used in the past is [[xenobiology]], (&quot;biology of the foreigners&quot;) a word used in 1954 by science fiction writer [[Robert Heinlein]] in his work ''[[The Star Beast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinlein R, Harold W|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Xenobiology |journal=Science |date=21 July 1961 |pages=223–225 | doi=10.1126/science.134.3473.223 |pmid=17818726 |jstor=1708323 |volume=134 |issue=3473|bibcode = 1961Sci...134..223H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean &quot;biology based on foreign chemistry&quot;, whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Since alternate chemistry analogs to some life-processes have been created in the laboratory, xenobiology is now considered as an extant subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markus Schmidt | title=Xenobiology: A new form of life as the ultimate biosafety tool | journal=BioEssays | date=9 March 2010 | pages=322–331 | doi=10.1002/bies.200900147 | volume=32 | issue=4 | pmid=20217844 | pmc=2909387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, NASA launched the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission carrying the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'']] rover, which [[Curiosity rover#Landing|landed]] on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Crater&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Webster |first1=Guy |last2=Brown |first2=Dwayne |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover To Land At Gale Crater |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[NASA JPL]] |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-222#1 |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Crater2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1= Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Crater3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate = 22 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722170810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524| archivedate= 22 July 2011| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curiosity'' rover is currently probing the environment for past and present [[planetary habitability]] of [[microbe|microbial]] [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].

==Methodology==

=== Planetary habitability ===
{{Main|Planetary habitability}}

When looking for life on other planets like Earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on [[Carbon-based life|carbon chemistries]], as are all life forms on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: An Interview With Dr. Farid Salama |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2000 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620075201/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/index.php?page=interview07 |archivedate=20 June 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of [[molecule]]s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant element]] in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and [[organic compound|complex molecules]].

The presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/astrobiology-spsc-04/ |title=Astrobiology |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan Science Library: Space Sciences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers posit environments of water-[[ammonia]] mixtures as possible solvents for [[hypothetical types of biochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2057.html |title=The Ammonia-Oxidizing Gene |accessdate=20 October 2008 |author=Penn State |date=19 August 2006 |publisher=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting [[Sun]]-like [[star]]s for increased probabilities of [[planetary habitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |title=Stars and Habitable Planets |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2007 |publisher=Sol Company |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001194624/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |archivedate=1 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on [[planet]]s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be [[Tidal lock|tidally &quot;locked&quot;]] to the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/display/?id=223364&amp;source=r |title=M Dwarfs: The Search for Life is On |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=29 August 2005 |publisher=Red Orbit &amp; [[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The long lifetimes of [[red dwarf]]s could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See [[Habitability of red dwarf systems]]).

Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor [[life]], there is no evident way to know if any of these simplifying assumptions are correct.

===Communication attempts===
{{Main|Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence}}
[[File:Pioneer10-plaque tilt.jpg|right|thumb|The illustration on the [[Pioneer plaque]] ]]
Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence ([[Communication with extraterrestrial intelligence|CETI]]) focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the [[Arecibo message]] and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The [[SETI]] program, for example, uses both [[radio telescope]]s and [[optical telescope]]s to search for deliberate signals from an [[extraterrestrial intelligence]].

While some high-profile scientists, such as [[Carl Sagan]], have advocated the transmission of messages,&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Carl. Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence. MIT Press, 1973, 428 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/you-never-get-a-seventh-chance-to-make-a-first-impression-an-awkward-history-of-our-space-transmissions/| title=You Never Get a Seventh Chance to Make a First Impression: An Awkward History of Our Space Transmissions| work=Lightspeed Magazine| accessdate=13 March 2015| date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; scientist [[Stephen Hawking]] warned against it, suggesting that aliens might simply raid Earth for its resources and then move on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/25/stephen-hawking-aliens_n_551035.html|title=Stephen Hawking: Humans Should Fear Aliens|date=25 June 2010|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements of astrobiology===

==== Astronomy ====
{{Main|Astronomy}}
[[Image:OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb planet.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of the [[extrasolar planet]] [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] orbiting its star 20,000 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]]; this planet was discovered with [[gravitational microlensing]].]]
[[Image:Telescope Kepler-NASA.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[NASA]] [[Kepler mission]], launched in March 2009, searches for [[extrasolar planets]].]]
Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of [[extrasolar planet]] (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably [[NASA]]'s [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) and [[European Space Agency|ESA's]] [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' mission]] in March 2009, and the [[French Space Agency]] launched the [[COROT]] space mission in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/ |title=Kepler Mission |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031070350/http://kepler.nasa.gov/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |title=The COROT space telescope |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=17 October 2008 |publisher=CNES |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108130307/http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/ |archivedate=8 November 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied [[spectroscopy|spectroscopically]]. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vpl.astro.washington.edu/main/about_vpl.html |title=The Virtual Planet Laboratory |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=2008 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent ''communicative'' [[extraterrestrial life]] can be gleaned from the [[Drake equation]], essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm |title=What is the Drake Equation? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Ford |first=Steve |date=August 1995 |publisher=SETI League | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081029212425/http://www.setileague.org/general/drake.htm| archivedate= 29 October 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N = R^{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* '''''N''''' = The number of communicative civilizations
* '''''R*''''' = The rate of formation of suitable stars (stars such as our Sun)
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those stars with planets (current evidence indicates that planetary systems may be common for stars like the Sun)
* '''''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The number of Earth-sized worlds per planetary system
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of those Earth-sized planets where life actually develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of life sites where intelligence develops
* '''''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = The fraction of communicative planets (those on which electromagnetic communications technology develops)
* '''''L''''' = The &quot;lifetime&quot; of communicating civilizations

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, '''''R*''''', number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, ''f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'', stars with planets and ''f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/seti/seti_history_07.html|author=Amir Alexander| title=The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Short History – Part 7: The Birth of the Drake Equation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or [[pseudoscientific]] arguments.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 17 January 2011 | date = 26 September 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101212184044/http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html| archivedate= 12 December 2010| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another associated topic is the [[Fermi paradox]], which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the [[universe]], then there should be obvious signs of it.

Another active research area in astrobiology is [[planetary system]] formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the [[Solar System]] (for example, the presence of [[Jupiter]] as a protective shield)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |title=Jupiter: Friend or foe? |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Horner |first=Jonathan |author2=Barrie Jones |date=24 August 2007 |publisher=Europlanet |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202152231/http://www.europlanet-eu.org/demo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=999 |archivedate=2 February 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=3910 |title=The Role of Astrobiology in Solar System Exploration |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last1=Jakosky |first1=Bruce |author2=David Des Marais |date=14 September 2001 |work=NASA |publisher=SpaceRef.com |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1222 |title=Coming Soon: &quot;Good&quot; Jupiters |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Bortman |first=Henry |date=29 September 2004 |work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, has to exist forcibly in an extraterrestrial body. Biologists specify what is speculative and what is not.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt; The discovery of [[extremophiles]], organisms able to survive in extreme environments, became a core research element for astrobiologists, as they are important to understand four areas in the limits of life in planetary context: the potential for [[panspermia]], forward contamination due to human exploration ventures, planetary colonization by humans, and the exploration of extinct and extant extraterrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;[Living at the Extremes: Extremophiles and the Limits of Life in a Planetary Context.] N.

Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the [[Sun]]. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from [[sunlight]] to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the [[food chain]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming [[marine snow|organic detritus rained down from the surface waters]] or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoker&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of [[giant tube worm]]s, [[clam]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[mussel]]s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;smoker&quot;/&gt; These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent [[ecosystem]]. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidization]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulphur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trixler2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trixler|first=F|title=Quantum tunnelling to the origin and evolution of life.|journal=Current Organic Chemistry|date=2013|volume=17|number=16|pages=1758–1770|doi=10.2174/13852728113179990083|pmc=3768233|pmid=24039543}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

Biologists have found extremophiles that thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/050207_extremophiles.html |title=Wild Things: The Most Extreme Creatures |accessdate=20 October 2008 |last=Carey |first=Bjorn |date=7 February 2005 |work=Live Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cavicchioli &gt;{{cite journal| title=Extremophiles and the search for extraterrestrial life|journal=Astrobiology|date=Fall 2002 |first=R. |last=Cavicchioli |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=281–92 |pmid=12530238 |doi=10.1089/153110702762027862 |bibcode = 2002AsBio...2..281C |url=http://somosbacteriasyvirus.com/extremophiles.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.3179}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats.

The origin of life, known as [[abiogenesis]], distinct from the [[Evolution#Evolution of life|evolution of life]], is another ongoing field of research. [[Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]] postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of [[organic compound]]s from [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic elements]] and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth.

{{Main|Astroecology}}
[[Astroecology]] concerns the interactions of life with space environments and resources, in [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns resources for life about [[stars]] in the [[galaxy]] through the cosmological future. Astroecology attempts to quantify future life in space, addressing this area of astrobiology.

==== Astrogeology ====
{{Main|Geology of solar terrestrial planets}}
[[Geology of solar terrestrial planets|Astrogeology]] is a [[planetary science]] discipline concerned with the [[geology]] of [[celestial bodies]] such as the [[planet]]s and their [[moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[meteorite]]s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a [[planet]]'s or a [[natural satellite]]'s potential to develop and sustain [[life]], or [[planetary habitability]].

An additional discipline of astrogeology is [[geochemistry]], which involves study of the [[chemistry|chemical]] composition of the Earth and other [[planet]]s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[soil]]s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the [[hydrosphere]] and the [[atmosphere]] of the planet. Specializations include [[cosmochemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[organic geochemistry]].

The [[fossil record]] provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html |title=Fossil Succession |accessdate=20 October 2008 |date=14 August 1997 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081014190106/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/fossils/succession.html| archivedate= 14 October 2008| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; By examining the fossil evidence, [[paleontologists]] are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the [[Pilbara]] in [[Western Australia]] and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past [[life on Mars]].

The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living [[organism]]. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules.&lt;ref name=BC/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;/&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar those on Earth, in the generality if not in the detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;/&gt; Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique. If life has had a comparable impact elsewhere in the Solar System, the relative abundances of chemicals key for its survival – whatever they may be – could betray its presence. Whatever extraterrestrial life may be, its tendency to chemically alter its environment might just give it away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Michael | title = Telltale chemistry could betray ET | date = 21 January 2011 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20927962.700-telltale-chemistry-could-betray-et.html | work = New Scientists | accessdate = 22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have long speculated about the possibility of life in settings other than Earth, however, speculation on the nature of life elsewhere often has paid little heed to constraints imposed by the nature of biochemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title=The universal nature of biochemist ry| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA| date=30 January 2001|first=Norman R. |last=Pace| volume=98| issue=3| pages=805–808 | pmid=11158550| doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.805| pmc=33372 |bibcode = 2001PNAS...98..805P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood that life throughout the universe is probably carbon-based is suggested by the fact that carbon is one of the most abundant of the higher elements. Only two of the natural atoms, [[carbon]] and [[silicon]], are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon, it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation.

{{Main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}

The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. It provides a possible answer to the [[Fermi paradox]] which suggests, &quot;If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?&quot; It is apparently in opposition to the [[principle of mediocrity]], assumed by famed astronomers [[Frank Drake]], [[Carl Sagan]], and others. The [[Principle of mediocrity|Principle of Mediocrity]] suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, and it is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

;Methane

In 2004, the spectral signature of [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane]] ({{chem|C|H|4}}) was detected in the Martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter. Because of [[solar radiation]] and [[cosmic radiation]], methane is predicted to disappear from the Martian atmosphere within several years, so the gas must be actively replenished in order to maintain the present concentration.&lt;ref name=&quot;results&quot;&gt;

;Planetary systems
It is possible that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's [[Kepler Mission]] seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's [[light curve]] as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimeter astronomy]] has revealed the constituents of other [[star system]]s.

;Planetary habitability
{{main|Planetary habitability}}
Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in [[habitable zone]]s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous [[extrasolar planet]]s have been detected using the [[Doppler spectroscopy|wobble method]] and [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transit method]], showing that planets around other [[star]]s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is [[Gliese 581 c]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gliese&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Ker | last=Than | title=Major Discovery: New Planet Could Harbor Water and Life | date=24 April 2007 | publisher=Space.com | url =http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html | accessdate =20 October 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015075030/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070424_hab_exoplanet.html| archivedate= 15 October 2008| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extremophiles ===
Studying extremophiles is useful for understanding the possible origin of life on Earth as well as for finding the most likely candidates for future colonization of other planets. The aim is to detect those organisms that are able to survive space travel conditions and to maintain the proliferating capacity.  The best candidates are extremophiles, since they have adapted to survive in different kind of extreme conditions on earth. During the course of evolution, extremophiles have developed various strategies to survive the different stress conditions of different extreme environments. These stress responses could also allow them to survive in harsh space conditions.

Thermophilic species G. thermantarcticus is a good example of a microorganism that could survive space travel. It is a bacterium of the spore-forming genus Bacillus. The formation of spores allows for it to survive extreme environments while still being able to restart cellular growth. It is capable of effectively protecting its DNA, membrane and proteins integrity in different extreme conditions (desiccation, temperatures up to -196&amp;nbsp;°C, UVC and C-ray radiation...). It is also able to repair the damage produced by space environment.

By understanding how extremophilic organisms can survive the Earth's extreme environments, we can also understand how microorganisms could have survived space travel and how the panspermia hypothesis could be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Di Donato|first=Paola|last2=Romano|first2=Ida|last3=Mastascusa|first3=Vincenza|last4=Poli|first4=Annarita|last5=Orlando|first5=Pierangelo|last6=Pugliese|first6=Mariagabriella|last7=Nicolaus|first7=Barbara|date=March 2018|title=Survival and Adaptation of the Thermophilic Species Geobacillus thermantarcticus in Simulated Spatial Conditions|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres|volume=48|issue=1|pages=141–158|doi=10.1007/s11084-017-9540-7|issn=0169-6149|bibcode=2018OLEB...48..141D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Missions ==
Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme [[ecosystem]]s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]], [[ExoMars]], [[Mars 2020]] rover to Mars, and the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' probe]] to [[Saturn]]'s moons aim to further explore the possibilities of life on other planets in the Solar System.

[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] posing with a model of the Viking Lander.]]
The two [[Viking program|Viking landers]] each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for [[metabolism]] by current microbial [[Life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface; [[Viking 1]] near the equator and [[Viking 2]] further north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chambers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book
