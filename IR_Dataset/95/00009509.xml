The '''endometrium''' is the inner [[epithelium|epithelial]] layer, along with its [[mucous membrane]], of the [[mammal]]ian [[uterus]].  It has a basal layer and a functional layer; the functional layer thickens and then is shed during [[menstruation]] in humans and some other mammals, including [[ape]]s, [[Old World monkey]]s, some species of [[bat]], and the [[elephant shrew]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emera&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Emera|first1=D|last2=Romero|first2=R|last3=Wagner|first3=G|title=The evolution of menstruation: a new model for genetic assimilation: explaining molecular origins of maternal responses to fetal invasiveness.|journal=BioEssays|date=January 2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=26–35|doi=10.1002/bies.201100099|pmid=22057551|pmc=3528014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed in the [[estrous cycle]].

==Structure==
[[File:Endometrium ocp use3.jpg|thumb|right|High magnification [[micrograph]] of [[decidualization|decidualized]] endometrium due to exogenous [[progesterone]] ([[oral contraceptive pill]]). [[H&amp;E stain]]]]
[[File:Endometrium ocp use0.jpg|thumb|right|Low magnification micrograph of decidualized endometrium. H&amp;E stain]]
The endometrium consists of a single layer of [[columnar epithelium]] plus the [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] on which it rests. The stroma is a layer of [[connective tissue]] that varies in thickness according to [[hormonal]] influences. In the [[uterus]], simple [[tubular gland]]s reach from the endometrial surface through to the base of the stroma, which also carries a rich blood supply provided by the [[spiral artery|spiral arteries]]. In a woman of reproductive age, two layers of endometrium can be distinguished. These two layers occur only in the endometrium lining the cavity of the uterus, and not in the lining of the [[Fallopian tube]]s.&lt;ref name=histology/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guyton2006/&gt;
* The ''functional layer'' is adjacent to the uterine cavity. This layer is built up after the end of menstruation during the first part of the previous [[menstrual cycle]]. Proliferation is induced by [[estrogen]] (follicular phase of menstrual cycle), and later changes in this layer are engendered by progesterone from the [[corpus luteum]] (luteal phase). It is adapted to provide an optimum environment for the implantation and growth of the [[embryo]]. This layer is completely shed during [[menstruation]].
* The ''basal layer'', adjacent to the [[myometrium]] and below the functional layer, is not shed at any time during the menstrual cycle. The functional layer develops on top of it.
In the absence of progesterone, the arteries supplying blood to the functional layer constrict, so that cells in that layer become [[ischaemic]] and die, leading to [[menstruation]].

It is possible to identify the phase of the menstrual cycle by reference to either the [[Menstrual cycle#Ovarian cycle|ovarian cycle]] or the [[Menstrual cycle#Uterine cycle|uterine cycle]] by observing microscopic differences at each phase—for example in the ovarian cycle:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Phase !! Days !! Thickness !! Epithelium
 |-
 | Menstrual phase || 1–5 || Thin || Absent
 |-
 | [[Follicular phase]] || 5–14 || Intermediate || Columnar
 |-
 | [[Luteal phase]] || 15–27 || Thick || Columnar. Also visible are [[arcuate vessels of uterus]]
 |-
 | [[Ischemic phase]] || 27–28 ||  || Columnar. Also visible are arcuate vessels of uterus

=== Gene and protein expression ===
{{Further |Bioinformatics#Gene and protein expression}}
About 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and some 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal endometrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/endometrium|title=The human proteome in endometrium - The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlén|first=Mathias|last2=Fagerberg|first2=Linn|last3=Hallström|first3=Björn M.|last4=Lindskog|first4=Cecilia|last5=Oksvold|first5=Per|last6=Mardinoglu|first6=Adil|last7=Sivertsson|first7=Åsa|last8=Kampf|first8=Caroline|last9=Sjöstedt|first9=Evelina|date=2015-01-23|title=Tissue-based map of the human proteome|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6220|pages=1260419|doi=10.1126/science.1260419|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25613900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just over 100 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the endometrium with only a handful genes being highly endometrium specific. The corresponding specific proteins are expressed in the glandular and stromal cells of the endometrial mucosa. The expression of many of these proteins vary depending on the menstrual cycle, for example the [[progesterone receptor]] and [[thyrotropin-releasing hormone]] both expressed in the proliferative phase, and [[PAEP]] expressed in the secretory phase. Other proteins such as the [[HOXA11|HOX11]] protein that is required for female fertility, is expressed in endometrial stroma cells throughout the menstrual cycle. Certain specific proteins such as the [[Estrogen receptor alpha|estrogen receptor]] are also expressed in other types of female tissue types, such as the [[cervix]], [[fallopian tube]]s, [[Ovary|ovaries]] and [[breast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zieba|first=Agata|last2=Sjöstedt|first2=Evelina|last3=Olovsson|first3=Matts|last4=Fagerberg|first4=Linn|last5=Hallström|first5=Björn M.|last6=Oskarsson|first6=Linda|last7=Edlund|first7=Karolina|last8=Tolf|first8=Anna|last9=Uhlen|first9=Mathias|date=2015-10-21|title=The Human Endometrium-Specific Proteome Defined by Transcriptomics and Antibody-Based Profiling|journal=OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology|volume=19|issue=11|pages=659–668|doi=10.1089/omi.2015.0115|pmid=26488136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbiome speculation===
The uterus and endometrium was for a long time thought to be sterile. The [[cervical mucus plug|cervical plug]] of mucosa was seen to prevent the entry of any [[microorganism]]s ascending from the vagina. In the 1980s this view was challenged when it was shown that uterine infections could arise from weaknesses in the barrier of the cervical plug. Organisms from the vaginal microbiota could enter the uterus during [[uterine contractions]] in the menstrual cycle. Further studies sought to identify microbiota specific to the uterus which would be of help in identifying cases of unsuccessful [[IVF]] and miscarriages. Their findings were seen to be unreliable due to the possibility of cross-contamination in the sampling procedures used. The well-documented presence of ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' species, for example, was easily explained by an increase in the vaginal population being able to seep into the cervical mucous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;/&gt; Another study highlighted the flaws of the earlier studies including cross-contamination. It was also argued that the evidence from studies using germ-free offspring of [[axenic]] animals (germ-free) clearly showed the sterility of the uterus. The authors concluded that in light of these findings there was no existence of a microbiome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Microbiome&quot;/&gt;

The normal dominance of Lactobacilli in the vagina is seen as a marker for vaginal health. However, in the uterus this much lower population is seen as invasive in a closed environment that is highly regulated by female sex hormones, and that could have unwanted consequences. In studies of endometriosis ''Lactobacillus'' is not the dominant type and there are higher levels of ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' species. Half of the cases of [[bacterial vaginitis]] showed a polymicrobial [[biofilm]] attached to the endometrium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;/&gt;

==Function==
The endometrium is the innermost lining layer of the [[uterus]], and functions to prevent adhesions between the opposed walls of the [[myometrium]], thereby maintaining the patency of the uterine cavity. During the [[menstrual cycle]] or [[estrous cycle]], the endometrium grows to a thick, blood vessel-rich, glandular tissue layer. This represents an optimal environment for the [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of a [[blastocyst]] upon its arrival in the uterus. The endometrium is central, echogenic (detectable using ultrasound scanners), and has an average thickness of 6.7&amp;nbsp;mm.

During [[pregnancy]], the glands and [[blood vessel]]s in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the [[placenta]], which supplies [[oxygen]] and nutrition to the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]].

===Cycle===
The endometrial lining undergoes cyclic regeneration. Humans, apes, and some other species display the [[menstrual cycle]], whereas most other mammals are subject to an [[estrous cycle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Emera&quot;/&gt; In both cases, the endometrium initially proliferates under the influence of [[estrogen]]. However, once [[ovulation]] occurs, the ovary (specifically the corpus luteum) will produce much larger amounts of [[progesterone]].  This changes the proliferative pattern of the endometrium to a secretory lining. Eventually, the secretory lining provides a hospitable environment for one or more blastocysts.

Upon fertilization, the egg may implant into the uterine wall and provide feedback to the body with [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (HCG). HCG provides continued feedback throughout pregnancy by maintaining the corpus luteum, which will continue its role of releasing progesterone and estrogen. The endometrial lining is either reabsorbed (estrous cycle) or shed (menstrual cycle). In the latter case, the process of shedding involves the breaking down of the lining, the tearing of small connective blood vessels, and the loss of the tissue and blood that had constituted it through the [[vagina]]. The entire process occurs over a period of several days. Menstruation may be accompanied by a series of uterine contractions; these help expel the menstrual endometrium.

In case of implantation, however, the endometrial lining is neither absorbed nor shed. Instead, it remains as ''[[decidua]]''. The decidua becomes part of the placenta; it provides support and protection for the gestation.

If there is inadequate stimulation of the lining, due to lack of hormones, the endometrium remains thin and inactive. In humans, this will result in [[amenorrhea]], or the absence of a menstrual period. After [[menopause]], the lining is often described as being atrophic.  In contrast, endometrium that is chronically exposed to estrogens, but not to progesterone, may become [[hyperplastic]]. Long-term use of [[oral contraceptives]] with highly potent [[progestin]]s can also induce endometrial [[atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In humans, the cycle of building and shedding the endometrial lining lasts an average of 28 days. The endometrium develops at different rates in different mammals. Various factors including the seasons, climate, and stress can affect its development. The endometrium itself produces certain [[hormone]]s at different stages of the cycle and this affects other parts of the [[reproductive system]].

[[Chorionic tissue]] can result in marked endometrial changes, known as an [[Arias-Stella reaction]], that have an appearance similar to [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=pmid11756756&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Arias-Stella | first1 = J. | title = The Arias-Stella reaction: facts and fancies four decades after. | journal = Adv Anat Pathol | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 |date=Jan 2002 | doi =  10.1097/00125480-200201000-00003| pmid = 11756756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, this change was diagnosed as [[endometrial cancer]] and it is important only in so far as it should not be misdiagnosed as cancer.

* [[Adenomyosis]] is the growth of the endometrium into the muscle layer of the uterus (the [[myometrium]]).
* [[Endometriosis]] is the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus.
* [[Endometrial hyperplasia]]
* [[Endometrial cancer]] is the most common [[cancer]] of the human female genital tract.
* [[Asherman's syndrome]], also known as intrauterine [[adhesions]], occurs when the basal layer of the endometrium is damaged by instrumentation (e.g., [[Dilation and curettage|D&amp;C]]) or infection (e.g., endometrial [[tuberculosis]]) resulting in endometrial sclerosis and adhesion formation partially or completely obliterating the uterine cavity.

Thin endometrium may be defined as an endometrial thickness of less than 8&amp;nbsp;mm. It usually occurs after [[menopause]]. Treatments that can improve endometrial thickness include [[Vitamin E]], [[L-arginine]] and [[sildenafil citrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Takasaki A, Tamura H, Miwa I, Taketani T, Shimamura K, Sugino N |title=Endometrial growth and uterine blood flow: a pilot study for improving endometrial thickness in the patients with a thin endometrium |journal=Fertil.

===Embryo transfer===
{{Anchor|Triple-line}}
An endometrial thickness of less than 7&amp;nbsp;mm decreases the pregnancy rate in [[in vitro fertilization]] by an [[odds ratio]] of approximately 0.4 compared to an EMT of over 7&amp;nbsp;mm. However, such low thickness rarely occurs, and any routine use of this parameter is regarded as not justified.&lt;ref name=&quot;KasiusSmit2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasius|first1=A.|last2=Smit|first2=J.

[[File:Triple-line endometrium.jpg|thumb|''Triple-line'' endometrium measuring 7mm.]]
Observation of the endometrium by [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] is used when administering [[fertility medication]], such as in [[in vitro fertilization]]. At the time of [[embryo transfer]], it is favorable to have an endometrium of a thickness of between 7 and 14 [[millimeter|mm]] with a ''triple-line'' configuration,&lt;ref name=&quot;ZhaoZhang2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Jing|last2=Zhang|first2=Qiong|last3=Li|first3=Yanping|title=The effect of endometrial thickness and pattern measured by ultrasonography on pregnancy outcomes during IVF-ET cycles|journal=Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology|volume=10|issue=1|year=2012|pages=100|issn=1477-7827|doi=10.1186/1477-7827-10-100|pmid=23190428|pmc=3551825}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the endometrium contains a [[hyperechoic]] (usually displayed as light) line in the middle surrounded by two more [[hypoechoic]] (darker) lines. A ''triple-line'' endometrium reflects the separation of the stratum basalis and functionalis layers, and is also observed in the periovulatory period secondary to rising [[estradiol]] levels, and disappears after ovulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaerwaldPierson2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baerwald|first1=A.
