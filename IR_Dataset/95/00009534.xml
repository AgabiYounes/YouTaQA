A '''euphemism''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|f|ə|m|ɪ|z|əm}} is an innocuous word or expression used in place of one that may be found [[Profanity|offensive]] or suggest something unpleasant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphemism |title=Euphemism |dictionary=Webster's Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some euphemisms are intended to amuse, while others use bland, inoffensive terms for concepts that the user wishes to downplay. Euphemisms may be used to mask [[profanity]] or refer to [[Taboo word|taboo topics]] such as disability, sex, excretion, or death in a polite way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=euphemism (n.) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euphemism |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Euphemism'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc-Latn|euphemia}} ({{lang|grc|εὐφημία}}) which refers to the use of 'words of good omen'; it is a compound of {{lang|grc-Latn|eû}} ({{lang|grc|εὖ}}), meaning 'good, well', and {{lang|grc-Latn|phḗmē}} ({{lang|grc|φήμη}}), meaning 'prophetic speech; rumour, talk'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=fh/mh φήμη], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eupheme'' is a reference to the female Greek spirit of words of praise and positivity, etc. The term ''euphemism'' itself was used as a euphemism by the [[ancient Greeks]]; with the meaning &quot;to keep a holy silence&quot; (speaking well by not speaking at all).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=euphemism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=''Euphemism&quot; Etymology|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Reasons for using euphemisms vary by context and intent. Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing.

Euphemisms are also used to downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at [[Auschwitz]], relative to their sheer number, is &quot;directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MyUser_Newyorker.com_December_1_2015c&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/11/15/evidence-of-evil |title=Evidence of Evil  |newspaper=Newyorker.com – The New Yorker |date= November 15, 1993 |author=Timothy Ryback |accessdate= December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euphemisms are sometimes used to lessen the opposition to a political move. For example, according to linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] used the neutral Hebrew lexical item פעימות ''peimót'' (&quot;beatings (of the heart)&quot;), rather than נסיגה ''nesigá'' (&quot;withdrawal&quot;), to refer to the stages in the Israeli withdrawal from the [[West Bank]] (see [[Wye River Memorandum]]), in order to lessen the opposition of right-wing Israelis to such a move.&lt;ref name=&quot;language&quot;&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]]. [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. {{ISBN|978-1403917232|978-1403938695}} [http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} The lexical item פעימות ''peimót'', which literally means &quot;beatings (of the heart)&quot; is thus a euphemism for &quot;withdrawal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;language&quot;/&gt;{{rp|181}}

The act of labeling a term as a euphemism can in itself be controversial, as in the following  two examples:
* ''[[Affirmative action]]'', meaning a preference for minorities or the historically disadvantaged, usually in employment or academic admissions. This term is sometimes said to be a euphemism for [[reverse discrimination]], or in the UK [[positive discrimination]], which suggests an intentional bias that might be legally prohibited, or otherwise unpalatable.&lt;ref&gt;affirmative action as euphemism

* ''[[Enhanced interrogation techniques|Enhanced interrogation]]'' is sometimes said to be a euphemism for torture. For example, columnist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] called the use of this term for practices at [[Abu Ghraib]], [[Guantánamo]], and elsewhere an effort to &quot;dull the moral sensibility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Enhanced interrogation as euphemism

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

===Phonetic modification===
Phonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, diminishing their intensity. Modifications include:
* Shortening or &quot;clipping&quot; the term, such as ''Jeez'' (Jesus) and ''what the—'' (&quot;what the hell&quot; or &quot;what the fuck&quot;)
* Mispronunciations, such as ''[[Frak (expletive)|frak]]'', ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]'' (both the preceding for &quot;fuck&quot;), ''what the fudge'', ''what the truck'' (both &quot;what the fuck&quot;), ''oh my gosh'' (&quot;oh my God&quot;), ''frickin'' (&quot;fucking&quot;), ''darn'' (&quot;damn&quot;), ''oh shoot'' (&quot;oh shit&quot;), ''be-yotch'' (&quot;bitch&quot;), etc. This is also referred to as a [[minced oath]].
* Using first letters as replacements, such as ''SOB'' (&quot;son of a bitch&quot;), ''what the eff'' (&quot;what the fuck&quot;), ''S my D'' (&quot;suck my dick&quot;), ''POS'' (&quot;piece of shit&quot;), ''BS'' (&quot;bullshit&quot;). Sometimes, the word &quot;word&quot; is added after it, such as ''F-word'' (&quot;fuck&quot;), ''S-word'' (&quot;shit&quot;), ''B-word'' (&quot;bitch&quot;), ''N-word'' (&quot;nigger&quot;), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled. For example, the word ''piss'' was shortened to ''pee'' (pronounced as the letter ''P'') in this way.
include:
*[[Understatement]]s (''asleep'' for dead, ''drinking'' for consuming alcohol, ''hurt'' for injured, etc.)
* Pleasant or more neutral terms instead of explicit or unpleasant ones, like &quot;meat company&quot; for &quot;slaughterhouse&quot; &quot;let go&quot; for &quot;fired&quot; or &quot;laid off,&quot; &quot;intimate&quot; for &quot;sexual,&quot; &quot;plus-sized&quot; for &quot;overweight,&quot; &quot;memorial marker&quot; for &quot;gravestone,&quot; &quot;marital aid&quot; for &quot;sex toy,&quot; or &quot;final expenses&quot; for &quot; funeral costs.&quot;
* [[Metaphor]]s (''beat the meat'' or ''choke the chicken'' or ''jerkin' the gherkin'' for [[masturbation]], ''take a dump'' and ''take a leak'' for defecation and urination respectively)
* Comparisons (''buns'' for buttocks, ''weed'' for cannabis)
* [[Metonymy]] (''men's room'' for &quot;men's toilet&quot;)

===Rhetoric===
Euphemism may be used as a [[Rhetorical strategies|rhetorical strategy]], in which case its goal is to change the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of a description.

===Slang===
{{see also|Slang}}
The use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, ''screwed up'' is a euphemism for ''fucked up''; ''hook-up'' and ''laid'' are euphemisms for [[sexual intercourse]].

There is some disagreement over whether certain terms are or are not euphemisms. For example, sometimes the phrase ''visually impaired'' is labeled as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] euphemism for ''blind'' or a blind person. However, ''[[visual impairment]]'' can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word ''blind''.

===Words from a foreign language===
Expressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word ''enceinte'' was sometimes used instead of the English word ''pregnant''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ENCEINTE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enceinte|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=2017-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice of word substitution became so frequent that the expression &quot;''[[pardon my French]]''&quot; was adopted in attempts to excuse the use of profanity.

===Evolution===
{{anchor|Euphemism treadmill}}
Euphemisms may be formed in a number of ways. [[Periphrasis]], or [[circumlocution]], is one of the most common: to &quot;speak around&quot; a given word, [[Implicature|implying]] it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.

To alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a [[swear word]]) to form a euphemism is known as ''taboo deformation'', or a [[minced oath]]. In [[American English]], words that are unacceptable on television, such as ''[[fuck]]'', may be represented by deformations such as ''freak'', even in children's cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |work=FCC.gov |accessdate=2014-01-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=2013-12-09 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feck]] is a minced oath originating in Hiberno-English and popularised outside of Ireland by the British [[sitcom]] ''[[Father Ted]]''. Some examples of [[rhyming slang]] may serve the same purpose: to call a person a ''berk'' sounds less offensive than to call a person a ''[[cunt]]'', though ''berk'' is short for [[Berkeley Hunt]], which rhymes with ''cunt''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/berk Collins Dictionary, definition of &quot;berk&quot;/&quot;burk&quot;, retrieved 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucracies]] frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as [[doublespeak]] expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term &quot;[[sunshine units]]&quot; for contamination by [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCool |first=W.C. |date=1957-02-06 |title=Return of Rongelapese to their Home Island&amp;nbsp;– Note by the Secretary |publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] |url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |accessdate=2007-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925185914/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the [[Great Purge]] often used the clause &quot;imprisonment [[Without the right of correspondence|without right to correspondence]]&quot;: the person sentenced would be shot soon after conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (1974). The Gulag Archipelago I. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 6. {{ISBN|0-06-092103-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1939, Nazi official [[Reinhard Heydrich]] used the term ''[[Sonderbehandlung]]'' (&quot;special treatment&quot;) to mean [[summary execution]] (most likely by hanging) of persons viewed as &quot;disciplinary problems&quot; by the Nazis even before commencing the [[the Holocaust|systematic extermination of the Jews]]. Heinrich Himmler, aware that the word had come to be known to mean murder, replaced that euphemism with one in which Jews would be &quot;guided&quot; (to their deaths) through the slave-labor and extermination camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml|title=Holocaust-history.org|website=www.holocaust-history.org|accessdate=20 May 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528142643/http://www.holocaust-history.org/quick-facts/special-treatment.shtml|archivedate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having been &quot;evacuated&quot; to their doom. Such was part of the formulation of ''[[Final Solution|Endlösung der Judenfrage]]'' (the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;), which became infamous to the entire world during the Nuremberg Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477|title=Wannsee Conference and the &quot;Final Solution&quot;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A euphemism may itself devolve into a taboo word, through the linguistic process known as [[semantic change]] (specifically pejoration) described by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=W.V. |last=Quine |title=Quiddities |url=https://archive.org/details/quidditiesinterm00quin |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] |year=1987 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/quidditiesinterm00quin/page/53 53–54]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently dubbed the &quot;'''euphemism treadmill'''&quot; by Harvard professor [[Steven Pinker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515171806/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |title=The game of the name |newspaper=The New York Times |archivedate=2011-05-15 |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf |date=1994-04-03 |accessdate=2011-01-19 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''toilet'' is an 18th-century euphemism, replacing the older euphemism ''house-of-office'', which in turn replaced the even older euphemisms ''privy-house'' and ''bog-house''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell 1953&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell |first=Vicars Walker |title=On Learning the English Tongue |year=1953 |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |quote=The Honest Jakes or Privy has graduated via Offices to the final horror of Toilet. |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-8WAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=toilet#search_anchor--&gt; In the 20th century, where the words ''lavatory'' or ''[[toilet]]'' were deemed inappropriate (e.g. in the United States), they were sometimes replaced with ''bathroom'' or ''water closet'', which in turn became ''restroom'', ''W.C.'', or ''washroom''.  Another example in American English is the replacement of [[colored]] with [[Negro]] and then [[Black people|Black]] and then [[African American]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/11/07/362273449/why-we-have-so-many-terms-for-people-of-color Why We Have So Many Terms For 'People Of Color']&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''[[shit]]'' appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] *''sḱeyd-'', from which it was derived, meant &quot;to cut off&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ringe&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Ringe |first=Don | authorlink=Donald Ringe| title=From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-955229-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euphemisms are at risk of being misunderstood and used literally by young children who are acquiring language, and by older people who are learning a foreign language. An example is the &quot;pregnant [[Firefighter|fireman]]&quot; type of children's [[solecism]], where a child might hear someone define pregnancy euphemistically as &quot;carrying a child,&quot; then mistakenly extend that meaning and refer to a fireman literally carrying a child as pregnant. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://ladiesforlife.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/the-pregnant-fireman-vocabulary-lesson/ |title = The pregnant fireman vocabulary lesson|date = 2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doublespeak]] is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of words to distort or reverse their meaning, as in a &quot;Ministry of Peace&quot; which wages war, and a &quot;Ministry of Love&quot; which imprisons and tortures. It is a [[portmanteau]] of the terms ''[[Newspeak]]'' and ''[[doublethink]]'', which originate from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

The word ''euphemism'' itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (see [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of ''euphemism'' also occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, &quot;Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?&quot;

In Wes Anderson's film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', the replacement of swear words by the word ''cuss'' became a humorous motif throughout the film.

In [[Tom Hanks]]'s web series ''[[Electric City (web series)|Electric City]]'', the use of profanity has been censored by the word ''expletive''. &quot;[[Expletive deleted|&amp;#91;Expletive deleted&amp;#93;]]&quot; entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the [[Watergate tapes]].

In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], the curses of the scientist [[Ebling Mis]] have all been replaced with the word ''unprintable''. In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story &quot;[[Flies (Asimov short story)|Flies]]&quot;.

[[George Carlin]] has stated in audio books and his stand-up shows that euphemisms soften everyday language and take the life out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9n8Xp8DWf8|title=George Carlin's stand up act: Euphemism|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] (2004), use of the words &quot;frak&quot; and &quot;frakking&quot; was directly substituted for the English slang words &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;fucking&quot;, confounding the censors. Other science fiction series have similarly used word substitution to avoid censorship, such as &quot;frell&quot; instead of &quot;fuck&quot; in ''[[Farscape]]'', &quot;gorram&quot; and &quot;rutting&quot; instead of &quot;goddamn&quot; and &quot;fucking&quot; in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', and &quot;frag&quot; instead of &quot;fuck&quot; in ''[[Babylon 5]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syfy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/shazbot_check_out_14_frak |title=Shazbot!
