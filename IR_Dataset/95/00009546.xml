      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Engineering statistics''' combines [[engineering]] and [[statistics]] using [[scientific methods]] for analyzing data. Engineering statistics involves data concerning [[manufacturing]] processes such as: component dimensions, [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]], type of material, and fabrication process control. There are many methods used in engineering analysis and they are often displayed as [[histograms]] to give a visual of the data as opposed to being just numerical. Examples of methods are:&lt;ref name=&quot;BHH&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WuHamada&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LogoWynn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Logothetis, N. and [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/cats/People/HenryPage.htm Wynn, H.

# [[Design of Experiments]] (DOE) is a methodology for formulating scientific and engineering problems using statistical models. The protocol specifies a randomization procedure for the experiment and specifies the primary data-analysis, particularly in hypothesis testing. In a secondary analysis, the statistical analyst further examines the data to suggest other questions and to help plan future experiments. In engineering applications, the goal is often to optimize a process or product, rather than to subject a scientific hypothesis to test of its predictive adequacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BHH&quot;&gt;[[George E.

==History==

Engineering statistics dates back to 1000 B.C. when the [[Abacus]] was developed as means to calculate numerical data. In the 1600s, the development of information processing to systematically analyze and process data began. In 1654, the [[Slide Rule]] technique was developed by [https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule#ref81001 Robert Bissaker] for advanced data calculations. In 1833, a British mathematician named [[Charles Babbage]] designed the idea of an automatic computer which inspired developers at [[Harvard University]] and [[IBM]] to design the first mechanical automatic-sequence-controlled calculator called [[harvard mark I|MARK I]]. The integration of computers and calculators into the industry brought about a more efficient means of analyzing data and the beginning of engineering statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|title=Slide Rule|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/slide-rule#ref81001|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prentice Hall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Douglas|last2=Runger|first2=George|last3=Hubele|first3=Norma|title=Engineering Statistics|isbn=0470631473|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
