'''Euthanasia''' (from {{lang-el|εὐθανασία}}; &quot;good death&quot;: εὖ, ''eu''; &quot;well&quot; or &quot;good&quot; + θάνατος, ''thanatos''; &quot;death&quot;) is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve [[pain]] and [[suffering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quotation= Philosopher [[Helga Kuhse]]: &quot;'Euthanasia' is a compound of two Greek words – eu and thanatos meaning, literally, 'a good death'.

Different countries have different [[Legality of euthanasia|euthanasia laws]].

{{As of | 2006}} euthanasia had become the most active area of research in [[bioethics]].&lt;ref&gt;

In some countries divisive public controversy occurs over the moral, ethical, and legal issues associated with euthanasia. Passive euthanasia (known as &quot;pulling the plug&quot;) is legal under some circumstances in many countries. Active euthanasia, however, is legal or ''de facto'' legal in only a handful of countries (for example: Belgium, Canada and Switzerland), which limit it to specific circumstances and require the approval of [[counselor (disambiguation) | counselors]] and doctors or other specialists. In some countries - such as Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan - support for active euthanasia is almost non-existent.

==Definition==
Like other terms borrowed from history, &quot;euthanasia&quot; has had different meanings depending on usage. The first apparent usage of the term &quot;euthanasia&quot; belongs to the historian [[Suetonius]], who described how the Emperor [[Augustus]], &quot;dying quickly and without suffering in the arms of his wife, Livia, experienced the 'euthanasia' he had wished for.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Letellier, chapter: ''History and Definition of a Word,'' in ''Euthanasia: Ethical and Human Aspects'' By [[Council of Europe]]&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;euthanasia&quot; was first used in a medical context by [[Francis Bacon]] in the 17th century, to refer to an easy, painless, happy death, during which it was a &quot;physician's responsibility to alleviate the 'physical sufferings' of the body.&quot; Bacon referred to an &quot;outward euthanasia&quot;—the term &quot;outward&quot; he used to distinguish from a spiritual concept—the euthanasia &quot;which regards the preparation of the soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Bacon: ''The Major Works by Francis Bacon,'' edited by Brian Vickers, p. 630.&lt;/ref&gt;

In current usage, euthanasia has been defined as the &quot;painless inducement of a quick death&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohl | first = Marvin | year = 1974 | title = The Morality of Killing | url = https://archive.org/details/moralityofkillin0000kohl | url-access = registration | publisher = Humanities Press | location = New York | page = [https://archive.org/details/moralityofkillin0000kohl/page/94 94] }}, quoted in Beauchamp &amp; Davidson (1979), p 294. A similar definition is offered by Blackburn (1994) with &quot;the action of causing the quick and painless death of a person, or not acting to prevent it when prevention was within the agent's powers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is argued that this approach fails to properly define euthanasia, as it leaves open a number of possible actions which would meet the requirements of the definition, but would not be seen as euthanasia. In particular, these include situations where a person kills another, painlessly, but for no reason beyond that of personal gain; or accidental deaths that are quick and painless, but not intentional.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = Tom L. | authorlink1 = Tom Beauchamp | last2 = Davidson | first2 = Arnold I. | authorlink2 = Arnold Davidson | year = 1979 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | journal = [[Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–312 | doi=10.1093/jmp/4.3.294 | pmid=501249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Draper | first = Heather | year = 1998 | chapter = Euthanasia | editor = Chadwick, Ruth | title = Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics | volume = 2 | publisher = Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach incorporates the notion of [[suffering]] into the definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979&quot; /&gt; The definition offered by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] incorporates suffering as a necessary condition, with &quot;the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = euthanasia | work = Oxford Dictionaries | date = April 2010 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/euthanasia | accessdate = 26 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821152342/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/euthanasia | archivedate = 21 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is included in Marvin Khol and Paul Kurtz's definition of it as &quot;a mode or act of inducing or permitting death painlessly as a relief from suffering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kohl | first1 = Marvin | last2 = Kurtz | first2 = Paul | year = 1975 | chapter = A Plea for Beneficient Euthanasia | editor = Kohl, Marvin | title = Beneficient Euthanasia | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp &amp; Davidson (1979), p 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Counterexamples can be given: such definitions may encompass killing a person suffering from an incurable disease for personal gain (such as to claim an inheritance), and commentators such as [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[Arnold Davidson]] have argued that doing so would constitute &quot;murder simpliciter&quot; rather than euthanasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979&quot; /&gt;

The third element incorporated into many definitions is that of intentionality – the death must be intended, rather than being accidental, and the intent of the action must be a &quot;merciful death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979&quot; /&gt; Michael Wreen argued that &quot;the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from intentional killing simpliciter is the agent's motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wreen1988p639&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–53 [639] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, James Field argued that euthanasia entails a sense of compassion towards the patient, in contrast to the diverse non-compassionate motives of [[Angel of mercy (criminology)|serial killers who work in health care professions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Field |first=John |date=October 2007 |title=Caring to Death: a discursive analysis of nurses who murder patients |type=Ph.D. thesis |chapter=Chapter 6 |publisher=University of Adelaide |docket= |oclc= |chapter-url=https://hekyll.services.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/41890/10/02whole.pdf |access-date=September 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that &quot;the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be in the best interests of the person on the receiving end.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper1998&quot; /&gt; Definitions such as that offered by the [[House of Lords]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] on [[Medical Ethics]] take this path, where euthanasia is defined as &quot;a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris-2001&quot;/&gt; Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight [[Baruch Brody]]'s &quot;an act of euthanasia is one in which one person&amp;nbsp;... (A) kills another person (B) for the benefit of the second person, who actually does benefit from being killed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brody  | first1 = Baruch | year = 1975 | chapter = Voluntary Euthanasia and the Law | editor = Kohl, Marvin | title = Beneficient Euthanasia | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp &amp; Davidson (1979), p 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Draper argued that any definition of euthanasia must incorporate four elements: an agent and a subject; an intention; a causal proximity, such that the actions of the agent lead to the outcome; and an outcome. Based on this, she offered a definition incorporating those elements, stating that euthanasia &quot;must be defined as death that results from the intention of one person to kill another person, using the most gentle and painless means possible, that is motivated solely by the best interests of the person who dies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Draper1998p176&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Draper | first = Heather | year = 1998 | chapter = Euthanasia | editor = Chadwick, Ruth | title = Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics | volume = 2 | publisher = Academic Press | page = 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Draper, Beauchamp and Davidson had also offered a definition that includes these elements. Their definition specifically discounts [[fetus]]es to distinguish between abortions and euthanasia:&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979p303&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = Tom L. | authorlink1 = Tom Beauchamp | last2 = Davidson | first2 = Arnold I. | authorlink2 = Arnold Davidson | year = 1979 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | journal = [[Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 303| doi = 10.1093/jmp/4.3.294 | pmid=501249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In summary, we have argued&amp;nbsp;... that the death of a human being, A, is an instance of euthanasia if and only if (1) A's death is intended by at least one other human being, B, where B is either the cause of death or a causally relevant feature of the event resulting in death (whether by action or by omission); (2) there is either sufficient current evidence for B to believe that A is acutely suffering or irreversibly comatose, or there is sufficient current evidence related to A's present condition such that one or more known causal laws supports B's belief that A will be in a condition of acute suffering or irreversible comatoseness; (3) (a) B's primary reason for intending A's death is cessation of A's (actual or predicted future) suffering or irreversible comatoseness, where B does not intend A's death for a different primary reason, though there may be other relevant reasons, and (b) there is sufficient current evidence for either A or B that causal means to A's death will not produce any more suffering than would be produced for A if B were not to intervene; (4) the causal means to the event of A's death are chosen by A or B to be as painless as possible, unless either A or B has an overriding reason for a more painful causal means, where the reason for choosing the latter causal means does not conflict with the evidence in 3b; (5) A is a nonfetal organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979p304&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = Tom L. | authorlink1 = Tom Beauchamp | last2 = Davidson | first2 = Arnold I. | authorlink2 = Arnold Davidson | year = 1979 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | journal = [[Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 304| doi = 10.1093/jmp/4.3.294 | pmid=501249}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wreen, in part responding to Beauchamp and Davidson, offered a six-part definition:

{{quote|Person A committed an act of euthanasia if and only if (1) A killed B or let her die; (2) A intended to kill B; (3) the intention specified in (2) was at least partial cause of the action specified in (1); (4) the causal journey from the intention specified in (2) to the action specified in (1) is more or less in accordance with A's plan of action; (5) A's killing of B is a voluntary action; (6) the motive for the action specified in (1), the motive standing behind the intention specified in (2), is the good of the person killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wreen1988pp637-640&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wreen also considered a seventh requirement: &quot;(7) The good specified in (6) is, or at least includes, the avoidance of evil&quot;, although as Wreen noted in the paper, he was not convinced that the restriction was required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wreen1988p645&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637–53 [645] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing his definition, Wreen noted the difficulty of justifying euthanasia when faced with the notion of the subject's &quot;[[right to life]]&quot;. In response, Wreen argued that euthanasia has to be voluntary, and that &quot;involuntary euthanasia is, as such, a great wrong&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wreen1988p645&quot;/&gt; Other commentators incorporate consent more directly into their definitions. For example, in a discussion of euthanasia presented in 2003 by the European Association of Palliative Care (EPAC) Ethics Task Force, the authors offered: &quot;Medicalized killing of a person without the person's consent, whether nonvoluntary (where the person is unable to consent) or involuntary (against the person's will) is not euthanasia: it is murder. Hence, euthanasia can be voluntary only.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Materstvedt2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 2003 | title = Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide: a view from an EAPC Ethics Task Force |journal = [[Palliative Medicine (journal)|Palliative Medicine]] | volume = 17 | pages = 97–101 | doi = 10.1191/0269216303pm673oa | pmid = 12701848 |author1=Materstvedt, Lars Johan |author2=Clark, David |author3=Ellershaw, John |author4=Førde, Reidun |author5=Boeck Gravgaard, Anne-Marie |author6=Müller-Busch, Christof |author7=Porta i Sales, Josep |author8=Rapin, Charles-Henri | issue = 2| citeseerx = 10.1.1.514.5064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the EPAC Ethics Task Force argued that both [[non-voluntary euthanasia|non-voluntary]] and [[involuntary euthanasia]] could not be included in the definition of euthanasia, there is discussion in the literature about excluding one but not the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wreen1988p645&quot; /&gt;

==Classification of euthanasia==
Euthanasia may be classified into three types, according to whether a person gives [[informed consent]]: voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Perrett RW |title=Buddhism, euthanasia and the sanctity of life |journal=J Med Ethics |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=309–13 |date=October 1996 |pmid=8910785 |pmc=1377066 |doi=10.1136/jme.22.5.309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=LaFollette, Hugh |title=Ethics in practice: an anthology |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2002 |pages=25–26 |isbn=978-0-631-22834-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o5peQpgSTTIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA3-IA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a debate within the medical and bioethics literature about whether or not the non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients can be regarded as euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient's circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent on the part of the patient was not considered as one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeauchampDavidson1979&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wreen1988&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | pages = 637–53 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others see consent as essential.

===Voluntary euthanasia===
{{see also|Right to die}}
[[Voluntary euthanasia]] is conducted with the consent of the patient. Active voluntary euthanasia is legal in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Passive voluntary euthanasia is legal throughout the US per ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]''. When the patient brings about their own death with the assistance of a physician, the term [[assisted suicide]] is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.

===Non-voluntary euthanasia===
[[Non-voluntary euthanasia]] is conducted when the consent of the patient is unavailable. Examples include [[child euthanasia]], which is illegal worldwide but decriminalised under certain specific circumstances in the Netherlands under the [[Groningen Protocol]].

===Involuntary euthanasia===
[[Involuntary euthanasia]] is conducted against the will of the patient.

===Passive and active euthanasia===
Voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary types can be further divided into passive or active variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197501092920206 |author=Rachels J |title=Active and passive euthanasia |journal=N.

While some authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of [[Analgesic|painkillers]], there is a debate whether or not to regard the practice as active or passive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris-2001&quot;/&gt;

[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787), depicting Socrates prepared to drink [[Conium|hemlock]], following his conviction for corrupting the youth of [[Athens]]]]
Euthanasia was practiced in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]: for example, [[Conium|hemlock]] was employed as a means of hastening death on the island of [[Kea (island)|Kea]], a technique also employed in [[Marseilles]]. Euthanasia, in the sense of the deliberate hastening of a person's death, was supported by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Seneca the Elder]] in the ancient world, although [[Hippocrates]] appears to have [[Hippocratic Oath|spoken against the practice]], writing &quot;I will not prescribe a deadly drug to please someone, nor give advice that may cause his death&quot; (noting there is some debate in the literature about whether or not this was intended to encompass euthanasia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mystakidou | first1 = Kyriaki | last2 = Parpa | first2 = Efi | last3 = Tsilika | first3 = Eleni | last4 = Katsouda | first4 = Emanuela | last5 = Vlahos | first5 = Lambros | year = 2005 | title = The Evolution of Euthanasia and Its Perceptions in Greek Culture and Civilization | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 97–98 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2005.0013 | pmid = 15681882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stolberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stolberg | first = Michael | year = 2007 | title = Active Euthanasia in Pre-ModernSociety, 1500–1800: Learned Debates and Popular Practices | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 20 | pages = 206–07 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1093/shm/hkm034 | pmid = 18605325 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cc2d64832a7a218a837047c0d4bec663b7ba43bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gesundheit | first1 = Benjamin | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = Avraham | last3 = Glick | first3 = Shimon | last4 = Or | first4 = Reuven | last5 = Jotkovitz | first5 = Alan | year = 2006 | title=  Euthanasia: An Overview and the Jewish Perspective | journal = [[Cancer Investigation]] | volume = 24 | doi = 10.1080/07357900600894898 | pmid = 16982468 | issue = 6 | pages = 621–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
The term ''euthanasia'' in the earlier sense of supporting someone as they died, was used for the first time by [[Francis Bacon]]. In his work, ''Euthanasia medica'', he chose this ancient Greek word and, in doing so, distinguished between ''euthanasia interior'', the preparation of the soul for death, and ''euthanasia exterior'', which was intended to make the end of life easier and painless, in exceptional circumstances by shortening life. That the ancient meaning of an easy death came to the fore again in the [[early modern period]] can be seen from its definition in the 18th century [[Grosses vollständiges Universal-Lexicon Aller Wissenschafften und Künste|''Zedlers Universallexikon'']]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Euthanasia: a very gentle and quiet death, which happens without painful convulsions. The word comes from ευ, ''bene'', well, and θανατος, ''mors'', death.&lt;ref&gt;''Zedlers Universallexikon'', Vol. 08, p. 1150, published 1732–54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of euthanasia in the sense of alleviating the process of death goes back to the medical historian, [[Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx]], who drew on Bacon's philosophical ideas. According to Marx, a doctor had a moral duty to ease the suffering of death through encouragement, support and mitigation using medication. Such an &quot;alleviation of death&quot; reflected the contemporary ''[[zeitgeist]]'', but was brought into the medical canon of responsibility for the first time by Marx. Marx also stressed the distinction between the theological care of the soul of sick people from the physical care and medical treatment by doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|16|327|328|Marx, Karl, Mediziner|Markwart Michler|116814357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helge Dvorak: ''Biographisches Lexikon der Deutschen Burschenschaft.''

Euthanasia in its modern sense has always been strongly opposed in the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. [[Thomas Aquinas]] opposed both and argued that the practice of euthanasia contradicted our natural human instincts of survival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000130 &quot;Historical Timeline: History of Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide,&quot;] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120705164631/http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000130 |date=5 July 2012 }} Euthanasia – ProCon.org.

In 1678, the publication of Caspar Questel's ''De pulvinari morientibus non-subtrahend'', (&quot;''On the pillow of which the dying should not be deprived''&quot;), initiated debate on the topic. Questel described various customs which were employed at the time to hasten the death of the dying, (including the sudden removal of a pillow, which was believed to accelerate death), and argued against their use, as doing so was &quot;against the laws of God and Nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;stolberg&quot;/&gt;{{rp|209–211}} This view was shared by others who followed, including Philipp Jakob Spener, Veit Riedlin and [[Johann Georg Krünitz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stolberg&quot;/&gt;{{rp|211}} Despite opposition, euthanasia continued to be practised, involving techniques such as bleeding, suffocation, and removing people from their beds to be placed on the cold ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;stolberg&quot;/&gt;{{rp|211–214}}

===Beginnings of the contemporary euthanasia debate===
In the mid-1800s, the use of [[morphine]] to treat &quot;the pains of death&quot; emerged, with [[John Collins Warren|John Warren]] recommending its use in 1848. A similar use of [[chloroform]] was revealed by Joseph Bullar in 1866. However, in neither case was it recommended that the use should be to hasten death. In 1870 Samuel Williams, a schoolteacher, initiated the contemporary euthanasia debate through a speech given at the Birmingham Speculative Club in England, which was subsequently published in a one-off publication entitled ''Essays of the Birmingham Speculative Club'', the collected works of a number of members of an amateur philosophical society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emanuel1994&quot;/&gt;{{rp|794}} Williams' proposal was to use chloroform to deliberately hasten the death of terminally ill patients:

{{quote|That in all cases of hopeless and painful illness, it should be the recognized duty of the medical attendant, whenever so desired by the patient, to administer chloroform or such other anaesthetic as may by-and-bye supersede chloroform – so as to destroy consciousness at once, and put the sufferer to a quick and painless death; all needful precautions being adopted to prevent any possible abuse of such duty; and means being taken to establish, beyond the possibility of doubt or question, that the remedy was applied at the express wish of the patient.|Samuel Williams (1872) | ''Euthanasia'' Williams and Northgate: London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emanuel1994&quot;/&gt;{{rp|794}} }}

The essay was favourably reviewed in ''[[Saturday Review (London)|The Saturday Review]]'', but an editorial against the essay appeared in ''[[The Spectator]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Manchester University Press |isbn = 978-0-7190-6124-0 |title = Merciful Release |author = Nick Kemp |date = 7 September 2002 |id = 0719061245 |df = dmy-all |ol = 10531689M }}&lt;/ref&gt; From there it proved to be influential, and other writers came out in support of such views: Lionel Tollemache wrote in favour of euthanasia, as did [[Annie Besant]], the essayist and reformer who later became involved with the [[National Secular Society]], considering it a duty to society to &quot;die voluntarily and painlessly&quot; when one reaches the point of becoming a 'burden'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Dowbiggin|title=A Concise History of Euthanasia: Life, Death, God, and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNigO7gMGkUC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=23 June 2011|date=March 2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3111-6|pages=51, 62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Popular Science'' analyzed the issue in May 1873, assessing both sides of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-B8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;pg=PA90 | title = Popular Science | last1 = Corporation | first1 = Bonnier | date = May 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kemp notes that at the time, medical doctors did not participate in the discussion; it was &quot;essentially a philosophical enterprise&amp;nbsp;... tied inextricably to a number of objections to the Christian doctrine of the sanctity of human life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kemp&quot; /&gt;

=== Early euthanasia movement in the United States ===
{{Main article|Euthanasia in the United States}}

[[Image:Felix-Adler-Hine.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|[[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]], circa 1913, the first prominent American to argue for permitting suicide in cases of chronic illness]]
The rise of the euthanasia movement in the United States coincided with the so-called [[Gilded Age]], a time of social and technological change that encompassed an &quot;individualistic conservatism that praised laissez-faire economics, [[scientific method]], and [[rationalism]]&quot;, along with major [[Depression (economics)|depressions]], industrialisation and conflict between corporations and labour unions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emanuel1994&quot;/&gt;{{rp|794}} It was also the period in which the modern hospital system was developed, which has been seen as a factor in the emergence of the euthanasia debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pappas | first = Demetra | year = 1996 | title = Recent historical perspectives regarding medical euthanasia and physician assisted suicide | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 52 | pages = 386–87 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a011554 | pmid=8759237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]] argued for euthanasia, stating in 1894 that where someone is suffering from a terminal illness, such as terminal cancer, they should have a right to end their pain through suicide. [[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]] offered a similar approach, although, unlike Ingersoll, Adler did not reject religion. In fact, he argued from an [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]] framework. In 1891, Adler argued that those suffering from overwhelming pain should have the right to commit suicide, and, furthermore, that it should be permissible for a doctor to assist – thus making Adler the first &quot;prominent American&quot; to argue for suicide in cases where people were suffering from chronic illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dowbiggin | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Dowbiggin | year = 2003 | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-515443-6 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/mercifulendeutha00dowb_0/page/10 10–13] | url = https://archive.org/details/mercifulendeutha00dowb_0/page/10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ingersoll and Adler argued for voluntary euthanasia of adults suffering from terminal ailments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin&quot;/&gt; Dowbiggin argues that by breaking down prior moral objections to euthanasia and suicide, Ingersoll and Adler enabled others to stretch the definition of euthanasia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin2003p13&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Dowbiggin | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Dowbiggin | year = 2003 | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-515443-6 | page = [https://archive.org/details/mercifulendeutha00dowb_0/page/13 13] | url = https://archive.org/details/mercifulendeutha00dowb_0/page/13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to legalise euthanasia took place in the United States, when [[Henry Thomas Hunt|Henry Hunt]] introduced legislation into the [[Ohio General Assembly|General Assembly]] of [[Ohio]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Appel | first = Jacob | authorlink = Jacob M.

Hall had watched her mother die after an extended battle with [[liver cancer]], and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not have to endure the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited [[Lurana W. Sheldon|Lurana Sheldon]] and [[Maud Ballington Booth]], and organised a debate on euthanasia at the annual meeting of the [[American Humane Association]] in 1905 – described by [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|614–616}}

Hunt's bill called for the administration of an [[anesthetic]] to bring about a patient's death, so long as the person is of lawful age and sound mind, and was suffering from a fatal injury, an irrevocable illness, or great physical pain. It also required that the case be heard by a physician, required informed consent in front of three witnesses, and required the attendance of three physicians who had to agree that the patient's recovery was impossible. A motion to reject the bill outright was voted down, but the bill failed to pass, 79 to 23.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emanuel1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Emanuel | first = Ezekiel | authorlink = Ezekiel Emanuel | year = 1994 | title = The history of euthanasia debates in the United States and Britain | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 121 | page = 796 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-121-10-199411150-00010 | pmid = 7944057 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.732.724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|796}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|618–619}}

Along with the Ohio euthanasia proposal, in 1906 Assemblyman Ross Gregory introduced a proposal to permit euthanasia to the [[Iowa General Assembly|Iowa legislature]]. However, the Iowa legislation was broader in scope than that offered in Ohio. It allowed for the death of any person of at least ten years of age who suffered from an ailment that would prove fatal and cause extreme pain, should they be of sound mind and express a desire to artificially hasten their death. In addition, it allowed for infants to be euthanised if they were sufficiently deformed, and permitted guardians to request euthanasia on behalf of their wards. The proposed legislation also imposed penalties on physicians who refused to perform euthanasia when requested: a 6–12 month prison term and a fine of between $200 and $1,000. The proposal proved to be controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|619–621}} It engendered considerable debate and failed to pass, having been withdrawn from consideration after being passed to the Committee on Public Health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Appel2004&quot;/&gt;{{rp|623}}

After 1906 the euthanasia debate reduced in intensity, resurfacing periodically, but not returning to the same level of debate until the 1930s in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emanuel1994&quot;/&gt;{{rp|796}}

Euthanasia opponent [[Ian Dowbiggin]] argues that the early membership of the [[Euthanasia Society of America]] (ESA) reflected how many perceived euthanasia at the time, often seeing it as a eugenics matter rather than an issue concerning individual rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin&quot;/&gt; Dowbiggin argues that not every eugenist joined the ESA &quot;solely for eugenic reasons&quot;, but he postulates that there were clear ideological connections between the eugenics and euthanasia movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin&quot;/&gt;

===1930s in Britain===
The [[Voluntary Euthanasia Legalisation Society]] was founded in 1935 by [[Charles Killick Millard]] (now called Dignity in Dying). The movement campaigned for the legalisation of euthanasia in Great Britain.

In January 1936, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] was given a fatal dose of morphine and [[cocaine]] to hasten his death. At the time he was suffering from cardio-respiratory failure, and the decision to end his life was made by his physician, [[Bertrand Dawson, 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn|Lord Dawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramsay | first = J H R | date = 28 May 2011 | title = A king, a doctor, and a convenient death | journal = [[British Medical Journal]] | volume = 308 | issue = 1445 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/308/6941/1445.1.full | accessdate = 2 August 2011 | pmid = 11644545 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.308.6941.1445 | page = 1445 | pmc = 2540387 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807054519/http://www.bmj.com/content/308/6941/1445.1.full | archivedate = 7 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this event was kept a secret for over 50 years, the death of George V coincided with proposed legislation in the [[House of Lords]] to legalise euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gurney | first = Edward | year = 1972 | title = Is There a Right to Die – A Study of the Law of Euthanasia | journal = Cumberland-Samford Law Review | volume = 3 | page = 237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He explains that the Nazi version of &quot;euthanasia&quot; was based on the work of [[Adolf Jost]], who published ''The Right to Death'' (Das Recht auf den Tod) in 1895. Lifton writes: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jost argued that control over the death of the individual must ultimately belong to the social organism, the state. This concept is in direct opposition to the Anglo-American concept of euthanasia, which emphasizes the ''individual's'' 'right to die' or 'right to death' or 'right to his or her own death,' as the ultimate human claim. In contrast, Jost was pointing to the state's right to kill.&amp;nbsp;... Ultimately the argument was biological: 'The rights to death [are] the key to the fitness of life.' The state must own death—must kill—in order to keep the social organism alive and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Books 1986, 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In modern terms, the use of &quot;euthanasia&quot; in the context of Action T4 is seen to be a [[wikt:euphemism|euphemism]] to disguise a program of [[genocide]], in which people were killed on the grounds of &quot;disabilities, religious beliefs, and discordant individual values&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michalsen2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michalsen A, Reinhart K |title=&quot;Euthanasia&quot;: A confusing term, abused under the Nazi regime and misused in present end-of-life debate |journal=Intensive Care Med |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1304–10 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16826394 |doi=10.1007/s00134-006-0256-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the discussions of euthanasia that emerged post-war, the Nazi program may have been worded in terms that appear similar to the modern use of &quot;euthanasia&quot;, but there was no &quot;mercy&quot; and the patients were not necessarily terminally ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michalsen2006&quot; /&gt; Despite these differences, historian and euthanasia opponent [[Ian Dowbiggin]] writes that &quot;the origins of Nazi euthanasia, like those of the American euthanasia movement, predate the Third Reich and were intertwined with the history of eugenics and Social Darwinism, and with efforts to discredit traditional morality and ethics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin&quot;/&gt;{{rp|65}}

=== 1949 New York State Petition for Euthanasia and Catholic opposition ===
On 6 January 1949, the Euthanasia Society of America presented to the [[New York State Legislature]] a petition to legalize euthanasia, signed by 379 leading Protestant and Jewish ministers, the largest group of religious leaders ever to have taken this stance. A similar petition had been sent to the New York Legislature in 1947, signed by approximately 1,000 New York physicians. [[Roman Catholic]] religious leaders criticized the petition, saying that such a bill would &quot;legalize a suicide-murder pact&quot; and a &quot;rationalization of the fifth commandment of God, 'Thou Shalt Not Kill.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercy Killing&quot;&gt;[[The Moncton Transcript]]. &quot;Ministers Ask Mercy Killing.&quot; 6 January 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; The Right Reverend Robert E. McCormick stated that
{{Quote|The ultimate object of the Euthanasia Society is based on the Totalitarian principle that the state is supreme and that the individual does not have the right to live if his continuance in life is a burden or hindrance to the state. The Nazis followed this principle and compulsory Euthanasia was practiced as a part of their program during the recent war. We American citizens of New York State must ask ourselves this question: &quot;Are we going to finish Hitler's job?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mercy Killing&quot;/&gt;}}
The petition brought tensions between the American Euthanasia Society and the Catholic Church to a head that contributed to a climate of anti-Catholic sentiment generally, regarding issues such as birth control, eugenics, and population control. However, the petition did not result in any legal changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowbiggin&quot;/&gt;

==Euthanasia debate==
Historically, the euthanasia debate has tended to focus on a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that people have a right to [[self-determination]], and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the [[doctrine of double effect]]–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], and states like [[Oregon]], where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.

Similarly, Emanuel argues that there are four major arguments presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined with the use of effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a [[Euthanasia and the slippery slope|slippery slope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Times Books |isbn = 978-0-8129-2790-0 |location = New York |title = Forced Exit |author = Wesley J.

{{Main article|Legality of euthanasia}}
West's ''Encyclopedia of American Law'' states that &quot;a 'mercy killing' or euthanasia is generally considered to be a criminal homicide&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com says: &quot;If a person kills another person in order to end the other person's pain or suffering, the killing is considered a homicide. It does not matter if the other person is about to die or is terminally ill just prior to being killed; the law generally views such a killing as criminal. Thus, a &quot;mercy killing&quot;, or act of Euthanasia, is generally considered a criminal homicide&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and is normally used as a synonym of homicide committed at a request made by the patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomas_Valiente_1997&quot;/&gt;

The judicial sense of the term &quot;[[homicide]]&quot; includes any intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, even to relieve intractable suffering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomas_Valiente_1997&quot;&gt;Carmen Tomás Y Valiente, La regulación de la eutanasia en Holanda, Anuario de Derecho Penal y Ciencias Penales – Núm.

The term &quot;euthanasia&quot; is usually confined to the active variety; the University of Washington website states that &quot;euthanasia generally means that the physician would act directly, for instance by giving a lethal injection, to end the patient's life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;University of Washington&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pas.html|title=Physician-Assisted Suicide: Ethical Topic in Medicine|website=depts.washington.edu|accessdate=4 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165103/http://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/pas.html|archivedate=13 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assisted suicide|Physician-assisted suicide]] is thus not classified as euthanasia by [[Oregon|the US State of Oregon]], where it is legal under the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act]], and despite its name, it is not legally classified as suicide either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.or.us/comm/commsrvs/background_briefs2004/Health%20Care/FG_Physician_Assisted_Suicide2004.pdf|title=Physician Assisted Suicide|last=Taylor|first=Bill|date=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204223955/http://www.leg.state.or.us/comm/commsrvs/background_briefs2004/Health%20Care/FG_Physician_Assisted_Suicide2004.pdf|archive-date=4 December 2004|url-status=|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike physician-assisted suicide, withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments with patient consent (voluntary) is almost unanimously considered, at least in the United States, to be legal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/162/6/2029 &quot;Legal Aspects of Withholding and Withdrawing Life Support from Critically Ill Patients in the United States and Providing Palliative Care to Them&quot;, ''Am.

Some governments around the world have legalized voluntary euthanasia but most commonly it is still considered to be criminal homicide. In the Netherlands and Belgium, where euthanasia has been legalized, it still remains homicide although it is not prosecuted and not punishable if the perpetrator (the doctor) meets certain legal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Oluyemisi Bamgbose |title=Euthanasia: Another Face of Murder |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |volume=48 |issue=1 |year=2004 |pages=111–21 |doi=10.1177/0306624X03256662 |pmid=14969121|citeseerx=10.1.1.631.618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee : Netherlands. 27 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Tomás Y Valiente, ''La regulación de la eutanasia en Holanda'', Anuario de Derecho Penal y Ciencias Penales – Núm.

In a historic judgment, the Supreme court of India legalized passive euthanasia. The apex court remarked in the judgment that the Constitution of India values liberty, dignity, autonomy, and privacy. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra delivered a unanimous judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-recognises-living-will-by-terminally-ill-patients-for-passive-euthanasia/article22991873.ece | title = Euthanasia and beyond: on the Supreme Court's verdict SC Constitution Bench holds passive euthanasia, living wills permissible | newspaper = [[The Hindu]] | location = [[Karnataka]] | date = 2018-03-09 | accessdate = 2018-03-09 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032828/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-recognises-living-will-by-terminally-ill-patients-for-passive-euthanasia/article22991873.ece | archivedate = 5 June 2018 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health professionals' sentiment==
A 2010 survey in the United States of more than 10,000 physicians found that 16.3% of physicians would consider halting life-sustaining therapy because the family demanded it, even if they believed that it was premature. Approximately 54.5% would not, and the remaining 29.2% responded &quot;it depends&quot;.&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie Kane, MA |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_2 |title=Exclusive Ethics Survey Results: Doctors Struggle With Tougher-Than-Ever Dilemmas |website=Medscape.com |accessdate=2017-07-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814134456/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/731485_2 |archivedate=14 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that 45.8% of physicians agreed that physician-assisted suicide should be allowed in some cases; 40.7% did not, and the remaining 13.5% felt it depended.&lt;ref name=kane/&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the assisted dying campaign group [[Dignity in Dying]] cites research in which 54% of General Practitioners support or are neutral towards a law change on assisted dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public opinion – Dignity in Dying |url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/assisted-dying/public-opinion/ |accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2017 [[Doctors.net.uk]] poll reported in the [[British Medical Journal]] stated that 55% of doctors believe assisted dying, in defined circumstances, should be legalised in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted dying case 'stronger than ever' with majority of doctors now in support |url=https://inews.co.uk/news/health/assisted-dying-debate-bmj-doctors-majority-support/ |accessdate=3 August 2018|date=2018-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern among healthcare professionals is the possibility of being asked to participate in euthanasia in a situation where they personally believe it to be wrong. In a 1996 study of 852 nurses in adult [[Intensive care unit|ICUs]], 19% admitted to participating in euthanasia. 30% of those who admitted to it also believed that euthanasia is unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Religious views==
{{main|Religious views on euthanasia}}
===Christianity===

====Broadly against====
The Roman Catholic Church condemns euthanasia and assisted suicide as morally wrong. It states that, &quot;intentional euthanasia, whatever its forms or motives, is murder. It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator&quot;. Because of this, the practice is unacceptable within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicity.com/vote/euthanasia.html|title=How to Vote Catholic: Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide|website=www.catholicity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orthodox Church in America]], along with other Eastern Orthodox Churches, also opposes euthanasia stating that it must be condemned as murder stating that, &quot;Euthanasia is the deliberate cessation to end human life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;orthodoxchristian.info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Euthanasia.htm|title=The Orthodox Christian view on Euthanasia|website=www.orthodoxchristian.info|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812133422/http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/Euthanasia.htm|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-Catholic churches in the United States take a stance against euthanasia. Among Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1991 opposing euthanasia and assisted suicide stating that it is &quot;morally wrong and unacceptable to take a human life to relieve the suffering caused by incurable illnesses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;orthodoxchristian.info&quot;/&gt; Other Protestant churches which oppose euthanasia include:

====Partially in favor of====
The [[Church of England]] accepts passive euthanasia under some circumstances, but is strongly against active euthanasia, and has led opposition against recent attempt to legalise it.&lt;ref&gt;Why the Church of England Supports the Current Law on Assisted Suicide. Dr Brendan McCarthy Archbishops’ Council Church House, London 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Church of Canada]] accepts passive euthanasia under some circumstances, but is in general against active euthanasia, with growing acceptance now that active euthanasia has been partly legalised in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Submission to The Special Joint Committee on Physician-Assisted Dying. Rev. Jordan Cantwell Moderator of The United Church of Canada. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Islam===

Euthanasia is a complex issue in Islamic theology; however, in general it is considered contrary to [[Sharia|Islamic law]] and [[Islamic holy books|holy texts]]. Among interpretations of the [[Koran]] and [[Hadith]], the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all [[Muslim world|Muslim majority countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Perspectives, Euthanasia (Qatl al-raḥma). Abulfadl Mohsin Ebrahim. Journal of the Islamic Medical Association of North America 2007 Volume 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===

There is much debate on the topic of euthanasia in Judaic theology, ethics, and general opinion (especially in Israel and the United States). Passive euthanasia was declared legal by [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israel's highest court]] under certain conditions and has reached some level of acceptance. Active euthanasia remains illegal, however the topic is actively under debate with no clear consensus through legal, ethical, theological and spiritual perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Death and Euthanasia in Jewish Law: Essays and Responses. W Jacob and M. Zemer. Pitsburg and Tel Aviv. Rodef Shalom Press. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
