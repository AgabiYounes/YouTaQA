Since the mid-20th century, active ongoing research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence|search for extraterrestrial intelligent life]]. Depending on the category of search, methods range from the analysis of telescope and specimen data&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20150106-DB&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=As Ranks of Goldilocks Planets Grow, Astronomers Consider What's Next |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/science/space/as-ranks-of-goldilocks-planets-grow-astronomers-consider-whats-next.html |date=6 January 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to radios used to detect and send communication signals.

The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of [[science fiction]]. Over the years, science fiction has introduced a number of theoretical ideas, each having a wide range of possibilities. Many have piqued public interest in the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. One particular concern is the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to make contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others argue to do so may give away the location of Earth, making an invasion possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31442952 |title=Scientists in US are urged to seek contact with aliens |work=BBC News |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Would Contact with Extraterrestrials Benefit or Harm Humanity?

Alien life, such as [[microorganism]]s, has been hypothesized to exist in the [[Solar System]] and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the [[Size of the universe|vast size]] and consistent [[physical law]]s of the [[observable universe]].

===Evolution===
A study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes &quot;Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2017-10-31-aliens-may-be-more-us-we-think |title=Aliens may be more like us than we think |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential [[Planetary habitability|niches a planet]] contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolutionary exobiology: Towards the qualitative assessment of biological potential on exoplanets |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=18 |issue=3 |first1=David S. |last1=Stevenson |first2=Sean |last2=Large |date=25 October 2017 |doi=10.1017/S1473550417000349 |pages=204–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life on Earth requires [[water]] as a [[solvent]] in which biochemical reactions take place.

The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom, and its abundance in the visible universe, makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—for the chemical composition of life on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=To Utopia and Back: The Search for Life in the Solar System |url=https://archive.org/details/toutopiabacksear0000horo |url-access=registration |publisher=W.

The [[panspermia]] hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin.

[[Sir Fred Hoyle]] (1915–2001) and [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]] (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for [[macroevolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hoyle.org.uk/resources/virusesfromspacecompressed.pdf |title=Viruses from Space and Related Matters |publisher=University College Cardiff Press |first1=Fred |last1=Hoyle |first2=Chandra |last2=Wickramasinghe |first3=John |last3=Watson |date=1986 |isbn=978-0-906449-93-6 |bibcode=1986vfsr.book.....H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Directed panspermia]] concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life.

Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tritt2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulze-Makuch2001&quot;/&gt; [[Hydrothermal vent]]s on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the water and could be capable of supporting nutrients and energy to [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150326-europa-may-be-home-to-alien-life Europa may be home to alien life].

The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/huge-lakes-of-water-may-exist-under-europas-ice/ |title=Huge lakes of water may exist under Europa's ice |series=Bad Astronomy Blog |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2011/11/scientists-find-evidence-for-great-lake-on-europa/ |title=Scientists Find Evidence for &quot;Great Lake&quot; on Europa and Potential New Habitat for Life |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rover landed on Mars at [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Crater2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chow |first1=Dennis |title=NASA's Next Mars Rover to Land at Huge Gale Crater |url=http://www.space.com/12394-nasa-mars-rover-landing-site-unveiled.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale Crater3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Mars rover aims for deep crater |date=22 July 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14249524 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] stipulates that any planet with a robust population of life will have an atmosphere in chemical disequilibrium, which is relatively easy to determine from a distance by [[spectroscopy]]. However, significant advances in the ability to find and resolve light from smaller rocky worlds near their star are necessary before such spectroscopic methods can be used to analyze extrasolar planets. To that effect, the [[Carl Sagan Institute]] was founded in 2014 and is dedicated to the atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in [[circumstellar habitable zone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |title=Introducing: The Carl Sagan Institute |last=Glaser |first=Linda |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227012302/http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/2015/01/what-is-the-institute-for-pale-blue-dots/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CSI-Research'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://instituteforpalebluedots.com/research/ |title=Carl Sagan Institute – Research |date=May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planetary spectroscopic data will be obtained from telescopes like [[Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope|WFIRST]] and [[Extremely Large Telescope|ELT]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ColorCatalog&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Cofield |first=Calla |url=http://www.space.com/28906-alien-life-earth-microbe-catalog.html |title=Catalog of Earth Microbes Could Help Find Alien Life |work=Space.com |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system. The molecule was found around the [[protostar|protostellar]] binary ''IRAS 16293-2422'', which is located 400 light years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG-20120829&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sugar Found in Space |journal=National Geographic |last=Than |first=Ker |date=29 August 2012 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120829-sugar-space-planets-science-life/ |accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP-20120829&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweet!

==The Drake equation==
{{Main|Drake equation}}

In 1961, [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]] [[Frank Drake]] devised the [[Drake equation]] as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at a meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).&lt;ref name='December 2002'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.setileague.org/askdr/drake.htm |title=Chapter 3 – Philosophy: &quot;Solving the Drake Equation |accessdate=24 July 2015 |date=December 2002 |publisher=SETI League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drake equation is a [[probability theory|probabilistic argument]] used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]]. The equation is best understood not as an equation in the strictly mathematical sense, but to summarize all the various concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of life elsewhere.&lt;ref name='Burchell'&gt;{{cite journal |title=W(h)ither the Drake equation? |last=Burchell |first=M. J. |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=243–250 |date=2006 |doi=10.1017/S1473550406003107 |bibcode=2006IJAsB...5..243B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drake equation is:
:&lt;math&gt;N = R_{\ast} \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_{\ell} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''N'' = the number of Milky Way galaxy [[civilization]]s already capable of communicating across [[interplanetary space]]

and
:''R''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; = the average rate of [[star formation]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of those stars that have [[planet]]s
:''n''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; = the average number of planets that can potentially support [[life]]
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets that actually support life
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of planets with life that evolves to become [[intelligence|intelligent]] life (civilizations)
:''f''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; = the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology to broadcast detectable signs of their existence into space
:''L'' = the length of time over which such civilizations broadcast detectable signals into space

Drake's proposed estimates are as follows, but numbers on the right side of the equation are agreed as speculative and open to substitution:

&lt;math&gt;10{,}000 = 5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 1 \cdot 10{,}000&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NOVA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Aguirre |first=L. |date=1 July 2008 |title=The Drake Equation |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/drake.html |work=[[Nova ScienceNow]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are uncertain and based on conjecture, not allowing conclusions to be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 6: What does a Martian look like? |title=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=Hoboken, NJ |first1=Jack |last1=Cohen |author1-link=Jack Cohen (scientist) |first2=Ian |last2=Stewart |author2-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician) |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-09-187927-3|title-link=Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led critics to label the equation a [[guesstimate]], or even meaningless.

===Cosmic pluralism===
{{main|Cosmic pluralism}}
[[File:Shri Simandhar Swami.jpg|thumb|200px|The statue of [[Simandhara]], an enlightened man in [[Jain]] mythology who is believed to be residing on another planet]] 
Cosmic pluralism, the plurality of worlds, or simply pluralism, describes the philosophical belief in numerous &quot;worlds&quot; in addition to Earth, which might harbor extraterrestrial life. Before the development of the [[heliocentric]] theory and a recognition that the Sun is just one of many stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html |title=Who discovered that the Sun was a Star? |publisher=Stanford Solar Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of pluralism was largely [[mythology|mythological]] and philosophical. The earliest recorded assertion of extraterrestrial human life is found in ancient scriptures of [[Jainism]]. There are multiple &quot;worlds&quot; mentioned in Jain scriptures that support human life. These include ''Bharat Kshetra'', ''Mahavideh Kshetra'', ''Airavat Kshetra'', ''Hari kshetra'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mukundchandra G.

Weintraub (2014). &quot;Islam,&quot; ''Religions and Extraterrestrial Life'' (pp 161–168). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[scientific revolution|scientific]] and [[Copernican revolution]]s, and later, during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], cosmic pluralism became a mainstream notion, supported by the likes of [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in his 1686 work ''[[Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds |publisher=University of California Press |first=Bernard le Bovier |last=de Fontenelle |others=trans. H. A. Hargreaves |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-520-91058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluralism was also championed by philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[Giordano Bruno]] and astronomers such as [[William Herschel]]. The astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] promoted the notion of cosmic pluralism in his 1862 book ''La pluralité des mondes habités''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/F/Flammarion.html |title=Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925) |publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these notions of pluralism were based on any specific observation or scientific information.

===Early modern period===
There was a dramatic shift in thinking initiated by the invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] assault on geocentric cosmology. Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds &quot;have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth&quot; and, like Earth, &quot;contain animals and inhabitants&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |accessdate=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that &quot;if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.
The didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in &quot;Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds&quot; (1647).
In &quot;The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books&quot; (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: &quot;We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place&quot;. With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested &quot;our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere&quot;. [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s &quot;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&quot; (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.

The possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th–19th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed &quot;cosmic pluralism&quot; included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. At the height of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], even the [[Sun]] and Moon were considered candidates for extraterrestrial inhabitants.

===19th century===
[[File:Lowell Mars channels.jpg|thumb|Artificial Martian channels, depicted by Percival Lowell]]

Speculation about life on Mars increased in the late 19th century, following telescopic observation of apparent [[Martian canals]]—which soon, however, turned out to be optical illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Experiments as to the actuality of the &quot;Canals&quot; observed on Mars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first1=J. E. |last1=Evans |first2=E.

G. Wells]] to write the novel ''[[The War of the Worlds (novel)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1897, telling of an invasion by aliens from Mars who were fleeing the planet's desiccation.

[[Spectroscopy|Spectroscopic]] analysis of Mars's atmosphere began in earnest in 1894, when U.S. astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell]] showed that neither water nor oxygen was present in the [[Martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chambers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Paul |last=Chambers |title=Life on Mars; The Complete Story |place=London |publisher=Blandford |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7137-2747-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeonmarscomple00cham }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1909 better telescopes and the best perihelic opposition of Mars since 1877 conclusively put an end to the canal hypothesis.

The [[science fiction]] genre, although not so named during the time, developed during the late 19th century. [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the Moon]]'' (1870) features a discussion of the possibility of life on the Moon, but with the conclusion that it is barren.
Stories involving extraterrestrials are found in e.g. [[Garrett P. Serviss]]'s ''[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]'' (1898), an unauthorized sequel to
''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by H. G. Wells was published in 1897 which stands at the beginning of the popular idea of the &quot;Martian invasion&quot; of Earth prominent in 20th-century pop culture.

The possibility of extraterrestrial life on the Moon was ruled out in the 1960s, and during the 1970s it became clear that most of the other bodies of the Solar System do not harbor highly developed life, although the question of primitive life on bodies in the Solar System remains open.

===Recent history===
The failure so far of the [[SETI]] program to detect an intelligent radio signal after decades of effort has at least partially dimmed the prevailing optimism of the beginning of the space age. Notwithstanding, belief in extraterrestrial beings continues to be voiced in [[pseudoscience]], conspiracy theories, and in popular [[folklore]], notably &quot;[[Sector Four|Area 51]]&quot; and [[Planets proposed in religion and ufology|legends]]. It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.

In the words of SETI's Frank Drake, &quot;All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.

In 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).

Theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. &quot;If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]&quot;, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response, &quot;The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WhiteHouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Larson |first=Phil |title=Searching for ET, But No Evidence Yet |url=https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[White House]] |accessdate=6 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124052154/https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/Petitions#!/response/searching-et-no-evidence-yet |archivedate=24 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |title=No Alien Visits or UFO Coverups, White House Says |url=http://www.universetoday.com/90717/no-alien-visits-or-ufo-coverups-white-house-says/ |date=5 November 2011 |publisher=[[UniverseToday]] |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the response, there is &quot;no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WhiteHouse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot;/&gt; The response noted &quot;odds are pretty high&quot; that there may be life on other planets but &quot;the odds of us making contact with any of them—especially any [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent ones]]—are extremely small, given the distances involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WhiteHouse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot;/&gt;

In 2013, the [[exoplanet]] [[Kepler-62f]] was discovered, along with [[Kepler-62e]] and [[Kepler-62c]].
