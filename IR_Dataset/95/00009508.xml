The '''{{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}''' ([[Latin]] for &quot;British Encyclopaedia&quot;) is a [[general knowledge]] English-language [[encyclopaedia]]. It was formerly published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]], and other publishers (for previous editions). It was written by about 100&amp;nbsp;full-time editors and more than 4,000&amp;nbsp;contributors. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes&lt;ref name=&quot;nytstop&quot; /&gt; and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition.

The ''Britannica'' is the English-language encyclopaedia that was in print for the longest time: it lasted 244 years. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of [[Edinburgh]], as three volumes. (This first edition is available in [[facsimile]].) The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.britannica.com/company_info.html|title=History of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica Online|accessdate=31 May 2019|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020084752/http://corporate.britannica.com/company_info.html|archivedate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.britannica.com/company_info.html|url-status = unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010609041910/http://corporate.britannica.com/company_info.html|archivedate=9 June 2001|website=Britannica.com|title=History of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica.com|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th editions]] (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the ''Britannica'' shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. In 1933, the ''Britannica'' became the first encyclopaedia to adopt &quot;continuous revision&quot;, in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. In March 2012, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. announced it would no longer publish printed editions, and would focus instead on ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0314/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-After-244-years-in-print-only-digital-copies-sold|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica: After 244 years in print, only digital copies sold|last=Kearney|first=Christine|date=14 March 2012|website=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=31 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th edition had a three-part structure: a 12-volume {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} of short articles (generally fewer than 750&amp;nbsp;words), a 17-volume {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}} of long articles (two to 310&amp;nbsp;pages), and a single {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}} volume to give a [[hierarchical]] outline of knowledge. The {{lang|la|Micropædia}} was meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the {{lang|la|Macropædia}}; readers are advised to study the {{lang|la|Propædia}} outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. Over 70 years, the size of the ''Britannica'' has remained steady, with about 40&amp;nbsp;million words on half a million topics. Though published in the United States since 1901, the ''Britannica'' has for the most part maintained [[American and British English spelling differences|British English spelling]].

=== Print version ===
[[File:Encyclopaedia Britannica 15 with 2002.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|15th edition of the ''Britannica''. The initial volume with the green spine is the {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}; the red-spined and black-spined volumes are the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} and the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}, respectively. The last three volumes are the 2002 Book of the Year (black spine) and the two-volume index (cyan spine).]]
Since 1985, the ''Britannica'' has had four parts: the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}}, the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}, the {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}, and a two-volume index. The ''Britannica''{{'s}} articles are found in the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}, which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 {{lang|la|Macropædia}} has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 {{lang|la|Micropædia}} has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt; The {{lang|la|Micropædia}} articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the {{lang|la|Macropædia}}. The {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual states. A 2013 &quot;Global Edition&quot; of ''Britannica'' contained approximately forty thousand articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;store.britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100 |title=Britannica Global Edition |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705002524/http://store.britannica.com/products/043009100 |archive-date=5 July 2014 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica Store }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information can be found in the ''Britannica'' by following the cross-references in the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the {{lang|la|Propædia}}, which organizes the ''Britannica''{{'s}} contents by topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;index_preface&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, ''Index'' preface| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the {{lang|la|Propædia}} is its &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;, which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the ''Britannica''{{'s}} editors to decide which articles should be included in the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of ''Britannica'' articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1992 | title = Purchasing an Encyclopedia: 12 Points to Consider | edition = 4th | publisher = [[Booklist]] Publications, [[American Library Association]] | isbn = 978-0-8389-5754-7 | author = reviews by the Editorial Board of Reference Books Bulletin ; revised introduction by Sandy Whiteley.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|la|Propædia}} also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the ''Britannica''.

Taken together, the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}} comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images.&lt;ref name=&quot;index_preface&quot; /&gt; The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the ''Britannica'', together with 474,675 subentries under those topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; The ''Britannica'' generally prefers [[British English|British spelling]] over [[American English|American]];&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; for example, it uses ''colour'' (not ''color''), ''centre'' (not ''center''), and ''encyclopaedia'' (not ''encyclopedia''). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as ''defense'' rather than ''defence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Defense mechanism | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 3 | pages = 957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as &quot;Color: ''see'' Colour.&quot;

Since 1936, the articles of the ''Britannica'' have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopaedia_1954&quot; /&gt; According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eb.com/library/print/eb.html |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: School &amp; Library Site, promotional materials for the 2007 ''Britannica'' |accessdate=11 April 2007 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322035443/http://www.eb.com/library/print/eb.html |archivedate=22 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com.au/product.asp?prod=HLMPKG07 |title=Australian Encyclopædia Britannica, promotional materials for the 2007 ''Britannica'' |accessdate=10 April 2007 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830124610/http://www.britannica.com.au/product.asp?prod=HLMPKG07 |archivedate=30 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabetization of articles in the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}} follows strict rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;micropedia_preface&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|Micropædia}} preface| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diacritic]]al marks and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as &quot;[[War of 1812|1812, War of]]&quot; are alphabetized as if the number had been written out (&quot;Eighteen-twelve, War of&quot;). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, [[Charles the Simple|Charles III]] of France precedes [[Charles I of England]], listed in ''Britannica'' as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetized as if their titles were &quot;Charles, France, 3&quot; and &quot;Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1&quot;.) Similarly, places that share names are organized alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.

In March 2012, the company announced that the 2010 edition would be the last printed version. This was announced as a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2012/03/change/|title=Change: It's OK.

=== Contributors ===
The 2007 print version of the ''Britannica'' has 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel laureate economist [[Milton Friedman]], astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], and surgeon [[Michael DeBakey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;macropaedia_contributors&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 531–674| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 ([[Alfred North Whitehead]]), while another quarter are retired or [[:wikt:emeritus|emeritus]]. Most (approximately 98%{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is [[Christine Sutton]] of the [[University of Oxford]], who contributed 24 articles on [[particle physics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

While ''Britannica''{{'s}} authors have included writers such as [[Albert Einstein]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-9uFq-w6JicC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=contributors+to+encyclopedia+britannica+%22albert+Einstein%22#v=onepage&amp;q=contributors%20to%20encyclopedia%20britannica%20%22albert%20Einstein%22&amp;f=false|title=The Renaissance of Jewish Culture in Weimar Germany|last=Brenner|first=Michael|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300077209|location=|pages=117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Curie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPqfyfgi834C&amp;pg=PA44|title=The Cult of the Amateur: How Blogs, MySpace, YouTube, and the Rest of Today's User-generated Media are Destroying Our Economy, Our Culture, and Our Values|last=Keen|first=Andrew|date=2007|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385520812|location=|pages=44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leon Trotsky]],&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/contributor/Isaac-Asimov/108|title=Isaac Asimov|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; some have been criticized for lack of expertise. In 1911 the historian [[George Lincoln Burr|George L. Burr]] wrote:

{{quote|With a temerity almost appalling, [the ''Britannica'' contributor, Mr. Philips] ranges over nearly the whole field of European history, political, social, ecclesiastical... The grievance is that &amp;#91;this work&amp;#93; lacks authority.

Paul T. Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclopædia Britannica. He began his career there in 1934, eventually earning the positions of treasurer, vice president, and chief financial officer in his 58 years with the company, before retiring in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armstrong |work=Chicago Tribune |date=20 Jan 2001 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/keyword/encyclopedia-britannica |access-date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2007 editorial staff of the ''Britannica'' included five Senior Editors and nine Associate Editors, supervised by [[Dale Hoiberg]] and four others. The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} and some sections of the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_biochemistry&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Biochemical Components of Organisms | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica, 15th ed. | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc]] | year = 2007 | volume = 14 | pages = 1007–1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparation and publication of the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} required trained staff. According to the final page of the 2007 {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}, the staff were organized into ten departments:&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2007 |title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |journal=Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc |edition=15th edition, {{lang|la|Propædia}}|bibcode=1991neb..book.....G |last1=Goetz |first1=Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Editorial staff (19 editors and 1 executive assistant)
# Art and Cartography (9 employees)
# Compositional Technology and Design (4 employees)
# Copy Department (12 employees)
# Editorial and Publishing Technologies (5 employees)
# Information Management (9 employees)
# Media Asset Management and Production Control (4 employees)
# Reference Librarians (3 employees)
# World Data (5 employees)
# Manufacturing (1 employee)

Some of these departments were organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]. For example, the copy editors were divided into four copy editors, two senior copy editors, four supervisors, plus a coordinator and a director. Similarly, the Editorial department was headed by [[Dale Hoiberg]] and assisted by four others; they oversaw the work of five senior editors, nine associate editors, and one executive assistant.

Britannica had 14 editors in 2019: Adam Augustyn, Patricia Bauer, Brian Duignan, Alison Eldridge, Erik Gregersen, Amy McKenna, Melissa Petruzzello, John P. Rafferty, Michael Ray, Kara Rogers, Amy Tikkanen, Jeff Wallenfeldt, Adam Zeidan, and Alicja Zelazko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021014546/https://www.britannica.com/editor/The-Editors-of-Encyclopaedia-Britannica/4419|archivedate=21 October 2019|url=https://www.britannica.com/editor/The-Editors-of-Encyclopaedia-Britannica/4419|title=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|year=2019|accessdate=21 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editorial advisors ===
The ''Britannica'' has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars:&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_editorial advisors&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| page = 5| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Board of Editors |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=30 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204050531/http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; non-fiction author [[Nicholas G.

The {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}} and its ''Outline of Knowledge'' were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of [[Mortimer J. Adler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_other_editorial_advisors&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 524–530| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects – [[Rene Dubos]] (d. 1982), [[Loren Eiseley]] (d. 1977), [[Harold D. Lasswell]] (d. 1978), [[Mark Van Doren]] (d. 1972), [[Peter Ritchie Calder]] (d. 1982) and [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (d. 2001). The {{lang|la|Propædia}} also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;micropaedia_consultants&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 675–744| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate structure ===
In January 1996, the ''Britannica'' was purchased from the [[Benton Foundation]] by billionaire Swiss financier [[Jacqui Safra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960104/britannica.shtml | title = Britannica sold by Benton Foundation | publisher = University of Chicago Chronicle | date = 4 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, Don Yannias, a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html | title = Encyclopædia Britannica Announces Appointment of Don Yannias As Chief Executive Officer | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 4 March 1997 | accessdate =15 March 2012|archivedate=9 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709103523/http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a new company, [[Britannica.com Inc.]], was [[corporate spin-off|created]] to develop digital versions of the ''Britannica''; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at Britannica.com Inc. was marked by missteps, considerable lay-offs, and financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Abramson |first=Ronna |date=9 April 2001 |title=Look Under &quot;M&quot; for Mess—Company Business and Marketing |magazine=The Industry Standard |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 |accessdate=26 March 2007 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013183837/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Yannias was replaced by [[Ilan Yeshua]], who reunited the leadership of the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Ilan Yeshua Named Britannica CEO. Veteran Executive to Consolidate Operations of Encyclopædia Britannica and Britannica.com | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 16 May 2001 | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the ''Britannica''{{'s}} Board of Directors.

In 2003, former management consultant [[Jorge Aguilar-Cauz]] was appointed President of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the ''Britannica's'' Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the ''Britannica'' brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_Chair_President&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| page = 2| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''Britannica'' management has eliminated employee [[401(k)]] accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the ''Britannica'' staff have gone years without pay rises.&lt;!-- Note: pay &quot;rise&quot; is not an error, and is correct in British English; no need to change to the North American variant of pay &quot;raise&quot;.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cash-shy Britannica |page=6 |work=New York Post |date=11 September 2003 |url=http://www.pagesix.com/story/cash-shy+britannica |accessdate=26 March 2007 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2017, Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclopædia Britannica Group. Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high-level positions in digital media, including RELX (Reed Elsevier, FT SE 100) and Rodale, in which he was responsible for &quot;driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/encyclopaedia-britannica-group-appoints-karthik-krishnan-as-global-chief-executive-officer-300570318.html|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica Group Appoints Karthik Krishnan as Global Chief Executive Officer|last=Group|first=Encyclopaedia Britannica|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its 250th anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K-12 schools, Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year.

First was Britannica Insights,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-encyclopedia-britannica-fact-check-plug-in-20180608-story.html|title=Google results aren't always accurate. Encyclopaedia Britannica's new Chrome extension could help.|last=Marotti|first=Ally|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=3 December 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free, downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited, fact-checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Its purpose, the company said, was to &quot;provide trusted, verified information&quot; in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and &quot;fake news.&quot;

The product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights, which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica's online classroom solutions, and a partnership with YouTube&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bigthink.com/brandon-weber/new-to-youtube-a-fact-checking-collaboration-with-wikipedia-encyclopedia-brittanica|title=YouTube now displays facts below conspiracy theory videos|date=2018-08-08|work=Big Think|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user-generated video content that could be false or misleading. &amp;nbsp;

== Competition ==
As the ''Britannica'' is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]]'' or the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the ''Britannica''{{'s}} main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of [[Ephraim Chambers]] and, soon thereafter, ''[[Rees's Cyclopædia]]'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopædia Metropolitana]]''. In the 20th century, successful competitors included ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'', the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', and the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the ''Britannica'' was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia,&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas_1992&quot; /&gt; especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; The print version of the ''Britannica'' was significantly more expensive than its competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the ''Britannica'' has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of [[Web search engine|search engines]], has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as [[Google Book Search|Google Books]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[MIT OpenCourseWare|release of its educational materials]] and the open [[PubMed Central]] library of the [[National Library of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title=Accessibility of information on the web |journal=Nature |volume=400 |issue=6740 |year=1999 |doi=10.1038/21987 |pmid=10428673|bibcode = 1999Natur.400..107L |pages=107–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title= Searching the Web: general and scientific information access |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=116–122 |year=1999 |doi=10.1109/35.739314|citeseerx= 10.1.1.118.3636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electronic publishing takes journals into a new realm |publisher=American Chemical Society | url=http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/980518/elec.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990117003816/http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/980518/elec.html |url-status = dead| archive-date=17 January 1999 |accessdate=11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the ''Britannica'' has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor [[Walter Yust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_1954&quot; /&gt; Eventually, the ''Britannica'' turned to focus more on its online edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17362698|title=Britannica ends its print edition|date=14 December 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=2 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print encyclopaedias ===
The {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; A well-known comparison is that of [[Kenneth Kister]], who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' with two comparable encyclopaedias, ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random—[[circumcision]], [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]], [[Galileo]], [[Philip Glass]], [[heart disease]], [[IQ]], [[panda bear]], [[sexual harassment]], [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Uzbekistan]]—and letter grades of A–D or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between [[grade conversion|B− and B+]], chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the ''Britannica'' received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s, ''Encyclopedia Americana'' received eight &quot;A&quot;s, and ''Collier's'' received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s; thus, ''Britannica'' received an average score of 92% for accuracy to ''Americana''{{'}}s 95% and ''Collier's'' 92%. In the timeliness category, ''Britannica'' averaged an 86% to ''Americana'''s 90% and ''Collier's'' 85%.

=== Digital encyclopaedias on optical media ===
The most notable competitor of the ''Britannica'' among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopaedias was ''[[Encarta]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;seymour_2006&quot; /&gt; now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias: ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]]'', ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia|Collier's]]'' and the ''New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia''. ''Encarta'' was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | title = Microsoft Encarta—Premium 2007: Overview | url = http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=002 | accessdate =6 April 2007}} Sales figures for January 2000&amp;nbsp;– February 2006 as provided by the [[NPD Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both occupied the same price range, with the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|2007 Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate]]'' CD or DVD costing US$40–50&lt;ref name=&quot;2007EncartaPrice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/mar/27/20070327-113641-4034r/?page=all |title=Digital encyclopedia has wealth of information |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Store&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.britannica.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=765&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=4&amp;iSubCat=14&amp;iProductID=765&amp;show=all |title=The Britannica Store |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 November 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta Store&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-FB7-00442-Encarta-Premium-2007/dp/B000FL2DQS|title= Amazon.com: Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007: Software|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Britannica'' contains 100,000 articles and ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus]]'' (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Store&quot; /&gt; ''Encarta'' contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta Store&quot; /&gt; Like ''Encarta'', the ''Britannica'' has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;seymour_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=502|title= Encyclopedia face-off: Encarta vs Britannica|accessdate=21 November 2006|last= Seymour|first= Ursula|date= 9 November 2006|work= PC Advisor|publisher= IDG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Britannica'', ''Encarta'' was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/artcenter_0/Encyclopedia_Articles.html |title=Encarta's Encyclopedia Article Center |accessdate=11 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028002800/http://encarta.msn.com/artcenter_0/Encyclopedia_Articles.html |archivedate=28 October 2009 |url-status = dead|df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet encyclopaedias ===
The dominant internet encyclopaedia and main alternative to ''Britannica'' is Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Tancer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1595184,00.html |title=Look Who's Using Wikipedia |author=Bill Tancer |date=1 May 2007 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |quote=The sheer volume of content [...] is partly responsible for the site's dominance as an online reference.

The 699 printed {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}} articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 printed {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a ''Britannica'' article either has known authorship&lt;!--&quot;...identified authors&quot; can parse as verb--&gt; or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the ''Britannica''{{'s}} contributors are experts in their field—some are Nobel laureates.&lt;ref name=&quot;macropaedia_contributors&quot; /&gt; By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise: most do not claim any particular expertise, and of those who do, many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles_Nature_study_2005&quot; /&gt; It is for this lack of institutional vetting, or certification, that former ''Britannica'' editor-in-chief Robert McHenry notes his belief that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the ''Britannica'' in accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBE&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=McHenry | title=The Faith-Based Encyclopedia | work=TCS Daily | date=15 November 2004 | url=http://www.ideasinactiontv.com/tcs_daily/2004/11/the-faith-based-encyclopedia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the journal ''Nature'' chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called &quot;relevant&quot; field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles—one from each site on a given topic—side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. ''Nature'' got back 42 usable reviews.

In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts: four from each site. It also discovered many factual errors, omissions or misleading statements: 162 in Wikipedia and 123 in ''Britannica'', an average of 3.86 mistakes per article for Wikipedia and 2.92 for ''Britannica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles_Nature_study_2005&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | pages = 900–1 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 438 | doi = 10.1038/438900a | year = 2005 | pmid = 16355180 | title = Internet encyclopaedias go head to head: Jimmy Wales' Wikipedia comes close to Britannica in terms of the accuracy of its science entries| issue = 7070 | last1 = Giles | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jim Giles (reporter)|bibcode = 2005Natur.438..900G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel|title=Study: Wikipedia as accurate as Britannica|url=http://news.cnet.com/Study-Wikipedia-as-accurate-as-Britannica/2100-1038_3-5997332.html|work=Staff Writer, CNET News|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Britannica ''was revealed as the more accurate encyclopedia, with fewer errors, [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] in its detailed 20-page rebuttal called ''Nature'''s study flawed and misleading&lt;ref name=&quot;fatally_flawed&quot;&gt;{{cite web

It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a ''Britannica'' yearbook and not the encyclopaedia, and another two were from ''Compton's Encyclopedia'' (called the ''Britannica Student Encyclopedia'' on the company's website). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalized for factual omissions. The company also noted that several of what ''Nature'' called errors were minor spelling variations, and that others were matters of interpretation. ''Nature'' defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of ''Britannica'', it used whatever relevant material was available on ''Britannica''{{'}}s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of ''Britannica UK'' said: {{quote|Wikipedia is a fun site to use and has a lot of interesting entries on there, but their approach wouldn't work for {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}. My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind.

=== Awards ===
The CD/DVD-ROM version of the ''Britannica'', ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]'', received the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from the [[Association of Educational Publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edpress.org/awards/04tech.htm | title = 2004 Distinguished Achievement Awards Winners: Technology | date = 1 August 2003 | accessdate =11 April 2007 | publisher = [[Association of Educational Publishers]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017162810/http://www.edpress.org/awards/04tech.htm |archivedate = 17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2009, {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} was awarded a spot as one of &quot;Top Ten Superbrands in the UK&quot; by a panel of more than 2,000 independent reviewers, as reported by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8149460.stm | title = Top Ten Superbrands 2009–2010 | accessdate =15 July 2009 |publisher=BBC | date=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coverage of topics ===
Topics are chosen in part by reference to the {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}} &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; The bulk of the ''Britannica'' is devoted to geography (26% of the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%).&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; A complementary study of the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the &quot;range, depth, and [[wikt:catholicity|catholicity]] of coverage [of the ''Britannica''] are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lang | first = JP | year = 1992 | title = Reference Sources for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries | edition = 5th | publisher = American Library Association | location = Chicago | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0-8389-3406-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Britannica'' does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of [[Buddhism]] and most other religions is covered in a single {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}} article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;macropaedia_2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Britannica'' has been lauded as the ''least'' biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|It can be stated without fear of contradiction that the 15th edition of the ''Britannica'' accords non-Western cultural, social, and scientific developments more notice than any general English-language encyclopedia currently on the market.|[[Kenneth Kister]]|in ''Kister's Best Encyclopedias'' (1994)}}

=== Criticism of editorial decisions ===
On rare occasions, the ''Britannica ''was criticized for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974–1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children's literature, [[military decoration]]s, and the French poet [[Joachim du Bellay]]; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek_1974&quot; /&gt; Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}} and {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;15th_criticism&quot; /&gt; Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a &quot;qualified failure...&amp;#91;that&amp;#93; cares more for juggling its format than for preserving.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek_1974&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Prescott | first = Peter S. | title = The Fifteenth Britannica | magazine = Newsweek | date = 8 July 1974 | pages = 71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, reviewers from the [[American Library Association]] were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 {{lang|la|Macropædia}}, along with the article on [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1992&quot; /&gt;

Some very few ''Britannica''-appointed contributors are mistaken. A notorious instance from the ''Britannica's'' early years is the rejection of [[Newtonian gravity]] by [[George Gleig]], the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788–1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the [[fire (classical element)|classical element of fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt; The ''Britannica'' has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics, as it did with [[William Robertson Smith]]'s articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate (1875).&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt;

=== Other criticisms ===
{{See also|Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition#Notable commentary on the Eleventh Edition}}
The ''Britannica'' has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the ''Britannica'',{{efn|1=According to Kister, the initial 15th edition (1974) required over $32&amp;nbsp;million to produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;}} and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopaedia_1954&quot; /&gt; For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition became outdated after 35 years (1929–1964). When American physicist [[Harvey Einbinder]] detailed its failings in his 1964 book, ''The Myth of the Britannica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Einbinder | first = Harvey | authorlink = Harvey Einbinder | year = 1964 | title = The Myth of the Britannica | url = https://archive.org/details/mythofbritannica0000einb | url-access = registration | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-384-14050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; It is still difficult to keep the ''Britannica'' current; one recent critic writes, &quot;it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision&quot;, noting that the longer {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter {{lang|la|Micropædia}} articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; Information in the {{lang|la|Micropædia}} is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding {{lang|la|Macropædia}} article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; The bibliographies of the {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles have been criticized for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;

In 2010 an inaccurate entry about the [[Irish Civil War]] was discussed in the Irish press following a decision of the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]] to pay for online access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/britannica-errors-spark-unholy-row-2045150.html |title=Britannica errors spark unholy row|work=[[Irish Independent]] |date= 3 February 2010|accessdate=30 August 2010 |first=Grainne |last=Cunningham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehy, Clodagh (4 February 2010).

Writing about the 3rd edition (1788–1797), ''Britannica''{{'}}s chief editor [[George Gleig]] observed that &quot;perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supplement to the Encyclopædia or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences and Miscellaneous Literature|year=1803|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3YBulnow6IC&amp;pg=PR4 iv]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the ''Britannica'' wrote, &quot;we in no way mean to imply that ''Britannica'' is error-free; we have never made such a claim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fatally_flawed&quot; /&gt; The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]:

{{quote|{{Smallcaps|With}} regard to errors in general, whether falling under the denomination of mental, typographical or accidental, we are conscious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever. Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties attending the execution of a work of such an extensive nature will make proper allowances. To these we appeal, and shall rest satisfied with the judgment they pronounce.&lt;ref&gt;William Smellie in the [[s: Preface to the 1st edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica|Preface]] to the 1st edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, [[Jorge Cauz]] (president of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.) asserted in 2012 that &quot;''Britannica'' [...] will always be factually correct.&quot;&lt;ref name=nytstop /&gt;

[[File:Houghton Typ 705.71.363 Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1771 - title page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the first edition of the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}]]
{{Main|History of the Encyclopædia Britannica}}
Past owners have included, in chronological order, the Edinburgh, Scotland printers [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], Scottish bookseller [[Archibald Constable]], Scottish publisher [[A &amp; C Black]], [[Horace Everett Hooper]], [[Sears]] Roebuck and [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]].

The present owner of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. is [[Jacqui Safra]], a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]], ''[[Encarta]]'' and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias.&lt;ref name=&quot;web&quot; /&gt; To remain competitive, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the ''Britannica'', reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on [[CD-ROM]], DVD, and the [[World Wide Web]]. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopaedia_1954&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1954 | title = Encyclopaedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 14th}} Aside from providing an excellent summary of the ''Britannica's'' history and early spin-off products, this article also describes the life-cycle of a typical ''Britannica'' edition. A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated. When work on a new edition is begun, sales of the old edition stop, just when fiscal needs are greatest: a new editorial staff must be assembled, articles commissioned. [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] identified this fluctuation of income as a danger to any encyclopaedia, one he hoped to overcome with continuous revision.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Editions ===
The ''Britannica'' has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 4th editions (see the [[#Edition summary|Table]] below). The 5th and 6th editions were reprints of the 4th, the 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organization in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th. The 14th and 15th editions were edited every year throughout their runs, so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones.

Throughout history, the ''Britannica'' has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book, and to provide educational material.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematize all human knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 2007 | title = The New Encyclopædia Britannica | journal = Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc | edition= 15th edition, {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}| pages = 5–8| bibcode = 1991neb..book.....G | last1 = Goetz | first1 = Philip W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the ''Britannica'' can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management, or re-organization of the dictionary.

==== 1768–1826 ====
[[File:Rosetta Stone.jpg|thumb|right|The early 19th-century editions of {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} included influential, original research such as [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's]] article on Egypt, which included the translation of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] on the [[Rosetta Stone]] (pictured).]]
In the first era (1st–6th editions, 1768–1826), the ''Britannica'' was managed and published by its founders, [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], by [[Archibald Constable]], and by others. The ''Britannica'' was first published between December 1768&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Encyclopaedia|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Encyclopaedia|encyclopedia=1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=9|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1771 in [[Edinburgh]] as the ''Encyclopædia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan''. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (published 1751–72), which had been inspired by [[Cyclopædia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'']] (first edition 1728). It went on sale December 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |number=938490995649536000 |title=Our early history is described in our &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; entry: |date=&lt;!--11:31&amp;nbsp;am - --&gt;6 December 2017 |user=Britannica |accessdate=6 December 2017}} [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Encyclopaedia-Britannica-English-language-reference-work &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Britannica'' of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise, and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herman | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur L. Herman | year = 2002 | title = How the Scots Invented the Modern World | publisher = Three Rivers Press | isbn = 978-0-609-80999-0| title-link = How the Scots Invented the Modern World }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the ''Britannica'' moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editor—[[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Krapp |first=Philip |author2=Balou, Patricia K. |year=1992 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia |volume=9 |pages=135 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Company |location=New York |lccn=91061165}} The ''Britannica's'' 1st edition is described as &quot;deplorably inaccurate and unscientific&quot; in places.&lt;/ref&gt;—to a 20-volume set written by numerous authorities.&lt;ref name=KafkerLoveland2009/&gt; Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''Cyclopædia'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopædia Metropolitana]]'' and [[David Brewster]]'s ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]''.

==== 1827–1901 ====
During the second era (7th–9th editions, 1827–1901), the ''Britannica'' was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm [[A &amp; C Black]]. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably [[Macvey Napier]], others were attracted by the ''Britannica's'' reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974.

Production of the 9th edition was overseen by [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], the first English-born editor-in-chief. Dubbed the &quot;Scholar's Edition&quot;, the 9th edition is the most scholarly of all ''Britannicas''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the Encyclopædia Britannica | url = https://archive.org/details/greatebstoryo00koga_1 | url-access = registration | publisher = The [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | lccn = 58008379}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, Baynes was assisted by [[William Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SBDEL|wstitle=Baynes, Thomas Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; No biographies of living persons were included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Editor's Advertisement|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Thomas Huxley]] were special advisors on science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Prefatory Notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated, and the ''Britannica'' faced financial difficulties.

==== 1901–1973 ====
[[File:EncycBrit1913.jpg|left|thumb|US advertisement for the 11th edition from the May 1913 issue of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'']]

In the third era (10th–14th editions, 1901–1973), the ''Britannica'' was managed by American businessmen who introduced [[direct marketing]] and [[door-to-door]] sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, [[Horace Everett Hooper|Horace Hooper]], lavished enormous effort on its perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt;

When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the ''Britannica'' was managed by [[Sears Roebuck]] for 18 years (1920–1923, 1928–1943). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, [[Elkan Harrison Powell]], assumed presidency of the ''Britannica''; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopaedia_1954&quot; /&gt; Powell developed new educational products that built upon the ''Britannica''{{'}}s reputation.

[[File:Shipping box for the encyclopedia Britannica 2013-04-13 12-24.jpg|alt=A wooden crate reading &quot;THE / ENCYCLOPAEDIA / BRITANNICA / STANDARD OF THE WORLD / FOURTEENTH EDITION / BLUE CLOTH / BOOKS KEEP DRY&quot;|thumb|A wooden shipping crate for the 14th edition of the ''Britannica'']]

In 1943, Sears donated the {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}} to the [[University of Chicago]]. [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]], then a vice president of the University, provided the working capital for its operation. The stock was divided between Benton and the University, with the University holding an option on the stock.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 22 February 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Benton became chairman of the board and managed the ''Britannica'' until his death in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', 28 January 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Benton set up the [[Benton Foundation]], which managed the ''Britannica'' until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the ''Britannica'' celebrated [[Bicentennial of the Encyclopædia Britannica|its bicentennial]].

==== 1974–1994 ====
In the fourth era (1974–94), the ''Britannica'' introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organized into three parts: the {{lang|la|[[Micropædia]]}}, the {{lang|la|[[Macropædia]]}}, and the {{lang|la|[[Propædia]]}}. Under [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (member of the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of ''Britannica'' from 1965),&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''A Guidebook to Learning: for the lifelong pursuit of wisdom''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1986, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Britannica'' sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool, but to systematize all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the {{lang|la|Micro-}} and {{lang|la|Macropædia}}) provoked a &quot;firestorm of criticism&quot; of the initial 15th edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;15th_criticism&quot;&gt;

This second version of the 15th edition continued to be published and revised until the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the ''New Encyclopædia Britannica'', although it has also been promoted as ''Britannica 3''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;

On 9 March 1976 the US [[Federal Trade Commission]] entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using: a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/commission_decision_volumes/volume-87/ftc_volume_decision_87_january_-_june_1976pages_400-541.pdf|title=In the Matter of Encyclopedia Britannica, Inc. et al.|pages= 421–541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1994–present ====
[[File:Eb advert 1898.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for the 9th edition (1898)]]
In the fifth era (1994–present), digital versions have been developed and released on [[Optical disc|optical media]] and online. In 1996, the ''Britannica'' was bought by [[Jacqui Safra]] at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, [[Britannica.com Inc.]], developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies have shared a CEO, [[Ilan Yeshua]], who has continued Powell's strategy of introducing new products with the ''Britannica'' name. In March 2012, Britannica's president, [[Jorge Cauz]], announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia, with the 2010 15th edition being the last. The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytstop&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-stop&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/13/technology/encyclopedia-britannica-books/|title=Encyclopedia Britannica to stop printing books|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|date=13 March 2012|publisher=CNN|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Britannica''{{'}}s final print edition was in 2010, a 32-volume set.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytstop&quot; /&gt; ''Britannica Global Edition'' was also printed in 2010. It contained 30 volumes and 18,251 pages, with 8,500 photographs, maps, flags, and illustrations in smaller &quot;compact&quot; volumes. It contained over 40,000 articles written by scholars from across the world, including Nobel Prize winners. Unlike the 15th edition, it did not contain {{lang|la|Macro-}} and {{lang|la|Micropædia}} sections, but ran A through Z as all editions up to the 14th had. The following is ''Britannica''{{'}}s description of the work:&lt;ref name=&quot;store.britannica.com&quot; /&gt;

{{quote|The editors of {{lang|la|Encyclopædia Britannica}}, the world standard in reference since 1768, present the ''Britannica Global Edition''.

=== Dedications ===
The ''Britannica'' was [[Dedication (publishing)|dedicated]] to the reigning [[British monarchy|British monarch]] from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; Thus, the 11th edition is &quot;dedicated by Permission to His Majesty [[George V of the United Kingdom|George the Fifth]], [[King of Great Britain and Ireland]] and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, [[Emperor of India]], and to [[William Howard Taft]], President of the United States of America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_1911&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1910 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | edition = 11th | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is &quot;Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, [[Dwight D.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopædia Britannica. With preliminary dissertations on the history of the sciences.''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The 7th to 14th editions included a separate index volume.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The 9th edition featured articles by notables of the day, such as [[James Clerk Maxwell]] on electricity and magnetism, and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (who became Lord Kelvin) on heat.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The 10th edition included a maps volume and a cumulative index volume for the 9th and 10th edition volumes: ''the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the existing volumes of the 9th ed., the 10th ed.&amp;nbsp;... and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with recent events and developments''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ''Vols. 30–32&amp;nbsp;... the New volumes constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; This supplement replaced the previous supplement: ''The three new supplementary volumes constituting, with the volumes of the latest standard edition, the thirteenth edition.''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; At this point ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' began almost annual revisions. New revisions of the 14th edition appeared every year between 1929 and 1973 with the exceptions of 1931, 1934 and 1935.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=15th |location=Chicago |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2007 |at=interior flap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Annual revisions were published every year between 1974 and 2007 with the exceptions of 1996, 1999, 2000, 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The 15th edition (introduced as &quot;Britannica 3&quot;) was published in three parts: a 10-volume {{lang|la|Micropædia}} (which contained short articles and served as an index), a 19-volume {{lang|la|Macropædia}}, plus the {{lang|la|Propædia}} (see text).

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; In 1985, the system was modified by adding a separate two-volume index; the {{lang|la|Macropædia}} articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 US states were all included into the &quot;United States of America&quot; article), with some medium-length articles moved to the {{lang|la|Micropædia}}. The {{lang|la|Micropædia}} had 12 vols. and the {{lang|la|Macropædia}} 17.

The first CD-ROM edition was issued in 1994. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In 1999 this was offered free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended in 2001 and a new printed set was issued in 2001.
