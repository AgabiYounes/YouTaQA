'''Elias Canetti''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɛ|t|i|,_|k|ɑː|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canetti &quot;Canetti&quot;]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-bg|Елиас Канети}}; 25 July 1905 – 14 August 1994) was a [[German-language]] author, born in [[Ruse, Bulgaria]] to a merchant family. They moved to [[Manchester, England]], but his father died in 1912, and his mother took her three sons back to the continent.  They settled in Vienna.

Canetti moved to England in 1938 after the Anschluss to escape Nazi persecution. He became a British citizen in 1952.  He is known as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and non-fiction writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C.G.|title=A Companion to the Works of Elias Canetti|date=2009|isbn=978-080-578-276-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/eliascanetti00thom/page/350 350]|chapter=Introduction|chapter-url-access=registration|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/eliascanetti00thom|publisher=Twayne Publishers|url=https://archive.org/details/eliascanetti00thom/page/350}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981, &quot;for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1981|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1981/|accessdate=8 April 2014 |author=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his non-fiction book ''Crowds and Power'', among other works.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Born in 1905 to businessman Jacques Canetti and Mathilde ''née'' Arditti in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], a city on the [[Danube]] in [[Bulgaria]], Canetti was the eldest of three sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;litenc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Dagmar C. G.|date=17 April 2004 |title=Elias Canetti|journal=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|issn=1747-678X|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=725|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors were [[Sephardi Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/luminary/canetti-elias|title=Heroes – Trailblazers of the Jewish People|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal ancestors settled in Ruse from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Edirne|Adrianople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;litenc&quot;/&gt; The original family name was ''Cañete'', named after [[Cañete, Cuenca]], a village in [[Spain]].

In Ruse, Canetti's father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building, which they had built in 1898.&lt;ref name=&quot;gesellschaft&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eliascanetti.org/73.0.html?&amp;L=3 |title=The Canetti House&amp;nbsp;– a forum for alternative culture |publisher=Internationale Elias Canetti Gesellschaft |accessdate=2009-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324203226/http://eliascanetti.org/73.0.html?&amp;L=3 |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canetti's mother descended from the Arditti family, one of the oldest Sephardi families in Bulgaria, who were among the founders of the Ruse Jewish colony in the late 18th century. The Ardittis can be traced to the 14th century, when they were court physicians and astronomers to the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] royal court of [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso IV]] and [[Peter IV of Aragon|Pedro IV]]. Before settling in Ruse, they had migrated into Italy and lived in [[Livorno]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohrenzeuge&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Angelova|first=Penka|title=Elias Canetti: Der Ohrenzeuge des Jahrhunderts|publisher=Internationale Elias-Canetti-Gesellschaft Rousse|year=2006|chapter=Die Geburtsstadt von Elias Canetti|chapter-url=https://www.archives.government.bg/tda/docs/canetti_izlojba_ruse.pdf|language=German|access-date=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410202259/https://www.archives.government.bg/tda/docs/canetti_izlojba_ruse.pdf|archive-date=10 April 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elias Canettis fødested.JPG|right|thumb|Elias Canetti's native house in [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

Canetti spent his childhood years, from 1905 to 1911, in Ruse until the family moved to Manchester, England, where Canetti's father joined a business established by his wife's brothers. In 1912, his father died suddenly, and his mother moved with their children first to [[Lausanne]], then [[Vienna]] in the same year. They lived in Vienna from the time Canetti was aged seven onwards. His mother insisted that he speak German, and taught it to him. By this time Canetti already spoke [[Judezmo|Ladino]] (his native language), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], English, and some French; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in Britain. Subsequently, the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to [[Zürich]] and then (until 1924) to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where Canetti graduated from high school.

Canetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature. Introduced into the literary circles of [[First Austrian Republic|First-Republic]]-[[Vienna]], he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the [[July Revolt of 1927]] – he came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings), and left the place quickly with his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;Stieg, Gerard, ''Fruits de Feu - l'incendie du Palais du Justice de Vienne en 1927 et ses consequences dans la Littérature Autrichienne''. Université de Rouen ({{ISBN|9782877750080}}), 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a degree in chemistry from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1929, but never worked as a chemist.

He published two works in Vienna before escaping to Great Britain. He reflected the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in his novel ''Die Blendung'' (''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'', 1935) and non-fiction ''[[Crowds and Power]]'' (1960). He wrote several volumes of memoirs, contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood.

==Personal life==
[[File:Canetti Peak.jpg|thumb|right|Canetti Peak, Antarctica, named after Elias Canetti]]

In 1934 in Vienna he married Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon (1897–1963), who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant. Canetti remained open to relationships with other women. He had a short affair with [[Anna Mahler]]. In 1938, after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany, the Canetti couple moved to [[London]]. He became closely involved with the painter [[Marie-Louise von Motesiczky]], who was to remain a close companion for many years. His name has also been linked with the author [[Iris Murdoch]] (see [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]]'s ''Iris, A Memoir of Iris Murdoch'', which has several references to an author, referred to as &quot;the Dichter&quot;, who was a Nobel Laureate and whose works included ''Die Blendung'' [English title ''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'']).

After Veza died in 1963, Canetti married Hera Buschor (1933–1988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972. Canetti's brother [[Jacques Canetti]] settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French [[chanson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/06/10/jacques-canetti-le-decouvreur-de-brassens-et-de-brel_3787006_1819218.html | title=Jacques Canetti, Le découvreur de Brassens et de Brel | work=Le Monde | author=Patrick Labesse | date=1997-06-10 | accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a German-language writer, Canetti settled in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, Canetti lived mostly in [[Zürich]].

===Career===
A writer in German, Canetti won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1981, &quot;for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power&quot;. He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss [[Vienna]]: ''Die Gerettete Zunge'' (The Tongue Set Free); ''Die Fackel im Ohr'' (The Torch in My Ear), and ''Das Augenspiel'' (The Play of the Eyes); for his modernist novel ''[[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|Auto-da-Fé]]'' (''Die Blendung''); and for ''[[Crowds and Power]]'', a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations.

In the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years. He died in Zürich in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92556/Elias-Canetti ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' profile]&lt;/ref&gt;
