'''Electricity generation''' is the process of generating [[electric power]] from sources of [[primary energy]]. For [[electric utility|utilities]] in the [[electric power industry]], it is the stage prior to its [[Electricity delivery|delivery]] to end users ([[Electric power transmission|transmission]], [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], etc.) or its [[energy storage|storage]] (using, for example, the [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] method).

A characteristic of electricity is that it is not freely available in nature in large amounts, so it must be &quot;produced&quot; (that is, transforming other forms of energy to electricity). Production is carried out in [[power station]]s (also called &quot;power plants&quot;). Electricity is most often generated at a power plant by [[electromechanical]] [[electric generator|generators]], primarily driven by [[heat engine]]s fueled by [[combustion]] or [[nuclear fission]] but also by other means such as the [[kinetic energy]] of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar [[photovoltaics]] and [[geothermal power]].

== History ==
[[File:Electricity production in the World.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Electricity production in the World, 1980-2013]]
[[File:Edison Central Station Dynamos and Engine.jpg|thumb|Dynamos and engine installed at Edison General Electric Company, New York 1895]]
The fundamental principles of electricity generation were discovered in the 1820s and early 1830s by British scientist [[Michael Faraday]]. His method, still used today, is for electricity to be generated by the movement of a loop of wire, or [[Faraday disc]], between the poles of a [[magnet]]. Central power stations became economically practical with the development of [[alternating current]] (AC) power transmission, using power [[transformer]]s to transmit power at high voltage and with low loss.

Commercial electricity production started in 1870 with the coupling of the dynamo to the hydraulic turbine. The mechanical production of electric power began the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] and made possible several inventions using electricity, with the major contributors being [[Thomas Alva Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. Previously the only way to produce electricity was by chemical reactions or using battery cells, and the only practical use of electricity was for the [[telegraph]].

Electricity generation at central power stations started in 1882, when a [[steam engine]] driving a dynamo at [[Pearl Street Station]] produced a [[DC current]] that powered public lighting on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]], [[New York City|New York]]. The new technology was quickly adopted by many cities around the world, which adapted their gas-fueled street lights to electric power. Soon after electric lights would be used in public buildings, in businesses, and to power public transport, such as trams and trains.

The first power plants used water power or coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethw.org/Pearl_Street_Station|title=Pearl Street Station - Engineering and Technology History Wiki|website=ethw.org|access-date=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today a variety of energy sources are used, such as [[coal]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[natural gas]], [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]], [[Wind power|wind]], and [[Petroleum|oil]], as well as [[solar energy]], [[tidal power]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] sources.

== Methods of generation ==
{{Latest pie chart of world power by source}}

Several fundamental methods exist to convert other forms of energy into electrical energy. Utility-scale generation is achieved by rotating electric generators or by [[photovoltaic]] systems. A small proportion of electric power distributed by utilities is provided by batteries. Other forms of electricity generation used in niche applications include the [[triboelectric effect]], the [[piezoelectric effect]], the [[thermoelectric effect]], and [[betavoltaics]].

=== Generators ===
{{main|Electric generator}}
[[File:Turbine aalborg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Wind turbine]]s usually provide electrical generation in conjunction with other methods of producing power.]]
[[Electric generator]]s transform [[kinetic energy]] into electricity. This is the most used form for generating electricity and is based on [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]. It can be seen experimentally by rotating a magnet within closed loops of conducting material (e.g. copper wire). Almost all commercial electrical generation is done using electromagnetic induction, in which [[mechanical energy]] forces a generator to rotate:

=== Electrochemistry ===
[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Hoover Dam]] can provide large amounts of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power; it has 2.07 [[Watt#Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]]

[[Electrochemistry]] is the direct transformation of [[chemical energy]] into electricity, as in a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Electrochemical electricity generation is important in portable and mobile applications. Currently, most electrochemical power comes from batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/archive.cfm/pubDate=%7Bd%20'2003-09-24'%7D#6490 World's Largest Utility Battery System Installed in Alaska] (press release, 2003-09-24), U.S. Department of Energy. ''&quot;13,670 nickel-cadmium battery cells to generate up to 40 megawatts of power for about 7 minutes, or 27 megawatts of power for 15 minutes.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primary cell]]s, such as the common [[Zinc–carbon battery|zinc–carbon batteries]], act as power sources directly, but [[secondary cell]]s (i.e. rechargeable batteries) are used for [[electricity storage|storage]] systems rather than primary generation systems. Open electrochemical systems, known as [[fuel cell]]s, can be used to extract power either from natural fuels or from synthesized fuels. [[Osmotic power]] is a possibility at places where salt and fresh water merge.

=== Photovoltaic effect ===
The [[photovoltaic effect]] is the transformation of light into electrical energy, as in [[solar cell]]s. [[Photovoltaics|Photovoltaic panels]] convert sunlight directly to DC electricity. [[Power inverter|Power inverters]] can then convert that to AC electricity if needed. Although sunlight is free and abundant, [[solar power]] electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due to the cost of the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.gov/news/4503.htm ''New World Record Achieved in Solar Cell Technology''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423030653/http://www.doe.gov/news/4503.htm |date=2007-04-23 }} (press release, 2006-12-05), U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, United States, China, and India.

== Economics ==
{{see also|Cost of electricity by source|Electricity pricing}}
The selection of electricity production modes and their economic viability varies in accordance with demand and region. The economics vary considerably around the world, resulting in [[Electricity pricing#Global comparison|widespread residential selling prices]]&lt;!--sort table by price--&gt;, e.g. the price in Iceland is 5.54 cents per kWh while in some island nations it is 40 cents per kWh. [[Hydroelectric plant]]s, [[nuclear power plant]]s, [[thermal power plant]]s and [[renewable source]]s have their own pros and cons, and selection is based upon the local power requirement and the fluctuations in demand. All power grids have varying loads on them but the daily minimum is the base load, often supplied by plants which run continuously. Nuclear, coal, oil, gas and some hydro plants can supply base load. If well construction costs for natural gas are below $10 per MWh, generating electricity from natural gas is cheaper than generating power by burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2013/03/22/will-natural-gas-stay-cheap-enough-replace-coal-and-lower-us-carbon-emissions/ | work=Forbes | first=Karl | last=Smith| title= Will Natural Gas Stay Cheap Enough To Replace Coal And Lower Us Carbon Emissions| date= 22 March 2013| accessdate= 20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermal energy]] may be economical in areas of high industrial density, as the high demand cannot be met by local renewable sources. The effect of localized pollution is also minimized as industries are usually located away from residential areas. These plants can also withstand variation in load and consumption by adding more units or temporarily decreasing the production of some units.
Nuclear power plants can produce a huge amount of power from a single unit. However, [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|disasters in Japan]] have raised concerns over the safety of nuclear power, and the capital cost of nuclear plants is very high.
Hydroelectric power plants are located in areas where the potential energy from falling water can be harnessed for moving turbines and the generation of power. It may not be an economically viable single source of production where the ability to store the flow of water is limited and the load varies too much during the annual production cycle.

Due to advancements in technology, and with mass production, renewable sources other than hydroelectricity (solar power, wind energy, tidal power, etc.) experienced decreases in cost of production, and the energy is now in many cases cost-comparative with fossil fuels. Many governments around the world provide subsidies to offset the higher cost of any new power production, and to make the installation of renewable energy systems economically feasible. However, their use is frequently limited by their [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent nature]]; sometimes less than demand, sometimes more than transmission constraints allow, in which case their production may be curtailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Curtailment - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/curtailment |website=www.sciencedirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating equipment==
{{main|Electric generator}}
[[File:Stator winding at WPS.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A large generator with the rotor removed]]
Electric generators were known in simple forms from the discovery of [[electromagnetic induction]] in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary coils of wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Type testing a 2000 MW turbogenerator|first1=K.|last1=Sedlazeck|first2=C.|last2=Richter|first3=S.|last3=Strack|first4=S.|last4=Lindholm|first5=J.|last5=Pipkin|first6=F.|last6=Fu|first7=B.|last7=Humphries|first8=L.|last8=Montgomery|title=2009 IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference|date=May 1, 2009|pages=465–470|via=IEEE Xplore|doi=10.1109/IEMDC.2009.5075247|isbn=978-1-4244-4251-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only commercial scale electricity production that does not employ a generator is solar PV.

=== Turbines ===
[[File: Dreischluchtendamm hauptwall 2006.jpg|thumb|Large dams such as [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China can provide large amounts of [[hydroelectric]] power; it has a 22.5 [[Gigawatt|GW]] capability.]]
Almost all commercial electrical power on Earth is generated with a [[turbine]], driven by wind, water, steam or burning gas. The turbine drives a generator, thus transforming its mechanical energy into electrical energy by electromagnetic induction. There are many different methods of developing mechanical energy, including [[heat engine]]s, hydro, wind and tidal power. Most electric generation is driven by [[heat engine]]s. The combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s supplies most of the energy to these engines, with a significant fraction from [[nuclear fission]] and some from [[renewable source]]s. The modern [[steam turbine]] (invented by [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] in 1884) currently generates about 80% of the [[electric power]] in the world using a variety of heat sources. Turbine types include:
* Steam 
** Water is boiled by [[coal]] burned in a [[thermal power plant]]. About 41% of all electricity is generated this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/coal-electricity|title=Coal &amp; electricity|website=World Coal Association|access-date=2016-08-14|date=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Nuclear fission]] heat created in a [[nuclear reactor]] creates steam. Less than 15% of electricity is generated this way.
** Renewable energy. The steam is generated by [[biomass]], [[solar thermal energy]], or [[geothermal power]].
* Natural gas: turbines are driven directly by gases produced by combustion. [[Combined cycle]] are driven by both steam and natural gas. They generate power by burning natural gas in a [[gas turbine]] and use residual heat to generate steam. At least 20% of the world's electricity is generated by natural gas.
*Water Energy is captured by a [[water turbine]] from the movement of water - from falling water, the rise and fall of tides or ocean thermal currents (see [[ocean thermal energy conversion]]). Currently, hydroelectric plants provide approximately 16% of the world's electricity.
*The [[windmill]] was a very early [[wind turbine]]. In a [[solar updraft tower]] wind is artificially produced. Before 2010 less than 2% of the world's electricity was produced from wind.
Although turbines are most common in commercial power generation, smaller generators can be powered by [[gasoline]] or [[diesel engine]]s. These may used for backup generation or as a prime source of power within isolated villages.

Variations between countries generating electrical power affect concerns about the environment. In France only 10% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels, the US is higher at 70% and China is at 80%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics and Balances&quot;/&gt;  The cleanliness of electricity depends on its source. Most scientists agree that emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based electricity generation account for a significant portion of world greenhouse gas emissions; in the United States, electricity generation accounts for nearly 40% of emissions, the largest of any source. Transportation emissions are close behind, contributing about one-third of U.S. production of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003732690_carbon03.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Carbon-emissions culprit?

In the United States, fossil fuel combustion for electric power generation is responsible for 65% of all emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]], the main component of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sulfur Dioxide|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/sulfurdioxide/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity generation is the fourth highest combined source of [[NOx]], [[carbon monoxide]], and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AirData|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://www.epa.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_service=airdata&amp;_program=progs.webprogs.emcatbar.scl&amp;_debug=2&amp;geotype=us&amp;geocode=USA&amp;geoname=United+States&amp;epol=CO+NOX+VOC+SO2+PM25+PM10&amp;years=2002&amp;mapsize=zsc&amp;reqtype=viewmap}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2011, the UK parliament tabled a motion that &quot;levels of (carbon) emissions from nuclear power were approximately three times lower per [[kilowatt hour]] than those of solar, four times lower than clean coal and 36 times lower than conventional coal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2061|title=Early day motion 2061|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
