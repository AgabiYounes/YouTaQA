'''Ajax''' ({{lang-grc|Αἴας}} ''Aias'') was a [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] [[Greek hero cult|hero]], son of [[Oileus]], the king of [[Locris]].  He was called the &quot;lesser&quot; or &quot;Locrian&quot; Ajax,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0134%3Abook%3D2%3Acard%3D511  ii. 527]&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish him from [[Ajax the Great]], son of [[Telamon]]. He was the leader of the [[Locrians|Locrian]] contingent during the [[Trojan War]].  He is a significant figure in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and is also mentioned in the ''[[Odyssey]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{Citation  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard | contribution = Ajax (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 87–88  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0096.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in  [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Trojan Women]]''. In [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan legend]], he was known as ''Aivas Vilates''.

==Life==
Ajax's mother's name was [[Eriopis]].  According to [[Strabo]], he was born in [[Naryx]] in [[Locris]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ix. p. 425&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Ovid]] calls him ''Narycius heros''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiv. 468&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''Iliad'',&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' ii. 527, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt; he led his [[Locrians]] in forty ships against [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 97 gives the number of ships as twenty&lt;/ref&gt;  He is described as one of the great heroes among the Greeks. In battle, he wore a [[linen]] [[cuirass]] ({{lang|grc|λινοθώραξ}}), was brave and intrepid, especially skilled in throwing the spear and, next to [[Achilles]], the swiftest of all the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' xiv. 520, &amp;c., xxiii. 789, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In the funeral games at the [[pyre]] of [[Patroclus]], Ajax contended with [[Odysseus]] and [[Antilochus]] for the prize in the footrace; but [[Athena]], who was hostile towards him and favored Odysseus, made him stumble and fall, so that he won only the second prize.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Iliad'' (xxiii. 754), &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later traditions, this Ajax is called a son of Oileus and the [[nymph]] Rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Gaius Julius Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 81, 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 10. § 8&lt;/ref&gt; After the taking of Troy, he rushed into the temple of Athena, where [[Cassandra]] had taken refuge, and was embracing the statue of the goddess in [[supplication]]. Ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' ii. 403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]], ''Troad.'' 70, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dict. Cret.'' v. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Gaius Julius Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 116&lt;/ref&gt;  According to some writers, he raped Cassandra inside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tryphiodorus]], 635&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], xiii. 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lycophron]], 360, with the [[Scholion]]&lt;/ref&gt; Odysseus called for Ajax's death by stoning for this crime, but Ajax saved himself by claiming innocence with an oath to Athena, clutching her statue in supplication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' x. 26. § 1, 31. § 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Since Ajax dragged a supplicant from her temple, Athena had cause to be indignant. According to the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until [[Calchas]], the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide at the altar of a deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices, Athena became so angry that she persuaded [[Zeus]] to send a storm that sank many of their ships.

As he was [[Returns from Troy|returning from Troy]], Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt and the vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks ({{lang|grc|Γυραὶ πέτραι}}). But he escaped with some of his men, managing to cling onto a rock through the assistance of [[Poseidon]]. He would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. Offended by this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his [[trident]] and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv. 499, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Thetis]] buried him when the corpse washed up on Myconos.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodore, R. Scott Smith, Stephen Trzaskoma, and Hygin. ''Apollodorus' Library and Hyginus' Fabulae: Two Handbooks of Greek Mythology'', Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2007. 84–85. &quot;5.24–6.6.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions depict a different death for Ajax, showing him dying when on his voyage home. In these versions, when Ajax came to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of [[Euboea]], his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Virgil, ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 40, &amp;c., xi. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ajax's death, his spirit dwelt in the island of [[Leuce (island)|Leuce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;paus319&quot;&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias3B.html Description of Greece]'' iii. 19. § 13&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Opuntian Locris|Opuntian]] Locrians worshiped Ajax as their national hero, and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle, they always left one place open for him, believing that, although invisible to them, he was fighting for and among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;paus319&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] ''Narrations'' 18&lt;/ref&gt;  The story of Ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists, and the hero who appears on some Locrian coins with the helmet, shield, and sword is probably this Ajax.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Edme Mionnet, No. 570, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accounts of Ajax's death are offered by [[Philostratus III|Philostratus]] and the [[scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]], ''Her.'' viii. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] on [[Lycophron]] ''l. c.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The abduction of Cassandra by Ajax was frequently represented in [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek]] works of art, such as the chest of [[Cypselus]] described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and in extant works.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' v. 17&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
