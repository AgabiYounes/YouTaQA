'''Albert II'''  ({{lang-de|Albrecht}}; 28 March 1522{{snd}}8 January 1557) was the [[Margrave]] of [[Principality of Bayreuth|Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] (Brandenburg-Bayreuth) from 1527 to 1553. He was a member of the [[Franconia]]n branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Because of his bellicose nature,{{says who|date=February 2020}} Albert was given the cognomen ''Bellator'' (&quot;the Warlike&quot;) during his lifetime. Posthumously, he became known as ''[[Alcibiades]]''.

==Biography==
Albert was born in [[Ansbach]] and, losing his father [[Casimir, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Casimir]] in 1527, he came under the guardianship of his uncle [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], a strong adherent of [[Protestantism]].
In 1541, he received [[Bayreuth]] as his share of the family lands, but as the chief town of his principality was [[Kulmbach]], he is sometimes referred to as the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.
His restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected a small band of soldiers, he assisted Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in his [[Italian War of 1542–1546|war with France]] in 1543.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The [[Peace of Crépy]] in September 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he won a considerable reputation, and when Charles was preparing to attack the [[Schmalkaldic League]], he took pains to win Albert's assistance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Sharing in the attack on the [[Electorate of Saxony]], Albert was taken prisoner at [[Rochlitz]] in March 1547 by Elector [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony|John Frederick]] of Saxony, but was released as a result of the Emperor's victory at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] in the succeeding April.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He then followed the fortunes of his friend Elector [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice]] of Saxony, deserted Charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the Emperor by an alliance with King [[Henry II of France]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the [[Peace of Passau]] was signed in August 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in [[Franconia]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} which led to the [[Second Margrave War]].

Having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of [[Nuremberg]], he quarrelled with his supporter, the French King, and offered his services to the Emperor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to Albert's demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of [[Bishopric of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[Bishopric of Bamberg|Bamberg]]; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the Emperor on the retreat from the [[Siege of Metz (1552)|Siege of Metz]] in January 1553.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

When Charles left Germany a few weeks later, Albert renewed his depredations in Franconia.  These soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and Maurice of Saxony led an army against his former comrade.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
The rival forces met at [[Battle of Sievershausen|Sievershausen]] on 9 July 1553, and after a combat of unusual ferocity Albert was put to flight. [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]], then took command of the troops of the league, and after Albert had been placed under the imperial ban in December 1553 he was defeated by Duke Henry, and compelled to flee to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
He there entered the service of Henry II of France and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at [[Pforzheim]] on 8 January 1557.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 

He is defined by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as &quot;a failure of a [[Fritz]],&quot; with &quot;features&quot; of a [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] in him, &quot;but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an Alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent&quot;. He had early two children: [[Friedrich of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Frederick]] and [[Anna of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Anna]]. He was to be buried Heilsbronn Münster. His hymn &quot;Was mein Got will, das g'scheh allzeit&quot; was translated as &quot;The will of God is always best&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;it is #477 in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary]]'', #758 in ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'', and #435 in ''[[Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal]]'', see also the [https://hymnary.org/text/my_heart_is_longing_to_praise_my_savior entry for the hymn on hymnary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
