'''''Amaranthus''''', collectively known as '''amaranth''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Amaranthaceae {{!}} plant family |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18481/Amaranthaceae#ref230955 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2015-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[genus]] of [[annual plant|annual]] or short-lived [[perennial plant]]s. Some amaranth species are cultivated as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[pseudocereal]]s, and [[ornamental plant]]s. Most of the ''Amaranthus'' species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as [[pigweed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bensch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bensch |display-authors=etal |year=2003 |title=Interference of redroot pigweed (''Amaranthus retroflexus''), Palmer amaranth (''A. palmeri''), and common waterhemp (''A. rudis'') in soybean |journal=Weed Science |volume=51 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.1614/0043-1745(2003)051[0037:IORPAR]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catkin]]-like [[cyme (botany)|cymes]] of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=RHS A–Z encyclopedia of garden plants |year=2008 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |isbn=978-1405332965 |pages=1136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amaranth varies in flower, leaf, and stem color with a range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from 3 to 8 feet tall with a cylindrical, succulent, fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt; 

There are approximately 75 species in the genus, 10 of which are [[Carex sterilis|dioecious]] and native to North America with the remaining 65 [[Plant reproductive morphology|monoecious]] species endemic to every continent from tropical lowlands to the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steckel|first=Lawrence E.|date=April 2007 |title=The Dioecious ''Amaranthus'' spp.: Here to Stay |journal=Weed Technology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=567–570|doi=10.1614/WT-06-045.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''[[Celosia]]''.  

== Etymology and culture ==
&quot;Amaranth&quot; derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀμάραντος}}&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)ma/rantos|ἀμάραντος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|grc-Latn|amárantos}}), &quot;unfading&quot;, with the Greek word for &quot;flower&quot;, {{lang|grc|ἄνθος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|ánthos}}), factoring into the word's development as ''amaranth, the unfading flower''. ''Amarant'' is an archaic variant. The showy Amaranth present in [[John Milton]]'s [[garden of Eden]] is &quot;remov'd from Heav'n&quot; when it blossoms because the flowers &quot;shade the fountain of life&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Paradise lost|last=Milton |first=John |date=2000|publisher=Penguin Books|oclc=647024119}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He describes Amaranth as 'immortal' in reference to the flowers that generally do not whither and retain bright reddish tones of color, even when deceased as sometimes referred to as &quot;love-[[Amaranthus caudatus|lies]]-bleeding.&quot;

Amaranth has a primary root with deeper spreading secondary fibrous root structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrequez etal&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arreguez |first=Guillermo A. |last2=Martínez |first2=Jorge G. |last3=Ponessa |first3=Graciela |date=September 2013 |title=''Amaranthus hybridus'' L. ssp.

== Taxonomy ==

''Amaranthus'' shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species.  Amaranthus is part of the Amaranthaceae that is part of the larger grouping of the Carophyllales.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt; Although the family ([[Amaranthaceae]]) is distinctive, the [[genus]] has few distinguishing characters among the 75 species present across all seven continents.&lt;ref name=stetter1/&gt; This complicates [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and ''Amaranthus'' has generally been considered among systematists as a &quot;difficult&quot; genus and hybridize often.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costea&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Costea | first=Mihai | last2=DeMason | first2=Darleen A. | title=Stem Morphology and Anatomy in ''Amaranthus'' L. (Amaranthaceae), Taxonomic Significance | journal=Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society | volume=128 | issue=3 | year=2001 | issn=1095-5674 | doi=10.2307/3088717 | page=254| jstor=3088717 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2086d4ca95883e301ada62e0f5ef160665aeb8b1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Sauer classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|monoecious]] and [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|dioecious]] species: ''Acnida'' (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and ''Amaranthus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costea&quot; /&gt; Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group. Mosyakin and Robertson 1996 later divided into three subgenera: Acnida, Amaranthus, and Albersia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosyakin|first=Sergei L.|last2=Clemants|first2=Steven E.|date=1996|title=New Infrageneric Taxa and Combinations in Chenopodium L.

The classification of these groups are further supported with a combination of  floral characters, reproductive strategies, geographic distribution, and molecular evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;stetter1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Analysis of phylogenetic relationships and genome size evolution of the Amaranthus genus using GBS indicates the ancestors of an ancient crop|last=Stetter|first=Markus G.|last2=Schmid|first2=Karl J|date=2016-11-03|doi = 10.1101/085472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wasel&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waselkov|first=Katherine E.|last2=Boleda|first2=Alexis S.|last3=Olsen|first3=Kenneth M.|date=2018-06-21|title=A Phylogeny of the Genus Amaranthus (Amaranthaceae) Based on Several Low-Copy Nuclear Loci and Chloroplast Regions|journal=Systematic Botany|volume=43|issue=2|pages=439–458|doi=10.1600/036364418x697193|issn=0363-6445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clouse|first=J.

The phylogenies of Amaranthus of [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|maximum parsimony]] and [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] analysis of [[Nuclear gene|nuclear]] and [[chloroplast]] [[Gene|genes]] suggest five [[Clade|clades]] within the [[genus]]: Diecious / Pumilus, Hybris, Galapagos, Eurasian/ South African, Australian (ESA), ESA + South American.&lt;ref name=wasel/&gt;

''Amaranthus'' includes three recognised subgenera and 75 species, although species numbers are questionable due to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] and species concepts.&lt;ref name=schmid/&gt; Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification.&lt;ref name=stetter1/&gt; Bracteole morphology present on the stem is used for taxonomic classification of Amaranth. Wild species have longer [[Bract|bracteole's]] compared to cultivated species.&lt;ref name = &quot;Costea&quot; /&gt; A modified infrageneric classification of ''Amaranthus'' includes three subgenera: ''[[Amaranthus tuberculatus|Acnida]]'', ''Amaranthus'', and ''Albersia'', with the taxonomy further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Sergei L. Mosyakin, Kenneth R. Robertson |year=1996 |title=New infrageneric taxa and combinations in ''Amaranthus'' (Amaranthaceae) |journal=Ann. Bot.

There is near certainty that ''A. hypochondriacus'' is the common ancestor to the cultivated grain species, however the later series of domestication to follow remains unclear. There has been opposing hypotheses of a single as opposed to multiple domestication events of the three grain species.&lt;ref name=stetter1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;joshi&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Dinesh C.|last2=Sood|first2=Salej|last3=Hosahatti|first3=Rajashekara|last4=Kant|first4=Lakshmi|last5=Pattanayak|first5=A.|last6=Kumar|first6=Anil|last7=Yadav|first7=Dinesh|last8=Stetter|first8=Markus G.|date=2018-07-10|title=From zero to hero: the past, present and future of grain amaranth breeding|journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics|volume=131|issue=9|pages=1807–1823|doi=10.1007/s00122-018-3138-y|pmid=29992369|issn=0040-5752}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of phylogenetic and geographical support for clear groupings that indicate separate domestication events in South America and Central America.&lt;ref name=stetter1/&gt; ''A. hybridus'' may derive from South America, whereas ''A. quentiensis'', ''A. caudatus'', and ''A. hypochondriacus'' are native to Central and North America.&lt;ref name=stetter1/&gt;&lt;ref name=joshi/&gt;

The genus is native to Mexico and Central America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 1986&quot; /&gt; Known to the [[Aztecs]] as {{lang|nci|huāuhtli}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coe, S.D.|year=1994|title=America's First Cuisines|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292711594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guKnUdrLhtYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; amaranth is thought to have represented up to 80% of their energy consumption before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]]. Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegría}}, meaning &quot;joy&quot; in Spanish. [[Diego Durán]] described the festivities for the Aztec god {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}} (whose name means &quot;left side of the hummingbird&quot;; hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}.  People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

Amaranth is native to the New World and has been first found in the Old World as part of an archaeological excavation in Narhan, India, dated to 1000-800 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saraswat |first1=K.S. |last2=Sharma |first2=N.K. |last3=Saini |first3=D.C. |title=Plant Economy at Ancient Narhan (ca. 1300 B.C.-300/400 A.D.) in Excavations at Narhan (1984-1989), Appendix IV |date=1994 |publisher=Department of Ancient Indian History, Cultre and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University |location=Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India |pages=225–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2020}}

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America.  Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are [[pseudocereal]]s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.

Several species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|&quot;grain&quot;]] in Asia and the Americas. The spread of Amaranthus is of a joint effort of human expansion, adaptation, and fertilization strategies. Seeds of Amaranth grain have been found in archeological records in Northern Argentina that date to the mid-Holocene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrequez etal&quot; /&gt; Archeological evidence of seeds from ''A. hypochondriacus'' and ''A. crutenus'' found in a cave in Tehuacan, Mexico suggests Amaranth was part of Aztec civilization in the 1400s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brenner|first=D.

Ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species, ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costea06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Costea | first=M. | last2=Brenner | first2=D.

It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:

* A small amount of seed plants a large area (seeding rate 1 kg/ha).
* Yields are high compared to the seeding rate: 1000 kg or more per hectare.
* It is easily harvested and easily processed, post harvest, as there are no hulls to remove.
* Its seeds are a source of protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 1986&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=mpoll&gt;De Macvean &amp; Pöll (1997). Chapter 8: Ethnobotany. Tropical Tree Seed Manual, USDA Forest Service, edt. J.A Vozzo.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has rich content of the [[dietary mineral]]s, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium.&lt;ref name=usdamrth/&gt;
* In cooked and edible forms, amaranth retains adequate content of several [[dietary minerals]].&lt;ref name=usdamrth&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA National Nutrient Database: cooked amaranth grain per 100 grams; Full report |url=https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170683/nutrients|date=2014|accessdate=7 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is easy to cook. Boil in water with twice the amount of water as grain by volume (or 2.4 times as much water by weight).
* It grows fast and, in three cultivated species, the large seedheads can weigh up to 1&amp;nbsp;kg and contain a half-million small seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker 1986&quot; /&gt;

In the United States, amaranth crop is mostly used for seed production. Most amaranth in American food products starts as a ground flour, blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals, crackers, cookies, bread or other baked products. Despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended with other flours at levels above 50% without affecting functional properties or taste, most commercial products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as &quot;amaranth&quot; products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.extension.iastate.edu/alternativeag/cropproduction/amaranth.html |title=Amaranth: Alternative Agriculture |last=Delate |first=Kathleen |publisher=Iowa State University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--original research === Seed flour ===

Amaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52–74% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world. Four species of ''Amaranthus'' are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus blitum]], [[Amaranthus dubius]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea (2003). Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called {{lang|id|bayam}}. In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili peppers to make a dish called ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red chili pepper, and cumin. It is  called ''keerai masial''.  In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.

In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau dền}} and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: {{lang|vi|dền đỏ}} (''Amaranthus tricolor'') and {{lang|vi|dền cơm}} or {{lang|vi|dền trắng}} (''Amaranthus viridis'').

A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= 10.17226/11763|id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&amp;page=35 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as ''doodo'' or ''litoto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author=Goode, P. M. | title=Edible plants of Uganda | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  | year=1989| isbn= 9789251027134|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known among the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] as a [[drought]] crop (''chepkerta''). In [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (spoken in the Congo), it is known as {{lang|ln|lɛngalɛnga}} or {{lang|ln|bítɛkutɛku}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enama, M. |year=1994 |title=Culture: The missing nexus in ecological economics perspective |journal=Ecological Economics |issue=2 |pages=93–95 |doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)00010-7 |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nigeria, it is a common vegetable and goes with all Nigerian starch dishes. It is known in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as {{lang|yo|shoko}} a short form of {{lang|yo|shokoyokoto}} (meaning &quot;make the husband fat&quot;) or {{lang|yo|arowo jeja}} (meaning &quot;we have money left over for fish&quot;). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called ''bhaji'' in Trinidad and ''callaloo'' in Jamaica, and are sautéed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup. In Botswana, it is referred to as ''morug'' and cooked as a staple green vegetable.

In Greece, green amaranth (''A. viridis'') is a popular dish called {{lang|el|βλήτα}}, {{lang|el-Latn|vlita}} or {{lang|el-Latn|vleeta}}. It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.

In Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, often considered an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported ''A. caudatus'' cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of {{lang|pt|caruru}} or {{lang|pt|bredo}}, which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, [[rice and beans]].

===Oil===
Making up about 5% of the total [[fatty acid]]s of amaranth, [[squalene]]&lt;ref name=&quot;HeCai2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=Han-Ping|last2=Cai|first2=Yizhong|last3=Sun|first3=Mei|last4=Corke|first4=Harold|title=Extraction and Purification of Squalene from Amaranthus Grain|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|issue=2|year=2002|pages=368–372|issn=0021-8561|doi=10.1021/jf010918p}}&lt;/ref&gt; is extracted as a vegetable-based alternative to the more expensive [[shark oil]] for use in [[dietary supplements]] and [[cosmetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/squalene-market-size-to-exceed-usd-240-million-by-2022-global-market-insights-inc-577232031.html |title=Squalene Market Size to Exceed USD 240 Million by 2022|publisher= Global Market Insights Inc. |date=27 April 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dyes ===

The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].  Also a synthetic dye was named &quot;[[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]]&quot; for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth [[pigment]]s known as [[betalain]]s. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North America and E123 in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The following color additives are not authorized for use in food products in the United States: (1) Amaranth (C.I. 16185, EEC No. E123, formerly certifiable as FD&amp;C red No. 2);&quot; [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html FDA/CFSAN Food Compliance Program: Domestic Food Safety Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110929/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamentals ===
[[File:Amaranthus flowers.jpg|thumb|''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather) flowering]]
The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''Amaranthus caudatus'' (love-lies-bleeding), a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including the [[Nutmeg (moth)|nutmeg moth]] and various case-bearer moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'', and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').

== Ecology ==

Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production,&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel et al. (1999). Use of PCR-based molecular markers to identify weedy Amaranthus species. Weed Science 47: 518-523.&lt;/ref&gt; The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: [[Amaranthus albus|''A. albus'']], [[Amaranthus blitoides|''A. blitoides'']], [[Amaranthus hybridus|''A. hybridus'']], [[Amaranthus palmeri|''A. palmeri'']], [[Amaranthus powellii|''A. powellii'']], [[Amaranthus retroflexus|''A. retroflexus'']], [[Amaranthus spinosus|''A. spinosus'']], [[Amaranthus tuberculatus|''A. tuberculatus'']], and [[Amaranthus viridis|''A. viridis'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AMARA USDA Plant Database. Plants Profile- ''Amaranthus'' L]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Assad, R., Reshi, Z. A., Jan, S., &amp; Rashid, I. (2017). &quot;Biology of amaranths&quot;. The Botanical Review, 83(4), 382-436.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new herbicide-resistant strain of ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'' has appeared; it is [[glyphosate]]-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [[soybean]] yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; Palmer amaranth is among the &quot;top five most troublesome weeds&quot; in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to [[dinitroaniline]] herbicides and [[acetolactate synthase inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Culpepper et al. (2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (''Amaranthus palmeri'') confirmed in Georgia. Weed Science 54: 620-626.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

An evolutionary lineage of around 90 species within the genus has acquired the [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]] pathway, which increases their photosynthetic efficiency. This probably occurred in the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sage2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sage |first=R.F. |year=2016 |title=A portrait of the {{C4}} photosynthetic family on the 50th anniversary of its discovery: species number, evolutionary lineages, and Hall of Fame |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=67 |issue=14 |pages=4039–4056 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erw156 |issn=0022-0957 |pmid=27053721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SageSage2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sage |first1=R.F. |last2=Sage |first2=T.L. |last3=Pearcy |first3=R.W. |last4=Borsch |first4=T. |title=The taxonomic distribution of {{C4}} photosynthesis in Amaranthaceae sensu stricto|journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=94 |issue=12 |year=2007 |pages=1992–2003 |issn=0002-9122 |doi=10.3732/ajb.94.12.1992|pmid=21636394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
