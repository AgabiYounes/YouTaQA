An '''acropolis''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἀκρόπολις, ''akropolis''; from ''akros'' (άκρος) or ''akron'' (άκρον), &quot;highest, topmost, outermost&quot; and ''polis'' (πόλις), &quot;city&quot;; plural in English: ''acropoles'', ''acropoleis'' or ''acropolises'')&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|acropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)kro/polis|acropolis}}, {{LSJ|a)/kros|akros}},  {{LSJ|a)/kron|akron|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was in [[ancient Greece]] a [[Human settlement|settlement]], especially a [[citadel]], built upon an area of elevated ground—frequently a hill with [[precipice|precipitous]] sides, chosen for purposes of defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/acropolis|title=acropolis – Definition of acropolis in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries – English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acropolis also had a function of a religious sanctuary with sacred springs highlighting its religious significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acropolis became the nuclei of large cities of [[classical antiquity]], such as [[ancient Athens]], and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts, such as modern [[Athens]]. One well-known acropolis is the [[Acropolis of Athens]], located on a rocky outcrop above the city of [[Athens]] and containing the [[Parthenon]]. 

== Use in antiquity ==
[[File:Via Tecta acropolis Pergamum 487 detail.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|View of the Acropolis of [[Pergamon]] in the background, as seen from Via Tecta at the entrance to the [[Asclepeion]].]]

The word ''acropolis'' literally means in [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;upper city,&quot; and though associated primarily with the [[Greece|Greek]] cities [[Athens]], [[Argos]] (with [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]]), [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] (with [[Cadmea]]), and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] (with its [[Acrocorinth]]), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, [[Jerusalem]], Celtic [[Bratislava]], many in [[Asia Minor]], or even [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]] in [[Edinburgh]]. An example in Ireland is the [[Rock of Cashel]]. Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban [[Castro culture]] settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops.

The most famous example is the [[Acropolis of Athens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404/|title=Acropolis, Athens|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the [[Parthenon]]), is known without qualification as ''the Acropolis''. Acropolis of Athens achieved its form in the fifth century BC and is currently an archeological site.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Although originating in the mainland of Greece, use of the acropolis model quickly spread to Greek colonies such as the [[Dorians|Dorian]] [[Lato]] on [[Crete]] during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]].

== Metaphorical use in modern times ==
Because of its classical [[Hellenistic]] style, the ruins of [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|Mission San Juan Capistrano's]] Great Stone Church in [[California|California, United States]] has been called the &quot;American Acropolis&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Erik|title=The visionary state : a journey through California's spiritual landscape|date=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0811848353|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the world developed other names for the high citadel or [[alcázar]], which often reinforced a naturally strong site. In Central [[Italy]], many small rural [[comune|communes]] still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as ''La Rocca'' of the commune.

The term ''acropolis'' is also used to describe the central complex of overlapping structures, such as plazas and pyramids, in many [[Maya city|Maya cities]], including [[Tikal]] and [[Copán]].
