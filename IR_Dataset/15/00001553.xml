'''Agnes Maria of Andechs-Merania''' (died 1201) was a Queen of [[France]]. She is called Marie by some of the French chroniclers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=378}}

==Biography==
Agnes Maria was the daughter of [[Berthold, Duke of Merania]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=378}} who was Count of [[Andechs]], a castle and territory near [[Ammersee]], [[Bavaria]]. Her mother was [[Agnes of Rochlitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Jiri Louda et Michael MacLagan, ''Les Dynasties d'Europe'', Bordas, 1995. ({{ISBN|2-04-027115-5}}); see also in French, Agnès de Wettin: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnès_de_Wettin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1196 Agnes married [[Philip II of France]], who had repudiated his second wife [[Ingeborg of Denmark, Queen of France|Ingeborg of Denmark]] in 1193. [[Pope Innocent III]] espoused the cause of Ingeborg; but Philip did not submit until 1200, when, nine months after [[interdict]] had been added to [[excommunication]], he consented to a separation from Agnes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=378}}

Agnes died broken-hearted in July of the next year, at the castle of [[Poissy]], and was buried in the [[Convent of St Corentin]], near [[Nantes]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=378}}

==Family==
Agnes and Philip had two children: [[Philip I, Count of Boulogne]] and [[Marie of France, Duchess of Brabant|Mary]], 
who were legitimized by the Pope in 1201 at the request of the King.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Baldwin, ''Paris 1200'', Stanford University Press, 2010. {{ISBN|9780804772075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the personality of Agnes, beyond the remarkable influence which she seems to have exercised over Philip.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=378}}

==Artistic representation==
She has been made the heroine of a [[tragedy]] by [[François Ponsard]], ''Agnès de Méranie'',{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=378}} and of an [[opera]] by [[Vincenzo Bellini]], ''[[La straniera]]''.
