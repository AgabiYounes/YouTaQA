'''Alexander II''' ([[Middle Irish|Mediaeval Gaelic]]: ''{{lang|mga|Alaxandair mac Uilliam}}''; [[Scottish Gaelic|Modern Gaelic]]: ''{{lang|gd|Alasdair mac Uilleim}}''; 24 August 1198{{snd}}6 July 1249) was [[King of Scotland]] from 1214 until his death. He concluded the [[Treaty of York]] (1237) which defined the boundary between England and Scotland, virtually unchanged today.

==Early life==

He was born at [[Haddington, East Lothian]], the only son of the Scottish king [[William the Lion]] and [[Ermengarde of Beaumont]]. He spent time in England ([[John of England]] knighted him at [[Clerkenwell Priory]] in 1213) before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on 4 December 1214, being crowned at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 6 December the same year.

==King of Scots==

In 1215, the year after his accession, the clans [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]], inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection. In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against [[John of England]], and led an army into the [[Kingdom of England]] in support of their cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Alexander II. (king of Scotland)|display=Alexander II.|volume=1|page=563}}&lt;/ref&gt; This action led to the sacking of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] as John's forces ravaged the north.

The Scottish forces reached the south coast of England at the port of [[Dover]] where in September 1216, Alexander paid homage to the pretender [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]] for his lands in England, chosen by the barons to replace King John. But [[John of England|King John]] having died, the Pope and the English aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine-year-old son, [[Henry III of England|Henry]], forcing the French and the Scots armies to return home.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_ii/ &quot;Alexander II, King of Scots 1214 – 1249&quot;, Scotland's History, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peace between Henry III, Louis of France, and Alexander followed on 12 September 1217 with the [[Treaty of Lambeth|Treaty of Kingston]]. Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henry's sister [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Scotland|Joan of England]] on 18 June or 25 June 1221.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1222 [[Jon Haraldsson]], the last native Scandinavian to be [[Earl of Orkney#Norse Earls|Jarl of Orkney]], was indirectly implicated in the burning of [[Adam of Melrose|Bishop Adam]] at his hall at [[Halkirk]] by local farmers when this part of [[Caithness]] was still part of the [[Scandinavian Scotland#Caithness and Sutherland|Kingdom of Norway]]. A contemporary chronicler, [[Boetius of Dacia|Boethius the Dane]] blamed Haraldsson for the bishop's death. After the Jarl swore oaths to his own innocence, Alexander took the opportunity to assert his claims to the mainland part of the Orkney jarldom. He visited Caithness in person, and hanged the majority of the farmers while mutilating the rest. His actions were applauded by [[Pope Honorius III]], and a quarter of a century later, he was continuing to receive commendation from the [[Catholic Church|Vatican]], as in the reward of a [[Papal bull|bull]] from [[Pope Celestine IV|Celestine IV]].

During the same period, Alexander subjugated the hitherto semi-independent district of [[Argyll]] (much smaller than the modern area by that name, it only comprised [[Craignish]], [[Ardscotnish]], [[River Add|Glassary]], [[River Aray|Glenary]], and [[Cowal]]; [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorn]] was a separate province, while [[Kintyre]] and [[Knapdale]] were part of [[Scandinavian Scotland#|Suðreyar]]). Royal forces crushed a revolt in [[Galloway]] in 1235 without difficulty;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success. Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties. The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; This was the Treaty of York, which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth (in the west) and the mouth of the River Tweed (in the east).

Alexander's first wife [[Joan of England, Queen of Scotland|Joan of England]] died in March 1238 in Essex, and was buried in Dorset.  Alexander married his second wife, [[Marie de Coucy]], the following year on 15 May 1239.  Together they had one son, the future [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], born in 1241.

A threat of invasion by Henry in 1243 for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to [[Treaty of Newcastle (1244)|make peace]] next year at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].

Alexander now turned his attention to securing the [[Western Isles]], which were still part of the Norwegian domain of [[Scandinavian Scotland#Geography|Suðreyjar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; He repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;  Alexander set out to conquer these islands but died on the way in 1249.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scotland A Concise History, Fourth Edition|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-500-28987-7|location=New York|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dispute over the Western Isles, also known as the [[Hebrides]], was not resolved until 1266 when [[Magnus VI of Norway]] ceded them to Scotland along with the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-III-king-of-Scotland|title=Alexander III King of Scotland|date=November 28, 2017|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' described Alexander as red-haired:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[King John] taunted King Alexander, and because he was red-headed, sent word to him, saying, 'so shall we hunt the red fox-cub from his lairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Scottish annals from English chroniclers A.D.500 to 1286'', Alan Orr Anderson, Paul Watkins, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==

Alexander attempted to persuade [[Ewen MacDougall|Ewen]], the son of Duncan, Lord of [[Argyll]], to sever his allegiance to [[Haakon IV of Norway]]. When Ewen rejected these attempts, Alexander sailed forth to compel him, but on the way he suffered a fever at the Isle of [[Kerrera]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; He died there in 1249 and was buried at [[Melrose Abbey]].

He was succeeded by his son, the seven-year-old [[Alexander III of Scotland]].

==Family==
Alexander II had two wives:

1. '''[[Joan of England, Queen Consort of Scotland|Joan of England]]''', (22 July 1210{{snd}}4 March 1238), was the eldest legitimate daughter and third child of [[John of England]] and [[Isabella of Angoulême]]. She and Alexander II married on 21 June 1221, at [[York Minster]]. Alexander was 23. Joan was 11. They had no children. Joan was Alexander's 3rd cousin, their closest common ancestor being [[Henry I of England]]. Joan died in [[Essex]] in 1238, and was buried at [[Tarant Crawford Abbey]] in [[Dorset]].

2. '''[[Marie de Coucy]]''', who became mother of [[Alexander III of Scotland]]. She was Alexander's third cousin once removed by their common ancestor [[Hugh, Count of Vermandois]].

He also had an illegitimate daughter Marjorie, who married [[Alan Durward]].

==Fictional portrayals==

Alexander II has been depicted in historical novels:

* ''Sword of State'' (1999) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. The novel depicts the friendship between Alexander II and [[Patrick II, Earl of Dunbar]]. &quot;Their friendship withstands treachery, danger and rivalry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cunninghamh.tripod.com/books/9105.htm &quot;Tranter First Edition Books, Publication Timeline&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Child of the Phoenix'' (1992) by [[Barbara Erskine]].
The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio. Day the Second: Third Story.
