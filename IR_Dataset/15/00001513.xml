Cardinal '''Albert of Brandenburg''' ({{lang-de|Albrecht von Brandenburg}}; 28 June 1490{{snd}}24 September 1545) was [[Prince-elector|Elector]] and [[Archbishop of Mainz]] from 1514 to 1545, and [[Archbishop of Magdeburg]] from 1513 to 1545.

His involvement in the sale of indulgences to fund his debt was to prompt Martin Luther, a friar, to complain about the abuse. His subsequent failure to meet with and take seriously the complaints from Luther, his failure to inform Rome of the seriousness of the situation and finally Rome's refusal to act properly faced with the situation, forced Luther to more serious action. These failures to respond adequately make him notable for his failure to prevent the [[Reformation]].

==Biography==
=== Early career ===
Born in [[Kölln]] on the Spree, Albert was the younger son of [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg]] and of [[Margaret of Thuringia]].

After their father's funeral, Albert and his older brother [[Joachim I Nestor]] became [[Margrave of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] in 1499, but only his older brother held the title of an [[elector of Brandenburg]]. Having studied at the University of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], Albert entered the ecclesiastical profession, and in 1513 became [[archbishop]] of [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] at the age of 23 and administrator of the [[Diocese of Halberstadt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline= y|wstitle= Albert I. (elector of Mainz)|display= Albert|volume= 1|pages= 496-497}} Endnote: See
* J. H. Hennes, ''Albrecht von Brandenburg, Erzbischof von Mainz und Magdeburg'' (Mainz, 1858)
* J. May, ''Der Kurfürst, Kardinal, und Erzbischof Albrecht II. von Mainz und Magdeburg'' (Munich, 1865–1875)
* W. Schum, ''Kardinal Albrecht von Mainz und die Erfurter Kirchenreformation'' (Halle, 1878)
* P. Redlich, ''Kardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg, und das neue Stift zu Halle (Mainz, 1900).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1514 he obtained the [[Electorate of Mainz]], and in 1518, at the age of 28, was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].  To pay for the [[pallium]] of the [[Holy See|see of Mainz]] and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 [[ducat]]s from [[Jakob Fugger]], ''[Fugger article says 48,000 ducats]'' and had obtained permission from [[Pope Leo X]] to conduct the sale of [[indulgences]] in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as he forwarded half of the income to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinal's retinue in charge of the cashbox. He procured the services of [[John Tetzel]] to sell the indulgences.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Largely in reaction to the commerce in indulgences, [[Martin Luther]] wrote his famous [[95 Theses]], which led to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Luther sent these to Albert on 31 October 1517, and according to a false tradition nailed a copy to the door of [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|Castle Church]] in [[Wittenberg]]. Albert forwarded the theses to Rome, suspecting Luther of heresy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} When the [[imperial election of 1519]] drew near, partisans of the two leading candidates ([[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]] and [[Francis I of France]]) eagerly solicited the vote of the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz, and Albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote. The electors eventually chose Charles, who became the Emperor Charles V.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[File:CranachBrandenburgasJerome.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal Albert, Archbishop of Mainz, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1526]]

Albert's large and liberal ideas, his friendship with [[Ulrich von Hutten]], and his political ambitions, appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to [[Protestantism]]; but after the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1525 he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and was among the princes who joined the [[League of Dessau]] in July 1525.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Cardinal Albert needed a prestigious church building that met his expectations at a central location in his ''[[Residenz]]'' town. Albert feared for his peace of mind in heaven, and collected more than 8,100 [[relics#Roman Catholic classification and prohibitions|relics]] and 42 holy [[human skeleton|skeletons]] which needed to be stored. These precious treasures, known as &quot;Hallesches Heilthum&quot;, indirectly related to the sale of [[indulgences]] which had triggered the Reformation a few years before. Then the cardinal and the Catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of [[the Reformation]] by holding far grander [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] and [[church service|services]] in a new church dedicated solely to Saint Mary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 011.jpg|thumb|Meeting of Saint [[Erasmus of Formiae]] and [[Saint Maurice]], by [[Matthias Grünewald]], between 1517 and 1523.  Grünewald used Albert of Mainz, who commissioned the painting, as the model for St. Erasmus (left).]]
Albert's hostility towards the reformers, however, was not so extreme as that of his brother [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg]]; and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace, although he was a member of the League of Nuremberg, formed in 1538 as a counterpoise to the [[League of Schmalkalden]]. New doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 [[florin]]s. During his later years showed more intolerance towards the Protestants, and favoured the teaching of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in his dominions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

===Market Church of Our Lady===
The [[Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen|Market Church of Our Lady]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], which had been built to defend against the spread of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] sympathies,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} was the very spot where [[Justus Jonas]] officially introduced the Reformation into Halle with his [[Good Friday]] sermon in 1541. The service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air, because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave. Jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed. Cardinal Albert left the town permanently after the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] (''Stände'') in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of [[Jacob Fugger]]. Halle became Protestant and in 1542 Jonas was appointed as priest to St. Mary's and in 1544 bishop over the city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Albert adorned the [[collegiate church]] (''Stiftskirche'')  at Halle and the [[Mainz Cathedral|cathedral at Mainz]] in sumptuous fashion, and took as his motto the words ''Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae'' (Latin for: &quot;Lord, I admired the adornment of your house.&quot;). A generous patron of art and learning, he counted [[Erasmus]] among his friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

===Death===
Albert died at the [[Martinsburg, Mainz]] in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1518.htm Biographical Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025123945/http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1518.htm |date=2015-10-25 }} BRANDENBURG, Albrecht von (1490-1545)&lt;/ref&gt;
