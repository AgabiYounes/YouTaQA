'''Alexander III'''  ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Medieval Gaelic]]: ''Alaxandair mac Alaxandair''; Modern Gaelic: ''Alasdair mac Alasdair'') (4 September 1241 – 19 March 1286) was [[King of Scots]] from 1249 until his death. He concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]], by which Scotland acquired sovereignty over the Western Isles and the Isle of Man. His heir, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], died before she could be crowned.

==Life==
Alexander was born at [[Roxburgh]], the only son of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] by his second wife [[Marie de Coucy]]. Alexander III was also the grandson of [[William the Lion]]. Alexander's father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 13 July 1249.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by [[Walter Comyn]], [[Earl of Menteith]], the other by [[Alan Durward]], [[Justiciar of Scotia]]. The former dominated  the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to [[Margaret of England]] in 1251, [[Henry III of England]] seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]] led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_iii/ &quot;Alexander III, King of Scots 1249 – 1286&quot;, Scotland's History, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the [[Western Isles]] which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He laid a formal claim before the [[Norway|Norwegian]] king [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon]].  Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the [[Isle of Arran]], and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific [[extreme weather|storm]] which greatly damaged his ships. The [[Battle of Largs]] (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the [[Treaty of Perth]] by which he ceded the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Western Isles]] to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] until 1469 when they became a dowry for [[James III of Scotland|James III]]'s bride, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]].

==Succession==

Alexander had married [[Margaret of England|Margaret]], daughter of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]], on 25 December 1251, when he was ten years old and she was eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacArthur2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret MacArthur|title=History of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5c8sDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT25|date=12 July 2017|publisher=Merkaba Press via PublishDrive|pages=25–|id=PKEY:6610000020409}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1275, after they had had three children.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

According to the [[Lanercost Chronicle]], Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: &quot;he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Herbert, ed.|title=Chronicle of Lanercost|journal=The Scottish Historical Review|date=1909|volume=6|page=184|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBNAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=he+used+never+to+forbear+on+account+of+season+nor+storm,+nor+for+perils+of+flood+or+rocky+cliffs,+but+would+visit+none+too+creditably+nuns+or+matrons,+virgins+or+widows+as+the+fancy+seized+him,+sometimes+in+disguise&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yEItYRMs7g&amp;sig=yz0Vs_BdYFi0hwh3YKOzFPyDQDM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9mPKzybLOAhWIRiYKHWgqAm4Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20used%20never%20to%20forbear%20on%20account%20of%20season%20nor%20storm%2C%20nor%20for%20perils%20of%20flood%20or%20rocky%20cliffs%2C%20but%20would%20visit%20none%20too%20creditably%20nuns%20or%20matrons%2C%20virgins%20or%20widows%20as%20the%20fancy%20seized%20him%2C%20sometimes%20in%20disguise&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance. In 1284 he induced the [[Parliament of Scotland|Estates]] to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter [[Margaret of Scotland (Maid of Norway)|Margaret, the &quot;Maid of Norway&quot;]]. The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to [[Yolande de Dreux (Scotland)|Yolande de Dreux]]&lt;ref name=alba&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/warsofindependence/deathofalexanderiii/index.asp |title=&quot;Death of Alexander III&quot;, Foghlam Alba |access-date=2015-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714225534/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/warsofindependence/deathofalexanderiii/index.asp |archive-date=2015-07-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 November 1285.

Alexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at [[Kinghorn]] in [[Fife]] on 18 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Scottish Queens, 1034-1714 | last=Marshall | first=Rosalind K. | page=27 | year=2003 | publisher=Tuckwell Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander III (1241 - 1286)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alexander_iii.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors. He was advised by them not to make the journey to Fife because of weather conditions, but he travelled anyway. Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing. The 44-year-old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck. Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=James, ed.|title=The Nuttall Encyclopaedia|date=1920|publisher=Warne|location=London|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EcPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=alexander+iii+fell+off+a+cliff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEjZ3CzLLOAhWEQCYKHd1fDMYQ6AEISjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=alexander%20iii%20fell%20off%20a%20cliff&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found, there is a very steep rocky embankment, which &quot;would have been fatal in the dark.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mount|first1=Toni|title=Dragon's Blood &amp; Willow Bark: The Mysteries of Medieval Medicine|date=2015|publisher=Amberley|location=Stroud, Glos.|isbn=978-1445643830|page=n.p.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UlVpCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP23&amp;lpg=PP23&amp;dq=death+alexander+iii+no+cliff&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ldi7V7r9Bg&amp;sig=lfQp3NXzUEWnAaXKWvPnaoKUHzw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiApOLezbLOAhVC7CYKHTSRAd84ChDoAQhZMA8#v=onepage&amp;q=death%20alexander%20iii%20no%20cliff&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Alexander's death, his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England. He was buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]].

As Alexander left no surviving children, the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande. When Yolande's pregnancy ended, probably with a miscarriage, Alexander's seven-year-old granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], became the heir. Margaret died, still uncrowned, on her way to Scotland in 1290. The inauguration of [[John Balliol]] as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of the [[Guardians of Scotland]] governing the land.

The death of Alexander and the subsequent period of instability in Scotland was lamented in an early [[Scots language|Scots]] poem recorded by [[Andrew of Wyntoun]] in his [[Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland]].

In 1886, a monument to Alexander III was erected at the approximate location of his death in [[Kinghorn]].&lt;ref name=nationalgalleries&gt;[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-13639-kinghorn-road-alexander-iii-monument-king &quot;Alexander III Monument, Kinghorn&quot;, British Listed Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional portrayals==

[[File:Alexander III statue, West door of St. Giles, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.88|Statue of Alexander on the west door of [[St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh]]]]
Alexander III has been depicted in historical novels. They include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Nield&quot;&gt;Nield (1968), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

*''The Thirsty Sword'' (1892) by Robert Leighton. The novel depicts the &quot;Norse invasion of Scotland&quot; (1262–1263, part of the [[Scottish–Norwegian War]]) and the [[Battle of Largs]]. It includes depictions of Alexander III and his opponent [[Haakon IV of Norway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nield&quot;&gt;Nield (1968), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Alexander the Glorious'' (1965) by Jane Oliver. The novel covers the entire reign of Alexander III (1249–1286), &quot;almost entirely from Alexander's viewpoint&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalnovels.info/Medieval-Celts.html &quot;Historical Novel:Medieval Celts&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/ALEXANDER-GLORIOUS-Jane-Oliver/product-reviews/B00209JTBA/ref=sr_1_1_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1 &quot;Alexander the Glorious&quot;, review]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Crown in Darkness'' (1988) by [[Paul C. Doherty]]. A [[crime fiction]] novel where Hugh Corbett investigates the &quot;mysterious death&quot; of Alexander III (1286). Alexander supposedly suffered a fatal fall from his horse. But there are suspicions of murder. The novel concludes that Alexander was indeed murdered &quot;by a fanatical servant&quot; of [[Edward I of England]]. The killer acting according to &quot;Edward's secret desire to overwhelm and control Scotland&quot;. Doherty suggests that the personal relations of the two kings were strained by constant arguments, though this is not confirmed by historical sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Detective&quot;&gt;Browne, Kreiser (2000), p. 78, 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Quest For A Maid'' (1988) by [[Frances Mary Hendry]]. The novel depicts the life of Meg, her power-hungry older sister Inge, Lady [[Marjorie, Countess of Carrick]] and their part in securing the succession of Lady Marjorie's son [[Robert the Bruce]] to the Scottish throne.  It includes depictions of Alexander III's death as &quot;falling off a cliff&quot; with sorcery as the cause.
*''Insurrection'' (2010) by [[Robyn Young]]. This novel is the first of a series of novels primarily about the life and times of Robert the Bruce. However, it covers Alexander III and the circumstances surrounding his death in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Insurrection | author=http://historicalnovelsociety.org| work=historicalnovelsociety.org | url=http://historicalnovelsociety.org/reviews/insurrection/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Raphael Holinshed]], in his oft-fanciful history of England in his [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']], stated that at Alexander III's wedding, a horrible monster, mostly skeleton but with raw flesh, appeared at the end of the procession and caused the wedding to be hurriedly concluded. This was, in tradition, an omen of death.
*''Crusader'' (1991) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. This novel follows the minority of Alexander III and his relationship with David de Lindsay. Tranter, who has written scores of historical novels spanning the range of Scotland's history, also wrote &quot;Envoy Extraordinary&quot; (1999) (about Patrick Earl of Dunbar) and &quot;True Thomas&quot; (1981) (about Thomas the Rhymer), both of which take place during the reign of Alexander III, and in which Alexander is a featured character.
