'''Agate''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ɡ|ə|t}} is a rock consisting primarily of [[cryptocrystalline]] [[silica]], chiefly [[chalcedony]], alternating with microgranular quartz. It is characterized by its fineness of grain and variety of color. Although agates may be found in various kinds of host rock, they are classically associated with [[volcanic]] rocks and can be common in certain [[metamorphic rock]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilder&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology and history==
The stone was given its name by [[Theophrastus]], a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]] and [[naturalist]], who discovered the stone along the shore line of the river [[Dirillo|Achates]] ({{lang-grc|Ἀχάτης}}) in [[Sicily]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Ancient use===
Agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of [[hardstone carving]], and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites, indicating its widespread use in the ancient world; for example, archaeological recovery at the [[Knossos]] site on [[Crete]] illustrates its role in [[Bronze Age]] [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2007. [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and characteristics==
[[File:Faceted Botswana agate.jpg|thumb|left|Botswana agate]]
Agate minerals have the tendency to form on preexisting rocks, creating difficulties in accurately determining their time of formation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindat.org/min-51.html|title=Agate: Mineral information, data and localities.|website=www.mindat.org|access-date=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their host rocks have been dated to have formed as early as the [[Archean]] Eon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://depositsmag.com/2018/03/27/agate-a-mineral-that-develops-with-age-water-and-moganite/|title=Agate: a mineral that develops with age, water and moganite|last=UKGE|date=2018-03-27|website=Deposits Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Agates are most commonly found as nodules within the cavities of [[Volcanic rock|volcanic rocks]]. These cavities are formed from the gases trapped within the liquid volcanic material forming [[Vesicle (geology)|vesicles]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/MineralDefinition.aspx?name=agate|title=Agate chalcedony: The mineral Agate information and pictures|website=www.minerals.net|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cavities are then filled with silica-rich fluids from the volcanic material form agate, layers are deposited on the walls of the cavity slowly working there way inwards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geologyin.com/2016/02/how-do-agates-form.html|title=How Do Agates Form?|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first layer deposited on the cavity walls is commonly known as the priming layer&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stonetreasuresbythelake.com/pages/yellow-skin-agate|title=Metaphysical Properties of Yellow Skin Agate - Stone Treasures|website=Stone Treasures by the Lake|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers. These variations in layers result in bands of [[chalcedony]] often alternate with layers of crystalline [[quartz]] forming banded agate&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rocktumbler.com/blog/what-is-agate-jasper-chalcedony/|title=The Difference Between Agate, Jasper and Chalcedony|website=rocktumbler.com|access-date=2020-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hollow agates can also form due to the deposition of liquid-rich silica not penetrating deep enough to fill the cavity completely&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;. From the reduced cavity within the agate will form crystals, the apex of each crystal will angle towards the center of the cavity.

The priming layer are often dark green in colouration but can be reduced by [[iron oxide]] emitting a rust like appearance&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;. Agate is a very durable mineral and therefore is often seen detach from its eroding matrix, once removed, the outer surface is usually pitted and rough from filling the cavity of its former matrix. Agates have also been found in [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary rocks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;, normally in [[limestone]] or [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]; these sedimentary rock require cavities often from decomposed branches or other buried organic material. If a silica-rich fluids are able to penetrate into these cavities agates can be formed.

&lt;br /&gt;

==Types==

A Mexican agate, showing only a single eye, has received the name of ''cyclops agate''. Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or [[moss agate]]. ''Dendritic'' agates include fern-like patterns formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetatable material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate, due to its appearance. [[Enhydro agate]] contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.

''Turritella agate'' is formed from silicified [[fossil]] ''[[Elimia tenera]]'' (erroneously considered ''[[Turritella]]'') shells. ''E. tenera'' are spiral freshwater [[gastropod]]s with elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, [[coral]], [[petrified wood]] and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized.

''Coldwater agates'', such as the Lake Michigan Cloud Agate, did not form under volcanic processes, but instead formed within the limestone and dolomite strata of marine origin. Like volcanic-origin agates, Coldwater Agates formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock. These agates are typically less colorful, with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brays|first1=Karen|title=Customer Agate Finds|url=http://agatelady.com/photo-gallery-customer-agate-finds.html|website=Gitche Gumee Museum|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Greek agate'' is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in [[Sicily]], once a Greek colony, back to{{clarify|date=February 2019}} 400 BC. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads.

''Brazilian agate'' is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.

Certain stones, when examined in [[thin section]]s by transmitted light, show a [[diffraction]] spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed ''rainbow agates''. Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.

''Lace agate'' is a variety that exhibits a [[lace]]-like pattern with forms such as eyes, swirls, bands or zigzags (if these{{clarify|date=February 2019}} predominate, it is called ''lattice agate''). ''Crazy lace agate'', found in Mexico, is often brightly colored with a complex pattern. ''Blue lace agate'' is found in Africa and is especially hard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polk 80&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Polk|first1=Patti|title=Collecting Rocks, Gems and Minerals: Identification, Values and Lapidary Uses|date=2016|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|isbn=9781440246159|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Polyhedroid agate'' is agate which has grown in a flat-sided shape similar to a [[polyhedron]].&lt;ref&gt;Plodowski, G., and Werner, R.; Achate: Kleine Senckenberg-Reihe, No. 12 (1981), p. 34, fig. 20&lt;/ref&gt; When sliced, it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric [[polygon]]s. Polyhedroid agate is thought to be found only in [[Paraíba]] State, Brazil. It has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling-in of spaces between pre-existing crystals which have since dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donoghue, M.; ''Quartz'', Butterworth-Heinemann (1987), p. 82. {{ISBN|978-0408014625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of agate include Holley&lt;!-- Not &quot;Holly&quot;, the stone is named after the town of Holley --&gt; blue agate (also spelled &quot;Holly blue agate&quot;), a rare dark blue ribbon agate only found near [[Holley, Oregon]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/281/WRRI-5ocr.pdf?sequence=1|title= Socio-Cultural Impacts of Water Resource Development in the Santiam River Basin |date= October 1970 |publisher= Oregon State University: Water Resources Research Institute |page= 9 |accessdate= February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Superior agate]]; carnelian agate (has reddish hues); Botswana agate; plume agate; [[condor agate]], tube agate (with visible flow channels or pinhole-sized &quot;tubes&quot;); fortification agate (with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts); [[Binghamite]], a variety found only on the Cuyuna iron range (near Crosby) in Crow Wing County, Minnesota; [[fire agate]] (showing an iridescent, internal flash or &quot;fire&quot;, the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite); and [[Patuxent River stone]], a red and yellow form of agate only found in [[Maryland]], where it is the state gem.

==Uses in industry and art==
Industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness, ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack. It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for [[laboratory balance]]s and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make [[Mortar and pestle|mortars and pestles]] to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for [[leather burnishing]] tools.

The decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as [[pins]], [[brooch]]es or other types of [[jewellery]], paper knives, [[inkstand]]s, [[marbles]] and [[seal (emblem)|seals]]. Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and [[Intarsia]] art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin. [[Idar-Oberstein]] was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farlang.com/art/2007-04-15.7721093142 Background Article on Idar Oberstein]&lt;/ref&gt; Agates have long been used in arts and crafts. The sanctuary of a Presbyterian church in [[Yachats, Oregon]], has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yachatspresbyterian.org/webapp/GetPage?pid=211|title=Agate Windows - Community Presbyterian Church|publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301204921/http://www.yachatspresbyterian.org/webapp/GetPage?pid=211|archive-date=1 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
