Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Efficacy --&gt;
The conclusions of numerous trials and [[systematic review]]s of acupuncture are inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; An overview of [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane reviews]] found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions.&lt;ref name=Ernst2009/&gt; A systematic review conducted by medical scientists at the Universities of [[University of Exeter|Exeter]] and [[University of Plymouth|Plymouth]] found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; Overall, the evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits.&lt;ref name=Wang-2008/&gt; Some research results suggest that acupuncture can alleviate some forms of pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's apparent effects are [[Placebo|not caused by the treatment itself]].&lt;ref name=Ernst2006/&gt; A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.&lt;ref name=Madsen2009/&gt; One [[meta-analysis]] found that acupuncture for chronic [[low back pain]] was [[cost-effective]] as an adjunct to standard care,&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor2013&quot;/&gt; while a separate systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Standaert2011&quot;/&gt;

Acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single-use needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu S&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nciacupuncture&quot;/&gt; When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor [[adverse effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu S&quot;/&gt; Accidents and infections do occur, though, and are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner, particularly in the application of [[Asepsis|sterile techniques]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nciacupuncture&quot;/&gt; A review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gnatta2013&quot;/&gt; The most frequently reported adverse events were [[pneumothorax]] and infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism, Epidemiology and History --&gt;
Scientific investigation has not found any [[histology|histological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as ''[[qi]]'', [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], and acupuncture points,{{refn |group= n |name=&quot;SinghErnst2008&quot; |Singh &amp; Ernst (2008) stated, &quot;Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;As yin and yang, acupuncture points and meridians are not a reality, but merely the product of an ancient Chinese philosophy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahn2008&quot;/&gt; and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (''qi'') or meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peñas2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mann2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams2013/&gt; Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100&amp;nbsp;BC in China, around the time ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine'' ([[Huangdi Neijing]]) was published,&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2006&quot;/&gt; Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, [[yin and yang]] energies, and a body's &quot;rhythm&quot; on the effectiveness of treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prioreschi2004&quot;/&gt; Acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in China due to changes in the country's political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or Western medicine.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; and then to Europe, beginning with France.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflicted with Western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter 2013 p. 403&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson 2011 p. 610&quot;/&gt;

Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; It is used most commonly for pain relief,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCCAM2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture for Pain|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/acupuncture-for-pain.htm|work=NCCIH|access-date=9 May 2014|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions. Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson2012/&gt; For example, the [[American Society of Anesthesiologists]] states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benzon HT, Connis RT, De Leon-Casasola OA, Glass DD, Korevaar WC, Cynwyd B, Mekhail NA, Merrill DG, Nickinovich DG, Rathmell JP, Sang CN, Simon DL | title = Practice guidelines for chronic pain management: an updated report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Chronic Pain Management and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 810–33 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20124882 | doi = 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181c43103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]] (Mayo Clinic), a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted; for the majority of cases, the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes.&lt;ref name=mayo2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/acupuncture/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020778|work=Mayo Clinic Staff|publisher=[[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]]|title=What you can expect|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be associated with the application of heat, pressure, or [[laser light]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; Classically, acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schwartz | first=L | url=http://medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011121060240/http://medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html|archive-date=21 November 2001 |journal=Medical Acupuncture | pages=38–41 | year=2000 |volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Evidence-Based Medicine And Traditional Chinese Medicine: Not Mutually Exclusive}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[invasiveness of surgical procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] therapy developed in early 20th century Japan using an elaborate set of instruments other than needles for the treatment of children (''shōnishin'' or ''shōnihari'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Birch | name-list-format = vanc |title=Japanese Pediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Thieme |year=2011 |isbn=978-3131500618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Thomas | last = Wernicke | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Art of Non-Invasive Paediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=978-1848191600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Inquiring involves focusing on the &quot;seven inquiries&quot;: chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender ''&quot;A-shi&quot;'' points and feeling the pulse.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987&gt;[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|right|Acupuncture needles]]
[[File:Japanese kudabari.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional and modern Japanese guiding tube needles]]
The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture).&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005&gt;{{cite book | first = Angela | last = Hicks | name-list-format = vanc |edition=1 |page=41 |title=The Acupuncture Handbook: How Acupuncture Works and How It Can Help You |publisher=[[Piatkus Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0749924720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collinge |first=William J. |name-list-format=vanc |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-446-67258-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanholistic00coll }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas, only sterile, single-use acupuncture needles are allowed, including the State of California, USA.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Consumer Affairs, California Acupuncture Board.

Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.&lt;ref name=FCA&gt;{{cite book| pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKoMiuhSb3YC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2–3] | title=Fundamentals of Chinese Acupuncture | vauthors = Ellis A, Wiseman N, Boss K | isbn=978-0912111339 | publisher=Paradigm Publications | year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.&lt;ref name=Aung116/&gt; Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.&lt;ref name=Dummies&gt;{{cite book | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6_1FOwC_GYC&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 126–128] | title=Complementary Medicine For Dummies | last=Young | first=J | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-0470519684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====

The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.&lt;ref name=Aung2007&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 113–114].&lt;/ref&gt; Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called ''de qi'', as well as &quot;needle grasp,&quot; a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture can be painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loyeung BY, Cobbin DM | title = Investigating the effects of three needling parameters (manipulation, retention time, and insertion site) on needling sensation and pain profiles: a study of eight deep needling interventions | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | pages = 1–12 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24159337 | pmc = 3789497 | doi = 10.1155/2013/136763 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.&lt;ref name=Aung2007/&gt;

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; &quot;arrival of qi&quot;) refers to a claimed sensation of numbness, distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site. If these sensations are not observed then inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, are blamed. If ''de-qi'' is not immediately observed upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques are often applied to promote it (such as &quot;plucking&quot;, &quot;shaking&quot; or &quot;trembling&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;AungChen2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven | last1 = Aung | first2 = William | last2 = Chen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|access-date=20 September 2012|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9781588902214|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once ''de-qi'' is observed, techniques might be used which attempt to &quot;influence&quot; the ''de-qi''; for example, by certain manipulation the ''de-qi'' can allegedly be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body.&lt;!---is this threading?---&gt; Other techniques aim at &quot;tonifying&quot; ({{zh|s=补|p=bǔ}}) or &quot;sedating&quot; ({{zh|s=泄|p=xiè}}) ''qi''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AungChen2007&quot;/&gt; The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|deficiency]] patterns, the latter in excess patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AungChen2007&quot;/&gt; ''De qi'' is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.&lt;ref name=Dummies/&gt;

A 2014 systematic review suggests that the [[nocebo effect]] of acupuncture is clinically relevant and that the rate of adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koog YH, Lee JS, Wi H | title = Clinically meaningful nocebo effect occurs in acupuncture treatment: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 67 | issue = 8 | pages = 858–69 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24780405 | doi = 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.02.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[meta-analysis]] conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration found &quot;relatively modest&quot; efficacy of acupuncture (in comparison to sham) for the treatment of four different types of [[chronic pain]] (back and neck pain, knee osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain) and on that basis concluded that it &quot;is more than a placebo&quot; and a reasonable referral option.&lt;ref name=Vickers2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vickers AJ, Cronin AM, Maschino AC, Lewith G, MacPherson H, Foster NE, Sherman KJ, Witt CM, Linde K | title = Acupuncture for chronic pain: individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 172 | issue = 19 | pages = 1444–53 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22965186 | pmc = 3658605 | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2012.3654 | others = for the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this meta-analysis, both [[Edzard Ernst]] and [[David Colquhoun]] said the results were of negligible clinical significance.&lt;ref name=Jha&gt;{{cite news| first = Alok | last = Jha | title = Acupuncture useful, but overall of little benefit, study shows | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/10/acupuncture-useful-little-benefit-study| newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Colquhoun&gt;{{cite journal| first = David | last = Colquhoun| title = Re: Risks of acupuncture range from stray needles to pneumothorax, finds study | journal = The BMJ| url = http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6060/rr/603200| publisher= [[BMJ]] | date = 17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edzard Ernst]] later stated that &quot;I fear that, once we manage to eliminate this bias &amp;#91;that operators are not blind&amp;#93; … we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response.&quot;&lt;ref name=Vickers2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vickers AJ, Maschino AC, Lewith G, MacPherson H, Sherman KJ, Witt CM | title = Responses to the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration individual patient data meta-analysis | journal = Acupuncture in Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 98–100 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23449559 | pmc = 3658608 | doi = 10.1136/acupmed-2013-010312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the same research group updated their previous meta-analysis and again found acupuncture to be superior to sham acupuncture for non-specific musculoskeletal pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain.

==== Children and pregnancy ====

Although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China, its use in [[pediatrics]] in the United States did not become common until the early 2000s. In 2007, the [[National Health Interview Survey]] (NHIS) conducted by the [[National Center for Health Statistics|National Center For Health Statistics]] (NCHS) estimated that approximately 150,000 children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/news/nhsr12.pdf |title = Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Among Adults and Children: United States, 2007 |date = 10 December 2008|website = National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health |publisher = NCHS |last = Barnes |first = Patricia M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 a study determined that the use of acupuncture-needle treatment on children was &quot;questionable&quot; due to the possibility of adverse side-effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults. The study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants, as well as on children who are over-fatigued, very weak, or have over-eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jindal V, Ge A, Mansky PJ | title = Safety and efficacy of acupuncture in children: a review of the evidence | journal = Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 431–42 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18525459 | pmc = 2518962 | doi = 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318165b2cc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used on children, acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; The same review found 279 adverse events, 25 of them serious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. [[cardiac rupture]] or [[hemoptysis]]); many might have been a result of substandard practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams D, Cheng F, Jou H, Aung S, Yasui Y, Vohra S | title = The safety of pediatric acupuncture: a systematic review | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 128 | issue = 6 | pages = e1575-87 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22106073 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2011-1091 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a83fc841822cc0fbb58ef5fc1d0489d18501b4f5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt;

When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park-2014&quot;/&gt; The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park-2014&quot;/&gt; Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park-2014&quot;/&gt; Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park-2014&quot;&gt;

Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the [[abdomen|abdominal region]], should be avoided during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman2010&quot;/&gt;

==== Moxibustion and cupping ====
&lt;!-- Traditional acupuncture involves moxibustion and cupping. --&gt;

Acupuncture is a substantial part of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] (TCM).

Acupuncture may have been practiced during the [[Neolithic]] era, near the end of the [[stone age]], using sharpened stones called [[Bian Stones|Bian shi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|70}} Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called &quot;plen&quot;, which means &quot;stone probe&quot;, that may have been used for acupuncture purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|70}} The ancient Chinese medical text, Huangdi Neijing, indicates that sharp stones were believed at-the-time to cure illnesses at or near the body's surface, perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|71}} However, it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes, such as puncturing a growth to drain its [[pus]].&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter 2013 p. 403&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Mawangdui]]'' texts, which are believed to be from the 2nd century BC, mention the use of pointed stones to open [[abscess]]es, and moxibustion, but not for acupuncture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prioreschi2004&quot;/&gt; It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting, due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Singh S, Ernst E | title=Trick Or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine | publisher=W.

According to historians [[Lu Gwei-djen]] and [[Joseph Needham]], there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around 600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; Some hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Robson | first = T | title = An Introduction to Complementary Medicine | isbn = 978-1741140545 | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E6oa37ZyTxEC&amp;pg=PA90 | page = 90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians Gwei-djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|71–72}} It is possible that [[bronze]] was used for early acupuncture needles. Tin, copper, gold and silver are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely, or to have been used in fewer cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|69}} If acupuncture was practiced during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1766 to 1122&amp;nbsp;BC), organic materials like thorns, sharpened bones, or bamboo may have been used.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|70}} Once methods for producing steel were discovered, it would replace all other materials, since it could be used to create a very fine, but sturdy needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|74}} Gwei-djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence, such as sharpened bones, bamboo or stones, were also used for other purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; An article in ''Rheumatology'' said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of Ma-Wang-Dui from 198&amp;nbsp;BC suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Belief systems====
Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prioreschi2004&quot;/&gt; According to David Ramey, no single &quot;method or theory&quot; was ever predominantly adopted as the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey DW | title = Inaccurate acupuncture history | journal = Rheumatology | volume = 43 | issue = 12 | pages = 1593; author reply 1593–4 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15564643 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/keh363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced, but the autobiography of Pien Chhio from around 400–500&amp;nbsp;BC references inserting needles at designated areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; [[Bian Que]] believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one's skull that he called the point &quot;of the hundred meetings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|83}} Texts dated to be from 156–186&amp;nbsp;BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt;

Ramey and Buell said the &quot;practice and theoretical underpinnings&quot; of modern acupuncture were introduced in ''The Yellow Emperor's Classic'' (Huangdi Neijing) around 100&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Prioreschi2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Prioreschi | first = P | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJUMhEYGOKsC&amp;pg=PA147 147–148] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1888456011 | publisher = Horatius Press | title = A history of Medicine, Volume 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt; It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy (''qi'') in a network of meridian (channels) in the body.&lt;ref name=Ramey/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Epler DC | title = Bloodletting in early Chinese medicine and its relation to the origin of acupuncture | journal = Bulletin of the History of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–67 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6998524 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The network concept was made up of acu-tracts, such as a line down the arms, where it said acupoints were located. Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the ''Yellow Emperor's Classic''.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|93}} Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|101}} By the 4th century AD, most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|101}}

===Early development in China===

====Establishment and growth====
In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|140–141}} The Science of the Yin-Yang Cycles (''Yün Chhi Hsüeh'') was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (thien) and earthly (ti) forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|140–141}} There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|140–141}} According to Needham and Gwei-djen, these &quot;arbitrary predictions&quot; were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;

Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection. Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|102–103}} Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a [[cauterizing]] effect at the injection site.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|104}} Nine needles were recommended in the ''Chen Chiu Ta Chheng'' from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|102–103}}

Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|140–141}} In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|140–141}}

In the 1st century AD, many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The ''Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing'', which was published in the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; Other books like the ''Yu Kuei Chen Ching'', written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; In the mid 7th century, [[Sun Simiao]] published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;

Acupuncture became more established in China as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books. The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College, which both supported acupuncture, became more established and created medical colleges in every province.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{rp|129}} The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{rp|129–135}} By time ''The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion'' was published during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644&amp;nbsp;AD), most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;

====Decline====
By the end of the Song dynasty (1279&amp;nbsp;AD), acupuncture had lost much of its status in China.&lt;ref name=Barnes2005&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 25].&lt;/ref&gt; It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious professions like [[alchemy]], [[shamanism]], [[midwifery]] and moxibustion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes 2005 p. 25&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 | access-date=21 July 2015 | page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by the 18th century, scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; By 1757 a book documenting the history of Chinese medicine called acupuncture a &quot;lost art&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|160}} Its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA188 188].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1822, the Chinese Emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the Imperial Medical Institute.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; He said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes 2005 p. 308&quot;/&gt; In China acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower-class, illiterate practitioners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes 2005 p. 58&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA58 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored for a time, but banned again in 1929 in favor of science-based Western medicine. Although acupuncture declined in China during this time period, it was also growing in popularity in other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter 2013 p. 403&quot;/&gt;

===International expansion===
[[File:hua t08.jpg|thumb|Acupuncture chart from ''Shisi jing fahui'' (Expression of the Fourteen Meridians) written by Hua Shou ([[floruit|fl.]] 1340s, [[Ming dynasty]]). Japanese reprint by Suharaya Heisuke (Edo, 1. year Kyōhō = 1716).]]
Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor [[Dangun]], though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|262–263}} Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter 2013 p. 403&quot;/&gt; As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; China and Korea sent &quot;medical missionaries&quot; that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219&amp;nbsp;AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|264}} Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|264–265}}

Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the [[Dutch East India Company]] met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;{{RP|264–265}} He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term &quot;acupuncture&quot; in his 1683 work ''De Acupunctura''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42&quot;/&gt; France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries, who brought the practice to French clinics in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The French doctor Louis Berlioz (the father of the composer [[Hector Berlioz]]) is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in Europe in 1810, before publishing his findings in 1816.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes 2005 p. 308&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA308 | access-date=21 July 2015 | page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|295}} Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century but interest waned by mid century.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, [[pulse diagnosis]], and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter 2013 p. 403&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson 2011 p. 610&quot;/&gt; In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh Ernst 2008 p. 42&quot;/&gt;

The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by [[Willem ten Rhijne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes 2005 p. 75&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Barnes LL | title=Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-674-01872-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA75 | access-date=14 July 2015 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern era ====
[[File:An ancient acupuncture statue.jpg|thumb| An ancient Acupuncture statue at the lobby of the [[Emperor's College|Emperor's College clinic]], California]]
In China, the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in 1949 when [[Mao Zedong]] took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values. It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).&lt;ref name=&quot;Porter 2013 p. 403&quot;/&gt;

New practices were adopted in the 20th century, such as using a cluster of needles,&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} electrified needles, or leaving needles inserted for up to a week.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} A lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;{{RP|164}} Acupuncture research organizations were founded in the 1950s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; China, where acupuncture was believed to have originated, was increasingly influenced by Western medicine.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Meanwhile, acupuncture grew in popularity in the US. The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992 and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in November 1997. In 1999, the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] was created within the NIH. Acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the US.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;

Politicians from the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party's commitment to science.&lt;ref name=Crozier1968/&gt; Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong later reversed this position,&lt;ref name=Crozier1968&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |edition=1 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |isbn=978-0674901056 }}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles.&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;{{cite book | last=Taylor | first=K | title=Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945–63: a Medicine of Revolution | year=2005 | isbn=978-0415345125 | publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, a ''New York Times'' reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in China, which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; The US President [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Richard Nixon visited China in 1972]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;/&gt; During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than [[anesthesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;/&gt; Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high [[pain tolerance]] and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving [[morphine]] surreptitiously through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ |title=Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 1) | vauthors = Beyerstein BL, Sampson W |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=1996 |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004020227/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ |archive-date=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One patient receiving [[open heart surgery]] while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a [[local anesthetic]] into the wound.&lt;ref name=Colquhoun2013/&gt; After the [[National Institute of Health]] expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions, adoption in the US grew further.&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC&lt;ref name=&quot;JCIM_Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx/ |title=The first acupuncture center in the United States: an interview with Yao Wu Lee, Washington Acupuncture Center |first=AY |last=Fan |volume=20 |issue=5 |year=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Integrative Medicine]] |publisher=Committee for Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727004846/http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx |archive-date=27 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 the American [[Internal Revenue Service]] allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 133&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 978-0465041954|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/133 133]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a [[BBC]] documentary ''Alternative Medicine'' filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture-induced anesthesia.

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of acupuncture}}
There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Japan, Canada, and in European countries and elsewhere. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that before being licensed or certified, an acupuncturist receive 200 hours of specialized training if they are a physician and 2,500 hours for non-physicians; many governments have adopted similar standards.

In China, the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong's traditional Chinese medicine laws 'putting public at risk'|date=23 July 2007|first=Mark|last=O'Neill|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/601500/hong-kongs-traditional-chinese-medicine-laws-putting-public-risk|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsay2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first = Cynthia | last = Ramsay | name-list-format = vanc |title=Unnatural Regulation: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y5oPvK4QVwC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2009|publisher=The Fraser Institute|page=43|id=GGKEY:0KK0XUSQASK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation in the US began in the 1970s in California, which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho. Licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state. The needles used in acupuncture are regulated in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChanLee2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Chan | first2 = Henry | last2 = Lee | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Way Forward for Chinese Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5EIubrfg6wC&amp;pg=PA349|date=6 December 2001|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-2423-4|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states acupuncture is regulated by a board of medical examiners, while in others by the board of licensing, health or education.

In Japan, acupuncturists are licensed by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare|Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare]] after passing an examination and graduating from a technical school or university.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = WHO Global Atlas of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine|publisher = World Health Organization|year = 2005|isbn = 978-92-4-156286-7|page = 195|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VO8K9h9GvaoC&amp;pg=PA195}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia regulates acupuncture, among other Chinese medical traditions, and restricts the use of titles like 'acupuncturist' to registered practitioners only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinesemedicineboard.gov.au/Codes-Guidelines/FAQ/Registration.aspx|title=Chinese Medicine Board of Australia - Registration and how to apply|website=www.chinesemedicineboard.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 28 countries in Europe have professional associations for acupuncturists.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; In France, the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine]] (National Academy of Medicine) has regulated acupuncture since 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bossy|first=Jean|title=Acupuncture in France|publisher=Acupunct Med|url=http://aim.bmj.com/content/5/1/6.full.pdf+html|quote=Since 1955, the French Academy of Medicine accetr ted and included Acupunchlre as a part of medicine because it includes both diagnosis and therapeutic treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
