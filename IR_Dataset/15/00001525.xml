&lt;!-- Adverse effects --&gt;
One common [[adverse effect]] is an [[upset stomach]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; More significant side effects include [[stomach ulcer]]s, [[stomach bleeding]], and worsening [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], take other NSAIDs, or are on other [[anticoagulants|blood thinners]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; It is not generally recommended in children with [[infection]]s because of the risk of [[Reye syndrome]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt; High doses may result in [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]].&lt;ref name=AHSF2016/&gt;

Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain, although it is generally considered inferior to [[ibuprofen]] because aspirin is more likely to cause [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].&lt;ref name=pmid15768621&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachs CJ | title = Oral analgesics for acute nonspecific pain | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 913–8 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15768621 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0301/p913.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140528051101/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2005/0301/p913.html | df = dmy-all | url-status = live | archive-date = 28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle [[cramp]]s, [[bloating]], [[gastric distension]], or acute skin irritation.&lt;ref name=pmid14592563&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaciong Z | title = The real dimension of analgesic activity of aspirin | journal = Thrombosis Research | volume = 110 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 361–4 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 14592563 | doi = 10.1016/j.thromres.2003.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other NSAIDs, [[Compound analgesic|combinations]] of aspirin and [[caffeine]] provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone.&lt;ref name=pmid22419343&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Derry CJ, Derry S, Moore RA | title = Caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant for acute pain in adults | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2014 | issue = 12 | pages = CD009281 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25502052 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009281.pub3 | pmc = 6485702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effervescent]] formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets,&lt;ref name=pmid10868553&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hersh EV, Moore PA, Ross GL | title = Over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics: a critical assessment | journal = Clinical Therapeutics | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 500–48 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10868553 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-2918(00)80043-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes them useful for the treatment of [[migraine]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid18451718&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mett A, Tfelt-Hansen P | title = Acute migraine therapy: recent evidence from randomized comparative trials | journal = Current Opinion in Neurology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–7 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18451718 | doi = 10.1097/WCO.0b013e3282fee843 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c32e3c3121bc4ca7d5b7499cb775db43a1e824c5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Topical medication|Topical]] aspirin may be effective for treating some types of [[neuropathic pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kingery WS | title = A critical review of controlled clinical trials for peripheral neuropathic pain and complex regional pain syndromes | journal = Pain | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–39 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9415498 | doi = 10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00049-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Headache====
Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain [[Headache#Classification|types of a headache]], but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the [[International Classification of Headache Disorders]] distinguishes between [[tension headache]] (the most common), migraine, and [[cluster headache]]. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loder E, Rizzoli P | title = Tension-type headache | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7635 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18187725 | pmc = 2190284 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39412.705868.AD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin, especially as a component of an [[aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine]] [[combination drug|combination]], is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of [[sumatriptan]]. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilmore B, Michael M | title = Treatment of acute migraine headache | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–80 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21302868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fever===
Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control [[fever]] is due to its action on the [[prostaglandin]] system through its irreversible inhibition of [[COX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartfai T, Conti B | title = Fever | journal = TheScientificWorldJournal | volume = 10 | pages = 490–503 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20305990 | pmc = 2850202 | doi = 10.1100/tsw.2010.50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although aspirin's use as an [[antipyretic]] in adults is well established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies, including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and the [[Food and Drug Administration]], strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pugliese A, Beltramo T, Torre D | title = Reye's and Reye's-like syndromes | journal = Cell Biochemistry and Function | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 741–6 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18711704 | doi = 10.1002/cbf.1465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beutler AI, Chesnut GT, Mattingly JC, Jamieson B | title = FPIN's Clinical Inquiries.

===Inflammation===
Aspirin is used as an [[anti-inflammatory agent]] for both acute and long-term [[inflammation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19597002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris T, Stables M, Hobbs A, de Souza P, Colville-Nash P, Warner T, Newson J, Bellingan G, Gilroy DW | display-authors = 6 | title = Effects of low-dose aspirin on acute inflammatory responses in humans | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 183 | issue = 3 | pages = 2089–96 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19597002 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.0900477 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref name=AHFS /&gt;

===Heart attacks and strokes===
Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation: the acute management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation [Internet] | journal = NICE Clinical Guidelines | issue = 167 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 25340241 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0071000/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151231192814/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0071000/ | df = dmy-all | url-status = live | at = 17.2 Asprin | archive-date = 31 December 2015 | vauthors = ((National Clinical Guideline Centre (UK))) }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems, including those over the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnett DK, Blumenthal RS, Albert MA, Buroker AB, Goldberger ZD, Hahn EJ, Himmelfarb CD, Khera A, Lloyd-Jones D, McEvoy JW, Michos ED, Miedema MD, Muñoz D, Smith SC Jr, Virani SS, Williams KA Sr, Yeboah J, Ziaeian B | display-authors = 6 | title = 2019 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 74 | issue = 10 | pages = e177–e232 | date = 2019 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2019.03.010 | pmid = 30894318|url=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High risk====
For people who have already had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years prevented 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (heart attack, stroke, or death), but also caused non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Newman |first1=David | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in people with known heart disease or strokes |url=http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-for-cardiovascular-prevention-after-prior-heart-attack-or-stroke/#%22 |website=The NNT |access-date=30 November 2015 |date=July 10, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208160242/http://www.thennt.com/nnt/aspirin-for-cardiovascular-prevention-after-prior-heart-attack-or-stroke/#%22 |archive-date=8 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20112887&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall SL, Lorenc T | title = Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–96 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20112887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baigent C, Blackwell L, Collins R, Emberson J, Godwin J, Peto R, Buring J, Hennekens C, Kearney P, Meade T, Patrono C, Roncaglioni MC, Zanchetti A | display-authors = 6 | title = Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9678 | pages = 1849–60 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19482214 | pmc = 2715005 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60503-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Low dose aspirin appears useful for people less than 70{{nbsp}}kg while higher dose aspirin is required to benefit those over 70{{nbsp}}kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid30017552&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothwell PM, Cook NR, Gaziano JM, Price JF, Belch JF, Roncaglioni MC, Morimoto T, Mehta Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Effects of aspirin on risks of vascular events and cancer according to body weight and dose: analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials | journal = Lancet | volume = 392 | issue = 10145 | pages = 387–399 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30017552 | pmc = 6083400 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31133-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF), {{as of|2016|lc=yes}}, recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colon cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF aspirin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF 2016&quot; /&gt;

====Lower risk====
In those with no previous history of heart disease, aspirin decreases the risk of a non-fatal myocardial infarction but increases the risk of bleeding and does not change the overall risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lip GY, Felmeden DC, Dwivedi G |title=Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants for hypertension |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=12 |pages=CD003186 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003186.pub3 |pmid=22161375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guirguis2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guirguis-Blake JM, Evans CV, Senger CA, O'Connor EA, Whitlock EP | title = Aspirin for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 164 | issue = 12 | pages = 804–13 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27064410 | doi = 10.7326/M15-2113 | type = Systematic Review &amp; Meta-Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMA2019/&gt; Specifically over 5 years it decreased the risk of a cardiovascular event by 1 in 265 and increased the risk of bleeding by 1 in 210.&lt;ref name=JAMA2019&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roddick |first1=Alistair J. |last2=Zheng |first2=Sean L. |title=Association of Aspirin Use for Primary Prevention With Cardiovascular Events and Bleeding Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |date=22 January 2019 |volume=321 |issue=3 |pages=277–287 |doi=10.1001/jama.2018.20578 |pmid=30667501 |pmc=6439678 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====After surgery====
After [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s (PCIs), such as the placement of a [[coronary artery]] [[stent]], a U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)|title=2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guideline for percutaneous coronary artery intervention.

This is called dual [[antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet therapy]] (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Musumeci G, Di Lorenzo E, Valgimigli M | title = Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: what are the drivers? | journal = Current Opinion in Cardiology | volume = 26 Suppl 1 | pages = S4–14 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22129582 | doi = 10.1097/01.hco.0000409959.11246.ba }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.{{mcn|date=October 2019}}

===Other uses===
Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]]. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.&lt;ref name=NHFA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726052030/http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf |archive-date=2008-07-26 |title=Diagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia.

&lt;!--Please note that I do not have access to the full text of this source. The abstract and lay summary state that pseudoresistance occurs with enteric-coated aspirin only.

In addition to enteric coating, &quot;buffering&quot; is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses [[magnesium oxide]]. Other preparations use [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |title=General chemistry online: FAQ: Acids and bases: What is the buffer system in buffered aspirin? |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |access-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414145143/http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |archive-date=14 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking it with vitamin C has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining. &lt;!--According to research done at a German university, t--&gt;Taking equal doses of vitamin C and aspirin may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dammann&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dammann HG, Saleki M, Torz M, Schulz HU, Krupp S, Schürer M, Timm J, Gessner U | display-authors = 6 | title = Effects of buffered and plain acetylsalicylic acid formulations with and without ascorbic acid on gastric mucosa in healthy subjects | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–74 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14984384 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2004.01742.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Konturek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konturek PC, Kania J, Hahn EG, Konturek JW | title = Ascorbic acid attenuates aspirin-induced gastric damage: role of inducible nitric oxide synthase | journal = Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology | volume = 57 Suppl 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 125–36 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17218764 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central effects===
Large doses of [[salicylate]], a metabolite of aspirin, cause temporary [[tinnitus]] (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on [[arachidonic acid]] and [[NMDA receptor]]s cascade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guitton MJ, Caston J, Ruel J, Johnson RM, Pujol R, Puel JL | title = Salicylate induces tinnitus through activation of cochlear NMDA receptors | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 3944–52 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12736364 | pmc = 6742173 | df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-09-03944.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reye's syndrome===
{{Main|Reye's syndrome}}
Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute [[encephalopathy]] and [[fatty liver]], can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 to 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a [[Respiratory tract infection|respiratory infection]], [[chickenpox]], or [[diarrhea]]. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported.&lt;ref name=Belay&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belay ED, Bresee JS, Holman RC, Khan AS, Shahriari A, Schonberger LB | title = Reye's syndrome in the United States from 1981 through 1997 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 340 | issue = 18 | pages = 1377–82 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10228187 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199905063401801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]'s warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued.&lt;ref name=Belay/&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever,&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ2002-Macdonald&quot;/&gt; and the UK [[National Health Service]] recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Reyes-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title= Reye's syndrome |publisher=National Health Service |work=NHS Choices |access-date=10 August 2016 |date= 12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling, and headache.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Aspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stadelmann WK, Digenis AG, Tobin GR | title = Impediments to wound healing | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 176 | issue = 2A Suppl | pages = 39S–47S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9777971 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(98)00184-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maessen-Visch MB, de Roos KP | title = Dutch Venous Ulcer guideline update | journal = Phlebology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 suppl | pages = 153–156 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24843102 | doi = 10.1177/0268355514529693 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a231726eb5b814a6aad671f1edaa70beb42fb8a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema|swelling of skin tissues]] in some people. In one study, [[angioedema]] appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berges-Gimeno MP, Stevenson DD | title = Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced reactions and desensitization | journal = The Journal of Asthma | volume = 41 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–84 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15281324 | doi = 10.1081/JAS-120037650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on [[MRI]] scans of 5 to 10{{nbsp}}mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vernooij MW, Haag MD, van der Lugt A, Hofman A, Krestin GP, Stricker BH, Breteler MM | display-authors = 6 | title = Use of antithrombotic drugs and the presence of cerebral microbleeds: the Rotterdam Scan Study | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 714–20 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19364926 | doi = 10.1001/archneurol.2009.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gorelick PB | title = Cerebral microbleeds: evidence of heightened risk associated with aspirin use | journal = Archives of Neurology | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 691–3 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19506128 | doi = 10.1001/archneurol.2009.85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such cerebral microbleeds are important, since they often occur prior to [[ischemic stroke]] or [[intracerebral hemorrhage]], [[Binswanger disease]], and [[Alzheimer's disease]].{{Original research inline|date=March 2011}}

Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause [[hyperkalemia|abnormally high blood levels of potassium]] by inducing a [[hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism|hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state]] via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.&lt;ref&gt;Medical knowledge self-assessment program for students 4, By American College of Physicians, Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine, Nephrology 227, Item 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scher KS | title = Unplanned reoperation for bleeding | journal = The American Surgeon | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–5 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8540646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2015, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] toughened warnings of increased [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] risk associated with [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA-20150709&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=FDA strengthens warning of heart attack and stroke risk for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs |url=https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-strengthens-warning-heart-attack-and-stroke-risk-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs |date=9 July 2015 |work=[[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] |access-date=9 July 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711004922/https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm453610.htm |archive-date=11 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overdose===
{{Main|Aspirin poisoning}}
Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a [[mortality rate]] of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Kreplick LW |year=2001 |title=Salicylate toxicity in emergency medicine |publisher=[[Medscape]] |url=http://misc.medscape.com/pi/android/medscapeapp/html/A818242-business.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831184805/http://misc.medscape.com/pi/android/medscapeapp/html/A818242-business.html |archive-date=31 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pediatrics1982-gaudreault&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudreault P, Temple AR, Lovejoy FH | title = The relative severity of acute versus chronic salicylate poisoning in children: a clinical comparison | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 566–9 | date = October 1982 | pmid = 7122154 }} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including [[activated charcoal]], intravenous dextrose and normal saline, [[sodium bicarbonate]], and [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |name-list-format=vanc |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/rosensemergencym0002unse/page/2242 2242] |url=https://archive.org/details/rosensemergencym0002unse/page/2242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100{{nbsp}}mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300{{nbsp}}mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400{{nbsp}}mg/l following acute overdose.

=== Interactions ===
Aspirin is known to [[Drug interaction|interact]] with other drugs. For example, [[acetazolamide]] and [[ammonium chloride]] are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;drugs.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/aspirin.html |title=Aspirin information from Drugs.com |access-date=8 May 2008 |publisher=Drugs.com| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163105/http://www.drugs.com/aspirin.html| archive-date= 9 May 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;personalmd&quot;/&gt; Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the [[antidiabetic drug]]s [[tolbutamide]] and [[chlorpropamide]], [[warfarin]], [[methotrexate]], [[phenytoin]], [[probenecid]], [[valproic acid]] (as well as interfering with [[beta oxidation]], an important part of valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs.

==Chemical properties==
Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or the [[acetate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[citrate]]s, or [[hydroxide]]s of the [[alkali metals]]. It is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to [[acetic acid|acetic]] and [[salicylic acid]]s. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Reynolds, E.F.|encyclopedia=Martindale: the extra pharmacopoeia|edition=28th|year=1982|pages=[https://archive.org/details/extrapharmacopoe28mart/page/234 234–82]|title=Aspirin and similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents|publisher=Rittenhouse Book Distributors|isbn=978-0-85369-160-0|url=https://archive.org/details/extrapharmacopoe28mart/page/234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[flour mill]]s, factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building, because [[dust explosion|the powder-air mixture can be explosive]]. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] in the United States of 5{{nbsp}}mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (time-weighted average).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0010.html |title = Acetylsalicylic acid |date = April 11, 2016 |website = NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards |publisher = U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170511071608/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0010.html |archive-date = 11 May 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) set a legal [[permissible exposure limit]] for aspirin of 5{{nbsp}}mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but this was vacated by the [[AFL-CIO v.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[ester]] group (R-OH → R-OCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimental organic chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R | name-list-format = vanc |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York | isbn=978-0-471-28250-1 |page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vishweshwar P, McMahon JA, Oliveira M, Peterson ML, Zaworotko MJ | title = The predictably elusive form II of aspirin | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 127 | issue = 48 | pages = 16802–3 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16316223 | doi = 10.1021/ja056455b }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fine structural details were given by Bond ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bond AD, Boese R, Desiraju GR | title = On the polymorphism of aspirin: crystalline aspirin as intergrowths of two &quot;polymorphic&quot; domains | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 618–22 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17139692 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200603373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and [[levetiracetam]] from hot [[acetonitrile]]. The form II is only stable at 100{{Spaces}}[[Kelvin|K]] and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) [[methyl]] proton to [[carbonyl]] [[hydrogen bond]]s, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the [[carboxylic acid]] groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Discovery of the mechanism===
In 1971, British [[pharmacologist]] [[John Robert Vane]], then employed by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[thromboxane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vane JR | title = Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis as a mechanism of action for aspirin-like drugs | journal = Nature | volume = 231 | issue = 25 | pages = 232–5 | date = June 1971 | pmid = 5284360 | doi = 10.1038/newbio231232a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vane JR, Botting RM | title = The mechanism of action of aspirin | journal = Thrombosis Research | volume = 110 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 255–8 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 14592543 | doi = 10.1016/S0049-3848(03)00379-7 | url = http://www.eao.chups.jussieu.fr/polys/certifopt/saule_coxib/theme/1vane2003.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228023239/http://www.eao.chups.jussieu.fr/polys/certifopt/saule_coxib/theme/1vane2003.pdf | df = dmy-all | url-status = live | archive-date = 28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], jointly with [[Sune Bergström]] and [[Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1982/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1982 |website=Nobelprize.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627030945/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1982/ |archive-date=27 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme ([[Suicide inhibition]]). This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.

Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in heart attack and stroke prevention |access-date=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archive-date=31 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 40{{nbsp}}mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tohgi H, Konno S, Tamura K, Kimura B, Kawano K | title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin | journal = Stroke | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1400–3 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1412574 | doi = 10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
At least two different types of [[cyclooxygenase|cyclooxygenases]], COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goel A, Aggarwal S, Partap S, Saurabh A, Choudhary | title = Pharmacokinetic solubility and dissolution profile of antiarrythmic drugs. | journal = Int J Pharma Prof Res | date = 2012 | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 592–601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn|date=August 2016}} Newer NSAID drugs, [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;ref name=COX2002/&gt;

However, several COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn from the market, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martínez-González J, Badimon L | title = Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of COX-inhibition: benefits and risks | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 13 | issue = 22 | pages = 2215–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17691994 | doi = 10.2174/138161207781368774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Funk CD, FitzGerald GA | title = COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 470–9 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18030055 | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318157f72d }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

Furthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the [[prostaglandins]], converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a [[lipoxygenase]]-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]] to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to [[specialized proresolving mediators]] such as the aspirin-triggered [[lipoxin]]s, aspirin-triggered [[resolvins]], and aspirin-triggered [[maresin]]s. These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid25895638&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romano M, Cianci E, Simiele F, Recchiuti A | title = Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins in resolution of inflammation | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 760 | pages = 49–63 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25895638 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.03.083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23747022&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N | title = Resolution phase lipid mediators of inflammation: agonists of resolution | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 632–40 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23747022 | pmc = 3732499 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2013.05.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26546723&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 785 | pages = 108–115 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.&lt;ref name=&quot;SomasundaramS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somasundaram S, Sigthorsson G, Simpson RJ, Watts J, Jacob M, Tavares IA, Rafi S, Roseth A, Foster R, Price AB, Wrigglesworth JM, Bjarnason I | title = Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 639–50 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10792129 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x | display-authors = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paul-Clark MJ, Van Cao T, Moradi-Bidhendi N, Cooper D, Gilroy DW | title = 15-epi-lipoxin A4-mediated induction of nitric oxide explains how aspirin inhibits acute inflammation | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 200 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–78 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15238606 | pmc = 2213311 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20040566 | lastauthoramp = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through [[NF-κB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCarty MF, Block KI | title = Preadministration of high-dose salicylates, suppressors of NF-kappaB activation, may increase the chemosensitivity of many cancers: an example of proapoptotic signal modulation therapy | journal = Integrative Cancer Therapies | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 252–68 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16880431 | doi = 10.1177/1534735406291499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NF-κB, a [[transcription factor]] complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawley SA, Fullerton MD, Ross FA, Schertzer JD, Chevtzoff C, Walker KJ, Peggie MW, Zibrova D, Green KA, Mustard KJ, Kemp BE, Sakamoto K, Steinberg GR, Hardie DG | display-authors = 6 | title = The ancient drug salicylate directly activates AMP-activated protein kinase | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6083 | pages = 918–22 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22517326 | pmc = 3399766 | doi = 10.1126/science.1215327 | bibcode = 2012Sci...336..918H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Raffensperger | first = Lisa | name-list-format = vanc |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21718-clues-to-aspirins-anticancer-effects-revealed.html|title=Clues to aspirin's anti-cancer effects revealed|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=19 April 2012|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(12)61073-2|volume=214|issue=2862|page=16|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530020136/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21718-clues-to-aspirins-anticancer-effects-revealed.html|archive-date=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Acetylsalicylic acid is a [[weak acid]], and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the [[acidic]] conditions of the stomach. The increased [[pH]] and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionized. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;RK Ferguson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson RK, Boutros AR | title = Death following self-poisoning with aspirin | journal = JAMA | volume = 213 | issue = 7 | pages = 1186–8 | date = August 1970 | pmid = 5468267 | doi = 10.1001/jama.213.7.1186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FL Kaufman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaufman FL, Dubansky AS | title = Darvon poisoning with delayed salicylism: a case report | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 610–1 | date = April 1972 | pmid = 5013423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy G, Tsuchiya T | title = Salicylate accumulation kinetics in man | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 287 | issue = 9 | pages = 430–2 | date = August 1972 | pmid = 5044917 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197208312870903 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to [[albumin|albumin protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. [[Conjugated system|Conjugation]] with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the ''acyl glucuronide''; the deacetylated conjugate is the ''phenolic glucuronide''. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidney|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), [[gentisic acid]] (&lt; 1%), and [[2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid|2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3342084&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grootveld M, Halliwell B | title = 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid is a product of human aspirin metabolism | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 271–80 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 3342084 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(88)90729-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When small doses (less than 250{{nbsp}}mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Hartwig&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartwig-Otto H | title = Pharmacokinetic considerations of common analgesics and antipyretics | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 5A | pages = 30–7 | date = November 1983 | pmid = 6606362 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(83)90230-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AK Done&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Done AK | title = Salicylate intoxication.

Medicines made from [[willow]] and other [[salicylate]]-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient [[Sumer]] as well as the [[Ebers Papyrus]] from ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|8–13}}&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; Hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt; Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Daniel R. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Aspirin: Turn of the Century Miracle Drug|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aspirin-turn-of-the-century-miracle-drug|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Summer 2009|volume=27|issue= 2|pages=26–30|access-date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to [[salicylic acid]], the active component of willow extract.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|46–55}}

In 1853, chemist [[Charles Frédéric Gerhardt]] treated [[sodium salicylate]] with [[acetyl chloride]] to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time;&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|46–48}} in the second half of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm [[Bayer]] began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|69–75}} By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world.&lt;ref name=MannPlummer1991/&gt;{{rp|27}} The word ''Aspirin'' was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.&lt;ref name=ACS/&gt;

Aspirin's popularity declined after the development of [[paracetamol|acetaminophen/paracetamol]] in 1956 and [[ibuprofen]] in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, [[John Vane]] and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects,&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|226–231}} while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|247–257}} The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in [[clinical research ethics]] and [[guidelines for human subject research]] and US federal law, and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiebinger L | title = Women's health and clinical trials | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 112 | issue = 7 | pages = 973–7 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14523031 | pmc = 198535 | doi = 10.1172/JCI19993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Regular aspirin intake and acute myocardial infarction | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 5905 | pages = 440–3 | date = March 1974 | pmid = 4816857 | pmc = 1633212 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.5905.440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elwood PC, Cochrane AL, Burr ML, Sweetnam PM, Williams G, Welsby E, Hughes SJ, Renton R | display-authors = 6 | title = A randomized controlled trial of acetyl salicylic acid in the secondary prevention of mortality from myocardial infarction | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 5905 | pages = 436–40 | date = March 1974 | pmid = 4593555 | pmc = 1633246 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.5905.436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for [[heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys2008/&gt;{{rp|267–269}}

Bayer lost its trademark for Aspirin in the United States in actions taken between 1918 and 1921 because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of &quot;Aspirin&quot; by other manufacturers without defending the industrial property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Bayer Co. v.

== Veterinary medicine ==
Aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an [[anticoagulant]] or to [[analgesic|relieve pain]] associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or [[osteoarthritis]]. Aspirin should only be given to animals under the direct supervision of a [[veterinarian]], as adverse effects—including gastrointestinal issues—are common. An aspirin overdose in any species may result in [[salicylate poisoning]], characterized by hemorrhaging, seizures, coma, and even death.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/anti-inflammatory-agents/nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs#v3337669|title=Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs: Aspirin|last=Edwards|first=Scott H. | name-list-format = vanc |work=Merck Veterinary Manual|access-date=2018-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218082147/http://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/anti-inflammatory-agents/nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs#v3337669|archive-date=2016-12-18|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cats and dogs ===
Dogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the [[glucuronide]] conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Feline internal medicine secrets|publisher=Hanley &amp; Belfus|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56053-461-7|editor=Lappin, Michael R|location=Philadelphia|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25{{nbsp}}mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/toxicology/toxicities_from_human_drugs/analgesics_toxicity.html|title=Analgesics (toxicity) |publisher=Merck|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150411095033/http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/toxicology/toxicities_from_human_drugs/analgesics_toxicity.html |archive-date=11 April 2015 |url-status=live|access-date=19 January 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating [[Thrombophilia|blood clotting diseases]] in cats is 10{{nbsp}}mg/kg every 48 hours to allow for metabolization.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxcat/toxcat.html|title=Plants poisonous to livestock|publisher=Cornell University Department of Animal Science|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816192109/http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxcat/toxcat.html|archive-date=16 August 2015|url-status=live|access-date=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
