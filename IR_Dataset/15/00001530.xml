Official estimates place the total Ainu population of Japan at 25,000. Unofficial estimates place the total population at 200,000 or higher, as the near-total assimilation of the Ainu into Japanese society has resulted in many individuals with Ainu heritage having no knowledge of their ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poisson, B 2002, p.5&quot;/&gt;

=== Pre-modern ===
Recent research suggests that Ainu culture originated from a merger of the [[Jōmon culture|Jōmon]], [[Okhotsk culture|Okhotsk]] and [[Satsumon culture|Satsumon]] cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato, Takehiro 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sato |first1=Takehiro |year=2007 |title=Origins and genetic features of the Okhotsk people, revealed by ancient mitochondrial DNA analysis |url= |journal=Journal of Human Genetics |volume=52 |issue=7 |pages=618–627 |doi=10.1007/s10038-007-0164-z |pmid=17568987|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early inhabitants did not speak the [[Japanese language]] and were conquered by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] early in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leeming |first1=David |title=The Dictionary of Asian Mythology |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1264, the Ainu invaded the land of the [[Nivkh people]]. The Ainu also started an expedition into the [[Amur region]] which was then controlled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]], resulting in reprisals by [[Mongol invasions of Sakhalin|the Mongols who invaded Sakhalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html |script-title=ja:第59回 交易の民アイヌ Ⅶ 元との戦い |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Asahikawa, Hokkaido|Asahikawa City]] |date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721151652/http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/hakubutsukagaku/museum/syuzo/59-tatakai/59-tatakai.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ainu-assn.or.jp/|title=公益社団法人 北海道アイヌ協会|website=公益社団法人北海道アイヌ協会|language=ja|access-date=2019-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active contact between the [[Yamato people|Wa-jin]] (the ethnically Japanese, also known as Yamato-jin) and the Ainu of [[Ezo]]gashima (now known as [[Hokkaido|Hokkaidō]]) began in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Weiner |editor-first=M. |year=1997 |title=Japan's Minorities: The Illusion of Homogeneity |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-41515-218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ainu formed a society of hunter-gatherers, surviving mainly by hunting and fishing. They followed a religion which was based on natural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu.html |website=[[Nova (American TV series)|NOVA Online]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |title=Island of the Spirits – Origins of the Ainu |accessdate=May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573), disputes between the Japanese and Ainu developed into a war. [[Takeda Nobuhiro]] killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain. Many Ainu were subject to Japanese rule, which led to violent Ainu revolt such as [[Koshamain's Revolt]] in 1456.
[[File:An Aino-Couple, Japan (10795600564).jpg|thumb|An Ainu couple in Japan (1914)]]
During the [[Edo period]] (1601–1868) the Ainu, who controlled the northern island which is now named Hokkaidō, became increasingly involved in trade with the Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island. The [[Tokugawa bakufu]] (feudal government) granted the [[Matsumae clan]] exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period Ainu were forced to import goods from the Japanese, and epidemic diseases such as [[smallpox]] reduced the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion, 1590–1800 |last=Walker |first=Brett |year=2001 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |pages=49–56, 61–71, 172–176 |isbn=978-0-52022-736-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the increased contact created by the trade between the Japanese and the Ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding, it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent Ainu revolts. The most important was [[Shakushain's Revolt]] (1669–1672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the [[Menashi-Kunashir Battle]] in 1789.

From 1799 to 1806, the shogunate took direct control of southern Hokkaidō. Ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten year terms of service, and were enticed with rewards of food and clothing if they agreed to drop their native language and culture and become Japanese. Ainu women were separated from their husbands and forcibly married to Japanese merchants and fishermen, who were told that a taboo forbade them from bringing their wives to Hokkaidō. Women were often tortured if they resisted rape by their new Japanese husbands, and frequently ran away into the mountains. These policies of family separation and forcible assimilation, combined with the impact of smallpox, caused the Ainu population to drop significantly in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewallen |title=The fabric of indigeneity : Ainu identity, gender, and settler colonialism in Japan |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |isbn=978-0826357366 |pages=131–142|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meiji Restoration and later ===
In the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |first=Dinah |last=Shelton |volume=2 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaidō, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Howell |chapter=The Meiji State and the Logic of Ainu 'Protection' |title=New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan |editor-first=Helen |editor-last=Hardacre |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1997 |page=614 |isbn=978-9-00410-735-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture. The Japanese government introduced a variety of social, political, and economic reforms in hope of modernizing the country in the Western style. One innovation involved the annexation of Hokkaidō. Sjöberg quotes Baba's (1890) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:&lt;ref name=&quot;Brett L. Walker 2001, Pages 49-56&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;… The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia. Second … it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class … Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjöberg1993&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labelling the Ainu as &quot;former aborigines&quot;, with the idea they would assimilate—this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Loos |editor-first1=Noel |editor-last2=Osani |editor-first2=Takeshi |year=1993 |title=Indigenous Minorities and Education: Australian and Japanese Perspectives on their Indigenous Peoples, the Ainu, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders |publisher=Sanyusha Publishing Co., Ltd. |location=Tokyo |isbn=978-4-88322-597-2}}{{pn|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.

[[File:AinuBearSacrificeCirca1870.jpg|thumb|Ainu bear-sacrifice. Japanese scroll painting, {{circa|1870}}.]]
The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land—over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Philippa |last=Fogarty |title=Recognition at last for Japan's Ainu |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7437244.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wa-Jin who had decided to move to Hokkaidō, encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island's abundant natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of Western industrial agriculture. While at the time, the process was openly referred to as {{Nihongo|colonization|拓殖|takushoku}}, the notion was later reframed by Japanese elites to the currently common usage ''kaitaku'' ({{Nihongo2|[[:ja:開拓|開拓]]}}), which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the Ainu lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siddle |first=Richard |title=Race, Resistance, and the Ainu of Japan |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |page=51 |isbn=978-0-41513-228-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, factories such as flour mills, beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sjöberg |first=Katarina |year=1993 |title=The Return of the Ainu |series=Studies in Anthropology and History |volume=9 |publisher=Harwood Academic Publishers |location=Switzerland |page=117 |isbn=978-3-71865-401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names, and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=David |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Asia |volume=1 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |page=72 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-684-80617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1899 act was replaced in 1997—until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato, Takehiro 2007&quot; /&gt; It was not until June 6, 2008, that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see [[#Official recognition in Japan|§ Official recognition in Japan]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato, Takehiro 2007&quot; /&gt;

The vast majority of these Wa-Jin men are believed to have compelled Ainu women to partner with them as local wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewallen |first=Ann-Elise |title=The Fabric of Indigeneity: Ainu Identity, Gender, and Settler Colonialism in Japan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d3ErDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=ainu+women+intermarriage#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20women%20intermarriage&amp;f=false|date=October 2016 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |page=133 |isbn=978-0-8263-5737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intermarriage between Japanese and Ainu was actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, [[Oki (musician)|Oki]], born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument ''[[tonkori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/news/article/605230042/ |title=アイヌ⇔ダブ越境！異彩を放つOKIの新作 |language=Japanese |website=HMV Japan |date=May 23, 2006 |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many small towns in the southeastern or [[Hidaka Subprefecture|Hidaka]] region where ethnic Ainu live such as in [[Nibutani]] ([[Ainu language|Ainu]]: ''Niputay''). Many live in [[Sambutsu]] especially, on the eastern coast. In 1966 the number of &quot;pure&quot; Ainu was about 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Honna |first1=Nobuyuki |first2=Hiroko Tina |last2=Tajima |first3=Kunihiko |last3=Minamoto |year=2000 |chapter=Japan |editor-first1=Ho Wah |editor-last1=Kam |editor-first2=Ruth Y.

Their most widely known [[ethnonym]] is derived from the word ''ainu'', which means &quot;human&quot; (particularly as opposed to ''kamui'', divine beings). Ainu also identify themselves as ''Utari'' (&quot;comrade&quot; or &quot;people&quot; in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

On June 6, 2008, the [[Government of Japan]] passed a bipartisan, non-binding resolution calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous to Japan]], and urging an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognized the Ainu people as &quot;an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture&quot;. The government immediately followed with a statement acknowledging its recognition, stating, &quot;The government would like to solemnly accept the historical fact that many Ainu were discriminated against and forced into poverty with the advancement of modernization, despite being legally equal to (Japanese) people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Ito |first=M. |title=Diet officially declares Ainu indigenous |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=June 7, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2015 |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/06/07/national/diet-officially-declares-ainu-indigenous/#.VTtdfZPJZoM}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--
 Though the resolution is historically significant, Hideaki Uemura, professor at [[Keisen University]] in Tokyo and a specialist in indigenous peoples' rights, commented that the motion is &quot;weak in the sense of recognizing historical facts&quot; as the Ainu were &quot;forced&quot; to become Japanese in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes2008&quot; /&gt;
--&gt; In February 2019, the Japanese government consolidated the legal status of the Ainu people by passing a bill which officially recognizes the Ainu as an indigenous people. Furthermore, the bill aims at simplifying procedures for getting various permissions from authorities in regards to the traditional lifestyle of the Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/15/national/japan-recognize-indigenous-ainu-people-first-time/#.XGcfrdJCeUl |title=Japan to recognize indigenous Ainu people for first time |date=February 15, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |accessdate=February 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill passed in April 2019 officially recognized the Ainu of Hokkaidō as an indigenous people of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/asia/japan-ainu-indigenous-peoples-bill-intl/index.html|title=Japan's Ainu will finally be recognized as indigenous people|author=Emiko Jozuka|website=CNN|access-date=2019-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Asahi Shimbun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201903040040.html|title=Ainu seek to showcase culture at 2020 Opening Ceremony|website=Asahi Shimbun|access-date=2020-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ainu were due to participate in the opening ceremony of the [[Olympic games 2020]] in Japan, but due to logisitcal constraints this was dropped in February 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/tokyo-olympics-dance-by-japans-indigenous-people-dropped-from-opening-ceremony|title=Tokyo Olympics: dance by Japan's indigenous people dropped from opening ceremony|website=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space will open on April 24, 2020, prior to the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled in the same year, in [[Shiraoi, Hokkaido|Shiraoi]], Hokkaidō.

As a result of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]], the Kuril Islands – along with their Ainu inhabitants – came under Japanese administration. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on September 18, 1877, after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the [[Commander Islands]]. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881, the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin on foot. Four months later they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino, was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian-dominated Zaporozhye rural settlement in [[Ust-Bolsheretsky District|Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcIErWxe16k |script-title=ru:Камчадальские айны добиваются признания |trans-title=Kamchadal Ainu seek recognition |author=vostokmediaTV |date=March 21, 2011 |website=YouTube |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the [[Kamchadals|Kamchadal]] community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the USSR, banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;kamchatka-etno&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kamchatka-etno.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=95 |script-title=ru:Айны |trans-title=Ainu |year=2008 |website=Kamchatka-Etno |language=ru |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623191226/http://www.kamchatka-etno.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=95 |archivedate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of |2015}}, the North Kuril Ainu of Zaporozhye form the largest Ainu subgroup in Russia. The Nakamura clan (South Kuril Ainu on their paternal side), the smallest group, numbers just six people residing in [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky|Petropavlovsk]]. On Sakhalin island, a few dozen people identify themselves as Sakhalin Ainu, but many more with partial Ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it. Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are of mixed Japanese–Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.5-tv.ru/news/37800/ |script-title=ru:В России снова появились айны - самый загадочный народ Дальнего востока |trans-title=In Russia, the Ainu appear again - the most mysterious people of the Far East |date=March 22, 2011 |work=5-tv.ru |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Similarly, no one identifies themselves as Amur Valley Ainu, although people with partial descent live in Khabarovsk.

Omoto has suggested that the Ainu are more closely related to other [[phenotype|phenotypically]] East Asian people (i.e. people previously described using the now-deprecated term &quot;Mongoloid&quot;), than to phenotypically [[West Eurasia]]n or [[Caucasoid]] (previously &quot;Caucasian&quot;) people – on the basis of fingerprints and [[dental morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FrwNcwKaUKoC&amp;pg=PA232|title=The History and Geography of Human Genes|last1=Cavalli-Sforza|first1=Luigi Luca|last2=Menozzi|first2=Paolo|last3=Piazza|first3=Alberto|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-691-08750-4|location=New Jersey|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Joseph Powell (1999) of the [[University of New Mexico]] wrote &quot;... we follow Brace and Hunt (1990) and Turner (1990) in viewing the Ainu as a southeast Asian population derived from early Jomon peoples of Japan, who have their closest biological affinity with South Asians rather than western Eurasian peoples&quot;.

[[Mark J. Hudson]], Professor of Anthropology at [[Nishikyushu University]], [[Kanzaki, Saga]], Japan, has stated that Japan was settled by a &quot;Proto-Mongoloid&quot; population in the [[Pleistocene]] who became the Jōmon and that their features can be seen in the Ainu and [[Ryukyuans|Okinawan]] people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Hudson |first= Mark J. |year= 1999 |title= Ruins of Identity: Ethnogenesis in the Japanese Islands |location= Honolulu |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |isbn= 978-0-82481-930-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dental morphology study shows the Jōmon and Ainu have their own dental structure, but are generally closer to the [[Sundadont]] groups which is more common in Southeast Asia and Taiwan (Turner, 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Anthropological Science: Journal of the Anthropological Society of Nippon, Volume 101 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=avyZAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The+Jomon+and+Ainu+are+classified+as+a+sundadont+group+together+with+Southeast+Asian+peoples+in+dental+morphology+%28Turner%2C+1990%29.&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=sundadont+group+]{{full|date=February 2020}}{{pn|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, anthropologist [[Arnold Henry Savage Landor]] described the Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, with a large and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to [[baldness]], slightly hook nose with large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek-bones and a medium mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Landor |first= Arnold Henry Savage |year= 1893 |title= Alone with the Hairy Ainu: or, 3,800 Miles on a Pack Saddle in Yezo and a Cruise to the Kurile Islands |url= https://archive.org/details/alonewithhairyai00land |location= London |publisher= John Murray |pages= [https://archive.org/details/alonewithhairyai00land/page/229 229–230]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ainu men have abundant wavy hair and often have long beards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ohnuki-Tierney |first= Emiko |title= Illness and healing among the Sakhalin Ainu: a symbolic interpretation |year= 1981 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-23636-2 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=OTo9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA19 |page= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book of ''Ainu Life and Legends'' by author Kyōsuke Kindaichi (published by the Japanese Tourist Board in 1942) contains a physical description of Ainu: &quot;Many have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them.&quot;

A craniometric study by Brace et al. (2001) shows a closer morphological relation of the Ainu and Jōmon people to prehistoric and modern [[Europeans]] rather than to other contemporary [[East Asian]]s. The study concludes that the Jōmon and Ainu people are descendants of a population (dubbed &quot;Eurasians&quot; by Brace et al.) that moved into northern Eurasia (and also the Americas) in the [[Late Pleistocene]], which significantly predates the expansion of the modern [[East Asian people|core population of East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brace |first1=C. Loring |last2=Nelson |first2=A.

Another study (Kura et al. 2014) based on cranial and genetic characteristics suggests a northern origin for the Ainu people. The study results and genetic evidence suggest the [[Arctic]] regions of [[Eurasia]] as possible original homeland of the ancestral population of the northern Jōmon and Ainu people. The Jōmon people are considered to be a people of northern ancestry and belong mostly to [[Haplogroup D-M55|Haplogroup D2 (D-M55 branch)]] which characterizes the northern people of Asia. Thus, despite their morphological similarities to [[Caucasoid]] populations, the Ainu are essentially of North Asiatic origin. Genetic evidence support a relation with Arctic populations, such as the [[Chukchi people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kura |first1=Kenya |last2=Armstrong |first2=Elijah L. |last3=Templer |first3=Donald I. |title=Cognitive function among the Ainu people |journal=Intelligence |date=May 2014 |volume=44 |pages=149–154 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2014.04.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hairy Ainu man Mongoloid.png|left|thumb|[[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]] took a picture of this Ainu man, who Batchelor said had hair completely covering his body.]]

Recent anthropologic studies suggest that the Jōmon people were not a homogenous group. While the majority of the northern Jōmon in Hokkaidō and Honshū show Ainu-like phenotypes, the southern-Jōmon on the Kyushu, Shikoku and parts of southern Honshu show similarities to [[neo-Mongoloid|Mongoloid]] phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;上田正昭他『日本古代史の謎再考（エコール・ド・ロイヤル 古代日本を考える１）』 学生社 1983年 pp.52より&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paternal lineages ====
Genetic testing has shown that the Ainu belong mainly to [[Haplogroup D-M55|Y-haplogroup D-M55]] (D1a2) and [[Haplogroup C-M217|C-M217]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tajima20042&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tajima|first=Atsushi|display-authors=etal|year=2004|title=Genetic origins of the Ainu inferred from combined DNA analyses of maternal and paternal lineages|url=|journal=Journal of Human Genetics|volume=49|issue=4|pages=187–193|doi=10.1007/s10038-004-0131-x|pmid=14997363|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y-DNA haplogroup D-M55 is found throughout the [[Japanese Archipelago]], but with very high frequencies among the Ainu of Hokkaidō in the far north, and to a lesser extent among the [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]] in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] of the far south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf|title=Y Haplogroups of the World Map|last=McDonald|first=J.

The split between [[Haplogroup D-Z27276|D1a1]] (which is common in [[Tibet]] and has a medium distribution in Central Asia) happened likely in Central Asia, while some others suggest an instant split during the origin of haplogroup D itself, as the Japanese branch has five unique mutations not found in any other D-branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mondal |first1=Mayukh |last2=Bergström |first2=Anders |last3=Xue |first3=Yali |last4=Calafell |first4=Francesc |last5=Laayouni |first5=Hafid |last6=Casals |first6=Ferran |last7=Majumder |first7=Partha P. |last8=Tyler-Smith |first8=Chris |last9=Bertranpetit |first9=Jaume |title=Y-chromosomal sequences of diverse Indian populations and the ancestry of the Andamanese |journal=Human Genetics |date=25 April 2017 |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=499–510 |doi=10.1007/s00439-017-1800-0 |pmid=28444560 |hdl=10230/34399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies (Hammer et al. 2006, Shinoda 2008, Matsumoto 2009, Cabrera et al. 2018) suggest that the paternal lineage of the Ainu and the [[Paleolithic]] [[Jōmon people|Jōmon population]] originated somewhere in [[Central Asia]]. According to Hammer et al., the ancestral haplogroup D originated between Tibet and the Altai mountains. He suggests that there were multiple waves into Eastern Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matsumoto |first1=Hideo |title=The origin of the Japanese race based on genetic markers of immunoglobulin G |journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B |date=2009 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.2183/pjab.85.69 |pmid=19212099 |pmc=3524296 |bibcode=2009PJAB...85...69M }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Nivkhs and Ainu men.jpg|left|thumb|1862 illustration of an Ainu man (left) and a [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]] couple (right)]]

(2009), who have studied the mtDNA of the same sample of modern Ainus (n=51), the major haplogroups of the Ainu are N9 (14/51 = 27.5%, including 10/51 Y and 4/51 N9(xY)), D (12/51 = 23.5%, including 8/51 D(xD5) and 4/51 D5), M7 (10/51 = 19.6%), and G (10/51 = 19.6%, including 8/51 G1 and 2/51 G2); the minor haplogroups are A (2/51), B (1/51), F (1/51), and M(xM7, M8, CZ, D, G) (1/51).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sato2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1537/ase.081202|title = Mitochondrial DNA haplogrouping of the Okhotsk people based on analysis of ancient DNA: An intermediate of gene flow from the continental Sakhalin people to the Ainu| journal=Anthropological Science| volume=117| issue=3| pages=171–180|year = 2009|last1 = Sato|first1 = Takehiro| last2=Amano| first2=Tetsuya| last3=Ono| first3=Hiroko| last4=Ishida| first4=Hajime| last5=Kodera| first5=Haruto| last6=Matsumura| first6=Hirofumi| last7=Yoneda| first7=Minoru| last8=Masuda| first8=Ryuichi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Autosomal DNA ====
A 2004 reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the Jōmon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shigematsu2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Shigematsu |first= Masahito |year= 2004 |title= Morphological affinities between Jomon and Ainu: Reassessment based on nonmetric cranial traits |journal= Anthropological Science |volume= 112 |issue= 2 |pages= 161–172 |doi= 10.1537/ase.00092 |url= |quote= |display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with the references to the Ainu as a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon referenced above. Nevertheless, a newer genome study shows that the Ainu share most of their genome with the Hokkaidō Jōmon and it is suggested that the Okhotsk received strong Jōmon influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jinam |first1=Timothy A |last2=Kanzawa-Kiriyama |first2=Hideaki |last3=Inoue |first3=Ituro |last4=Tokunaga |first4=Katsushi |last5=Omoto |first5=Keiichi |last6=Saitou |first6=Naruya |title=Unique characteristics of the Ainu population in Northern Japan |journal=Journal of Human Genetics |date=16 July 2015 |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=565–571 |doi=10.1038/jhg.2015.79 |pmid=26178428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okhotsk.org/news/oho-tukujin.html|title=オホーツク人|website=www.okhotsk.org|access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hideo Matsumoto (2009) suggested, based on immunoglobulin analyses, that the Ainu (and Jōmon) have a Siberian origin. Compared with other East Asian populations, the Ainu have the highest amount of Siberian (immunoglobulin) components, higher than mainland Japanese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matsumoto |first1=Hideo |title=The origin of the Japanese race based on genetic markers of immunoglobulin G |journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy. Series B, Physical and Biological Sciences |date=2009 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=69–82 |doi=10.2183/pjab.85.69 |pmid=19212099 |pmc=3524296 |bibcode=2009PJAB...85...69M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 genetic study has revealed that the closest genetic relatives of the Ainu are the [[Ryukyuan people]], followed by the [[Yamato people]] and [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Suzuki&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.asianscientist.com/2012/12/in-the-lab/ryukyuan-ainu-people-genetically-similar-2012/ |title=Ryukyuan, Ainu People Genetically Similar |first=Yuka |last=Suzuki |journal=Asian Scientist |date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic analysis in 2016 showed that although the Ainu have some genetic relations to the Japanese people and Eastern Siberians (especially [[Itelmens]] and [[Chukchi people|Chukchis]]), they are not closely related to any modern ethnic group. Further, the study detected genetic contribution from the Ainu to populations around the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] but no genetic influence on the Ainu themselves. According to the study, the Ainu-like genetic contribution in the [[Ulch people]] is about 17.8% or 13.5% and about 27.2% in the [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]]. The study also disproved the idea about a relation to [[Andamanese]] or [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]; instead, it presented evidence of gene flow between the Ainu and “lowland East Asian farmer populations” (represented in the study by the [[Amis people|Ami]] and [[Atayal people|Atayal]] in Taiwan, and the [[Dai people|Dai]] and [[Lahu people|Lahu]] in Mainland East Asia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jeong |first1=Choongwon |last2=Nakagome |first2=Shigeki |last3=Di Rienzo |first3=Anna |title=Deep History of East Asian Populations Revealed Through Genetic Analysis of the Ainu |journal=Genetics |date=January 2016 |volume=202 |issue=1 |pages=261–272 |doi=10.1534/genetics.115.178673 |pmid=26500257 |pmc=4701090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison with the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data of [[HGDP]] (Human Genome Diversity Panel) populations also showed the unique status of the Sanganji Jōmon despite being relatively closer to the East Eurasian cluster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanzawa-Kiriyama |first1=Hideaki |last2=Kryukov |first2=Kirill |last3=Jinam |first3=Timothy A |last4=Hosomichi |first4=Kazuyoshi |last5=Saso |first5=Aiko |last6=Suwa |first6=Gen |last7=Ueda |first7=Shintaroh |last8=Yoneda |first8=Minoru |last9=Tajima |first9=Atsushi |last10=Shinoda |first10=Ken-ichi |last11=Inoue |first11=Ituro |last12=Saitou |first12=Naruya |title=A partial nuclear genome of the Jomons who lived 3000 years ago in Fukushima, Japan |journal=Journal of Human Genetics |date=February 2017 |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=213–221 |doi=10.1038/jhg.2016.110 |pmid=27581845 |pmc=5285490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are far apart from all modern East Eurasians. The uniqueness of the Sanganji Jōmon within East Eurasians is consistent with the results including Europeans and Africans. When the Ainu, the mainland Japanese and the Ryukyuans from the Japanese Archipelago and CHB28 (Chinese from Beijing) were compared with Sanganji Jōmon, PC1 separated the Ainu and Sanganji Jōmon from the other populations. The population closest to the Sanganji Jōmon was the Ainu, followed by the Ryukyuan and then the mainland Japanese (Yamato). The study also implies genetic affinity between the Jōmon and [[Neanderthal|Altai-Neanderthals]] but the degree is not much different than other non-African populations. Compared with other East-Eurasians, the Jōmon lacked similarities with [[Denisovan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kanzawa-Kiriyama |first1=Hideaki |last2=Kryukov |first2=Kirill |last3=Jinam |first3=Timothy A |last4=Hosomichi |first4=Kazuyoshi |last5=Saso |first5=Aiko |last6=Suwa |first6=Gen |last7=Ueda |first7=Shintaroh |last8=Yoneda |first8=Minoru |last9=Tajima |first9=Atsushi |last10=Shinoda |first10=Ken-ichi |last11=Inoue |first11=Ituro |last12=Saitou |first12=Naruya |title=A partial nuclear genome of the Jomons who lived 3000 years ago in Fukushima, Japan |journal=Journal of Human Genetics |date=1 September 2016 |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=213–221 |doi=10.1038/jhg.2016.110 |pmid=27581845 |pmc=5285490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic analyses of HLA I and HLA II genes as well as HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 gene frequencies links the Ainu to some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], especially to populations on the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Pacific Northwest Coast]] such as [[Tlingit]]. The scientists suggest that the main ancestor of the Ainu and of some Native American groups can be traced back to [[Paleolithic]] groups in [[Southern Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tokunaga |first1=Katsushi |last2=Ohashi |first2=Jun |last3=Bannai |first3=Makoto |last4=Juji |first4=Takeo |title=Genetic link between Asians and native Americans: evidence from HLA genes and haplotypes |journal=Human Immunology |date=September 2001 |volume=62 |issue=9 |pages=1001–1008 |doi=10.1016/S0198-8859(01)00301-9 |pmid=11543902 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military service ==

==== Russo-Japanese War ====
Ainu men were first recruited into the Japanese military in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Yoshimi |last=Yoshiaki |year=2015 |orig-year=1987 |title=Grassroots Fascism: The War Experience of the Japanese People |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Dn0yBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Weatherhead Books on Asia |translator=Ethan Mark |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=127 |isbn=9780231538596 |oclc=1047893815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-four Ainu served in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), eight of whom died in battle or from illness contracted during military service. Two received the [[Order of the Golden Kite]], granted for bravery, leadership or command in battle.

==== Second World War ====
During [[World War II]], Australian troops engaged in the hard-fought [[Kokoda Track campaign]] (July–November 1942) in [[New Guinea]], were surprised by the physique and fighting prowess of the first Japanese troops they encountered.

{{quotation|During that day's fighting [30 August 1942] we saw many Japanese of large physique, powerfully built men of six feet and over. These tough assault troops came from Hokkaidō, a northern Japanese island of freezing winters, where the bears roamed freely. They were known in their own country as &quot;[[Dosanko]]&quot; a name for horses from Hokkaidō, and they withstood splendidly the harsh climate of the [[Owen Stanley Range]]. A 2/14th Battalion officer said to me: &quot;I couldn't believe it when I saw these big bastards bearing down on us.

In 2008 Hohmann gave an estimate of fewer than 100 remaining speakers of the language;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hohmann |first= S. |year= 2008 |title= The Ainu's modern struggle |journal= World Watch |volume= 21 |number= 6 |pages= 20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; other research (Vovin 1993) placed the number at fewer than 15 speakers.

Despite the small number of native speakers of Ainu, there is an active movement to [[Language revitalization|revitalize]] the language, mainly in Hokkaidō, but also elsewhere such as [[Kantō region|Kanto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;martin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=Kylie |title=特集 超国家的枠組、標準化、ネットワーク化--ヨーロッパ、日本、アフリカの組織的多様性マネージメント |trans-title=Aynu itak: on the road to Ainu language revitalization |language=Japanese |journal=Media and Communication Studies |date=2011 |volume=60 |pages=57–93 |id={{NCID|AA12286697}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainu oral literature has been documented both in hopes of safeguarding it for future generations, as well as using it as a teaching tool for language learners.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10271487|title=Vanishing Languages of the Pacific Rim|date=2007-01-01|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191532894|location=Oxford, GB|pages=377–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of 2011 there has been an increasing number of second-language learners, especially in Hokkaidō, in large part due to the pioneering efforts of the late Ainu folklorist, activist and former [[Japanese Diet|Diet]] member [[Shigeru Kayano]], himself a native speaker, who first opened an Ainu language school in 1987 funded by [[Ainu Kyokai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Okazaki, T 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teeter |first1=Jennifer Louise |last2=Okazaki |first2=Takayuki |title=Ainu as a Heritage Language of Japan: History, Current State and Future of Ainu Language Policy and Education |journal=Heritage Language Journal |date=2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=96–114 |id={{ERIC|EJ937154}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some researchers have attempted to show that the Ainu language and the Japanese language are related, modern scholars have rejected the idea that the relationship goes beyond contact (such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu). No attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and linguists currently classify Ainu as a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shibatani&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sD-MFTUiPYgC&amp;pg=PA3|title=The Languages of Japan|last=Shibatani|first=Masayoshi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-521-36918-3|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Ainu people speak either the [[Japanese language]] or the [[Russian language]].

Concepts expressed with [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (such as ''to'', ''from'', ''by'', ''in'', and ''at'') in [[English language|English]] appear as postpositional forms in Ainu (postpositions come after the word that they modify). A single sentence in Ainu can comprise many added or [[agglutinate]]d sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas.

The Ainu language has had no indigenous system of writing, and has historically been transliterated using the Japanese [[kana]] or [[Russian alphabet|Russian Cyrillic]]. {{As of | 2019}} it is typically written either in [[katakana]] or in the [[Latin alphabet]].

Many of the Ainu dialects, even those from different extremities of Hokkaidō, were not mutually intelligible; however, all Ainu speakers understood the classic Ainu language of the [[Yukar]], or epic stories. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales being committed to memory and related at gatherings which often lasted many hours or even days.&lt;ref&gt;

Traditional Ainu culture was quite different from [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full [[beard]]s and [[moustache]]s. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women [[tattoo]]ed their mouths, and sometimes the [[forearm]]s. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional [[Clothing|dress]] was a robe spun from the inner bark of the [[elm]] tree, called ''attusi'' or ''attush''. Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.&lt;ref name= &quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ainu |volume=1|pages=441–442}} Citations:

Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of [[bear meat|bear]], fox, [[wolf]], [[badger]], [[ox]], or [[horse meat|horse]], as well as fish, [[fowl]], [[millet]], vegetables, herbs, and [[root]]s.

Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (''[[Iris pseudacorus]]''); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets.

The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. [[Corporal punishment|Beating]] was considered a sufficient and final penalty.

=== Hunting ===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Local Customs of the Ainu.jpg|thumb|Bear-hunting, 19th century]]

==== Fishing ====
Fishing was important for the Ainu. They largely caught trout, primarily in summer, and salmon in autumn, as well as “ito” (Japanese huchen), dace and other fish. Spears called &quot;''marek''&quot; were often used. Other methods were &quot;''tesh''&quot; fishing, &quot;''uray''&quot; fishing and &quot;''rawomap''&quot; fishing. Many villages were built near rivers or along the coast. Each village or individual had a definite river fishing territory. Outsiders could not freely fish there and needed to ask the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng04.html|title=Ainu History and Culture|website=www.ainu-museum.or.jp|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornaments ===
Men wore a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] called ''sapanpe'' for important ceremonies. ''Sapanpe'' was made from wood fibre with bundles of partially shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Service2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Japan |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6z1vkF0xzHcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=matanpushi#v=onepage&amp;q=matanpushi&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Social Studies School Service |isbn=978-1-56004-256-3 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men carried an ''emush'' (ceremonial sword)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4oRxAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=ainu+emush&amp;q=emush |title=Ainu: Spirit of a Northern People |last1=Fitzhugh |first1=William W. |last2=Dubreuil |first2=Chisato O. |year=1999 |publisher=Arctic Studies Center, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution in association with University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-96734-290-0 |location= |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; secured by an ''emush at'' strap to their shoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BtszAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ainu+emush+at&amp;q=emush |title=Tribal: The Magazine of Tribal Art |last= |first= |year=2003 |publisher=Primedia Inc. |isbn= |location= |pages=76 &amp; 78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women wore ''matanpushi'', embroidered headbands, and ''ninkari'', earrings. ''Ninkari'' was a metal ring with a ball. ''Matanpushi'' and ''ninkari'' were originally worn by men. Furthermore, aprons called ''maidari'' now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore ''maidari''.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Women sometimes wore a bracelet called ''tekunkani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng08.html |title=Ainu History and Culture |website=Ainu Museum |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women wore a necklace called ''rektunpe'', a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques.&lt;ref name=&quot;Service2006&quot; /&gt; They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a ''[[tamasay]]'' or ''shitoki'', usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent.

[[File:平村ペンリウク翁.jpg|thumb|Ainu house]]
A village is called a ''kotan'' in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in [[river basins]] and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which [[salmon]] went upstream. A village consisted basically of a [[Patrilineality|paternal]] [[clan]]. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were [[forced labor|forced to labor]] at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

''Cise'' or ''cisey'' (houses) in a kotan were made of [[cogon|cogon grass]], [[bamboo|bamboo grass]], [[bark (botany)|bark]], etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the &quot;rorun-puyar,&quot; a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called ''shiso'') . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called ''harkiso''). The house had a platform for valuables called ''iyoykir'' behind the shiso. The Ainu placed ''sintoko'' (hokai) and ''ikayop'' (quivers) there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called ''ashinru'' and for women called ''menokoru'', a ''pu'' (storehouse) for food, a &quot;heper set&quot; (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (''nusasan'') faced the east side of the house (''rorunpuyar''). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as ''[[Iyomante]]'', a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

=== Traditions ===
The Ainu people had various types of [[marriage]]. A child was promised in [[arranged marriage|marriage by arrangement]] between his or her parents and the parents of his or her [[betrothal|betrothed]] or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a [[marriageable age]], they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=f3EIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=ainu+marriage#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage&amp;f=false |title=The Ainu and their folk-lore |last=Batchelor |first=John |year=1901 |publisher=The Religious Tract Society |location=London |page=223|isbn=9785871451199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called ''tunpu'' annexed to the southern wall of her house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iiADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=ainu+marriage+house#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20marriage%20house&amp;f=false |title=Ainu Family Life and Religion |first=J.

The age of marriage was 17 to 18 years of age for men and 15 to 16 years of age for women,&lt;ref name=&quot;Service2006&quot; /&gt; who were [[tattoo]]ed.

When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Service2006&quot; /&gt; When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts.

The worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from [[gods]] of illness and [[demons]] due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, they were given a [[decoction]] of the endodermis of [[alder]] and the roots of [[butterburs]] to discharge impurities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sILrJPM4DFAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA110&amp;dq=ainu+decoction+alder#v=onepage&amp;q=ainu%20decoction%20alder&amp;f=false |title=Early European Writings on Ainu Culture: Religion and Folklore |last=Refsing |first=Kirsten |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-70071-486-5 |location= |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as ''attush'', until coming of age.

[[File:Iomante2.JPG|thumb|left|Ainu traditional ceremony, c. 1930]]

The Ainu are traditionally [[Animism|animist]]s, believing that everything in nature has a ''[[kamuy]]'' (spirit or god) on the inside. The most important include [[Kamuy Fuchi]], goddess of the hearth, [[Kim-un Kamuy]], god of bears and mountains, and [[Repun Kamuy]], god of the sea, fishing, and marine animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng10.html|title=Ainu History and Culture|website=www.ainu-museum.or.jp|access-date=2019-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ainu have no priests by profession; instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies are confined to making [[libation]]s of [[Sake|saké]], saying [[prayers]], and offering [[willow]] sticks with wooden shavings attached to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt; These sticks are called ''[[inaw]]'' (singular) and ''nusa'' (plural).

They are placed on an altar used to &quot;send back&quot; the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called ''[[Iyomante]]''. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of [[Illness|sickness]]. They believe that their spirits are [[Immortality|immortal]], and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to ''kamuy mosir'' (Land of the Gods).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot; /&gt;

The Ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice &quot;arctolatry&quot; or [[Bear worship|bear-worship]]. The Ainu believe that the bear is very special because they think that the bear is Kim-un Kamuy's way of delivering the gift of the bear's hide and meat to humans.

John Batchelor reported that the Ainu view the world as being a spherical ocean on which float many islands, a view based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. He wrote that they believe the world rests on the back of a large fish, which when it moves causes earthquakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batchelor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batchelor|first1=John|title=The Ainu and their folk-lore|date=1901|publisher=The Religious Tract Society|location=London|pages=51–52|url=https://archive.org/stream/ainuandtheirfol00batcgoog#page/n84/mode/2up/search/round|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ainu assimilated into mainstream Japanese society have adopted [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] and [[Shinto|Shintō]], while some northern Ainu were converted as members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Regarding Ainu communities in [[Shikotanto]]（色丹と）and other areas that fall within the Russian sphere of cultural influence, there have been cases of church construction as well as reports that some Ainu have decided to profess their Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/lcs/kiyou/19-1/RitsIILCS_19.1pp.43-55Fumoto.pdf 北千島アイヌの改宗政策について] - [[立命館大学]]&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports that the Russian Orthodox Church has performed some missionary projects in the [[Sakhalin]] Ainu community. However, not many people have converted and there are only reports of several persons who have converted. Converts have been scorned as &quot;Nutsa Ainu&quot; (Russian Ainu) by other members of the Ainu community. Even so, the reports indiciate that many Ainu have kept their faith in the deities of ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no11/potapova.pdf 樺太における宗教活動 北海道大学] スラブ研究センター ポタポワH.B.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 survey conducted by [[Hokkaido University|Hokkaidō University]], a high percentage of Ainu are members of their household family religion which is Buddhism (especially [[Nichiren Shōshū]] Buddhism). However, it is pointed out that similar to the Japanese religious consciousness, there is not a strong feeling of identification with a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no11/potapova.pdf 樺太における宗教活動 北海道大学] スラブ研究センター ポタポワH.B]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ainu promotion center, Sapporo.JPG|thumb|Ainu cultural promotion centre and museum, in [[Sapporo]] (Sapporo Pirka Kotan)]]

Most Hokkaidō Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the [[Hokkaido Utari Association|Hokkaidō Utari Association]]. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese [[nation-state]]. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.

Other key institutions include ''The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC)'', set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaidō University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cais.hokudai.ac.jp/english/ |title=Center for Ainu &amp; Indigenous Studies |website=Hokkaido University |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers. Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.&lt;!-- Links to these organizations needed, also Tokyo Ainu documentary --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2kamuymintara.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/eng/top.htm |title=Documentary Film &quot;TOKYO Ainu&quot; |website=www.2kamuymintara.com |accessdate=September 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.2kamuymintara.com/film/groups.htm |title=ドキュメンタリー映画　TOKYO アイヌ　首都圏アイヌ団体紹介 |website=www.2kamuymintara.com |accessdate=September 30, 2017 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2011, the Ainu have cultural exchange and cultural cooperation with the [[Sámi people]] of northern Europe. Both the Sámi and the Ainu participate in the organization for Arctic indigenous peoples and the Sámi research office in [[Lapland (Finland)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcticcentre.org/EN/News?ln=nxqdhzo3&amp;id=c6d2c468-e74a-49e1-8412-89fdae3b22f9|title=Joint seminar for Sami and Ainu research|website=www.arcticcentre.org|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Litigation ===
On March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the [[Saru River]] watershed in southern Hokkaidō. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Levin |ssrn=1635451 |title=Essential Commodities and Racial Justice: Using Constitutional Protection of Japan's Indigenous Ainu People to Inform Understandings of the United States and Japan |journal=New York University Journal of International Law and Politics |volume=33 |pages=445–446 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to [[Nibutani]] village,&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkLevin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1635447 |first=Mark |last=Levin |year=1999 |title=Kayano et al. v. Hokkaido Expropriation Committee: 'The Nibutani Dam Decision' |journal=International Legal Materials |volume=38 |page=394|doi=10.1017/S0020782900013061}}&lt;/ref&gt; the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history.{{sfnp|Levin|2001|pages=419, 447}} In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and [[Shigeru Kayano|Kayano Shigeru]]—well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community.{{sfnp|Levin|2001|page=443}} After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaidō Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaidō Development Bureau.

The final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkLevin&quot; /&gt;{{rp|442}} The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wa-Jin in the case and discussions about the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkLevin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn=1551462 |first=Mark |last=Levin |title=The Wajin's Whiteness: Law and Race Privilege in Japan |journal=Hōritsu Jihō |volume=80 |number=2 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;japan_con&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of Japan (November 3, 1946) |url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Japan/English/english-Constitution.html |website=Solon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two weeks later.

=== Governmental advisory boards ===
Much national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as {{Nihongo4||審議会|shingikai}} in Japanese. One such committee operated in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Citation to Siddle's book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Siddle |first=Richard |title=Race, Resistance, and the Ainu of Japan |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-41513-228-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law.&lt;ref name=&quot;ainushinpou&quot; /&gt; This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citation to Siddle's book&quot; /&gt;

More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included. It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The Ainu Association of Hokkaidō reported that Kayano Shiro, the son of the former Ainu leader Kayano Shigeru, will head the party. Their aim is to contribute to the realization of a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and [[Polyethnicity|multiethnic]] society in Japan, along with rights for the Ainu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111031a5.html |title=Ainu plan group for Upper House run |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=October 31, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427092145/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111031a5.html |archivedate=April 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/1029/TKY201110290538.html |script-title=ja:参議院選挙 |trans-title=House of Councillors election |newspaper=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709010224/http://www.asahi.com/national/update/1029/TKY201110290538.html |archivedate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard of living ===
The Ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government as well as people since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion, 1590–1800 |last=Walker |first=Brett |year=2001 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |page=233 |isbn=978-0-52022-736-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaidō into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan's Minorities |last=Siddle |first=Richard |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-13008-0 |location=London |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the right to speak their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigweb.org/youth-media/panorama/article.html?ContentID=3609 |title=Will the Ainu language die? |date=May 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |website=TalkingITGlobal |last=Shim |first=Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/bjrenquan/190878.htm |title=Human Right Issues on the Ainu People in Japan |date= |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |website=China.org |last=Yokoyama |first=Yuzuru}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaidō in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had an 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaidō as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap.

The traditional locations of the Ainu are [[Hokkaido]], [[Sakhalin]], the [[Kuril Islands]], [[Kamchatka]], and the northern [[Tohoku region]]. Many of the place names that remain in [[Hokkaido]] and the [[Kuril Islands]] have a phonetic equivalent of the Ainu place names.&lt;ref name=jpn-Ainu-wiki&gt;Information from the Japanese wiki page about the Ainu&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1756 CE, Mitsugu Nyui was a Bank Accountant ([[Kanjō-bugyō]]) of the [[Hirosaki Domain]] in the [[Tsugaru Peninsula]]. He implemented an assimilation policy for Ainu who were engaged in fishing in the [[Tsugaru Peninsula]]. Since then, Ainu culture was rapidly lost from [[Honshu]].&lt;ref name=jpn-Ainu-wiki /&gt;

After the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]], most of the Ainu from the [[Kuril islands]] were moved to the island [[Shikotan]] by persuading the pioneers for difficult life supplies and for defense purposes (Kurishima Cruise Diary).&lt;ref name=jpn-Ainu-wiki /&gt;

In 1945, the [[Soviet Union]] invaded [[Japan]] and occupied [[Sakhalin]] and the [[Kuril Islands]]. The Ainu who lived there were repatriated to their home country, Japan, except for those who indicated their willingness to remain.&lt;ref&gt;「昭和21年（1946年）12月19日、東京でデレヴャンコ中将と日本における連合国軍最高司令官代表ポール・J・ミューラー中将が、ソ連領とのその支配下にある地域からの日本人捕虜と民間人の本国送還問題に関する協定に署名した。協定では、日本人捕虜と民間人はソ連領とその支配下のある地域から本国送還されなければならない、と記されていた。日本市民はソ連領から自由意志の原則に基づいて帰還することが特に但し書きされていた。」（ネットワークコミュニティきたみ・[http://www.city.kitami.lg.jp/650-03/100/nupunkesi100.htm 市史編さんニュース №100 ヌプンケシ]{{リンク切れ|date=2018年3月 |bot=InternetArchiveBot}} 平成17年1月15日発行）&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
{{See also|Ainu in Russia}}

The [[Demographic history of Japan before the Meiji Restoration|population of the Ainu during the Edo period]] was a maximum of 26,800, but it has declined due to the epidemic of infectious diseases since it was regarded as a Tenryō territory.

According to the 1897 Russian census, 1,446 Ainu native speakers lived in Russian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=o |title=Демоскоп Weekly - Приложение.

Currently, there are no Ainu items in the Japanese national census, and no fact-finding has been conducted at national institutions. Therefore, the exact number of Ainu people is unknown. However, multiple surveys were conducted that provide an indication of the total population.

According to a 2006 Hokkaido Agency survey, there were 23,782 Ainu people in Hokkaido.&lt;ref name=&quot;ainutyousa&quot;&gt;[http://www.ainu-assn.or.jp/about03.html 北海道アイヌ協会] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518015015/http://www.ainu-assn.or.jp/about03.html |date=2011年5月18日}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|日本学術会議|2011}} When viewed by the branch office (currently the Promotion Bureau), there are many in the Iburi / Hidaka branch office. In addition, the definition of “Ainu” by the Hokkaido Agency in this survey is “a person who seems to have inherited the blood of Ainu” or “the same livelihood as those with marriage or adoption.” Additionally, if it is denied that the other person is an Ainu then it is not subject to investigation.

According to a 1971 survey, there were 77,000 survey results. There is also a survey that the total number of Ainu living in Japan is 200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poisson, B 2002, p.5&quot; /&gt; However, there's no other survey that supports this estimate.

Many Ainu live outside Hokkaido. A 1988 survey estimated that the population of Ainu living in [[Tokyo]] was 2,700.&lt;ref name=&quot;ainutyousa&quot; /&gt; According to a 1989 survey report on Utari living in Tokyo, it is estimated that the area around Tokyo alone exceeds 10% of Ainu living in Hokkaido, and there are more than 10,000 Ainu living in the Tokyo metropolitan area.

In addition to Japan and Russia, it was reported in 1992 that there was a descendant of Kuril Ainu in [[Poland]], but there are also indications that it is a descendant of the Aleut.&lt;ref&gt;「しかしアキヅキトシユキは実際には1975年の樺太・千島交換条約の際に千島に住んでいた90人のアレウト族の末裔だったのではないかと推測している。そのアイヌがどこのだれのことを示しているのかということに関してそれ以上の情報はでてこなかった」&lt;!--In 1992 there were press reports that descendants of the Kuril Ainu were found in Poland, but Akizuki Toshiyuki (personal communication, 1992) speculates that the “Kuril Ainu” in Poland are actually descendants of the ninety Aleuts who lived in the Kurils at the time of the Sakhalin-Kuril exchange of 1875, and whose whereabouts are otherwise unknown.--&gt;

According to a 2017 survey, the Ainu population in Hokkaido is about 13,000. This has dropped sharply from 24,000 in 2006, but this is because the number of members of the [[Ainu Association of Hokkaido]], which is cooperating with the survey, has decreased, and interest in protecting personal information has increased. It is thought that the number of people who cooperated is decreasing, and that it does not match the actual number of people.&lt;ref name=ainu-nik&gt;{{cite news |title=北海道のアイヌ、10年余で４割減　実態反映せず |newspaper=[[日本経済新聞]]|date=2018-08-27 |url=https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO34630960X20C18A8CR8000/| accessdate=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Subgroups ===
These are unofficial sub groups of the Ainu people with location and population estimates. According to historical records and census only a small population of pure-blooded Ainu still exist. That amount continues to decrease. Many who claim Ainu heritage are multiracial.

|Sakhalin Ainu
|[[Sakhalin]]
|[[Sakhalin]] Ainu: Pure-blooded individuals may be surviving in Hokkaidō. From both Northern and Southern [[Sakhalin]], a total of 841 Ainu were relocated to Hokkaidō in 1875 by Japan. Only a few in remote interior areas remained, as the island was turned over to Russia. Even when Japan was granted Southern Sakhalin in 1905, only a handful returned. The Japanese census of 1905 counted only 120 Sakhalin Ainu (down from 841 in 1875, 93 in Karafuto and 27 in Hokkaidō). The Soviet census of 1926 counted 5 Ainu, while several of their multiracial children were recorded as ethnic Nivkh, Slav or Uilta.

* North Sakhalin: Only five pure-blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Soviet Census in Northern Sakhalin. Most of the Sakhalin Ainu (mainly from coastal areas) were relocated to Hokkaidō in 1875 by Japan.

|Northern [[Kuril islands]]
|Northern Kuril Ainu (no known living population in Japan, existence [[Ainu people#Official recognition in Russia|not recognized]] by Russian government in Kamchatka Krai): Also known as Kurile in Russian records. Were under Russian rule until 1875. First came under Japanese rule after the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)]]. Major population was on the island of [[Shumshu]], with a few others on islands like [[Paramushir]]. Altogether they numbered 221 in 1860. They had Russian names, spoke Russian fluently and were [[Russian Orthodox]] in religion. As the islands were given to the Japanese, more than a hundred Ainu fled to Kamchatka along with their Russian employers (where they were assimilated into the [[Kamchadal]] population).&lt;ref name=&quot;wurm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-I_pId0AuhIC&amp;pg=PA163|title=Japan's Competing Modernities: Issues in Culture and Democracy, 1900-1930|last=Minichiello|first=Sharon|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8248-2080-0|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about half remained under Japanese rule. In order to [[Russification|derussify]] the Kurile, the entire population of 97 individuals was relocated to [[Shikotan]] in 1884, given Japanese names, and the children were enrolled in Japanese schools. Unlike the other Ainu groups, the Kurile failed to adjust to their new surroundings and by 1933 only 10 individuals were alive (plus another 34 multiracial individuals). The last group of 20 individuals (including a few pure-bloods) were evacuated to Hokkaidō in 1941, where they vanished as a separate ethnic group soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;howell2005&quot; /&gt;
