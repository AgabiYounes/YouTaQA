An '''anxiolytic''' (also '''antipanic''' or '''antianxiety agent''')&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100020674|antianxiety agent}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a medication, or other intervention, that inhibits [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. This effect is in contrast to [[anxiogenic]] agents, which increase anxiety.  Together these categories of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compounds or interventions may be referred to as [[anxiotropic]] compounds or agents. Some [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] induce anxiolysis initially; however, studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic. Anxiolytic [[medication]]s have been used for the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]] and its related psychological and physical symptoms. [[Light therapy]] and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-7-62 |title=Does bright light have an anxiolytic effect? – an open trial |year=2007 |last1=Youngstedt |first1=Shawn D. |last2=Kripke |first2=Daniel F. |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=7 |pmid=17971237 |pages=62 |pmc=2194679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beta-receptor blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] and [[oxprenolol]], although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as [[tachycardia]] and [[palpitation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=Peggy E. |last2=Schulz |first2=S. Charles |title=Beta-blockers in anxiety disorders |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=119–30 |year=1987 |pmid=2890677 |doi=10.1016/0165-0327(87)90017-6 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258347 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiolytics are also known as '''minor [[tranquilizer]]s'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anxiolytic+tranquilizer|title=anxiolytic (tranquilizer)|work=Memidex (WordNet) Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is less common in modern texts and was originally derived from a dichotomy with [[major tranquilizer]]s, also known as [[neuroleptics]] or [[antipsychotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Finkel |first1=Richard Finkel|last2=Clark|first2=Michelle Alexia|last3=Cubeddu|first3=Luigi X. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacology|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781771559|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4hG2gRhy7oC&amp;pg=PA151|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401065559/https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4hG2gRhy7oC&amp;pg=PA151|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are concerns that some [[GABAergic]]s, such as [[benzodiazepine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s, may have an anxiogenic effect if used over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Marc (1 July 2008). ''The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment'' (American Psychiatric Press Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment) (4 ed.). American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. p. 197. {{ISBN|978-1-58562-276-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medications==

===Barbiturates===
{{Main|Barbiturate}}

[[Barbiturate]]s exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia, though only after benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lehne's pharmacology for nursing care|last1=Burchum|first1=Jacqueline Rosenjack|last2=Rosenthal |first2=Laura D. |isbn=9780323321907|edition=9th|location=St. Louis, Missouri|oclc=890310283|date = 2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benzodiazepines===
{{Main|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term and long-term relief of severe and disabling anxiety. Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[sedation]] is needed.
If benzodiazepines are discontinued rapidly after being taken daily for two or more weeks there is some risk of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[rebound syndrome]], which varies by the specific drug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassano&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cassano|first=Giovanni B.|last2=Rossi|first2=Nicolò Baldini|last3=Pini|first3=Stefano|date=2002|title=Psychopharmacology of anxiety disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=4|issue=3|pages=271–285|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181684|pmid=22033867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerance and dependence may also occur, but may be clinically acceptable,&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005. Psychiatry. 3rd ed. New York: Oxford. pp236.&lt;/ref&gt; also the risk of abuse is significantly smaller than in case of barbiturates. Cognitive and behavioral adverse effects are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lader M, Tylee A, Donoghue J |title=Withdrawing benzodiazepines in primary care |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=19–34 |year=2009 |pmid=19062773 |doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00002 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepines include:

* [[Alprazolam]] (Xanax)
* [[Bromazepam]] (Lectopam, Lexotan)
* [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium)
* [[Clonazepam]] (Klonopin, Rivotril)
* [[Clorazepate]] (Tranxene)
* [[Diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[Flurazepam]] (Dalmane)
* [[Lorazepam]] (Ativan)
* [[Oxazepam]] (Serax, Serapax)
* [[Temazepam]] (Restoril)
* [[Triazolam]] (Halcion)

Benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage. At higher dosage [[hypnotic]] properties occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009 |title=Neuromodulatory effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): A comparative study |year=2005 |last1=Montenegro |first1=Mariana |last2=Veiga |first2=Heloisa |last3=Deslandes |first3=Andréa |last4=Cagy |first4=Maurício |last5=McDowell |first5=Kaleb |last6=Pompeu |first6=Fernando |last7=Piedade |first7=Roberto |last8=Ribeiro |first8=Pedro |journal=Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria |volume=63 |issue=2b |pages=410–5 |pmid=16059590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tofisopam]] (Emandaxin and Grandaxin) is a drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties, but, unlike other benzodiazepines, it does not have [[anticonvulsant]], [[sedative]], [[skeletal muscle relaxant]], [[motor skill|motor skill-impairing]], or [[amnestic|amnestic properties]].

=== Carbamates ===
Marketed as a safer alternative to barbiturate anxiolytics, [[meprobamate]] (Miltown, Equanil) was commonly used to relieve anxiety in the late 1950s and 1960s. Like barbiturates, therapeutic doses produce sedation and significant overdoses may be fatal. In the US, meprobamate has generally been replaced with benzodiazepines while the drug is now withdrawn in many European countries and Canada. The muscle relaxant [[carisoprodol]] has anxiolytic effects by metabolizing to meprobamate. Various other [[carbamate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have been found to share these effects, such as [[tybamate]] and [[lorbamate]].

===Antihistamines===
{{Main|Antihistamines}}

[[Hydroxyzine]] (Atarax) is an [[antihistamine]] originally approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1956. In addition to its antihistamine properties hydroxyzine possesses anxiolytic properties and is approved for the treatment of anxiety and tension. Its sedative properties are useful as a premedication before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm|title= hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax)|accessdate= 17 May 2008|author= medicine net|publisher= medicinenet.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513104646/http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm| archivedate= 13 May 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroxyzine has been shown to be as effective as [[benzodiazepines]] in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], while producing fewer side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n1112 |pmid=12444816 |title=Efficacy and Safety of Hydroxyzine in the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–7 |year=2002 |last1=Llorca |first1=Pierre-Michel |last2=Spadone |first2=Christian |last3=Sol |first3=Olivier |last4=Danniau |first4=Anne |last5=Bougerol |first5=Thierry |last6=Corruble |first6=Emmanuelle |last7=Faruch |first7=Michel |last8=Macher |first8=Jean-Paul |last9=Sermet |first9=Eric |last10=Servant |first10=Dominique }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chlorpheniramine]]''' (Chlor-Trimeton)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00213-009-1695-0 |title=Chlorpheniramine exerts anxiolytic-like effects and activates prefrontal 5-HT systems in mice |year=2009 |last1=Miyata |first1=Shigeo |last2=Hirano |first2=Shoko |last3=Ohsawa |first3=Masahiro |last4=Kamei |first4=Junzo |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=213 |issue=2–3 |pages=441–52 |pmid=19823805}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl) have [[hypnotic]] and [[sedative]] effects with mild anxiolytic-like properties ([[off-label use]]). These drugs are approved by the FDA for [[allergy|allergies]], [[rhinitis]], and [[urticaria]].

===Opioids===
[[Opioid]]s are drugs that are usually only prescribed for their painkilling properties, but some research is beginning to find that some varieties are effective at treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and other ailments often associated with or caused by anxiety.  They have a very high potential for abuse and have one of the highest addiction rates for all drugs.  Many people become addicted to these drugs because they are so effective at blocking emotional pain, including anxiety.  Similarly to alcohol, people with anxiety disorders are more likely to become addicted to opioids due to their anxiolytic effect.  These drugs range from the commonly prescribed [[hydrocodone]], to the often illegal [[heroin]], and all the way to much more potent varieties like [[fentanyl]] often used in trauma or end of life pain management. Most people purchasing these drugs illegally are seeking them out to get a euphoric like high, but many others seek them out because they are so effective at reducing both physical pain and emotional pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heroin addiction and anxiety disorder|url=http://www.dualdiagnosis.org/heroin-and-anxiety-disorder|website=DualDiagnosis|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that [[buprenorphine]] is gaining some acceptability within the medical community for treating anxiety, OCD, and depression. Buprenorphine is similar to [[methadone]] in that it is used in opioid replacement therapy as well as pain management. It is safer than methadone and other opioids and has a very long half-life leading to less compulsive use among those who attempt to abuse it or have become dependent on it. There has been research into more commonly abused opioids being prescribed for anxiety disorder, but given that these drugs produce more euphoria and require more constant dosing when compared to buprenorphine, there is a much higher danger for abuse and overdose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2045125312462233 |pmid=23983988 |pmc=3736962 |title=Buprenorphine augmentation in the treatment of refractory obsessive–compulsive disorder |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–9 |year=2013 |last1=Liddell |first1=Malcolm B. |last2=Aziz |first2=Victor |last3=Briggs |first3=Patrick |last4=Kanakkehewa |first4=Nimalee |last5=Rawi |first5=Omar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antidepressants ===
Antidepressant medications can reduce anxiety, and several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been [[Food and Drug Administration|USFDA]] approved to treat various anxiety disorders. Antidepressants are especially beneficial because anxiety and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] often [[Comorbidity|occur together]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassano&quot; /&gt;

==== Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ====
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors&lt;ref name=&quot;BARLOW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Barlow, David H. |author2=Durand, Mark V |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |edition=Fifth |page=239 |chapter=Chapter 7: Mood Disorders and Suicide |isbn=978-0-495-09556-9 |oclc=192055408 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2009}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SSRIs) are a class of compounds typically used in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] and some [[personality disorder]]s. Primarily classified as antidepressants, most SSRIs have anxiolytic effects, although at higher dosages than used to treat depression.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Paradoxically, SSRIs can [[Anxiogenic|increase anxiety]] initially due to negative feedback through the serotonergic [[autoreceptors]]. For this reason a concurrent benzodiazepine is sometimes used temporarily until the anxiolytic effect of the SSRI occurs.

==== Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ====
[[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] (SNRIs) include [[venlafaxine]] and [[duloxetine]] drugs. Venlafaxine, in [[extended release]] form, and duloxetine, are indicated for the treatment of [[Generalized anxiety disorder|GAD]]. SNRIs are as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name=Vanin&gt;{{cite book |title=Anxiety Disorders: A Pocket Guide For Primary Care |author1=John Vanin |author2=James Helsley |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |date=19 June 2008 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tricyclic antidepressants ====
[[Tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) have anxiolytic effects; however, side effects are often more troubling or severe and overdose is dangerous. Examples include [[imipramine]], [[doxepin]], [[amitriptyline]], [[nortriptyline]] and [[desipramine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Post|first1=Jason W.|last2=Migne|first2=Louis J.|title=Antidepressants : Pharmacology, Health Effects and Controversy|date=2012|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781620815557|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tetracyclic antidepressant ====

[[Mirtazapine]] has demonstrated anxiolytic effects with a better side effect profile to all other classes of antidepressants, for example it rarely causes or exacerbates anxiety. However, in many countries (such as USA and Australia), it is not specifically approved for anxiety disorders and is used off label.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ====
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) are effective for anxiety, but their dietary restrictions, side effects and availability of newer effective drugs, have limited their use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassano&quot; /&gt; First generation MAO inhibitors include: [[phenelzine]], [[isocarboxazid]] and [[tranylcypromine]]. [[Moclobemide]], a reversible MAO-A inhibitor, lacks the dietary restrictions associated with classic MAOI's. The drug is used in Canada, the UK and Australia.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Sympatholytics===

[[Sympatholytic]]s are a group of anti-hypertensives which inhibit activity of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], and several medications within this group have shown anxiolytic effects as well as potential therapy for PTSD.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Beta blockers ====
Although not officially approved for this purpose, [[beta blocker]]s also can have an antianxiety effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1974.01760170071012 |pmid=4155284 |title=Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Drugs in Psychiatry |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=681–91 |year=1974 |last1=Jefferson |first1=James W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0033-3182(82)73433-4 |pmid=6122234 |title=Beta-blocking drugs and anxiety |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=155–70 |year=1982 |last1=Noyes |first1=Russell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alpha blockers ====
The alpha1 antagonist [[prazosin]] could be effective for PTSD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2045125313500982 |pmid=24490030 |pmc=3896131 |title=High-dose prazosin for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=43–7 |year=2013 |last1=Koola |first1=M.

==== Alpha-adrenergic agonist ====
The [[Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor]] [[agonist]]s [[clonidine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1981.01780360094011 |pmid=7305609 |title=Effects of Clonidine on Anxiety Disorders |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1278–82 |year=1981 |last1=Hoehn-Saric |first1=Rudolf |last2=Merchant |first2=A. F. |last3=Keyser |first3=M. L. |last4=Smith |first4=V. K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[guanfacine]] have demonstrated both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects.

====Selank====
[[Selank]] is an anxiolytic peptide based drug developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian academy of sciences. Selank is a heptapeptide with the sequence Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro. It is a synthetic [[structural analog|analog]] of a human tetrapeptide [[tuftsin]]. As such, it mimics many of its effects. It has been shown to modulate the expression of [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6) and affect the balance of T helper cell cytokines. There is evidence that it may also modulate the expression of [[brain-derived neurotropic factor]] in rats.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

====Bromantane====
[[Bromantane]] is a stimulant drug with anxiolytic properties developed in Russia during the late 1980s. Bromantane acts mainly by facilitating the biosynthesis of dopamine, through indirect genomic upregulation of relevant enzymes ([[tyrosine hydroxylase]] (TH) and [[aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase]] (AAAD), a.k.a. DOPA decarboxylase),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Vakhitova IuV)), Iamidanov RS, Seredinin SB | title = [Ladasten induces the expression of genes regulating dopamine biosynthesis in various structures of rat brain] | language = Russian | journal = Eksp Klin Farmakol | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 7–11 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15500036 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = ((Vakhitova IuV)), Iamidanov RS, Seredinin SB | title = [Ladasten induces the expression of genes regulating dopamine biosynthesis in various structures of rat brain] | language = Russian | journal = Eksp Klin Farmakol | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 7–11 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15500036 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vakhitova|first1=Yu.

Study results suggest that the combination of psychostimulant and anxiolytic actions in the spectrum of psychotropic activity of bromantane is effective in treating asthenic disorders compared to placebo.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

====Emoxypine====
[[Emoxypine]] is an [[antioxidant]] that is also a purported anxiolytic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10517-015-2855-3 |pmid=25894772 |title=Comparative Analysis of the Anxiolytic Effects of 3-Hydroxypyridine and Succinic Acid Derivatives |journal=Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine |volume=158 |issue=6 |pages=756–61 |year=2015 |last1=Volchegorskii |first1=I.

====Azapirones====
Azapirones are a class of [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] [[agonist]]s.  Currently approved azapirones include [[buspirone]] (Buspar) and [[tandospirone]] (Sediel).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oJY8LrP_JysC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=%22Azapirone%22+%225-HT1A%22+%22receptor%22+%22Sediel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEmIPutZDZAhXHDMAKHQ6xAr4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Azapirone%22%20%225-HT1A%22%20%22receptor%22%20%22Sediel%22&amp;f=false ''Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 32 p. 319'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregabalin====
[[Pregabalin]]'s anxiolytic effect appears after one week of use and is similar in effectiveness to [[lorazepam]], [[alprazolam]], and [[venlafaxine]], but has demonstrated more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of [[drug tolerance|tolerance]], and unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt [[sleep architecture]] and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Pregabalin also exhibits a lower potential for abuse and dependence than benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1586/14737175.7.7.769 |pmid=17610384 |title=Pregabalin for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A novel pharmacologic intervention |journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=769–81 |year=2014 |last1=Bandelow |first1=Borwin |last2=Wedekind |first2=Dirk |last3=Leon |first3=Teresa }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1358/dot.2007.43.9.1133188 |pmid=17940637 |title=Pregabalin: Its efficacy, safety and tolerability profile in generalized anxiety |journal=Drugs of Today |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=601–10 |year=2007 |last1=Owen |first1=R.T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Menthyl isovalerate ====

==== Propofol ====
[[Propofol]] produces anxiolytic effect, beneficial during medical procedures requiring sedation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.anclin.2013.10.011 |pmid=24491647 |title=Preoperative Anxiety Management, Emergence Delirium, and Postoperative Behavior |journal=Anesthesiology Clinics |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=1–23 |year=2014 |last1=Banchs |first1=Richard J. |last2=Lerman |first2=Jerrold }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.01.007 |pmid=19248246 |title=Propofol: A review of its non-anaesthetic effects |journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=605 |issue=1–3 |pages=1–8 |year=2009 |last1=Vasileiou |first1=Ioanna |last2=Xanthos |first2=Theodoros |last3=Koudouna |first3=Eleni |last4=Perrea |first4=Despoina |last5=Klonaris |first5=Chris |last6=Katsargyris |first6=Athanasios |last7=Papadimitriou |first7=Lila }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Racetams ====
Some [[racetam]] based drugs such as  [[aniracetam]] can have an antianxiety effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/11319230-000000000-00000 |pmid=20166767 |title=Piracetam and Piracetam-Like Drugs |journal=Drugs |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=287–312 |year=2010 |last1=Malykh |first1=Andrei G. |last2=Sadaie |first2=M. Reza }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}

Ethanol is used as an anxiolytic, sometimes by [[self-medication]]. [[fMRI]] can measure the anxiolytic effects of alcohol in the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0086-08.2008 |pmid=18448634 |pmc=2730732 |title=Why We Like to Drink: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of the Rewarding and Anxiolytic Effects of Alcohol |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=18 |pages=4583–91 |year=2008 |last1=Gilman |first1=J.

W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British National Formulary]] states, &quot;Alcohol is a poor hypnotic because its [[diuretic]] action interferes with [[sleep]] during the latter part of the night.&quot; Alcohol is also known to induce alcohol-related [[sleep disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa41.htm | title = Alcohol and Sleep | publisher = [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]], [[National Institutes of Health]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inhalants====
{{see also|Inhalant abuse#Patterns of non-medical usage|Street children in Latin America#Drugs}}

The anxiolytic effects of solvents act as positive modulators of GABAA receptors (Bowen and colleagues 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Matthew O. |last1=Howard |first2=Scott E. |last2=Bowen |first3=Eric L. |last3=Garland |first4=Brian E. |last4=Perron |first5=Michael G. |last5=Vaughn |pmid=22003419 |year=2011 |title=Inhalant use and inhalant use disorders in the United States |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=18–31 |pmc=3188822 |journal=Addiction Science &amp; Clinical Practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives to medication ==
Psychotherapeutic treatment can be an effective alternative to medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zwanzger-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00115-006-2202-z |pmid=17279399 |title=Angsterkrankungen |journal=Der Nervenarzt |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=349–59; quiz 360 |year=2007 |last1=Zwanzger |first1=P. |last2=Deckert |first2=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exposure therapy]] is the recommended treatment for phobic anxiety disorders. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) has been found to be effective treatment for [[panic disorder]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. Healthcare providers can also help by educating sufferers about anxiety disorders and referring individuals to self-help resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shearer-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2007.05.002 |pmid=17868756 |title=Recent Advances in the Understanding and Treatment of Anxiety Disorders |journal=Primary Care: Clinics in Office Practice |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=475–504, v–vi |year=2007 |last1=Shearer |first1=Steven L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], and possibly more effective than pharmacological treatments in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(97)80048-2 |id={{INIST|2831082}} |title=Cognitive behavioral and pharmacological treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A preliminary meta-analysis |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=285–305 |year=1997 |last1=Gould |first1=Robert A. |last2=Otto |first2=Michael W. |last3=Pollack |first3=Mark H. |last4=Yap |first4=Liang }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes medication is combined with psychotherapy, but research has not found a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy versus monotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pull-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e3280115e52 |pmid=17143079 |title=Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=30–5 |year=2007 |last1=Pull |first1=Charles B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even with CBT being a viable treatment option, it can still be ineffective for many individuals. Both the Canadian and American medical associations then suggest the use of a strong but long lasting benzodiazepine such as [[clonazepam]]  and an antidepressant, usually [[Prozac]] for its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;CMA &amp; AMA Home medical guides 2012 &amp; 2014 {{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn|date=March 2018}}
