An '''alphabet song''' is any of various songs used to teach children the [[alphabet]]. Alphabet songs typically recite the names of all letters of the alphabet of a given language in order.

== The A.B.C. (Verse 1) ==
&quot;The A.B.C.&quot; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|.|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː}} or &quot;A.B.Cs&quot; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|.|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː|z}} is one of the best-known [[English language]] alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as &quot;the alphabet song&quot;, especially in the [[United States]].

{{Listen|filename=Alphabet song.ogg|title=Alphabet song|description=Tune for ''Alphabet song''}}
The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the [[Boston]]-based music publisher [[Charles Bradlee]], and given the title &quot;The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte&quot;. The musical arrangement was attributed to [[Louis Le Maire]] (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was &quot;Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts&quot;, according to the Newberry Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First|website=illinois.edu |title=Newberry's Library Catalog |accessdate=29 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also says, &quot;The theme is that used by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] for his [[Twelve Variations on &quot;Ah vous dirai-je, Maman&quot;|piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The alphabet song is sometimes said to come from another of Bradlee's publications, &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot;, but the first line of that song is given as &quot;Come, come my children, I must see&quot;, in [http://orbis.library.yale.edu [[Yale University]]'s library catalog]. It is described as &quot;a favorite glee for three voices, as sung at the Salem glee club.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This tune is the same as the tune for  &quot;[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]&quot; and &quot;[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]&quot;.

Lyrics: ''(each line represents two measures, or eight beats)''
:''[[A]], [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[E]], [[F]], [[G]]...'' ({{IPAc-en|eɪ|_|b|iː|_|s|iː|_|d|iː|_|iː|_|ɛ|f|_|dʒ|iː}})
:''[[H]], [[I]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[O]], [[P]]...'' ({{IPAc-en|eɪ|tʃ|_|aɪ|_|dʒ|eɪ|_|k|eɪ|_|ɛ|l|ɛ|m|ɛ|n|oʊ|_|p|iː}}; &quot;L, M, N, O&quot; spoken twice as quickly as rest of rhyme)

:''[[W]]... [[X]].../ [[Y]] and [[Z]].'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ʌ|b|əl|.|juː|_|ɛ|k|s|nbsp|!|_|w|aɪ|_|æ|n|d|_|z|iː}}; pause between X and Y, and W and X last for two beats)
:''Now, I know my ABCs.'' ({{IPAc-en|n|aʊ|_|aɪ|_|n|oʊ|_|m|aɪ|_|eɪ|_|b|iː|_|s|iː|z}})
:''Next time, won't you sing with me?'' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɛ|k|s|t|_|t|aɪ|m|_|w|oʊ|n|t|_|juː|_|s|ɪ|ŋ|_|w|ɪ|ð|_|m|iː}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evaeaston.com/pr/media/r/alpha-song.ra |format=[[RealPlayer]]|title=Listen to the song sung |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033936/http://evaeaston.com/pr/media/r/alpha-song.ra |archivedate=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backwards alphabet ===
This is a version that goes Z to A instead of A to Z.
:''z-y-x, w''
:''v-u-t, s-r-q''
:''p-o-n-m-l-k-j''
:''i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-a''
:''Now you know your ZYXs''
:''I bet that's not what you expected!''&lt;ref name=&quot;SchillerWillis2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiller|first1=Pamela Byrne|last2=Willis|first2=Clarissa|title=School Days: 28 Songs and Over 300 Activities for Young Children|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l02CH6yYI0sC&amp;pg=PT26|accessdate=30 October 2017|year=2006|publisher=Gryphon House|isbn=978-0-87659-019-5|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The e-d-c-b part is as fast as the l-m-n-o part in the normal alphabet song.

=== Zed for Zee ===
In the [[United States]], [[Z]] is pronounced ''zee''; in most other English-speaking countries (such as the UK, Canada and Australia) it is pronounced ''zed''.  Generally, the absent ''zee''-rhyme is not missed, although some children use a ''zee'' pronunciation in the rhyme which they would not use elsewhere. Variants of the song exist to accommodate the ''zed'' pronunciation.  One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between [[N]] and zed:{{cn|date=February 2020}}

&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt;{ \time 4/4 c'4 c' g' g' | a' a' g'2 | f'4 f' e' e' | d' d' c'2 | g'4 g' f' f' | e' e' d'2 | g'4 \times 2/3 { f'8 f' f' } e'4 d' | c' r r2 | \bar &quot;|.&quot; } \addlyrics { A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V dub- a- U X Y &quot;Z(ed)&quot; }&lt;/score&gt;
:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-l-m-n''
:''o-p-q-r-s-t-u''
:''v-w-x-y-z(ed)''

Another alternative ''zed'' version:{{citation needed|reason=can't see how this grouping could fit the tune|date=December 2016}}

:''a-b-c, d-e-f''
:''g-h-i-j-k-l-m''
:''n-o-p, q-r-s''
:''t-u-v-w-x-y-z(ed)''

==== French Canadian version ====

A French-language version of the song is also taught in Canada, with generally no alterations to the melody except in the final line that requires adjustment to accommodate the two-syllable pronunciation of the French ''y''.

== Phonics songs ==
Because the English language has 40 sounds{{cn|date=February 2020}} and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds ([[phoneme]]s) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.

== Acrostic songs ==
There are also songs that go through the alphabet, making some of the letters stand for something in the process. An example, ''[[A, You're Adorable]]'' (also known as &quot;The Alphabet Love Song&quot;), was recorded in 1948, by [[Buddy Kaye]], [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], [[Sidney Lippman]], and later [[Perry Como]].

A newer example of this is from the musical ''[[Matilda the Musical|Matilda]]''. &quot;School Song&quot; is an acrostic that spells out the alphabet phonetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/school-song-lyrics-matilda-london-cast.html|title=Matilda London Cast - School Song Lyrics {{!}} MetroLyrics|website=www.metrolyrics.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Backwards song (Verse 2) ==
The group [[Wee Sing]] released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order, called &quot;ZYXs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wee Sing|title=Wee Sing {{!}} The Alphabet Song|date=2015-07-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h2jK1TkE3o|access-date=2019-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian children's TV series ''[[The Big Comfy Couch]]'' used a version of the song in the first episode of Season 4, &quot;Backwards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=FilmRise|title=The Big Comfy Couch - Season 4 Ep 1 - &quot;Backwards&quot;|date=2014-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we13hA-oEgI|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian [[Soupy Sales]] released a song in 1966 called &quot;Backwards Alphabet&quot; which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Soupy+Sales/_/The+Backwards+Alphabet|title=Soupy Sales — The Backwards Alphabet — Listen, watch, download and discover music for free at Last.fm|website=Last.fm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of the song was performed by actress Judi Rolin with the [[Smothers Brothers]] in the 1966 teleplay adaptation of ''Alice Through the Looking Glass''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64sqQTqi-Z0|title=Alice through the Looking Glass: &quot;Backwards Alphabet&quot;|first=|last=storyjan|date=13 July 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
