'''Alexandar Živojinović''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (born 27 August 1953), better known by his stage name '''Alex Lifeson''', is a Canadian musician, singer, songwriter, and [[record producer]], best known as the guitarist of the progressive rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. In 1968, Lifeson co-founded the band that would become Rush, with drummer [[John Rutsey]] and bassist and singer [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]]. Jones was replaced by [[Geddy Lee]] a month later, and Rutsey was replaced by [[Neil Peart]] in 1974, making Lifeson the only constant member. 

With Rush, Lifeson plays electric and acoustic guitars, as well as other [[string instrument]]s such as [[mandola]], [[mandolin]], and [[bouzouki]]. He also performs backing vocals in live performances, and occasionally plays keyboards and bass pedal synthesizers. Like the other members of Rush, Lifeson performs real-time on-stage triggering of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampled]] instruments, concurrently with his guitar playing.&lt;ref name=&quot;onstagemag.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |title=Onstagemag.com |publisher=Onstagemag.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm |archivedate=18 October 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although Lifeson has contributed to a body of work outside the band as well. Aside from music, Lifeson is part-owner of [[The Orbit Room]], a bar and restaurant in [[Toronto]], a painter and a licensed aircraft [[Aviator|pilot]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vdtsgn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Alex Lifeson Biography |url=http://www.2112.net/xanadu/ |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=20 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161412/http://2112.net/xanadu/| archivedate= 12 October 2007 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his bandmates [[Geddy Lee]] and [[Neil Peart]], Lifeson was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] on 9 May 1996.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lifeson was born as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović/Александар Живојиновић in Serbian) in [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], [[British Columbia]], to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, and raised in Toronto, [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name = &quot;vdtsgn&quot; /&gt; His stage name of &quot;Lifeson&quot; is a semi-literal translation of the surname [[Živojinović]], which means &quot;son of life&quot; in Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;Horizon to Horizon [http://rush.robpagano.com/index.php?c=alex Rob Pagano's Rush Music Tribute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132306/http://rush.robpagano.com/index.php?c=alex |date=16 October 2007 }} Accessed 7 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His first exposure to formal music training came in the form of the [[viola]], which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jimmy Page]],&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=137 Epiphone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928151801/http://www.epiphone.com/news.asp?NewsID=137 |date=28 September 2011 }} Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Hackett]], and [[Allan Holdsworth]];&lt;ref&gt;Guitar World Staff (12 January 2012). &quot;[http://www.guitarworld.com/60-minutes-alex-lifeson-and-geddy-lee-rush?page=0,10 60 Minutes with Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee of Rush] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807072822/http://www.guitarworld.com/60-minutes-alex-lifeson-and-geddy-lee-rush?page=0,10 |date=7 August 2017 }}&quot;. ''[[Guitar Player]]''. [[New Bay Media]]. Retrieved 2012-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; he explained in 2011 that &quot;Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in '[[Spoonful]].' But there was nothing I could do with Hendrix.&quot;&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite news |title=Alex Lifeson: Rush Keeps Rollin' |last=Cohen |first=Elliot Stephen |date=September 2011 |work=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]] |pages=42–44 |accessdate=28 August 2013 |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/20110900vintageguitar.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Lifeson met future Rush drummer [[John Rutsey]] in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.

Lifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:

{{quote|My brother-in-law played flamenco guitar. He lent his guitar to me and I grew to like it. When you're a kid, you don't want to play an accordion because it would be too boring. But your parents might want you to play one, especially if you're from a Yugoslavian family like me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inquirer with Alex Lifeson|author=Joe Lalaina
|year=2008|journal=Guitar Legends}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lifeson's first girlfriend, Charlene, gave birth to their eldest son, Justin, in October 1970, and they married in 1975. Their second son, Adrian, was born two years later. Adrian is also involved in music, and performed on two tracks from Lifeson's 1996 solo project, ''Victor''.

===Rush===
[[Image:20110527-200145 Rush Ahoy Rotterdam 1200x0800.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Lifeson during the 2010–2011 [[Time Machine Tour]], Ahoy, [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands (27 May 2011)]]
Lifeson's neighbour [[John Rutsey]] began experimenting on a rented drum kit.  In 1963, Lifeson and Rutsey formed The Projection, which eventually became Rush in August 1968 following the recruitment of original bassist and vocalist [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]]. [[Geddy Lee]], a [[High school (North America)|high school]] friend of Lifeson, assumed this role soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banasiewicz  |first=Bill |title=Rush Visions: The Official Biography |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=1990 |isbn= 0-7119-1162-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instrumentally, Lifeson is renowned for his signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and the copious arsenal of equipment he has used over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson profile [http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml Dinosaur Rock God] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209005754/http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/bios/Lifeson.shtml |date=9 February 2006 }} Accessed 31 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson minor overview [http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=13124 Guitar Player] Accessed 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Lifeson Archive [http://www.rusharchives.com/rush-gear/alex-lifeson/ Alex Lifeson Archive and equipment] Accessed 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Rush was on hiatus for several years starting in 1997 owing to [[Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road|personal tragedies in Neil Peart's life]], and Lifeson had not picked up a guitar for at least a year following those events.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammond |first=Shawn |title=Back in the limelight: Alex Lifeson and Rush reignite after a five-year hiatus |journal=Guitar Player |volume=38 |issue=8 |date=August 2002 |publisher=New Bay Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after some work in his home studio and on various side projects, Lifeson returned to the studio with Rush to begin work on 2002's ''Vapor Trails''. ''Vapor Trails'' is the first Rush album since the 1970s to lack keyboards—as such, Lifeson used over 50 different guitars in what [[Shawn Hammond]] of ''Guitar Player'' called &quot;his most rabid and experimental playing ever.&quot; Geddy Lee was amenable to leaving keyboards off the album due in part to Lifeson's ongoing concern about their use. Lifeson's approach to the guitar tracks for the album eschewed traditional riffs and solos in favour of &quot;tonality and harmonic quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;

During live performances, he used foot pedals to cue various synthesizer, guitar, and backing vocal effects as he played.

===''Victor''===
While the bulk of&amp;nbsp;Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, his first major outside work was his solo project, ''[[Victor (album)|Victor]]'', released in 1996. ''Victor'' was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. ''Victor'' is attributed as the ''artist'' as well as the ''album title''). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the [[W.&amp;nbsp;H. Auden]] poem, also entitled &quot;Victor&quot;. Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album. A follow-up album, possibly including vocals by [[Sarah McLachlan]], was rumoured in the late 1990s, but was apparently shelved due to Atlantic Records' lack of support for the first album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eric Hansen |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |title=Alex Lifeson's &quot;Victor&quot; linernotes and lyrics from Power Windows |publisher=2112.net |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702083720/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VIClyrics.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side projects===
{{main article|List of songs recorded by Rush#Alex Lifeson}}
Lifeson has also contributed to a body of work outside his involvement with the band in the form of instrumental contributions to other musical outfits. He made a guest appearance on the 1985 [[Platinum Blonde (band)|Platinum Blonde]] album ''[[Alien Shores]]'' performing guitar solos on the songs &quot;Crying Over You&quot; and &quot;Holy Water&quot;. Later, in 1990, he appeared on [[Lawrence Gowan]]'s album ''[[Lost Brotherhood]]'' to play guitar. In 1995, he guested on two tracks on [[Tom Cochrane]]'s ''[[Ragged Ass Road]]'' album and then in 1996 on [[I Mother Earth]]'s &quot;Like a Girl&quot; from the ''[[Scenery and Fish]]'' album. In 1997, he appeared on the ''Merry Axemas: A Guitar Christmas'' album. Lifeson played &quot;[[The Little Drummer Boy]]&quot; which was released as track 9 on the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merry Axemas at Allmusic, overview&quot;&gt;{{allmusic | class=album | id=mw0000463676 | tab=overview | accessdate=23 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Lifeson founded the [[Big Dirty Band]], which he created for the purpose of providing original soundtrack material for ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]''. Lifeson [[Jam session|jammed]] regularly with the Dexters ([[the Orbit Room]] house band from 1994 to 2004). Lifeson made a guest appearance on the 2007 album ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' by UK progressive rock band [[Porcupine Tree]], contributing a solo during the song &quot;[[Anesthetize]]&quot;. He also appeared on the 2008 album ''[[Tiles (band)#About &quot;Fly Paper&quot;|Fly Paper]]'' by Detroit progressive rockers [[Tiles (band)|Tiles]]. He plays on the track &quot;Sacred and Mundane&quot;. Outside band related endeavours, Lifeson composed the theme for the first season of the science-fiction TV series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]''. He also produced three songs from the album ''[[Away from the Sun]]'' by [[3 Doors Down]]. Alex Lifeson is featured on [[Marco Minnemann]]'s 2017 release ''Borrego'', on which he played guitars on three songs and co-wrote the track &quot;On That Note&quot;. In 2018, he played lead guitar on [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]]'s 18-minute mostly instrumental track &quot;Il Mostro Atomico&quot; from the group's ''[[Clone of the Universe]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/av/new-music/fu-manchus-18-minute-psychedelic-stoner-epic-features-rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson|last=Kennelty|first=Greg|date=9 February 2018|accessdate=6 January 2019|title=FU MANCHU's 18-Minute Psychedelic Stoner Epic Features RUSH Guitarist Alex Lifeson|work=Metal Injection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and film appearances===
Lifeson made his film debut as himself under his birth name in the 1973 Canadian documentary film ''Come on Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/come_on_children|title=Come on Children|last=|first=|date=|website=Rotten Tomatoes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has appeared in several installments of the Canadian [[mockumentary]] franchise ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]''. In 2003, he was featured in an episode titled &quot;[[Closer to the Heart]]&quot;, playing a partly fictional version of himself. In the story, he is kidnapped by [[Robb Wells|Ricky]] and held as punishment for his inability (or refusal) to provide the main characters with free tickets to a Rush concert. In the end of the episode, Alex reconciles with the characters, and performs a duet of &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; with [[Mike Smith (actor)|Bubbles]] at the trailer park. In 2006, Lifeson appeared in ''[[Trailer Park Boys: The Movie]]'' as a traffic cop in the opening scene and in 2009 he appeared in their follow up movie, ''[[Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day]]'', as an undercover vice cop in drag. In 2017, Lifeson appeared in an episode of the spin-off series ''Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA'' titled &quot;Memphis.&quot;  

In 2008, Lifeson and the rest of Rush played &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; at the end of an episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. According to Colbert, this was their first appearance on American television as a band in 33 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/176340/july-16-2008/rush |title=Rush - The Colbert Report - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Colbertnation.com |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he and the rest of the band appeared as themselves in the comedy ''[[I Love You, Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, [https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/movies/20love.html?ref=movies Best Man Wanted. Must Be Rush Fan], [[The New York Times]], 20 March 2009 (accessed 31 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifeson appears as the border guard in the 2009 movie ''Suck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1323605/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Suck (2009)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of Dr. Funtime in ''[[The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour]]'' was originally written with Lifeson in mind, but due to scheduling conflicts the role was given to [[Maury Chaykin]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql-zaG2JLd8|title=Drunk and on Drugs Happy Funtime Hour: Behind the Scenes with Maury Chaykin|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book forewords===
Lifeson has penned forewords to three books: ''Behind the Stage Door'' by Rich Engler in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 20 January 2020 | url = https://www.rushisaband.com/blog/2013/12/08/3874/New-book-Behind-the-Stage-Door-from-concert-promoter-Rich-Engler-features-foreword-by-Alex-Lifeson | title = New book Behind the Stage Door from concert promoter Rich Engler features foreword by Alex Lifeson | date = 8 December 2013 | website = rushisaband.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;; ''Shredders!: The Oral History Of Speed Guitar (And More)'' by Greg Prato in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 20 January 2020 | url = https://www.rushisaband.com/blog/2017/03/16/4878/Greg-Patos-new-book-Shredders-The-Oral-History-Of-Speed-Guitar-featuring-a-foreword-by-Alex-Lifeson-now-available | title = Greg Prato's new book Shredders!: The Oral History Of Speed Guitar featuring a foreword by Alex Lifeson now available | date = 16 March 2017 | website = rushisaband.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and ''Geddy Lee's Big Beautiful Book of Bass'' by Geddy Lee in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate = 22 January 2020 | url = https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780062747839/geddy-lees-big-beautiful-book-of-bass/ | title = Geddy Lee's Big Beautiful Book of Bass | date = 18 December 2018 | website = harpercollins.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
On [[New Year's Eve#United States|New Year's Eve]] 2003, Lifeson, his son, and his daughter-in-law were arrested at the [[Ritz-Carlton]] hotel in [[Naples, Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Naples incident&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Howard W|title=The Naples incident|url=http://www.lawreport.org/ViewStory.aspx?StoryID=13796|website=Lawreport.org|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifeson, after intervening in an altercation between his son and police, was accused of assaulting a sheriff's deputy in what was described as a drunken brawl. In addition to suffering a broken nose at the hands of the officers, Lifeson was [[taser|tased]] six times. His son was also tased repeatedly.

On 21 April 2005, Lifeson and his son agreed to a plea deal with the local [[prosecutor]] for the [[State's Attorney]] office to avoid jail time by pleading [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to a first-degree [[misdemeanor]] charge of resisting arrest without violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSdvC8kMdwM |title=Rush' Alex Lifeson in court |publisher=YouTube |date=21 June 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the plea agreement, Lifeson and his son were each sentenced to 12 months of probation with the adjudication of that probation suspended. Lifeson acknowledged his subsequent legal action against both the Ritz-Carlton and the Collier County Sheriff's Office for &quot;their incredibly discourteous, arrogant and aggressive behaviour of which I had never experienced in thirty years of travel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Naples incident&quot;/&gt; Although both actions were initially dismissed in April 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052834/police-cleared-in-altercation-with-rushs-lifeson |title=Police Cleared In Altercation With Rush's Lifeson |magazine=Billboard |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal claims against the Ritz-Carlton were reinstated upon appeal, and ultimately settled out of court in August 2008, with Lifeson and his son agreeing to a confidential settlement from Ritz-Carlton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aisling Swift |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/aug/22/ritz-carlton-settles-lawsuit-rush-guitarists-son/ |title=Ritz-Carlton settles lawsuit with Rush guitarist’s son - Naples Daily News |publisher=Naplesnews.com |date=22 August 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his journal-based book ''Roadshow'', Peart relates the band's perspective on the events of that New Year's Eve.

==Guitar equipment==
[[Image:Alex Lifeson.jpg|Right|thumb|180px|Lifeson playing his [[Gibson Les Paul]] in the 'Heritage Cherry Sunburst'. This guitar has been modified to incorporate a [[Floyd Rose]] tremolo.]]

===Early Rush (1970s)===
In Rush's early career, Lifeson used a [[Gibson ES-335]] for the first tour, and in 1976 bought a 1974 [[Gibson Les Paul]]; he used those two guitars until the late 1970s. He had a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with a [[Bill Lawrence (guitar maker)|Bill Lawrence]] humbucker and [[Floyd Rose]] vibrato bridge as backup &quot;and for a different sound.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen&quot;/&gt; For the ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' sessions, Lifeson began using a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] for songs like &quot;[[Xanadu (Rush song)|Xanadu]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alex Lifeson Double Neck|url=http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2015/Custom/Alex-Lifeson-Double-Neck.aspx|access-date=31 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055332/http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2015/Custom/Alex-Lifeson-Double-Neck.aspx|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his main guitar became a white [[Gibson ES-355]].&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; During this period Lifeson used [[Hiwatt]] amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/prime-cuts-rush |title=Prime Cuts: Rush |magazine=Guitar World |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a [[Gibson B series#B-45|twelve-string Gibson B-45]] on songs like &quot;[[Closer to the Heart]].&quot;&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
From 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically modified Stratocasters, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters – a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Grace Under Pressure Tourbook |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm |website=Power Windows |access-date=10 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224014536/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/GUPtourbook.htm |archive-date=24 December 2008 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would start using them again twenty years later.&lt;ref name=WesInterview&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prasad |first1=Anil |title=John Wesley - Dose of Reality |url=https://www.innerviews.org/inner/wesley.html |website=Innerviews |publicationdate=2015| accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion and an Ovation Adamas acoustic/electric guitar.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; By 1987, Lifeson switched to Signature guitar despite describing them as &quot;awful to play—very uncomfortable--...had a particular sound I liked.&quot;&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt; Lifeson primarily used [[PRS Guitars|PRS guitars]] in the later-half of the 1990 Presto tour, and again during the recording of ''[[Roll The Bones]]'' in 1990/1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Interview: Alex Lifeson|url = http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Interview_Alex_Lifeson?page=2|website = www.premierguitar.com|access-date = 15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would continue to play PRS for the next sixteen years through the recording and touring of ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'', ''[[Test for Echo]]'' and ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' as well as the R30 tour.

===2000s onward: Return to Gibson guitars===
In 2011, Lifeson said that for the past few years he &quot;...used Gibson almost exclusively. There's nothing like having a low-slung Les Paul over my shoulder.&quot;

====Gibson &quot;Alex Lifeson Axcess&quot;====
In early 2011, Gibson introduced the &quot;Alex Lifeson Axcess&quot;, a guitar specially designed for him. These are custom made Les Pauls with [[Floyd Rose| Floyd Rose tremolo]] systems and [[Pickup (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoacoustic pick-ups]]. He used these two custom Les Pauls on the [[Time Machine Tour]]. These guitars are also available through Gibson, in a viceroy Brown or Crimson colour. Lifeson used these two guitars heavily on the tour.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

For the 2012-2013 Clockwork Angels tour, Gibson built an Alex Lifeson Axcess model in black which became Lifeson's primary guitar for much of the show.  For all acoustic work, he played one of his Axcess guitars using the piezo pick-ups; no acoustic guitars were used at all in the Clockwork Angels show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/GALLERY_Rushs_Clockwork_Angels_Tour_Gear|title=GALLERY: Rush's Clockwork Angels Tour Gear|last=Settle|first=Ken|date=12 October 2012|website=premierguitar.|access-date=20 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paul Reed Smith acoustic signature guitar====
For the 2015 R40 Tour, Lifeson used his signature acoustic guitar model by [[PRS Guitars|Paul Reed Smith]]. The guitar is currently available for private stock order.

====Gibson R40 Signature Les Paul Axcess====
Gibson introduced an Alex Lifeson R40 Les Paul Axcess signature guitar in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rush.com/alex-lifeson-r40-les-paul-axcess/|title=Introducing the Alex Lifeson R40 Les Paul Axcess - Rush.com|website=www.rush.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a limited edition with 50 guitars signed and played by Lifeson, and another 250 available without the signature.

====Gibson Custom Alex Lifeson Signature ES Les Paul semi-hollow====

At the 2017 Winter NAMM show, Gibson representative Mike Voltz  introduced an Antique White Gibson Custom Alex Lifeson Signature ES Les Paul semi-hollow guitar, a hybrid of a Les Paul Custom &amp; an ES 335, with only 200 made. Mike also introduced the Antique White as a new color from Gibson for this Custom (note: Gibson names this color as 'Classic White' on their web site which may be an error due to other Gibson reps labeling it as Antique White). Alex played this Custom on the last Rush tour.

===Amplification===
In 2005, Hughes &amp; Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier; Lifeson donates his royalties from the sale of these signature models to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TriAmp MKII Alex Lifeson |url=http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id=97&amp;prod=TriAmp%20MKII%20Alex%20Lifeson |publisher=Hughes-and-kettner.com |accessdate=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825202747/http://www.hughes-and-kettner.com/products.php5?id=97&amp;prod=TriAmp%20MKII%20Alex%20Lifeson |archivedate=25 August 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Lifeson abandoned his signature Triamps in favour for custom-built Lerxst Omega [[Marshall Amplification|Silver Jubilee]] clones, handmade by Mojotone in Burgaw, NC and [[Mesa Boogie Mark Series|Mesa/Boogie Mark V]] heads. He still uses the Hughes &amp; Kettner Coreblades.

===Effects===
For [[effects unit|effects]], Lifeson is known to use [[chorus effect|chorus]], [[phase shifting]], and [[flanger|flanging]]. Throughout his career, he has used well-known pedals such as the [[Electro-Harmonix|Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress]] flanger, the [[Boss Corporation|BOSS CE-1]] chorus, the [[Dunlop crybaby]] wah, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/new/node/32 |title=Alex Lifeson |publisher=Dinosaur Rock Guitar |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=15 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620051157/http://www.dinosaurrockguitar.com/new/node/32 |archivedate=20 June 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifeson and his guitar technician Scott Appleton have discussed in interviews Lifeson's use of Fractal Audio's Axe-FX, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Mainstage (software)|MainStage]], and [[Native Instruments]]' Guitar Rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lerxstamps.com/premierguitar-com-interview-with-alex-lifeson/|title=Premier Guitar Interview: Rush’s Alex Lifeson|date=19 February 2013|work=LERXST Amplification|access-date=3 October 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other instruments played==
===Stringed instruments===
In addition to acoustic and electric guitars, Lifeson has also played [[mandola]], [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]] on recent Rush studio albums, including ''[[Test for Echo]]'', ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' and ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]''.

===Electronic instruments===
During live Rush performances, Lifeson uses [[MIDI controller]]s that enables him to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds from [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] and [[synthesizer]]s, without taking his hands off his guitar. (Prior to this, Lifeson used [[Moog Taurus]] Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound &quot;events&quot; that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).&lt;ref name=&quot;onstagemag.com&quot; /&gt;
