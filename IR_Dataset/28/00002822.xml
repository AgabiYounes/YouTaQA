'''Ash''' or '''ashes''' are the solid remains of [[fire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ash|title=the definition of ash|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it refers to all non-[[aqueous]], non-[[gas]]eous residues that remain after something is [[combustion|burned]]. In [[analytical chemistry]], in order to analyse the mineral and metal content of [[chemical sample]]s,  [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] is the non-[[gas]]eous, non-[[liquid]] residue after a complete combustion.

Ashes as the end product of [[incomplete combustion]] will be mostly [[mineral]], but usually still contain an amount of [[combustible]] [[organic compound|organic]] or other [[Redox|oxidizable]] residues. The best-known type of ash is [[wood ash]], as a product of wood combustion in [[campfire]]s, [[fireplace]]s, etc. The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining [[charcoal]] will be due to incomplete combustion.

Like [[soap]], ash is also a [[disinfecting]] agent ([[alkaline]]).&lt;ref&gt;Howard et al. 2002: Healthy Villages A guide for communities and community health workers.

Accessed Oct. 2014.    http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/settings/hvchap8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends ash or sand as alternative when soap is not available.&lt;ref&gt;WHO 2014: Water Sanitation Health.
