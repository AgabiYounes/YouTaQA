'''Andrzej Sapkowski''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈandʐɛj sapˈkɔfskʲi}}; born 21 June 1948) is a [[Poles|Polish]] [[fantasy]] writer. He is best known for his book series, ''[[The Witcher]]''. His books have been translated into over 20 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrzejsapkowski.pl/autor.html |title=Andrzej Sapkowski - Biografia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|Sapkowski [[novel]]s on display occupying two shelves at an [[Empik]] bookstore in [[Katowice]], Poland]]
Sapkowski studied economics at the [[University of Łódź]], and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first [[short story]], &quot;[[The Witcher]]&quot; (&quot;Wiedźmin&quot;, also translated &quot;The Hexer&quot; or &quot;Spellmaker&quot;) on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine ''[[Fantastyka]]''. In an interview he said that being a businessman at the time and thus familiar with marketing, he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm НО МЫ ЖЕ СЛАВЯНЕ! РАЗГОВОР С АНДЖЕЕМ САПКОВСКИМ], An interview with Sapkowski for Russian monthly magazine &quot;World of Fatnastics&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The story was published in ''Fantastyka'' in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a [[Novel sequence|cycle of tales]] based on the world of &quot;The Witcher&quot;, comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his other works have made him one of the best-known [[fantasy author]]s in Poland in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=mo/&gt;

The main character of &quot;The Witcher&quot; is [[Geralt of Rivia]], a monster hunter trained for this since childhood. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref name=mo&gt;{{in lang|pl}} Marek Oramus ''[http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html Jedynie słuszny wizerunek wiedźmina]'', Polityka – nr 36 (2261) from 2000-09-02; pp. 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by [[Slavic mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Andrzej-Sapkowski/The-Last-Wish.html The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski ]'', fantasybookreview&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Sapkowski mentioned that his favorite writers included [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Raymond Chandler]] and [[Umberto Eco]], and stated &quot;I love their style, but I know I can never match them&quot;.
