'''Antipsychotics''', also known as '''neuroleptics''' or '''major tranquilizers''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Finkel |first1=Richard Finkel|last2=Clark|first2=Michelle Alexia|last3=Cubeddu|first3=Luigi X. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacology|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781771559|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4hG2gRhy7oC&amp;pg=PA151|language=en|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401065559/https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4hG2gRhy7oC&amp;pg=PA151|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a class of medication primarily used to manage [[psychosis]] (including [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]] or [[disordered thought]]), principally in [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. Antipsychotics are usually effective in relieving symptoms of psychosis in the short term.

&lt;!-- Side effects and mechanism --&gt; 
The long-term use of antipsychotics is associated with [[List of long term side effects of antipsychotics|adverse effects]] such as [[Extrapyramidal symptoms|involuntary movement disorders]], [[gynecomastia]], [[impotence]], [[weight gain]] and [[metabolic syndrome]].

&lt;!-- History and culture --&gt;
First-generation antipsychotics, known as [[typical antipsychotics]], were discovered in the 1950s. Most second-generation drugs, known as [[atypical antipsychotics]], have been developed more recently, although the first atypical antipsychotic, [[clozapine]], was discovered in the 1960s and introduced clinically in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hippius| first = H.| date = 1989-03-01| title = The history of clozapine| journal = Psychopharmacology| language = en| volume = 99| issue = 1| pages = S3–S5| doi = 10.1007/BF00442551| pmid = 2682730| issn = 0033-3158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both generations of medication [[dopamine receptor antagonist|block receptors in the brain for dopamine]], but atypicals tend to act on [[serotonin]] receptors as well. ''Neuroleptic'', originating from {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:νεῦρον|νεῦρον]]}} (''neuron'') and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λαμβάνω|λαμβάνω]]}} (''take hold of'') – thus meaning ''&quot;which takes the nerve&quot;'' – refers to both common [[neurological]] effects and side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = King C, Voruganti LN | title = What's in a name?

==Medical uses==
Antipsychotics are most frequently used for the following conditions:
* [[Schizophrenia]]
* [[Schizoaffective disorder]] most commonly in conjunction with either an antidepressant (in the case of the depressive subtype) or a mood stabiliser (in the case of the bipolar subtype). 
* [[Bipolar disorder]] (acute mania and mixed episodes) may be treated with either typical or atypical antipsychotics, although atypical antipsychotics are usually preferred because they tend to have more favourable adverse effect profiles&lt;ref name=Lancet2009/&gt; and, according to a recent meta-analysis, they tend to have a lower liability for causing conversion from mania to depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haldep&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goikolea JM, Colom F, Torres I, Capapey J, Valentí M, Undurraga J, Grande I, Sanchez-Moreno J, Vieta E | title = Lower rate of depressive switch following antimanic treatment with second-generation antipsychotics versus haloperidol | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 144 | issue = 3 | pages = 191–8 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23089129 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2012.07.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Psychotic depression]]. In this indication it is a common practice for the psychiatrist to prescribe a combination of an atypical antipsychotic and an antidepressant as this practice is best supported by the evidence.&lt;ref name = Maudsley/&gt;
* [[Treatment-resistant depression|Treatment-resistant]] (and not necessarily psychotic) major depression as an adjunct to standard antidepressant therapy.&lt;ref name = Maudsley /&gt;

They are not recommended for [[dementia]] or [[insomnia]] unless other treatments have not worked.&lt;ref name=Choose2013/&gt; They are not recommended in children unless other treatments are not effective or unless the child has psychosis.&lt;ref name=Choose2013&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psychiatric Association Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question|url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-psychiatric-association/|work=Choosing Wisely|accessdate=23 September 2013|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203174206/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-psychiatric-association/|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
Antipsychotic drug treatment is a key component of schizophrenia treatment algorithms recommended by the [[National Institute of Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE),&lt;ref name=&quot;NICE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG178|title=Psychosis and schizophrenia in adults (CG178)|format=|website=|accessdate=|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304005556/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG178|archivedate=4 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Psychiatric Association,&lt;ref name = &quot;APA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/guidelines.aspx |title=PsychiatryOnline &amp;#124; Guidelines |format= |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British Society for Psychopharmacology.&lt;ref name = &quot;BAP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnes TR | title = Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–620 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21292923 | doi = 10.1177/0269881110391123 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ab27b4846958fa1133d4c74c7117f115d715e150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main effect of treatment with antipsychotics is to reduce the so-called &quot;positive&quot; symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations.  There is mixed evidence to support a significant impact of antipsychotic use on negative symptoms (such as apathy, lack of emotional affect, and lack of interest in social interactions) or on the cognitive symptoms (disordered thinking, reduced ability to plan and execute tasks) of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miyamoto S, Miyake N, Jarskog LF, Fleischhacker WW, Lieberman JA | title = Pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: a critical review of the pharmacology and clinical effects of current and future therapeutic agents | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 1206–27 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22584864 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2012.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hartling L, Abou-Setta AM, Dursun S, Mousavi SS, Pasichnyk D, Newton AS | title = Antipsychotics in adults with schizophrenia: comparative effectiveness of first-generation versus second-generation medications: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 157 | issue = 7 | pages = 498–511 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22893011 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-157-7-201210020-00525 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment in reducing both positive and negative symptoms appears to increase with increasing severity of baseline symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Furukawa TA, Levine SZ, Tanaka S, Goldberg Y, Samara M, Davis JM, Cipriani A, Leucht S | title = Initial severity of schizophrenia and efficacy of antipsychotics: participant-level meta-analysis of 6 placebo-controlled studies | journal = JAMA Psychiatry | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–21 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25372935 | doi = 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2014.2127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All antipsychotic medications work relatively the same way, by antagonizing D2 dopamine receptors. However, there are some differences when it comes to typical and atypical antipsychotics. For example, atypical antipsychotic medications have been seen to lower the neurocognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia more so than conventional antipsychotics, although the reasoning and mechanics of this are still unclear to researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keefe RS, Silva SG, Perkins DO, Lieberman JA | title = The effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs on neurocognitive impairment in schizophrenia: a review and meta-analysis | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–22 | date = 1999-01-01 | pmid = 10416727 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a033374 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia include prophylaxis in those showing symptoms that suggest that they are at high risk of developing psychosis, treatment of first episode psychosis, maintenance therapy, and treatment of recurrent episodes of acute psychosis.&lt;ref name = BAP /&gt;

====Prevention of psychosis and symptom improvement====
Test batteries such as the PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic) and COPS (Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes), which measure low level psychotic symptoms, and others focused on cognitive disturbances (Basic symptoms&quot;), are used to evaluate people with early, low level symptoms of psychosis.  Used in combination with family history information, these tests can identify a &quot;high risk&quot; group having a 20–40% risk of progression to frank psychosis within 2 years.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt; These patients are often treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs with the goal of reducing their symptoms and preventing progression to frank psychosis.  While generally useful for reducing symptoms, the clinical trials performed to date provide little evidence that early use of antipsychotics, alone or in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy, provides improved long term outcomes in those with prodromal symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg178/resources/cg178-psychosis-and-schizophrenia-in-adults-full-guideline3 |title=NICE Treatment Guidance 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-07 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813081133/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg178/resources/cg178-psychosis-and-schizophrenia-in-adults-full-guideline3 |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First episode psychosis====
NICE recommends that all persons presenting with a first episode of frank psychosis be treated with both an antipsychotic drug and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).  NICE further recommends that those expressing a preference for CBT alone be informed that combination treatment is more efficacious.&lt;ref name = NICE /&gt;  A diagnosis of schizophrenia is not normally made at this time, as up to 25% of those presenting with first episode psychosis are eventually found to suffer from bipolar disorder instead. The goals of treatment of these patients include reducing symptoms and potentially improving long-term treatment outcomes. Randomized clinical trials have provided evidence for the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in achieving the former goal, with first-generation and second generation antipsychotics showing about equal efficacy. Evidence that early treatment has a favorable effect on long term outcomes is equivocal.&lt;ref name = NICE /&gt;&lt;ref name = BAP /&gt;

====Recurrent psychotic episodes====
Placebo-controlled trials of both first and second generation antipsychotic drugs consistently demonstrate the superiority of active drug to placebo in suppressing psychotic symptoms.&lt;ref name = BAP /&gt; A large meta-analysis of 38 trials of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia acute psychotic episodes showed an effect size of about 0.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leucht S, Arbter D, Engel RR, Kissling W, Davis JM | title = How effective are second-generation antipsychotic drugs? A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 429–47 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 18180760 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4002136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is little or no difference in efficacy among approved antipsychotic drugs, including both first- and second-generation agents.&lt;ref name = NICE /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Leucht_2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leucht S, Cipriani A, Spineli L, Mavridis D, Orey D, Richter F, Samara M, Barbui C, Engel RR, Geddes JR, Kissling W, Stapf MP, Lässig B, Salanti G, Davis JM | title = Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: a multiple-treatments meta-analysis | journal = Lancet | volume = 382 | issue = 9896 | pages = 951–62 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23810019 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60733-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The efficacy of such drugs is suboptimal. Few patients achieve complete resolution of symptoms. Response rates, calculated using various cutoff values for symptom reduction, are low and their interpretation is complicated by high placebo response rates and selective publication of clinical trial results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beitinger R, Lin J, Kissling W, Leucht S | title = Comparative remission rates of schizophrenic patients using various remission criteria | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 1643–51 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18616969 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2008.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maintenance therapy====
The majority of patients treated with an antipsychotic drug will experience a response within 4 weeks.  The goals of continuing treatment are to maintain suppression of symptoms, prevent relapse, improve quality of life, and support engagement in psychosocial therapy.&lt;ref name = BAP /&gt;

Maintenance therapy with antipsychotic drugs is clearly superior to placebo in preventing relapse, but is associated with weight gain, movement disorders, and high dropout rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leucht S, Tardy M, Komossa K, Heres S, Kissling W, Davis JM 2012 CD008016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leucht S, Tardy M, Komossa K, Heres S, Kissling W, Davis JM | title = Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = CD008016 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22592725 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008016.pub2 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/028b667c29f665ab7f3c78334170c433f36df78c }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 3-year trial following persons receiving maintenance therapy after an acute psychotic episode found that 33% obtained long-lasting symptom reduction, 13% achieved remission, and only 27% experienced satisfactory quality of life. The effect of relapse prevention on long term outcomes is uncertain, as historical studies show little difference in long term outcomes before and after the introduction of antipsychotic drugs.&lt;ref name = BAP /&gt;

A significant challenge in the use of antipsychotic drugs for the prevention of relapse is the poor rate of compliance. In spite of the relatively high rates of adverse effects associated with these drugs, some evidence, including higher dropout rates in placebo arms compared to treatment arms in randomized clinical trials, suggest that most patients who discontinue treatment do so because of suboptimal efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leucht S, Tardy M, Komossa K, Heres S, Kissling W, Davis JM 2012 CD008016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinon BJ, Ascher-Svanum H, Adams DH, Chen L | title = The temporal relationship between symptom change and treatment discontinuation in a pooled analysis of 4 schizophrenia trials | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 544–9 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18794651 | doi = 10.1097/JCP.0b013e318185e74a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipolar disorder===
{{Main|Bipolar disorder}}
Antipsychotics are routinely used, often in conjunction with [[Mood stabilizer|mood stabilisers]] such as [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]]/[[Valproate semisodium|valproate]], as a first-line treatment for manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name= &quot;Maudsley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Taylor D, Paton C, Kapur S, Taylor D | title = The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry | year=2012 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, West Sussex, UK | isbn = 978-0-470-97948-8 | edition = 11th }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Young &gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Young LL, Kradjan WA, Guglielmo BJ, Corelli RL, Williams BR, Koda-Kimble MA | title = Applied therapeutics: the clinical use of drugs | year = 2009 | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 978-0-7817-6555-8 | pages = 3040 | edition = 9th }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this combination is the therapeutic delay of the aforementioned mood stabilisers (for valproate therapeutic effects are usually seen around five days after treatment is commenced whereas lithium usually takes at least a week&lt;ref name = &quot;Young&quot; /&gt; before the full therapeutic effects are seen) and the comparatively rapid antimanic effects of antipsychotic drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20402706&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Correll CU, Sheridan EM, DelBello MP | title = Antipsychotic and mood stabilizer efficacy and tolerability in pediatric and adult patients with bipolar I mania: a comparative analysis of acute, randomized, placebo-controlled trials | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–41 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20402706 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2010.00798.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antipsychotics have a documented efficacy when used alone in acute mania/mixed episodes.&lt;ref name=Lancet2009/&gt;

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommend antipsychotics for managing acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and as a longer-term maintenance treatment for reducing the likelihood of further episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15000267&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lehman AF, Lieberman JA, Dixon LB, McGlashan TH, Miller AL, Perkins DO, Kreyenbuhl J | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, second edition | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 161 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 1–56 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 15000267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists &amp; The British Psychological Society (2003).[http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=289559 ''Schizophrenia.

A number of studies have looked at levels of &quot;compliance&quot; or &quot;adherence&quot; with antipsychotic regimes and found that discontinuation (stopping taking them) by patients is associated with higher rates of relapse, including hospitalization.

:- Reduced perspiration
* [[Tardive dyskinesia]] appears to be more frequent with high-potency first-generation antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, and tends to appear after chronic and not acute treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stahl&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Stahl SM |title=Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications | url = https://archive.org/details/stahlsessentialp00stah | url-access = registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by slow (hence the ''tardive'') repetitive, involuntary and purposeless movements, most often of the face, lips, legs, or torso, which tend to resist treatment and are frequently irreversible. The rate of appearance of TD is about 5% per year of use of antipsychotic drug (whatever the drug used).

;Rare/Uncommon (&lt;1% incidence for ''most'' antipsychotic drugs) adverse effects of antipsychotics include:
* Blood dyscrasias (e.g., agranulocytosis, leukopaenia, and neutropaenia), which is more common in patients on clozapine. 
* [[Metabolic syndrome]] and other metabolic problems such as [[type II diabetes mellitus]] — particularly common with clozapine, olanzapine and zotepine.

===Long-term effects===

Loss of [[grey matter]] and other brain structural changes over time are observed in schizophrenia. Meta-analyses of the effects of antipsychotic treatment on the course of grey matter loss and structural changes have reached conflicting conclusions.  A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that grey matter loss is greater in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics relative to those treated with atypicals, and hypothesized a protective effect of atypicals as one possible explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vita A, De Peri L, Deste G, Sacchetti E | title = Progressive loss of cortical gray matter in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis and meta-regression of longitudinal MRI studies | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = e190 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23168990 | pmc = 3565772 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2012.116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second meta-analysis suggested that treatment with antipsychotics was associated with increased grey matter loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Radua J, Borgwardt S, Crescini A, Mataix-Cols D, Meyer-Lindenberg A, McGuire PK, Fusar-Poli P | title = Multimodal meta-analysis of structural and functional brain changes in first episode psychosis and the effects of antipsychotic medication | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 2325–33 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22910680 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2012.07.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle, long-lasting forms of [[akathisia]] are often overlooked or confused with post-psychotic depression, in particular when they lack the extrapyramidal aspect that psychiatrists have been taught to expect when looking for signs of akathisia.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14609248&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirose S | title = The causes of underdiagnosing akathisia | journal = Schizophrenia Bulletin | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 547–58 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14609248 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a007027 | url = http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/547.full.pdf?origin=publication_detail | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151015202235/http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/3/547.full.pdf?origin=publication_detail | df = dmy-all |url-status = live| archivedate = 15 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discontinuation===

Unexpected psychotic episodes have been observed in patients withdrawing from clozapine. This is referred to as supersensitivity psychosis, not to be equated with tardive psychosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

[[Tardive dyskinesia]] may abate during withdrawal from the antipsychotic agent, or it may persist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glazer-2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glazer WM | title = Expected incidence of tardive dyskinesia associated with atypical antipsychotics | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 61 Suppl 4 | issue =  | pages = 21–6 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10739327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Withdrawal effects may also occur when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (it is presumed due to variations of potency and receptor activity). Such withdrawal effects can include [[cholinergic]] rebound, an activation syndrome, and motor syndromes including [[dyskinesia]]s. These adverse effects are more likely during rapid changes between antipsychotic agents, so making a gradual change between antipsychotics minimises these withdrawal effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambert-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lambert TJ | title = Switching antipsychotic therapy: what to expect and clinical strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 68 Suppl 6 | issue =  | pages = 10–3 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17650054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British National Formulary]] recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = BMJ Group | title=British National Formulary |edition=57|date=March 2009 |publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain |location=United Kingdom |page=192 |chapter=4.2.1|quote=Withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs after long-term therapy should always be gradual and closely monitored to avoid the risk of acute withdrawal syndromes or rapid relapse.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of cross-titration involves gradually increasing the dose of the new medication while gradually decreasing the dose of the old medication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stahl&quot;/&gt;

===Second-generation (atypical)===
{{Main|Atypical antipsychotic}}

====Benzamides====
* [[Amisulpride]] &lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; – Selective dopamine antagonist. Higher doses (greater than 400&amp;nbsp;mg) act upon post-synaptic dopamine receptors resulting in a reduction in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as psychosis. Lower doses, however, act upon dopamine autoreceptors, resulting in increased dopamine transmission, improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Lower doses of amisulpride have also been shown to have [[antidepressant]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects in non-schizophrenic patients, leading to its use in [[dysthymia]] and [[social anxiety disorder|social phobias]].
* [[Nemonapride]] &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; – Used in Japan.
* [[Remoxipride]] &lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; – Has a risk of causing [[aplastic anaemia]] and, hence, has been withdrawn from the market worldwide. It has also been found to possess relatively low (virtually absent) potential to induce [[hyperprolactinaemia]] and [[extrapyramidal symptoms]], likely attributable to its comparatively weak binding to (and, hence, rapid dissociation from) the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor.&lt;ref name=atyp&gt;{{cite journal|title=Atypical Antipsychotics: Mechanism of Action|journal=FOCUS: The Journal of Lifelong Learning in Psychiatry|date=January 2004|volume=2|issue=1|pages=48–58|url=http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/FOCUS/2601/48.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144052/http://focus.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/FOCUS/2601/48.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sultopride]] – An atypical antipsychotic of the benzamide chemical class used in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong for the treatment of schizophrenia. It was launched by Sanofi-Aventis in 1976. Sultopride acts as a selective D2 and D3 receptor antagonist.

====Benzisoxazoles/benzisothiazoles====
* [[Iloperidone]] – Approved by the US FDA in 2009, it is fairly well tolerated, although [[hypotension]], [[dizziness]], and [[somnolence]] were very common side effects. Has not received regulatory approval in other countries, however.
* [[Lurasidone]] – Approved by the US FDA for schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Given once daily, it has shown mixed Phase III efficacy results but has a relatively well tolerated side effect profile. It is also licensed for use as schizophrenia treatment in Canada. Not yet licensed elsewhere, however. Has procognitive effects via its antagonism of the [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptor.
* [[Paliperidone]] – Primary, active metabolite of risperidone that was approved in 2006.
* [[Paliperidone palmitate]] – Long-acting version of paliperidone for once-monthly injection.
* [[Perospirone]] &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; – Has a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than other atypical antipsychotics.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNS Drugs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onrust SV, McClellan K | title = Perospirone | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–37; discussion 338 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11463136 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200115040-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Risperidone]] – Divided dosing is recommended until initial titration is completed, at which time the drug can be administered once daily. Used off-label to treat [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[anxiety disorder]].
* [[Ziprasidone]] – Approved in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nemeroff CB, Lieberman JA, Weiden PJ, Harvey PD, Newcomer JW, Schatzberg AF, Kilts CD, Daniel DG | title = From clinical research to clinical practice: a 4-year review of ziprasidone | journal = CNS Spectrums | volume = 10 | issue = 11 Suppl 17 | pages = 1–20 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16381088 | doi = 10.1017/S1092852900019842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to treat bipolar disorder. Side-effects include a prolonged [[QT interval]] in the heart, which can be dangerous for patients with [[heart disease]] or those taking other drugs that prolong the QT interval.

====Butyrophenones====
* [[Melperone]] &lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; – Only used in a few European countries. No English-speaking country has licensed it to date.

* [[Aripiprazole lauroxil]] – Long-acting version of aripiprazole for injection.
* [[Brexpiprazole]] – Partial agonist of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. Successor of aripiprazole.
* [[Cariprazine]] – A D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-preferring D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; partial agonist.

====Tricyclics====
* [[Asenapine]] – Used for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.
* [[Clozapine]] – Requires routine laboratory monitoring of [[complete blood count]]s every one to four weeks due to the risk of [[agranulocytosis]]. It has unparalleled efficacy in the treatment of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
* [[Olanzapine]] – Used to treat psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute [[Mania|manic]] episodes, and maintenance of [[bipolar disorder]]. Used as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy, either alone or in combination with [[fluoxetine]] as [[Olanzapine/fluoxetine|Symbyax]].
* [[Quetiapine]] – Used primarily to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Also used and licensed in a few countries (including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States) as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in patients with [[major depressive disorder]]. It's the only antipsychotic that's demonstrated efficacy as a monotherapy for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]]. It indirectly serves as a [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] by means of its active metabolite, norquetiapine.
* [[Zotepine]] – An atypical antipsychotic indicated for acute and chronic schizophrenia. It is still used in Japan and was once used in Germany but it was discontinued.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;

====Others====
* [[Blonanserin]] – Approved by the PMDA in 2008. Used in Japan and South Korea.
* [[Pimavanserin]] – A selective 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis in 2016.
* [[Sertindole]] &lt;sup&gt;‡&lt;/sup&gt; – Developed by the Danish pharmaceutical company [[H. Lundbeck]]. Like the other atypical antipsychotics, it is believed to have [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] activity at dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.

Antipsychotic drugs such as [[haloperidol]] and [[chlorpromazine]] tend to block [[dopamine]] [[dopamine receptor|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]] in the [[dopaminergic pathways]] of the [[Human brain|brain]]. This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] has been linked to psychotic experiences. Decreased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, and excess dopamine release in other pathways, are associated with psychotic episodes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pickar D, Litman RE, Konicki PE, Wolkowitz OM, Breier A | title = Neurochemical and neural mechanisms of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia | journal = &lt;!-- --&gt; | volume = 24 | issue =  | pages = 124–51 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1970851 | doi =  10.1159/000418015| series = Modern Problems of Pharmacopsychiatry | isbn = 978-3-8055-5050-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liemburg EJ, Knegtering H, Klein HC, Kortekaas R, Aleman A | title = Antipsychotic medication and prefrontal cortex activation: a review of neuroimaging findings | journal = European Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 387–400 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22300864 | doi = 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2011.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the antagonistic effects of dopamine, antipsychotics (in particular atypical neuroleptics) also antagonize [[5-HT2A|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]]. Different [[allele]]s of the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor have been associated with schizophrenia and other psychoses, including depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonald 41–63&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonald C, Murphy KC | title = The new genetics of schizophrenia | journal = The Psychiatric Clinics of North America | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–63 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12683259 | doi = 10.1016/S0193-953X(02)00030-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt CJ, Sorensen SM, Kehne JH, Carr AA, Palfreyman MG | title = The role of 5-HT2A receptors in antipsychotic activity | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 56 | issue = 25 | pages = 2209–22 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7791509 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(95)00210-W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher concentrations of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in cortical and subcortical areas, in particular in the right [[caudate nucleus]] have been historically recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonald 41–63&quot;/&gt;

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block dopamine receptors in the [[mesocortical pathway]], [[tuberoinfundibular pathway]], and the [[nigrostriatal pathway]]. Blocking D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some unwanted [[adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as [[haloperidol]], in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[thioridazine]], which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side-effects.

[[Atypical antipsychotic]] drugs have a similar blocking effect on D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors; however, most also act on serotonin receptors, especially [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt;]] receptors. Both clozapine and quetiapine appear to bind just long enough to elicit antipsychotic effects but not long enough to induce extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin hypersecretion.&lt;ref name=Atypicality&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=SM|title=Describing an Atypical Antipsychotic: Receptor Binding and Its Role in Pathophysiology|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry|year=2003|volume=5|issue=Suppl. 3|pages=9–13|url=http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0302.pdf|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016080356/http://www.psychiatrist.com/pcc/pccpdf/v05s03/v05s0302.pdf|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; antagonism increases dopaminergic activity in the [[nigrostriatal pathway]], leading to a lowered extrapyramidal side effect liability among the atypical antipsychotics.&lt;ref name = Atypicality /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|name-list-format=vanc|last1=Gross|first1=Gerhard|last2=Geyer|first2=Mark A.|title=Current Antipsychotics|year=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-25761-2|pages=88–89|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-25761-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Thorazine advert.jpg|thumb|Advertisement for Thorazine ([[chlorpromazine]]) from the 1950s, reflecting the perceptions of psychosis, including the now-discredited perception of a tendency towards violence, from the time when antipsychotics were discovered&lt;ref&gt;The text reads: &quot;When the patient lashes out against 'them' - THORAZINE (brand of chlorpromazine) quickly puts an end to his violent outburst. 'Thorazine' is especially effective when the psychotic episode is triggered by delusions or hallucinations. At the outset of treatment, Thorazine's combination of antipsychotic and sedative effects provides both emotional and physical calming. Assaultive or destructive behavior is rapidly controlled. As therapy continues, the initial sedative effect gradually disappears. But the antipsychotic effect continues, helping to dispel or modify delusions, hallucinations and confusion, while keeping the patient calm and approachable. SMITH KLINE AND FRENCH LABORATORIES leaders in psychopharmaceutical research.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, [[chlorpromazine]], was developed as a surgical [[anesthetic]]. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a non-permanent &quot;pharmacological [[lobotomy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=pieters&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pieters T, Majerus B | title = The introduction of chlorpromazine in Belgium and the Netherlands (1951-1968); tango between old and new treatment features | journal = Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 443–52 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22035718 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsc.2011.05.003 | url = http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/2251 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170709194021/http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/2251 | df = dmy-all |url-status = live| archivedate = 9 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than lobotomy, even though it was known to be capable of causing severe sedation. The underlying [[neurochemistry]] involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.

The discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to further research that resulted in the development of [[antidepressant]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, [[Henri Laborit]] described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and [[Jean Delay]] and [[Pierre Deniker]] described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, D. 2005. Psychiatric Drugs Explained. 4th Ed. Britain:Elsevier Limited. P. 8, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1970s there was considerable debate within psychiatry on the most appropriate term to use to describe the new drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = King C, Voruganti LN | title = What's in a name?

Thus, the word means ''taking hold of one's nerves''. It was often taken to refer also to common side effects such as reduced activity in general, as well as lethargy and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and in some cases harmful, they were at one time, along with akathisia, considered a reliable sign that the drug was working.&lt;ref name=pieters /&gt; The term &quot;ataraxy&quot; was coined by the neurologist Howard Fabing and the classicist Alister Cameron to describe the observed effect of psychic indifference and detachment in patients treated with chlorpromazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| name-list-format = vanc| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-63353-6| last = Owens| first = David Griffith Cunningham| title = A guide to the extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotic drugs| date = 1999-04-13| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RwRSahg71GkC&amp;pg=PA12| page = 12|url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160318004651/https://books.google.com/books?id=RwRSahg71GkC&amp;pg=PA12| archivedate = 18 March 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term derived from the Greek adjective &quot;[[wikt:ἀτάρακτος|ἀτάρακτος]]&quot; (''[[wikt:ataractic|ataraktos]]''), which means &quot;not disturbed, not excited, without confusion, steady, calm&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;/&gt; In the use of the terms &quot;tranquilizer&quot; and &quot;ataractic&quot;, medical practitioners distinguished between the &quot;major tranquilizers&quot; or &quot;major ataractics&quot;, which referred to drugs used to treat psychoses, and the &quot;minor tranquilizers&quot; or &quot;minor ataractics&quot;, which referred to drugs used to treat [[neurosis|neuroses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;/&gt; While popular during the 1950s, these terms are infrequently used today. They are being abandoned in favor of &quot;antipsychotic&quot;, which refers to the drug's desired effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;/&gt; Today, &quot;minor tranquilizer&quot; can refer to [[anxiolytic]] and/or [[hypnotic]] drugs such as the [[benzodiazepine]]s and [[nonbenzodiazepines]], which have some antipsychotic properties and are recommended for concurrent use with antipsychotics, and are useful for insomnia or drug-induced psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc| publisher = Saunders| isbn = 978-0-7216-5257-3 |last = Tasman| first = Allan| title = Psychiatry Volume 2| page = 956| year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are powerful (and potentially addictive) sedatives.

Antipsychotics are broadly divided into two groups, the [[typical antipsychotic|typical or first-generation antipsychotics]] and the [[atypical antipsychotic|atypical or second-generation antipsychotics]]. The typical antipsychotics are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical antipsychotics are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see [[dopamine antagonist]] and [[serotonin antagonist]]), multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and [[dopamine partial agonists]], which are often categorized as atypicals.&lt;ref name=Horacek2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horacek J, Bubenikova-Valesova V, Kopecek M, Palenicek T, Dockery C, Mohr P, Höschl C | title = Mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs and the neurobiology of schizophrenia | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–409 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16696579 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
The term ''major tranquilizer'' was used for older antipsychotic drugs. The term ''neuroleptic'' is often used as a [[synonym]] for ''antipsychotic'', even though - strictly speaking - the two terms are not interchangeable. ''Antipsychotic'' drugs are a subgroup of ''neuroleptic'' drugs, because the latter have a wider range of effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ea_QVG2BFy8C&amp;pg=PA675&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiaoYvPs7DNAhUJTSYKHZGZAm0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title=Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology, and the Neurosciences|last=Ayd|first=Frank J.|date=2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781724685|page=675|language=en|chapter=neuroleptic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.

Antipsychotics are a type of [[psychoactive]] or psychotropic medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patel|first1=Sudha C.|last2=Jakopac|first2=Kim A.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Manual of Psychiatric Nursing Skills|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449613563|page=317|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fN9932sGu1kC|language=en|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
Antipsychotics were once among the biggest selling and most profitable of all drugs, generating $22&amp;nbsp;billion in global sales in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;healthcarefinancenews.com&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218005726/http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/press-release/pipeline-antipsychotic-drugs-drive-next-market-evolution Pipelineantipsychotic drugs to drive next market evolution (2009)]. Healthcarefinancenews.com (7 August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2003 in the US, an estimated 3.21&amp;nbsp;million patients received antipsychotics, worth an estimated $2.82&amp;nbsp;billion. Over 2/3 of prescriptions were for the newer, more expensive atypicals, each costing on average $164 per year, compared to $40 for the older types.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17158480&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aparasu RR, Bhatara V | title = Antipsychotic use and expenditure in the United States | journal = Psychiatric Services | volume = 57 | issue = 12 | pages = 1693 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17158480 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.57.12.1693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, sales in the US reached $14.6&amp;nbsp;billion, the biggest selling drugs in the US by therapeutic class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imshealth.com/portal/site/imshealth/menuitem.a46c6d4df3db4b3d88f611019418c22a/?vgnextoid=85f4a56216a10210VgnVCM100000ed152ca2RCRD&amp;cpsextcurrchannel=1 2008 U.S. Sales and Prescription Information: Top Therapeutic Classes by U.S. Sales (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416162222/http://www.imshealth.com/portal/site/imshealth/menuitem.a46c6d4df3db4b3d88f611019418c22a/?vgnextoid=85f4a56216a10210VgnVCM100000ed152ca2RCRD&amp;cpsextcurrchannel=1 |date=16 April 2010 }}.

===Formulations===

Antipsychotics are sometimes administered as part of compulsory psychiatric treatment via [[involuntary commitment|inpatient (hospital) commitment]] or [[outpatient commitment]]. They may be administered orally or, in some cases, through long-acting (depot) injections administered in the [[dorsogluteal muscle|dorsgluteal]], [[ventrogluteal area|ventrogluteal]] or [[deltoid muscle]].

===Controversy===
Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient.&lt;ref name=&quot;guard 1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Myth of the antipsychotic |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/02/mythoftheantipsychotic |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=27 July 2012 |first=Adam |last=James |date=2 March 2008 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108170147/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/02/mythoftheantipsychotic |archivedate=8 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of this class of drugs has a history of criticism in residential care. As the drugs used can make patients calmer and more compliant, critics claim that the drugs can be overused. Outside doctors can feel under pressure from care home staff.&lt;ref&gt;''GPs under 'pressure' to issue neuroleptics, claims professor'', Chemist + Druggist, 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In an official review commissioned by UK government ministers it was reported that the needless use of antipsychotic medication in dementia care was widespread and was linked to 1800 deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nick Triggle |title=Dementia drug use 'killing many' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8356423.stm |date=12 November 2009 |newspaper=BBC |accessdate=2013-05-07 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426202920/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8356423.stm |archivedate=26 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK study warns against antipsychotics for dementia |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/12/dementia-drugs-idUSLC44347420091112 |date=Nov 12, 2009 |newspaper=reuters |accessdate=2013-05-07 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720105333/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/12/dementia-drugs-idUSLC44347420091112 |archivedate=20 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the government has initiated legal action against the pharmaceutical company [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] for allegedly paying [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] to [[Omnicare]] to promote its antipsychotic [[risperidone]] (Risperdal) in nursing homes.&lt;ref name=Hilzenrath&gt;{{cite news |author=Hilzenrath, David S. |date=16 January 2010 |title=Justice suit accuses Johnson &amp; Johnson of paying kickbacks |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011503903.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=17 January 2010 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110143259/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/15/AR2010011503903.html |archivedate=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been controversy about the [[Pharmaceutical marketing|role of pharmaceutical companies in marketing]] and promoting antipsychotics, including allegations of downplaying or covering up adverse effects, expanding the number of conditions or illegally promoting off-label usage; influencing drug trials (or their publication) to try to show that the expensive and profitable newer atypicals were superior to the older cheaper typicals that were out of patent. Following charges of illegal marketing, settlements by two large pharmaceutical companies in the US set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations.&lt;ref name=bied2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |first=Duff |last=Wilson |date=October 2, 2010 |work=New York Times |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623234334/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=23 June 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One case involved [[Eli Lilly and Company]]'s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]].

Harvard medical professor [[Joseph Biederman]] conducted research on bipolar disorder in children that led to an increase in such diagnoses. A 2008 Senate investigation found that Biederman also received $1.6 million in speaking and consulting fees between 2000 and 2007&amp;nbsp;— some of them undisclosed to Harvard&amp;nbsp;— from companies including makers of antipsychotic drugs prescribed for children with bipolar disorder. [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, where research was conducted, in part, on [[Risperdal]], the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment.&lt;ref name=bied2010/&gt;

Pharmaceutical companies have also been accused of attempting to set the mental health agenda through activities such as funding [[consumer advocacy groups]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15278977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gosden R, Beder S | title = Pharmaceutical industry agenda setting in mental health policies | journal = Ethical Human Sciences and Services | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 147–59 | year = 2001 | pmid = 15278977 | doi =  | url = http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/pharm-agenda.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100430002638/http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/pharm-agenda.html | df = dmy-all |url-status = live| archivedate = 30 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
