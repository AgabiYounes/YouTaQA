'''Andreas Schlüter''' (1659 – c. June 1714) was a German [[baroque]] sculptor and architect, active in the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]], the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Tsardom]].

==Biography==
Andreas Schlüter was born probably in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''nach älteren Quellen angeblich am 20. Mai 1664 in Hamburg als Sohn des Bildhauers Gerhart Schlüter geboren'' – [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz78554.html#adbcontent ''Andreas Schlüter''], in: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]] (ADB). Bd. 55, Leipzig 1910, S. 184–194.&lt;/ref&gt; His early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented. The records of [[St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg]] show that an Andreas Schlüter, son of sculptor Gerhart Schlüter, had been baptized there on 22 May 1664. Documents from [[Gdańsk|Danzig]]/Gdańsk ([[Royal Prussia]]) reported that an Andreas Schlüter ''(senior)'' had worked 1640–1652 in Danzig's Jopengasse lane (today's ulica Piwna). Possibly born in 1640, an ''Andres Schliter'' is recorded as apprentice on 9 May 1656 by the mason's guild. Other sources state 1659 as year of birth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] online article on [[Zeughaus]] [http://www.dhm.de/magazine/zeughaus/Skulpturenschmuck.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He probably did spend several years abroad as [[Journeyman]]. His first work, in 1675, may have been epitaphs of the Dukes [[Sambor II, Duke of Pomerania|Sambor]] and [[Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania|Mestwin]] in the dome of [[Pelplin monastery]].

Schlüter's first known work was the decoration of the facade of the [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] Royal Chapel, in 1681. He later created statues for King [[John III Sobieski]]'s [[Wilanów Palace]] in [[Warsaw]] and sepulchral sculptures in [[Zhovkva Castle|Żółkiew (Zhovkva)]]. In 1689, he moved to Warsaw and made the [[pediment]] reliefs and sculptural work of [[Jan Dobrogost Krasiński|Krasiński Palace]].

Schlüter was invited to [[Berlin]] in 1694 by [[Eberhard von Danckelmann]] to work as court sculptor at the [[Zeughaus|armory (''Zeughaus'')]] for Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]]. His sculpted decorations are a masterpiece of baroque expression and [[pathos]]. While the more visible reliefs on the outside had to praise fighting, the statues of dying warriors in the interior denounced war and gave an indication of his pacifist religious beliefs (he is said to have been a [[Mennonite]]). Travelling through Italy in 1696, he studied the work of masters like [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].

Schlüter also worked as an architect and built many state buildings in Berlin in his role as &quot;Hofbaumeister&quot; (Court Architect), which he lost when one tower showed signs of a weak fundament. He also served as director of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]] from 1702 to 1704, after which he began concentrating on sculpting again, as &quot;Hofbildhauer&quot; (Court Sculptor). His most important [[equestrian sculpture]] is that of the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William of Brandenburg]], cast in 1708 and placed at &quot;Lange Brücke&quot; near the [[Berlin City Palace]], now situated in the honor court before [[Charlottenburg Palace]].

The Berlin City Palace, and many of his works, were partially destroyed by bombing in [[World War II]] and by the subsequent [[German Democratic Republic|Communist regime]]. A similar fate probably befell the [[Amber Room]], made between 1701 and 1709, Schlüter's most famous work of architecture.

In 1713 Schlüter's fame brought him to work for Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he died of an illness after creating several designs. Together with [[Johann Friedrich Braunstein]], he designed the [[Peterhof Grand Palace|Grand Palace]] and [[Monplaisir Palace]] in [[Peterhof Palace Complex]]. Also the city's oldest building, [[Kikin Hall]], and the reliefs at the [[Summer Palace (Saint Petersburg)|Summer Palace]] are attributed to him. This way he became an important figure of [[Petrine Baroque]].
