'''ArgoUML''' is an [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagramming application written in Java and released under the [[Open-source license|open source]] [[Eclipse Public License]].  By virtue of being a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application, it is available on any platform supported by [[Java SE]].

==History==
ArgoUML was originally developed at [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] by Jason E. Robbins, leading to his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] It is now an open source project hosted by [[Tigris.org]]. The ArgoUML project now includes more than 19,000 registered users and over 150 developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech-transition.html |title=Tech Transitions at ISR UCI |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120128012458/http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech-transition.html |archivedate=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, ArgoUML won the Software Development Magazine's annual Readers' Choice Award in the “Design and Analysis Tools” category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ddj.com/architect/184414997#designtools | title = Dr. Dobb's Readers' Choice Awards, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArgoUML development has suffered from lack of manpower. For example, ''Undo'' has been a perpetually requested feature since 2003 but has not been implemented yet.&lt;ref&gt;Issue 1834 (May 5th, 2003): Implement undo. http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1834&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
According to the official feature list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://argouml.tigris.org/features.html | title = ArgoUML Features }}&lt;/ref&gt; ArgoUML is capable of the following: 
*All 9 UML 1.4 diagrams are supported.
*Closely follows the UML standard.
*Platform independent – Java 1.5+ and C++.
*Click and Go! with Java Web Start (no setup required, starts from your web browser).
*Standard UML 1.4 Metamodel.
*[[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] support.
*Export diagrams as [[GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[PostScript|PS]], [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[PGML]] and [[SVG]].
*Available in ten languages: EN, EN-GB, DE, ES, IT, RU, FR, NB, PT, ZH.
*Advanced diagram editing and zoom.
*Built-in design critics provide unobtrusive review of design and suggestions for improvements.
*Extensible modules interface.
*[[Object Constraint Language|OCL]] support.
*Forward engineering (code generation supports C++ and C#, Java, PHP&amp;nbsp;4, PHP&amp;nbsp;5, Ruby and, with less mature modules, Ada, Delphi and SQL).
*Reverse engineering / [[JAR (file format)|JAR]]/class file import.

==Weaknesses==
*ArgoUML does not yet completely implement the UML standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://argouml.tigris.org/documentation/umlsupport/index.html | work = ArgoUML documentation | title = UML Specification Incompatibility list }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Partial undo feature (working for graphics edits &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://argouml.tigris.org/servlets/NewsItemView?newsItemID=1228
|title=ArgoUML 0.19.3 released
}} Undo working for graphics edits (this is mostly a GEF addition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1834
|title=Issue 1834. Implement undo
}} Undo working for graphics edits (this is mostly a GEF addition).&lt;/ref&gt;)
