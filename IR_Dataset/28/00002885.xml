==Medical uses==
[[Image:Amoxicillin.JPG|thumb|right|Amoxicillin [[British Pharmacopoeia|BP]]]]
Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including [[acute otitis media]], [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[Cellulitis|skin infections]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, ''[[Salmonella]]'' infections, [[Lyme disease]], and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] infections.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davisamox&gt;{{cite web | url = http://davisplus.fadavis.com/3976/meddeck/pdf/amoxicillin.pdf | access-date = March 22, 2017 | publisher = Davis | title = Amoxicillin | date = 2017 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908135951/https://davisplus.fadavis.com/3976/meddeck/pdf/amoxicillin.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute otitis media===
Children with acute otitis media who are younger than 6 months of age are generally treated with amoxicillin or other antibiotic. Although most children with acute otitis media who are older than two years old do not benefit from treatment with amoxicillin or other antibiotic, such treatment may be helpful in children younger than two years old with acute otitis media that is bilateral or accompanied by ear drainage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venekamp|first=Roderick P.|last2=Sanders|first2=Sharon L.|last3=Glasziou|first3=Paul P.|last4=Del Mar|first4=Chris B.|last5=Rovers|first5=Maroeska M.|date=2015-06-23|title=Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD000219|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000219.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26099233|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:293244/UQ293244_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, amoxicillin was dosed three times daily when used to treat acute otitis media, which resulted in missed doses in routine ambulatory practice. There is now evidence that two times daily dosing or once daily dosing has similar effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thanaviratananich S, Laopaiboon M, Vatanasapt P |title=Once or twice daily versus three times daily amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=12 |pages=CD004975 |date=December 2013 |pmid=24338106 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004975.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiratory infections===
Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate have been recommended by guidelines as the drug of choice for bacterial [[sinusitis]] and other respiratory infections.&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt; Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAAAIfive&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |authors = American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |author1-link = American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] |journal = Choosing Wisely: An Initiative of the ABIM Foundation |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AAAAI.pdf |accessdate = August 14, 2012 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151124/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_AAAAI.pdf |archivedate = November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the small benefit gained by amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;antibioticssinusitis&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahovuo-Saloranta | first1 = A. | last2 = Rautakorpi | first2 = U.

Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]], either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a [[macrolide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0071334/|title=Pneumonia - National Library of Medicine - PubMed Health|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908135935/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0071334/|archivedate=2017-09-08|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK)|year=2014|series=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence: Clinical Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not &quot;severe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK264162/|title=Revised WHO Classification and Treatment of Pneumonia in Children at Health Facilities - NCBI Bookshelf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908135935/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK264162/|archivedate=2017-09-08|isbn=9789241507813|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2014|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of [[anthrax]] to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis.&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt;

===''H. pylori''===
It is effective as one part of a multi-drug regimen for treatment of stomach infections of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''. It is typically combined with a [[proton-pump inhibitor]] (such as [[omeprazole]]) and a [[macrolide antibiotic]] (such as [[clarithromycin]]); other drug combinations are also effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chey WD, Leontiadis GI, Howden CW, Moss SF |title=ACG Clinical Guideline: Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=112 |issue=2 |pages=212–239 |date=February 2017 |pmid=28071659 |doi=10.1038/ajg.2016.563 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyme borreliosis===
Amoxicillin is effective for treatment of early cutaneous [[Lyme borreliosis]]; the effectiveness and safety of oral amoxicillin is neither better nor worse than common alternatively-used antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Torbahn G, Hofmann H, Rücker G, Bischoff K, Freitag MH, Dersch R, Fingerle V, Motschall E, Meerpohl JJ, Schmucker C |title=Efficacy and Safety of Antibiotic Therapy in Early Cutaneous Lyme Borreliosis: A Network Meta-analysis |journal=JAMA Dermatol |volume=154 |issue=11 |pages=1292–1303 |date=November 2018 |pmid=30285069 |pmc=6248135 |doi=10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.3186 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin infections===
Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections,&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt; such as [[acne vulgaris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Adolescent Acne: Management | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430534_5 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222205124/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/430534_5 | archivedate = 2010-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as [[doxycycline]] and [[minocycline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceofacne.com/amoxicillin/ |title=Amoxicillin and Acne Vulgaris |publisher=scienceofacne.com |date=2012-09-05 |accessdate=2012-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721002339/http://scienceofacne.com/amoxicillin/ |archivedate=2012-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infections in infants in resource-limited settings===
Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with [[gentamicin]] is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321136/|title=Guideline: Managing Possible Serious Bacterial Infection in Young Infants When Referral Is Not Feasible - NCBI Bookshelf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908135935/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK321136/|archivedate=2017-09-08|isbn=9789241509268|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2015|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention of bacterial endocarditis===
It is also used to prevent [[bacterial endocarditis]] in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without [[spleen]]s, such as people with [[sickle-cell disease]], and for both the prevention and the treatment of [[anthrax]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CG64 Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis: Full guidance |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11938/40039/40039.pdf |work=NICE |accessdate=8 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112000314/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/11938/40039/40039.pdf |archivedate=12 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thornhill |first=MH |last2=Dayer |first2=MJ |last3=Forde |first3=JM |last4=Corey |first4=GR |last5=Chu |first5=VH |last6=Couper |first6=DJ |last7=Lockhart |first7=PB|title=Impact of the NICE guideline recommending cessation of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infective endocarditis: before and after study|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) |date=2011-05-03 |volume=342 |pages=d2392 |pmid=21540258 |doi=10.1136/bmj.d2392 |pmc=3086390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination treatment===
Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by [[beta-lactamase|β-lactamase]]-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as [[penicillin]]. For this reason, it may be combined with [[clavulanic acid]], a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called [[Coamoxiclav|co-amoxiclav]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amoxicillin Susceptibility and Resistance Data|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/AmoxicillinClavulanate%20augmentin.pdf|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spectrum of activity ===

It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, [[β-lactam antibiotic]] in the [[aminopenicillin]] family used to treat susceptible [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. 
In general, ''[[Streptococcus]], [[Bacillus subtilis]], [[Enterococcus]], [[Haemophilus]], [[Helicobacter]],'' and ''[[Moraxella]]'' are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas ''[[Citrobacter]], [[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' are resistant to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amoxicillin spectrum of bacterial susceptibility and Resistance|url=http://www.toku-e.com/Assets/MIC/Amoxicillin%20sodium%20salt.pdf |accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and most clinical strains of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees.

==Adverse effects==

[[Adverse drug reaction|Adverse effect]]s are similar to those for other [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s, including [[nausea]], vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated [[colitis]]. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer adverse effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these adverse effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously.  However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased.  For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the adverse effects can be fatal due to [[anaphylaxis]].

Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild [[hepatitis]] in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested [[lethargy]], vomiting, and [[Renal failure|renal dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-induced hepatitis | journal = Am.

There is poor reporting of adverse effects of amoxicillin from clinical trials. For this reason, the severity and frequency of adverse effects from amoxicillin is probably higher than reported from clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gillies M, Ranakusuma A, Hoffmann T, Thorning S, McGuire T, Glasziou P, Del Mar C |title=Common harms from amoxicillin: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials for any indication |journal=CMAJ |volume=187 |issue=1 |pages=E21–31 |date=January 2015 |pmid=25404399 |pmc=4284189 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.140848 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonallergic rash===
Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or [[ampicillin]]) show a late-developing (&gt;72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the &quot;amoxicillin rash&quot;. The rash can also occur in adults.

The rash is described as [[maculopapular]] or morbilliform ([[Measles|measles-like]]; therefore, in medical literature, it is called &quot;amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2654598 |title=Role of delayed cellular hypersensitivity and adhesion molecules in amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rashes |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |accessdate=2010-11-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229151904/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2654598 |archivedate=2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pichichero ME |title=A review of evidence supporting the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for prescribing cephalosporin antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients |journal=Pediatrics |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=1048–57 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15805383 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1276 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/4/1048 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218212827/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/115/4/1048 |archivedate=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schmitt, Barton D. |title=Your child's health: the parents' one-stop reference guide to symptoms, emergencies, common illnesses, behavior problems, healthy development |edition=2nd |publisher=Bantam Books |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-553-38369-0 |oclc= |doi= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/yourchildshealth00bart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of [[infectious mononucleosis]]. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute [[Epstein Barr virus]] infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kagan | first=B | title=Ampicillin rash |journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=126 |issue=4 |pages=333–335 |year=1977 | pmid=855325 | pmc=1237570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Amoxicillin (α-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin) is a semisynthetic derivative of penicillin with a structure similar to ampicillin but with better absorption when taken by mouth, thus yielding higher concentrations in blood and in urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handsfield HH, Clark H, Wallace JF, Holmes KK, Turck M |title=Amoxicillin, a new penicillin antibiotic |journal=Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=262–5 |date=February 1973 |pmid=4208282 |pmc=444397 |doi= 10.1128/AAC.3.2.262|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids. Penetration into the central nervous system increases in meningitis. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is excreted into the urine and metabolized by the liver. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults.&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt;

Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a bactericidal compound. It is effective against streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Escherichia coli'', ''Proteus mirabilis'', ''Neisseria meningitidis'', ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', ''Shigella'', ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', ''Salmonella'', ''Borrelia burgdorferi'', and ''Helicobacter pylori''.&lt;ref name = Davisamox/&gt; As a derivative of [[ampicillin]], amoxicillin is a member of the [[penicillin]] family and, like penicillins, is a [[β-lactam antibiotic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcamo2003&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Alcamo |first=I.

It has two [[ionizable]] groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=XiShDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423|editor-last=Sezer|editor-first=Ali Demir|publisher=[[Winchester Science Centre|INTECH]]|isbn=9789535116288|title=Application of Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery|date=2016|page=423|accessdate=2019-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of antibiotics}}
Amoxicillin was one of several [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid ([[6-APA]]) developed at [[Beecham Group|Beecham, England]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=978178 |status=patent |title=Penicillins |pubdate=1964-12-16 |fdate=1962-11-02 |pridate=1962-11-02 |invent1=John Herbert Charles Nayler |invent2=Harry Smith |assign1=Beecham Research Laboratories Ltd |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&amp;NR=978178A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=&amp;date=19641216&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=GB |number=1241844 |status=patent |title=Penicillins |pubdate=1971-08-04 |fdate=1968-08-23 |pridate=1968-08-23 |invent1=Anthony Alfred Walter Long |invent2=John Herber Charles Nayler |assign1=Beecham Group LTD |url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=GB&amp;NR=1241844&amp;KC=&amp;FT=E&amp;locale=en_EP}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became available in 1972 and was the second [[aminopenicillin]] to reach the market (after [[ampicillin]] in 1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geddes | first1 = AM | display-authors = etal   | date = Dec 2007 | title = Introduction: historical perspective and development of amoxicillin/clavulanate | url = | journal = Int J Antimicrob Agents | volume = 30 | issue = Suppl 2| pages = S109–12 | pmid = 17900874 | doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ravina&gt;{{cite book |last=Raviña |first=E |title=The Evolution of Drug Discovery |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2014 |page=262 |isbn=9783527326693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruggink |first=A |title=Synthesis of β-lactam antibiotics |publisher=Springer |year=2001 |page=17 |isbn=978-0-7923-7060-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coamoxiclav|Co-amoxiclav]] became available in 1981.&lt;ref name=Ravina/&gt;

== Society and culture ==
=== Modes of delivery ===
Pharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in tri[[hydrate]] form, for oral use available as capsules, regular, chewable and dispersible [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], syrup and [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] for oral use, and as the sodium salt for [[intravenous]] administration.  Amoxicillin is most commonly taken orally. The liquid forms are helpful where the patient might find it difficult to take tablets or capsules.

===Names ===
&lt;!--DO NOT ADD DRUG NAMES HERE.  THERE ARE TOO MANY TO LIST IN WIKIPEDIA--&gt;
&quot;Amoxicillin&quot; is the [[International Nonproprietary Name]] (INN), [[British Approved Name]] (BAN), and [[United States Adopted Name]] (USAN), while &quot;amoxycillin&quot; is the [[Australian Approved Name]] (AAN).

Amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]] scientists. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under various trade names across the world.&lt;ref name=brands&gt;{{cite web|title=International brand names for amoxicillin|url=https://www.drugs.com/international/amoxicillin.html|website=www.drugs.com|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=15 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529051432/http://www.drugs.com/international/amoxicillin.html|archivedate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
