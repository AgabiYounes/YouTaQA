'''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}}; {{lang-ale|Alax̂sxax̂}}; {{Lang-ik|Alaasikaq}}; [[Alutiiq language|Alutiiq]]: ''Alas'kaaq;'' [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]]: ''Anáaski;'' {{Lang-ru|Аляска|translit=Alyaska}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the northwest extremity of the North American [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], just across the [[Bering Strait]] from [[Asia]]. An [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] of the U.S., it borders the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian]] province of [[British Columbia]] and territory of [[Yukon]] to the east and southeast has a maritime border with [[Russia]]'s [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] to the west. To the north are the [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] and [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] seas of the [[Arctic Ocean]], while the [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the south and southwest. 

Alaska is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest U.S. state]] by area and the [[List of country subdivisions by area|seventh largest subnational division in the world]]. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|third least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|most sparsely populated]] state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]], with an estimated population of 738,432 as 2015—more than quadruple the combined populations of [[Northern Canada]] and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEstUS&quot; /&gt; Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]]. The state capital of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] is the second [[List of United States cities by area|largest city in the United States by area]], comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware.

Alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The state is considered the entry point for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]]. The Russians were the first non-native people to settle the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing the [[Russian America|colony of Alaska]] that spanned most of the current state. The expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|year=1959|title=Video: 49th Star. Alaska Statehood, New Flag, Official, 1959/01/05 (1959)|url=https://archive.org/details/1959-01-05_49th_Star_Alaska_Statehood|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=February 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515054607/http://archive.org/details/1959-01-05_49th_Star_Alaska_Statehood|archive-date=May 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it has one of the smallest state economies in the country, Alaska's [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|per capita income is among the highest]], owing to a diversified economy dominated by [[fishing]], [[natural gas]], and [[petroleum|oil]], all of which it has in abundance. [[United States armed forces]] bases and [[Tourism in Alaska|tourism]] are also a significant part of the [[Economy of Alaska|economy]]; more than half the state is federally owned public land, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], parks, and [[National wildlife refuge|wildlife refuges]].

Alaska's indigenous population is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AK|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Alaska|website=www.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to two dozen native languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Alaska&quot; ({{lang-rus|Аляска|r=Alyaska}}) was introduced in the [[Russian America|Russian colonial period]] when it was used to refer to the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It was derived from an [[Aleut language|Aleut-language]] [[idiom]], which figuratively refers to the mainland. Literally, it means ''object to which the action of the sea is directed''.&lt;ref name=Aleut&gt;{{cite book|title=Aleut Dictionary: Unangam Tunudgusii |editor=Bergsland, Knut |publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|year=1994|isbn=978-1-55500-047-9}}, at pp. 49 (Alaxsxi-x = mainland Alaska), 50 (''alagu-x'' = ''sea''), 508 (''-gi'' = suffix, ''object of its action'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book |title=Native American Placenames in the United States|author=Bright, William|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0806135984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. &quot;Derivation of the Word &quot;Alaska&quot;, &quot; ''American Anthropologist'' n.s., 42: pp. 550–551&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of Alaska}}

Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the [[Aleutian Islands]] extend into the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaska.gov/kids/learn/facts.htm|title=Facts About Alaska, Alaska Kids' Corner, State of Alaska|author=|date=|website=alaska.gov|accessdate=April 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109130340/http://alaska.gov/kids/learn/facts.htm|archive-date=January 9, 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska is the only non-[[Contiguous United States|contiguous]] U.S. state on continental North America; about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} of [[British Columbia]] (Canada) separates Alaska from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is technically part of the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]], often called [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;the Lower 48&quot;]]. The capital city, [[Juneau]], is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]] in Canada, to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south and southwest, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian [[Big Diomede Island]] and Alaskan [[Little Diomede Island]] are only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html |title=Alaska's Size in Perspective |accessdate=November 19, 2007 |author=Benson, Carl |date=September 2, 1998 |publisher=[[Geophysical Institute]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125211706/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html |archivedate=November 25, 2007 |url-status=dead }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alaska area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Alaska's size compared with the [[contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]] ([[Albers projection|Albers equal-area conic projection]])]]

Alaska is the largest state in the United States by total area at {{convert|663268|sqmi|km2|0}}, over twice the size of [[Texas]], the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries. Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: Texas, [[California]], and [[Montana]]. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.

===Regions===

There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions:

====South Central====

{{Main|South Central Alaska}}

The most populous region of Alaska, containing [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] and the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the [[Alaska Range]] and west of the [[Wrangell Mountains]] also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the [[Prince William Sound]] area and the communities of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref name=cities&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel Information on South Central Alaska|year=2006|url=http://www.welcometoalaska.com/SouthCentral.htm|accessdate=April 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419212447/http://welcometoalaska.com/SouthCentral.htm|archive-date=April 19, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southeast====

{{Main|Southeast Alaska}}

Also referred to as the Panhandle or [[Inside Passage]], this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the [[Alaska Purchase]]. The region is dominated by the [[Alexander Archipelago]] as well as the [[Tongass National Forest]], the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital [[Juneau]], the former capital [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]], at one time Alaska's largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html |title=1927: When Ketchikan was the Largest City in Alaska |website=Sitnews US |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510144910/http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html |archive-date=May 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities ([[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOT Document&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities |publisher= Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities |url= http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/doc/presskit.pdf |title= The Alaska Marine Highway System |access-date= April 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130330013507/http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/doc/presskit.pdf |archivedate= March 30, 2013 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially designated in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Alaska Channel |website= Alaska.org |publisher= Alaska Channel |url= http://alaska.org/gettingaround/alaska-marine-highway.htm |title= Alaska Marine Highway |access-date= April 21, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120419072054/http://alaska.org/gettingaround/alaska-marine-highway.htm |archive-date= April 19, 2012 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interior====

{{Main|Alaska Interior}}
[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|[[Denali]] is the highest peak in North America.]]

The Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] is the only large city in the region. [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] is located here. ''[[Denali]]'' is the highest [[mountain]] in North America.

====Southwest====

{{Main|Southwest Alaska}}
[[File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grizzly bear]] fishing for [[salmon]] at [[Brooks Falls]], part of [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]]]]

Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some {{convert|500|mi|km}} inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. [[Kodiak Island]] is also located in Southwest. The massive [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. Portions of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

====North Slope====

{{Main|Alaska North Slope}}

The North Slope is mostly [[tundra]] peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]] and the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alaska.com |url=http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |title=Alaska.com |publisher=Alaska.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603064023/http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]], formerly known as Barrow, is the northernmost city in the United States and is located here. The [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic area]], anchored by [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and also containing the [[Kobuk River]] valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Aleutian Islands====

{{Main|Aleutian Islands}}

More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over {{convert|1200|mi}} into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the [[International Date Line]] was drawn west of [[180th meridian|180°]] to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.

===Natural features===

{{see also|Wildlife of Alaska}}
[[File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006 edited-1.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine Volcano]] erupting on January 12, 2006]]

With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly {{convert|34000|mi|km|-3}} of tidal shoreline. The [[Aleutian Islands]] chain extends west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. [[Unimak Island]], for example, is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to {{convert|10000|ft|m|-3}} above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's [[Mount Fuji]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of [[Wrangellia]], a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the [[Pacific Northwest]], which is actively undergoing [[plate tectonics|continent building]].

One of the world's largest tides occurs in [[Turnagain Arm]], just south of Anchorage, where tidal differences can be more than {{convert|35|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Porco, Peter|date = June 23, 2003 | title = Long said to be second to Fundy, city tides aren't even close | journal=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | pages = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an October 1998 report by the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as public lands, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], national parks, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrm.salrm.uaf.edu/~stodd/AlaskaPlanningDirectory/landOwnership.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628125756/http://nrm.salrm.uaf.edu/~stodd/AlaskaPlanningDirectory/landOwnership.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2002 |title=Alaska Land Ownership |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages {{convert|87|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising {{convert|16|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}.

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns {{convert|101|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, its entitlement under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]]. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another {{convert|44|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971. [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

===Climate===

{{Main|Climate of Alaska}}
[[File:Alaska Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Alaska]]
[[File:Alaska climate regions USGS.gif|thumb|Climate zones of Alaska]]

The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb'') in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfc'') in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over {{convert|50|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, and [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] averages over {{convert|150|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Monthly Climate Summary, Ketchikan, Alaska | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akketc | accessdate = February 7, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130516005502/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akketc | archive-date = May 16, 2013 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] receives {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, with around {{convert|75|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental/microthermal climate|Köppen: ''Dfc'']]) due to its brief, cool summers.

The climate of [[Southwest Alaska|Western Alaska]] is determined in large part by the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This [[region]] has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the [[Kobuk River]] valley (i.&amp;nbsp;e., the region around [[Kotzebue Sound]]) is technically a [[desert]], with portions receiving less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] average around {{convert|100|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-YK Precip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean Annual Precipitation, Alaska-Yukon|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~mabbott1/climate/mark/Images/AK-PPT-mm.gif|website=Spatial Climate Analysis Service|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=June 5, 2012|date=February 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025125522/http://www.pitt.edu/~mabbott1/climate/mark/Images/AK-PPT-mm.gif|archive-date=October 25, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below {{convert|-60|°F}}. Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire [[winter]].

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is {{convert|100|°F}} in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (which is just {{convert|8|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or|abbr=on}} inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards Information—Alaska Weather Interesting Facts and Records |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929022606/http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web|title=State Extremes |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105015744/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html |archivedate=January 5, 2007 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SD Weather History and Trivia for May: May 1 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 | accessdate = January 3, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208132328/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 | archive-date = February 8, 2007 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ ALASKA—Frequently Asked Questions About Alaska: Weather |publisher=Statewide Library Electronic Doorway, [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |date=January 17, 2005 |url=http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102180919/http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest official Alaska temperature is {{convert|−80|°F}} in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]] on January 23, 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI /&gt; one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in [[Snag, Yukon|Snag, Yukon, Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ned Rozell |title=The Coldest Place in North America |publisher=Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |date=January 23, 2003 |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040955/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is [[polar climate|Arctic]] ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP E: Polar climates|Köppen: ''ET'']]) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]] is {{convert|34|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PABR/2006/7/23/MonthlyHistory.html History for Barrow, Alaska.

Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/human-journey/|title=Map of Human Migration|access-date=November 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519020315/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/human-journey/|archive-date=May 19, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Upward Sun River site]] in the Tanana River Valley in Alaska, remains of a six-week-old infant were found. The baby's DNA showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the [[New World]] at the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Ben Potter, the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the Upward River Sun site in 2013, named this new group [[Ancient Beringians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/alaska-dna-ancient-beringia-genome/|title=Lost Native American Ancestor Revealed in Ancient Child's DNA|magazine=National Geographic|date=January 3, 2018|access-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103235253/https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/alaska-dna-ancient-beringia-genome/|archive-date=January 3, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tlingit people]] developed a society with a [[matrilineal]] kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the [[Haida people|Haida]], now well known for their unique arts. The [[Tsimshian]] people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President [[Grover Cleveland]], and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on [[Annette Island]] and found the town of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]. All three of these peoples, as well as other [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], experienced [[smallpox]] outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating [[epidemics]] occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Brian C. Hosmer, ''American Indians in the Marketplace: Persistence and Innovation among the Menominees and Metlakatlans, 1870–1920'' (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1999), pp. 129–131, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleutian Islands are still home to the [[Aleut people]]'s seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the [[Yup'ik]], while their cousins the [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq]] lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The [[Gwich'in people]] of the northern Interior region are [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. The North Slope and [[Little Diomede Island]] are occupied by the widespread [[Inupiat people]].

===Colonization===

{{Main|Russian America|Department of Alaska|District of Alaska}}
[[File:1860-russian-america.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of Russian America in 1860]]

Some researchers believe the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Свердлов Л. М. Русское поселение на Аляске в XVII в.? &quot;Природа&quot;. М., 1992. No. 4. С.67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several [[Koch (boat)|koches]] of [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]'s expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] geographer [[Nikolai Daurkin]], who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the [[Kheuveren]] River, populated by &quot;bearded men&quot; who &quot;pray to the [[icons]]&quot;. Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with [[Koyuk River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki |title=Outline of the History of Russian Cartography |website=Regions: a Prism to View the Slavic Eurasian World |year=2000 |first=Alexey V. |last=Postnikov |authorlink=Alexey Postnikov |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073034/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the ''St. Gabriel'' under the authority of the surveyor [[Mikhail Gvozdev|M. S. Gvozdev]] and assistant navigator [[Ivan Fyodorov (navigator)|I. Fyodorov]] on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian cossak [[Afanasiy Shestakov|A. F. Shestakov]] and Russian explorer [[Dmitry Pavlutsky]] (1729–1735).&lt;ref&gt;Аронов В. Н. Патриарх Камчатского мореходства. // &quot;Вопросы истории рыбной промышленности Камчатки&quot;: Историко-краеведческий сб.—Вып. 3.—2000. Вахрин С. Покорители великого океана. Петроп.-Камч.: Камштат, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when [[Vitus Bering]] led an [[second Kamchatka expedition|expedition]] for the Russian Navy aboard the ''St. Peter''. After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.
[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814]]

Between 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.

On March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire for the sum of $7.2&amp;nbsp;million. It was another six months before the commissioners arrived in Sitka and the formal transfer was arranged. The formal flag-raising took place at Fort Sitka on October 18, 1867. The original ceremony included 250 uniformed U.S. soldiers, who marched to the governor's house at &quot;Castle Hill&quot;. Here the Russian troops lowered the Russian flag and the U.S. flag was raised. This event is celebrated as [[Alaska Day]], a legal holiday on October 18.

[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.

[[File:Miners climb Chilkoot.jpg|thumb|Miners and prospectors climb the [[Chilkoot Trail]] during the 1898 [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]

For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a &quot;provisional city government&quot;, which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Keith|chapter=Learning to cope with 'Seward's Icebox'|title=The Alaskans|url=https://archive.org/details/alaskans00time|url-access=registration|year=1977|publisher=[[Time–Life Books]]|location=[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]|isbn=978-0-8094-1506-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alaskans00time/page/57 57–64]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and [[Home rule#Home rule in the United States|home rule]] for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.

===Alaska as a U.S. Territory===

{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Territory of Alaska}}

Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.
[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943]]

During World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands—[[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]]&lt;ref&gt;these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from continental USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from continental Alaska (U.S.), {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;—that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. During the occupation, one [[Aleut]] civilian was killed by Japanese troops and nearly fifty were interned in Japan, where about half of them died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-t6J21RGruEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Aleut+civilian+casualties&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj6mrac8NPlAhXSUt8KHWeID-0Q6AEwAnoECAIQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=aleut%20captured&amp;f=false|title=Attu: the forgotten battle|last=Cloe|first=John Haile|last2=|first2=|date=2017|publisher=Government Printing Office, United States National Park Service|year=|isbn=9780996583732|location=|pages=32|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unalaska]]/[[Dutch Harbor]] became a significant base for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[submarine]]rs.

The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

===Statehood===

{{See also|Alaska Statehood Act|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}

Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska—Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite]]

===Good Friday earthquake===

{{Main|1964 Alaska earthquake}}

On March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the [[Largest earthquakes by magnitude|second-most-powerful earthquake]] in the recorded history of the world, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]]. The time of day (5:36&amp;nbsp;pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.

===Discovery of oil===

The 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.

In 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spilling]] over {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and the proposed [[Pebble Mine]].

===Alaska Heritage Resources Survey===

The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted [[inventory]] of all reported [[historic site|historic]] and [[prehistoric]] sites within the state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology.

The 2018 [[gross state product]] was $55&amp;nbsp;billion, 48th in the nation. Its [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Robert|title=Top states for millionaires per capita|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101338309|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=January 22, 2014|date=January 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122061516/http://www.cnbc.com/id/101338309|archive-date=January 22, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

===Energy===

The [[heat pipe]]s in the column mounts are pertinent, since they disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of [[permafrost]].]]

Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the [[Energy Information Administration]], by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=ak |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=March 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522070348/http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=ak |archive-date=May 22, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rankings: Crude Oil Production, February 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=US&amp;CFID=11011948&amp;CFTOKEN=1da5d5e517e7a485-37ABEB4E-25B3-1C83-549C71EE21A56018&amp;jsessionid=84305d8fd0e59a4565705d1e106846494687#/series/46|publisher=United States Energy Information Administration|accessdate=May 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019131529/http://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=US&amp;CFID=11011948&amp;CFTOKEN=1da5d5e517e7a485-37ABEB4E-25B3-1C83-549C71EE21A56018&amp;jsessionid=84305d8fd0e59a4565705d1e106846494687#/series/46|archive-date=October 19, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, although by early 2014 North Dakota's [[Bakken Formation]] was producing over {{convert|900000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/stats/historicalbakkenoilstats.pdf | title=ND Monthly Bakken Oil Production Statistics | publisher=North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources | accessdate=May 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181113/https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/stats/historicalbakkenoilstats.pdf | archive-date=July 14, 2014 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudhoe Bay was the largest [[conventional oil]] field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous [[Athabasca oil sands]] field, which by 2014 was producing about {{convert | 1500000 | oilbbl/d | m3/d}} of [[unconventional oil]], and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=227308 | title=Crude Oil Forecast, Markets and Transportation | publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers | date=June 2013 | accessdate=May 21, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522084514/http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=227308 | archive-date=May 22, 2014 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] can transport and pump up to {{convert|2.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The [[United States Geological Survey]] estimates that there are {{convert|85.4|Tcuft|km3}} of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |title=Gas Hydrates on Alaska's North Slope |publisher=Usgs.gov |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601170523/http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |archivedate=June 1, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers.

Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]]) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014031/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan |date=April 2001 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.

====Permanent Fund====

The [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]]. The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900&amp;nbsp;million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.

The [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&amp;nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|website=apfc.org|access-date=May 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520095308/http://www.apfc.org/|archive-date=May 20, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 &quot;Resource Rebate&quot;). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420014117/http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.

The Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a &quot;[[Basic income]]&quot; policy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alaska's Citizens' Dividend Set To Be Near Highest Ever|url = http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|website = BIEN|accessdate = November 3, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103055141/http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of living===

The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Agriculture and fishing===

[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Halibut]], both as a sport fish and commercially, is important to the state's economy.]]

Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.

The [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].

Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&amp;printable=true&amp;contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth—USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117072838/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011%2F08%2F0338.xml&amp;printable=true&amp;contentidonly=true |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org |accessdate=June 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630050159/http://alaskapeonies.org/ |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. &quot;Alaska Grown&quot; is used as an agricultural slogan.

Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.

Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119004453/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;Outside&quot;]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Although most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620090230/http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http%3A%2F%2Ffuelgaugereport.opisnet.com%2Findex.asp|archive-date=June 20, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602043909/http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.
[[File:AlaskaSign.jpg|right|thumb|Alaska welcome sign on the [[Klondike Highway]]]]

The [[Interstate Highways in Alaska]] consists of a total of 1082 miles. One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]]. At {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}}, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;completion of the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on|1}} [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; project in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is the longest combination [[List of road-rail tunnels|road and rail tunnel]] in North America.

===Rail===

[[File:Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, In to the Tunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] traverses rugged terrain north of [[Skagway]] near the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].]]

Built around 1915, the [[Alaska Railroad]] (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as &quot;The Railbelt&quot;. In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.

The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.

In northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''

The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. (The nearest link to the North American railway network is the northwest terminus of the [[Canadian National Railway]] at [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], several hundred miles to the southeast.) In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&amp;nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |title=Alaska Oil / BC Tar sands via rail |author=Barbara Yaffe |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219014658/http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2138860820070622 | title=Economic study touts Alaska-Canada rail link | author=Allan Dowd | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 | agency=Reuters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713120019/https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-alaska-railway-dc/economic-study-touts-alaska-canada-rail-link-idUSN2138860820070621 | archive-date=July 13, 2019 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |title=Alaska Canada Rail Link |author=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=January 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425025223/http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].

===Marine transport===

Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.

[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|thumb|The {{MV|Tustumena}} (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]] and the [[Aleutian Chain]].]]

Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], in Canada through the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. The [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]] also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.

In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast. The population of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer, as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock, debarking thousands of passengers.

===Air transport===

Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed [[Alaskan Bush|bush]] air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska received almost two million visitors).&lt;ref&gt;
State of Alaska Office of Economic Development. ''[http://commerce.alaska.gov/dnn/ded/DEV/TourismDevelopment/TourismResearch.aspx Economic Impact of Alaska's Visitor Industry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522032359/http://commerce.alaska.gov/dnn/ded/DEV/TourismDevelopment/TourismResearch.aspx |date=May 22, 2014 }} ''. January 2014. Retrieved May 21, 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the [[Essential Air Service]] program. [[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and [[Fairbanks International Airport|Fairbanks]] to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.
[[File:ERA Aviation prop plane landing at ANC (6194226738).jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier Dash 8]], operated by [[Era Alaska]], on approach to [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]]]]

The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Ravn Alaska]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.

Many communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.&lt;ref&gt;
Out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 were pilots, or about one in 78, Federal Aviation Administration. ''[http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/ 2005 U.S. Civil Airman Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229221505/http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/ |date=December 29, 2009 }} ''
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other transport===

Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a {{convert|1150|mi|adj=on}} trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=out}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The &quot;Serum Run&quot; is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serumrun.org/ |title=Norman Vaughan Serum Run |publisher=United Nations |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303205023/http://serumrun.org/ |archivedate=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by [[all-terrain vehicle]] and in winter by [[snowmobile]] or &quot;snow machine&quot;, as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsminer.com/features/outdoors/snowmachine-or-snowmobile-whatever-you-call-it-there-s-a/article_5fd98c50-df56-11e4-a289-b3b886d32b2c.html |title=Snowmachine or snowmobile?

===Data transport===

Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: [[GCI (company)|GCI]] and [[Alaska Communications]]. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaunited.com/|title=Alaska United Fiber Optic System homepage|publisher=Alaskaunited.com|accessdate=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206052641/http://www.alaskaunited.com/|archive-date=February 6, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has &quot;two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskacommunications.com/Personal/Wireless/Coverage-Map.aspx Alaska Communications Coverage Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107193333/http://www.alaskacommunications.com/Personal/Wireless/Coverage-Map.aspx |date=January 7, 2012 }}. Alaska Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, it was reported that a $1&amp;nbsp;billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350&amp;nbsp;million in stimulus from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;

Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: an [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[governor of Alaska]] and his or her appointees which head executive departments; a [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] and [[Alaska Senate]]; and a [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] and lower courts.

The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doa.alaska.gov/dop/fileadmin/DOP_Home/pdf/dopannualreport.pdf |title=State of Alaska Workforce Profile Fiscal Year 2013 |publisher=Dop.state.ak.us |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005824/http://doa.alaska.gov/dop/fileadmin/DOP_Home/pdf/dopannualreport.pdf |archive-date=March 30, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Legislature]] consists of a 40-member [[Alaska House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a 20-member [[Alaska Senate|Senate]]. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The [[governor of Alaska]] serves four-year terms. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]] runs separately from the governor in the [[Primary election|primaries]], but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the [[Alaska Supreme Court]], the [[Alaska Court of Appeals]], the superior courts and the district courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |title=About the Alaska Court System |publisher=State.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913093708/http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior and district courts are [[trial court]]s. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts hear only certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot; /&gt;

The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are [[appellate court]]s. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot; /&gt; The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot; /&gt;

Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115144037/http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 15, 2006 |title=National Journal Alaska State Profile |publisher=Election.nationaljournal.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. [[Alaska Natives]], while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]]. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.

Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.&lt;ref name=seattle_times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html |title=Judge rules against Alaska marijuana law |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |last=Volz |first=Matt |date=July 11, 2006 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=Frank A.

The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the [[Alaskan Independence Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIPqa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akip.org/faqs.html|title=Questions And Answers—About Alaskan Independence|year=2006|publisher=Alaskan Independence Party|access-date=January 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104011721/http://www.akip.org/faqs.html|archive-date=January 4, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and four [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have served as governor of Alaska. In addition, Republican governor [[Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected.

Alaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the first three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over age 21 can consume small amounts of pot—[[Alaska Measure 2 (2014)|if they can find it]].

===Taxes===

Taxes are collected by the [[Alaska Department of Revenue – Tax Division]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tax.alaska.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money (2005). &quot;How tax friendly is your state?&quot; Retrieved from [http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html CNN website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913132712/http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html |date=September 13, 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of five states with no [[sales tax]], one of seven states with no individual [[income tax]], and the only state (except New Hampshire) that has neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newsday.com/business/12-states-with-either-no-income-or-sales-taxes-include-texas-florida-washington-1.13826242 |title=12 states that have either no income or sales taxes |newspaper=Newsday |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215050630/https://www.newsday.com/business/12-states-with-either-no-income-or-sales-taxes-include-texas-florida-washington-1.13826242 |archive-date=February 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}|&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Revenue Tax Division&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.Tax.alaska.gov |title=Alaska Department of Revenue |publisher=Tax.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610221601/http://www.tax.alaska.gov/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=dead }}|&lt;/ref&gt; reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.

While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, [[severance tax]]es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.

[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.

In 2014 the [[Tax Foundation]] ranked Alaska as having the fourth most &quot;business friendly&quot; tax policy, behind only [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/how-friendly-your-states-tax-system-tax-foundations-2014-state-business-tax-climate-index |title=How Friendly Is Your State's Tax System?

[[File:Presidential vote in Alaska.png|thumb|A line graph showing the presidential vote by party from 1960 to 2016 in Alaska]]

Alaska regularly supports [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] votes in all but one election that it has participated in ([[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]). No state has voted for a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his landslide election in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], while the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] elections were close. Since [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Republican [[John McCain]] defeated Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was [[Sarah Palin]], the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.

The [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaska Bush]], central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. {{as of|2004}}, well over half of all registered voters have chosen &quot;Non-Partisan&quot; or &quot;Undeclared&quot; as their affiliation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223222/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.

Because of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. This seat is held by Republican [[Don Young]], who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012. [[Alaska's at-large congressional district]] is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world by area.

In 2008, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became [[John McCain]]'s running mate. She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/ |title=Topic—Sarah Palin |newspaper=Washington Times |accessdate=May 25, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525011152/http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/ |archive-date=May 25, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska's United States senators]] belong to [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 2 and Class 3]]. In 2008, Democrat [[Mark Begich]], mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator [[Ted Stevens]]. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.

Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State representative [[Lisa Murkowski]] as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004, 2010 and 2016.

Alaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.countystate.info/alaska.htm| title=Alaska Boroughs—&quot;Official&quot; sites| publisher=CountyState.Info| accessdate=September 13, 2007| website=Official Borough Websites| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027120825/http://www.countystate.info/Alaska.htm| archive-date=October 27, 2007| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]]) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The state's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest [[Alaska locations by per capita income|location in Alaska by per capita income]] is [[Halibut Cove, Alaska|Halibut Cove]] ($89,895).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Yakutat City]], Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four [[List of U.S. cities by area|largest cities in the U.S. by area]].

===Cities and census-designated places (by population)===

As reflected in the [[2010 United States Census]], Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a [[consolidated city–county]]. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as &quot;[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]&quot; and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.

Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Alaska Department of Education and Early Development]] administers many [[List of school districts in Alaska|school districts]] in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, [[Mt.

Alaska has had a problem with a &quot;[[brain drain]]&quot;. Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. {{as of|2013}}, Alaska did not have a [[Legal education in Alaska|law school]] or medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=February 5, 2013 |title=House Bill 43 &quot;University Institutes of Law And Medicine&quot; |work=States News Service |url=http://akdemocrats.org/?bill=hb43 |accessdate=December 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230080140/http://akdemocrats.org/?bill=hb43 |archive-date=December 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Alaska]] has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/faq.xml#scholars_award |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309023826/http://www.alaska.edu/scholars/faq.xml#scholars_award |archivedate=March 9, 2008 |title=UA Scholars Program—Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public health and public safety==

{{See also|Dentistry in rural Alaska}}

The [[Alaska State Troopers]] are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on &quot;Public Safety Officers&quot; who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.

Many rural communities in Alaska are considered &quot;dry&quot;, having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dps.state.ak.us/AST/ABI/docs/SDEUreports/2003AnnualReport.pdf |title=Alaska State Troopers Alaska Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Enforcement Control Board |publisher=Dps.state.ak.us |accessdate=May 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230011202/http://www.dps.state.ak.us/AST/ABI/docs/SDEUreports/2003AnnualReport.pdf |archive-date=December 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.state.ak.us/suicideprevention/statistics_pages_sspc/AKsuiciderate_rural_urban_90-00.htm |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Hss.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925085430/http://hss.state.ak.us/suicideprevention/statistics_pages_sspc/AKsuiciderate_rural_urban_90-00.htm |archivedate=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic abuse]] and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/09/30/1480089/survey-finds-high-rates-of-sexual.html |title=Survey reveals higher rate of violence against Alaska women |accessdate=May 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531105355/http://www.adn.com/2010/09/30/1480089/survey-finds-high-rates-of-sexual.html |archivedate=May 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation, especially in rural areas.

The [[Stikine River]] attracts the largest springtime concentration of [[American bald eagle]]s in the world.

The [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self-esteem among Native people. The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]] promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskanativearts.org|title=Alaska Native Arts Foundation|website=alaskanativearts.org|access-date=November 28, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717094500/http://www.alaskanativearts.org/|archive-date=July 17, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

{{Main|Music of Alaska}}

The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable.

===Alaska in film and on television===

{{see also|List of films set in Alaska}}
[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]

Alaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.

One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as &quot;The Biggest Picture Ever Made&quot;. Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up &quot;Camp Hollywood&quot; in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.

When ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.

The 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. [[Steven Seagal]]'s 1994 ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]], was filmed in part at the [[Worthington Glacier]] near [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Filminamerica.com |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227140459/http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |archive-date=December 27, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 [[John Sayles]] film ''[[Limbo (1999 film)|Limbo]]'', starring [[David Strathairn]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]], was filmed in Juneau.

The psychological thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robin Williams]], was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.

Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]]. The 2007 horror feature ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' is set in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Barrow, Alaska]]{{refn|group=note|name=namechange|now known as Utqiagvik}}, but was filmed in New Zealand.

Many [[reality television]] shows are filmed in Alaska. In 2011 the ''Anchorage Daily News'' found ten set in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;hopkins20110214&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html |title=Rating the Alaska reality shows: The best and the worst |work=Anchorage Daily News |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |author=Hopkins, Kyle |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302051556/http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html |archivedate=March 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
