'''Apollo 11''' was the [[Human spaceflight|spaceflight]] that first [[Moon landing|landed]] humans on the [[Moon]]. Commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and lunar module pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] formed the American crew that landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] ''Eagle'' on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and they collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to [[Earth]]. Command module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] flew the [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']] alone in [[lunar orbit]] while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21 hours, 36 minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named [[Tranquility Base]] before lifting off to rejoin ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.

Apollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module (CM)]] with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [[Apollo service module|service module (SM)]], which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module (LM)]] that had two stagesâ€”a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

After being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into ''Eagle'' and landed in the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on July 20. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that propelled ''Columbia'' out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} They returned to Earth and [[Splashdown|splashed down]] in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. He described the event as &quot;one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;{{efn|Eric Jones of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal explains that the &quot;a&quot; article was intended, whether or not it was said; the intention was to contrast ''a man'' (an individual's action) and ''mankind'' (as a species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1092413|title=One Small Step|last1=Jones|first=Eric|website=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal|access-date=September 6, 2019|date=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=transcript}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; Apollo 11 effectively ended the [[Space Race]] and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

== Background ==

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United States was engaged in the [[Cold War]], a geopolitical rivalry with the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=134}} On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[Satellite|artificial satellite]]. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and challenged American claims of military, economic and technological superiority.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=13â€“15}} This precipitated the [[Sputnik crisis]], and triggered the [[Space Race]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=1}} [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] responded to the Sputnik challenge by creating the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), and initiating [[Project Mercury]],{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101â€“106}} which aimed to launch a man into [[Earth orbit]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=134}} But on April 12, 1961, Soviet [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=332â€“333}} Nearly a month later, on May 5, 1961, [[Alan Shepard]] became the first American in space, completing a 15-minute suborbital journey. After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from Eisenhower's successor, [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|p=121}}

Since the Soviet Union had higher lift capacity [[launch vehicle]]s, Kennedy chose, from among options presented by NASA, a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.{{sfn|Logsdon|1976|pp=112â€“117}}

On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the [[United States Congress]] on &quot;Urgent National Needs&quot; and declared:{{quote|I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorationsâ€”explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the Moonâ€”if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there. |source=Kennedy's speech to Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/jfk_speech_text.html |title=Excerpt: 'Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs' |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 16, 2018|date=May 25, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On September 12, 1962, Kennedy [[We choose to go to the Moon|delivered another speech]] before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the [[Rice Stadium (Rice University)|Rice University football stadium]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/49181/rt050i01.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title='Visiting Professor' Kennedy Pushes Space Age Spending|last=Keilen|first=Eugene|date=September 19, 1962|newspaper=The Rice Thresher|access-date=March 11, 2018|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2012/08/30/jfks-1962-moon-speech-still-appeals-50-years-later/|title=JFK's 1962 Moon Speech Still Appeals 50 Years Later|last=Boyd|first=Jade|date=August 30, 2012|publisher=Rice University|access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows:

{{quote|There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, [[Spirit of St. Louis|fly the Atlantic]]? Why does [[Riceâ€“Texas football rivalry|Rice play Texas]]?
We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon{{nbsp}}... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John F.

In spite of that, the proposed program faced the opposition of many Americans and was dubbed a &quot;[[Boondoggle|moondoggle]]&quot; by [[Norbert Wiener]], a mathematician at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-you-didnt-know-about-apollo-11-mission-fifty-years-ago-180972165/|title=What You Didn't Know About the Apollo 11 Mission|last=Fishman|first=Charles|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=June 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/moondoggle-the-forgotten-opposition-to-the-apollo-program/262254/|title=Moondoggle: The Forgotten Opposition to the Apollo Program|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=September 12, 2012|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=June 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort to land a man on the Moon already had a name: [[Project Apollo]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=15}} When Kennedy met with [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]] in June 1961, he proposed making the Moon landing a joint project, but Khrushchev did not take up the offer.{{sfn|Logsdon|2011|p=32}} Kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the Moon in a speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on September 20, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-046-041.aspx |access-date=March 11, 2018 |title=Address at 18th U.N.

An early and crucial decision was choosing [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] over both [[direct ascent]] and [[Earth orbit rendezvous]]. A [[space rendezvous]] is an [[orbital maneuver]] in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up. In July 1962 NASA head [[James E. Webb|James Webb]] announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html|title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program|date=December 1992|access-date=December 26, 2018|publisher=NASA|work=NASA Langley Research Center Office of Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=85â€“86}} and that the [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] would have three major parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that returned to Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stagesâ€”a descent stage for landing on the Moon, and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=72â€“77}} This design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single [[Saturn V]] rocket that was then under development.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=48â€“49}}

Technologies and techniques required for Apollo were developed by [[Project Gemini]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=181â€“182, 205â€“208}} The Apollo project was enabled by NASA's adoption of new advances in [[semiconductor]] [[electronic technology]], including [[metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs) in the [[Interplanetary Monitoring Platform]] (IMP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Interplanetary Monitoring Platform |date=August 29, 1989 |publisher=[[NASA]] |pages=1, 11, 134 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19800012928.pdf |accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=White |first1=H.

Project Apollo was abruptly halted by the [[Apollo 1]] fire on January 27, 1967, in which astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] died, and the subsequent investigation.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=214â€“218}} In October 1968, [[Apollo 7]] evaluated the command module in Earth orbit,{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=265â€“272}} and in December [[Apollo 8]] tested it in lunar orbit.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=274â€“284}} In March 1969, [[Apollo 9]] put the lunar module through its paces in Earth orbit,{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=292â€“300}} and in May [[Apollo 10]] conducted a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; in lunar orbit. By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|pp=303â€“312}}

The Soviet Union competed with the US in the Space Race, but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 launcher]], which was comparable to the Saturn V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/science-technology-and-society/sts-471j-engineering-apollo-the-moon-project-as-a-complex-system-spring-2007/readings/soviet_mand_lunr.pdf |title=The Soviet Manned Lunar Program |last=Lindroos |first=Marcus |work=[[MIT OpenCourseWare]] |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of [[Uncrewed spacecraft|uncrewed probes]]. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 15]], which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in [[Mare Crisium]] about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home.

The initial crew assignment of Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot (CMP) [[Jim Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) [[Buzz Aldrin]] on the backup crew for Apollo{{nbsp}}9 was officially announced on November 20, 1967.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=374}} Lovell and Aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of [[Gemini 12]]. Due to design and manufacturing delays in the LM, Apollo{{nbsp}}8 and Apollo{{nbsp}}9 swapped prime and backup crews, and Armstrong's crew became the backup for Apollo{{nbsp}}8. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong was then expected to command Apollo 11.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=312â€“313}}

There would be one change. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], the CMP on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=288â€“289}} Lovell took his place on the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew, and when Collins recovered he joined Armstrong's crew as CMP. In the meantime, [[Fred Haise]] filled in as backup LMP, and Aldrin as backup CMP for Apollo 8.{{sfn|Cunningham|2010|p=109}} Apollo 11 was the second American mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} the first being Apollo 10.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=72}} The next was [[STS-26]] in 1988.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}}

[[Deke Slayton]] gave Armstrong the option to replace Aldrin with Lovell, since some thought Aldrin was difficult to work with. Armstrong had no issues working with Aldrin, but thought it over for a day before declining. He thought Lovell deserved to command his own mission (eventually [[Apollo 13]]).{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=338â€“339}}

The Apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of [[Apollo 12]]. Instead they forged an amiable working relationship. Armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof, but Collins, who considered himself a loner, confessed to rebuffing Aldrin's attempts to create a more personal relationship.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=434â€“435}} Aldrin and Collins described the crew as &quot;amiable strangers&quot;.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}} Armstrong did not agree with the assessment, and said &quot;...&amp;nbsp;all the crews I was on worked very well together.&quot;{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=359}}

=== Backup crew ===

{{Spaceflight crew
|terminology  = Astronaut
|position1    = Commander
|crew1_up     = [[Jim Lovell|James A. Lovell Jr.]]
|position2    = Command Module Pilot

|position3    = Lunar Module Pilot
|crew3_up     = [[Fred Haise|Fred W. Haise Jr.]]
}}

The backup crew consisted of Lovell as Commander, [[William Anders]] as CMP, and Haise as LMP. Anders had flown with Lovell on Apollo{{nbsp}}8.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=90}} In early 1969, he accepted a job with the [[National Space Council|National Aeronautics and Space Council]] effective August 1969, and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time. [[Ken Mattingly]] was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Lovell, Haise, and Mattingly were later assigned as the prime crew of [[Apollo 13]].{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=237}}

=== Support crew ===

During Projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. For Apollo, a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew. The support crew maintained the flight plan, checklists and mission ground rules, and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes. They developed procedures, especially those for emergency situations, so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators, allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=261}} For Apollo 11, the support crew consisted of Ken Mattingly, [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] and [[William R. Pogue|Bill Pogue]].{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=375}}

=== Capsule communicators ===

The [[capsule communicator]] (CAPCOM) was an astronaut at the [[Christopher C.

=== Insignia ===

[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|Apollo 11 insignia]]

The Apollo 11 [[Mission patch|mission emblem]] was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for &quot;peaceful lunar landing by the United States&quot;. At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the [[bald eagle]], the [[national bird]] of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an [[olive branch]] in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. Collins added a lunar background with the Earth in the distance. The sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the Earth instead of the left. Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins decided the Eagle and the Moon would be in their natural colors, and decided on a blue and gold border. Armstrong was concerned that &quot;eleven&quot; would not be understood by non-English speakers, so they went with &quot;Apollo 11&quot;,{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=332â€“334}} and they decided not to put their names on the patch, so it would &quot;be representative of ''everyone'' who had worked toward a lunar landing&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=332}}

An illustrator at the MSC did the artwork, which was then sent off to NASA officials for approval.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=332â€“334}} The design was rejected. [[Bob Gilruth]], the director of the MSC felt the talons of the eagle looked &quot;too warlike&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=333}} After some discussion, the olive branch was moved to the talons.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=333}} When the [[Eisenhower dollar|Eisenhower dollar coin]] was released in 1971, the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |title=1971â€“78 Dollar Eisenhower |work=CoinSite |publisher=ROKO Design Group, Inc. |date=1994 |accessdate=July 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830064148/http://www.coinsite.com/CoinSite-PF/pparticles/$1eisen.asp |archive-date=August 30, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was also used for the smaller [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] unveiled in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Susan B.

=== Call signs ===

After the crew of Apollo 10 named their spacecraft ''Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy'', assistant manager for public affairs [[Julian Scheer]] wrote to [[George M. Low]], the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] (MSC), to suggest the Apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft. The name ''Snowcone'' was used for the CM and ''Haystack'' was used for the LM in both internal and external communications during early mission planning.{{sfn|Marshall Space Flight Center|1969|p=8}}

The LM was named ''Eagle'' after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia. At Scheer's suggestion, the CM was named ''[[Command Module Columbia|Columbia]]'' after ''[[Columbiad#In fiction|Columbiad]]'', the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1865 novel ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]''. It also referenced [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], a historical name of the United States. {{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=334â€“335}}{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=331}} In Collins' 1976 book, he said ''Columbia'' was in reference to [[Christopher Columbus]].{{sfn|Collins|1994|p=116}}

[[File:Apollo 11 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-416).jpg|thumb|alt=see caption|Apollo 11 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]

The astronauts had [[personal preference kit]]s (PPKs), small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/kit-pilots-personal-preference-apollo-11 |title=Kit, Pilot's Personal Preference, Apollo 11 |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five {{convert|0.5|lb|adj=on}} PPKs were carried on Apollo 11: three (one for each astronaut) were stowed on ''Columbia'' before launch, and two on ''Eagle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflownartifacts.com/flown_ppks.html |publisher=Space flown collectible artifacts |title=Personal Preference Kits (PPKs) |access-date=December 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Armstrong's LM PPK contained a piece of wood from the [[Wright brothers]]' 1903 ''[[Wright Flyer]]''{{'}}s left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing,{{sfn|Hansen |2005|p=527}} along with a diamond-studded [[astronaut pin]] originally given to Slayton by the widows of the Apollo{{nbsp}}1 crew. This pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to Slayton afterwards, but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals, the widows gave the pin to Slayton. Armstrong took it with him on Apollo 11.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=191â€“192}}

=== Site selection ===

[[File:Lunar site selection globe.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Moon showing prospective sites for Apollo 11. Site{{nbsp}}2 was chosen.]]

NASA's Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. These were the result of two years' worth of studies based on high-resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the [[Lunar Orbiter program]] and information about surface conditions provided by the [[Surveyor program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-lunar-landing-sites-selected |title=50 Years Ago: Lunar Landing Sites Selected |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 22, 2018|date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best Earth-bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution Project Apollo required.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=79}} The landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required, clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering, and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar. Scientific value was not a consideration.{{sfn|Harland|1999|p=19}}

Areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on Earth were often found to be totally unacceptable. The original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed, as no such site was found.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|pp=98â€“99}} Five sites were considered: Sites{{nbsp}}1 and{{nbsp}}2 were in the Sea of Tranquility (''[[Mare Tranquilitatis]]''); Site{{nbsp}}3 was in the Central Bay (''[[Sinus Medii]]''); and Sites{{nbsp}}4 and{{nbsp}}5 were in the Ocean of Storms (''[[Oceanus Procellarum]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot; /&gt;
The final site selection was based on seven criteria:
* The site needed to be smooth, with relatively few craters;
* with approach paths free of large hills, tall cliffs or deep craters that might confuse the landing radar and cause it to issue incorrect readings;
* reachable with a minimum amount of propellant;
* allowing for delays in the launch countdown;
* providing the Apollo spacecraft with a free-return trajectory, one that would allow it to coast around the Moon and safely return to Earth without requiring any engine firings should a problem arise on the way to the Moon;
* with good visibility during the landing approach, meaning the Sun would be between 7{{nbsp}}and 20 degrees behind the LM; and
* a general slope of less than two degrees in the landing area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot; /&gt;

The requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Site Selection&quot; /&gt; A landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience.{{sfn|Collins|1994|p=7}} The Apollo Site Selection Board selected Site{{nbsp}}2, with Sites 3{{nbsp}}and{{nbsp}}5 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed. In May 1969, Apollo 10's lunar module flew to within {{convert|15|km|sp=us}} of Site{{nbsp}}2, and reported it was acceptable.{{sfn|Cappellari|1972|p=976}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/orbital-missions/apollo10-facts.cfm|title=Apollo 10|website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=December 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First-step decision ===
During the first press conference after the Apollo 11 crew was announced, the first question was, &quot;Which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface?&quot;{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=148}}{{sfn|Hansen|2005|p=360}} Slayton told the reporter it had not been decided, and Armstrong added that it was &quot;not based on individual desire&quot;.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=148}}

One of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander, which matched what had been done on Gemini missions,{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=347}} where the commander had never performed the spacewalk.{{sfn|Aldrin|Abraham|2016|pp=57â€“58}} Reporters wrote in early 1969 that Aldrin would be the first man to walk on the Moon, and Associate Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] told reporters he would be first as well. Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=363â€“365}}

For decades, Aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar module's hatch location. Because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small, maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult. The crew tried a simulation in which Aldrin left the spacecraft first, but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress. While this was enough for mission planners to make their decision, Aldrin and Armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=149}} Slayton told Armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first, if he agreed. Armstrong said, &quot;Yes, that's the way to do it.&quot;{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=150}}

The media accused Armstrong of exercising his commander's prerogative to exit the spacecraft first.{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=281}} [[Chris Kraft]] revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between Gilruth, Slayton, Low, and himself to make sure Aldrin would not be the first to walk on the Moon. They argued that the first person to walk on the Moon should be like [[Charles Lindbergh]], a calm and quiet person. They made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft.{{sfn|Hansen|2005|pp=371â€“372}}

=== Pre-launch ===

[[File:69-HC-620 - SA506.jpg|thumb|left|Saturn V SA-506, the rocket carrying the Apollo 11 spacecraft, moves out of the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] towards [[Launch Complex 39]]]]

The ascent stage of lunar module LM-5 arrived at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] on January 8, 1969, followed by the descent stage four days later, and Command and Service Module CM-107 on January 23.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission Overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Apollo 11 Mission Overview |publisher=NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo11.html |first= Sarah |last=Loff |access-date=September 22, 2018|date=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several differences between LM-5 and Apollo 10's LM-4; LM-5 had a VHF radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their EVA on the lunar surface; a lighter ascent engine; more thermal protection on the landing gear; and a package of scientific experiments known as the [[Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package]] (EASEP). The only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch.{{sfn|Benson|Faherty|1978|p=472}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/apollo-to-the-moon/online/science/scientific-experiments.cfm |title=Scientific Experiments |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The command and service modules were mated on January 29, and moved from the [[Operations and Checkout Building]] to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] on April 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission Overview&quot; /&gt;

The [[S-IVB]] third stage of Saturn V AS-506 had arrived on January 18, followed by the [[S-II]] second stage on February 6, [[S-IC]] first stage on February 20, and the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit]] on February 27. At 1230 on May 20, the {{convert|5443|t|adj=on}} assembly departed the Vehicle Assembly Building atop the [[crawler-transporter]], bound for Launch Pad 39A, part of [[Launch Complex 39]], while Apollo 10 was still on its way to the Moon. A countdown test commenced on June 26, and concluded on July 2. The launch complex was floodlit on the night of July 15, when the crawler-transporter carried the [[service structure|mobile service structure]] back to its parking area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission Overview&quot; /&gt; In the early hours of the morning, the fuel tanks of the S-II and S-IVB stages were filled with [[liquid hydrogen]].{{sfn|Benson|Faherty|1978|p=474}} Fueling was completed by three hours before launch.{{sfn|Benson|Faherty|1978|p=475}} Launch operations were partly automated, with 43 programs written in the [[ATOLL (programming language)|ATOLL programming language]].{{sfn|Benson|Faherty|1978|pp=355â€“356}}

Slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400, and they showered, shaved, and had the traditional pre-flight breakfast of steak and eggs with Slayton and the backup crew. They then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen. At 0630, they headed out to Launch Complex 39.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=355â€“357}} Haise entered ''Columbia'' about three hours and ten minutes before launch time. Along with a technician, he helped Armstrong into the left hand couch at 06:54. Five minutes later, Collins joined him, taking up his position on the right hand couch.

Saturn V AS-506 launched Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 [[UTC]] (9:32:00 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mission Overview&quot; /&gt; At 13.2 seconds into the flight, the launch vehicle began to [[Roll program|roll]] into its [[flight azimuth]] of 72.058Â°. Full shutdown of the first-stage engines occurred about 2{{nbsp}}minutes and 42 seconds into the mission, followed by separation of the S-IC and ignition of the S-II engines. The second stage engines then cut off and separated at about 9{{nbsp}}minutes and 8{{nbsp}}seconds, allowing the first ignition of the S-IVB engine a few seconds later.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}}

Apollo 11 entered Earth orbit at an altitude of {{convert|100.4|nmi|km}} by {{convert|98.9|nmi|km}}, twelve minutes into its flight. After one and a half orbits, a second ignition of the S-IVB engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the Moon with the [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI) burn at 16:22:13 UTC. About 30 minutes later, with Collins in the left seat and at the controls, the [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver was performed. This involved separating ''Columbia'' from the spent S-IVB stage, turning around, and docking with ''Eagle'' still attached to the stage. After the LM was extracted, the combined spacecraft headed for the Moon, while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=374â€“375}}{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}} This was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft, the Earth, or the Moon.

On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter [[lunar orbit]].{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/11day4-loi1.html|title=Day 4, part 1: Entering Lunar Orbit|publisher=Apollo Flight Journal|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=July 14, 2019|last1=Woods|first1=W.

=== Lunar descent ===

At 12:52:00 UTC on July 20, Aldrin and Armstrong entered ''Eagle'', and began the final preparations for lunar descent.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=106}} At 17:44:00 ''Eagle'' separated from ''Columbia''.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=107}} Collins, alone aboard ''Columbia'', inspected ''Eagle'' as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged, and that the landing gear was correctly deployed.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=9}}{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=209}} Armstrong exclaimed: &quot;The ''Eagle'' has wings!&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=209}}

As the descent began, Armstrong and Aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early, and reported that they were &quot;long&quot;; they would land miles west of their target point. ''Eagle'' was traveling too fast. The problem could have been [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]]â€”concentrations of high mass that could have altered the trajectory. Flight Director Gene Kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel. Or it could have been the result of ''Eagle''{{'}}s pirouette maneuver.{{sfn|Mindell|2008|pp=220â€“221}}{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=82}}

Five minutes into the descent burn, and {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} above the surface of the Moon, the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|LM guidance computer]] (LGC) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center, computer engineer [[Jack Garman]] told [[Flight controller#GUIDO|Guidance Officer]] [[Steve Bales]] it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated &quot;executive overflows&quot;, meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|pp=210â€“212}}{{sfn|Hamilton|Hackler|2008|pp=34â€“43}} [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]], the Director of Apollo Flight Computer Programming at the [[MIT]] [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory]] later recalled:

{{quote|To blame the computer for the Apollo 11 problems is like blaming the person who spots a fire and calls the fire department. Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones. The computer, rather than almost forcing an abort, prevented an abort. If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hamilton |first=Margaret H. |authorlink=Margaret Hamilton (scientist) |date=March 1, 1971 |p=13 |title=Computer Got Loaded |journal=[[Datamation]] |type=Letter |issn=0011-6963}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
During the mission, the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position, causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=190â€“192}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.1201-fm.html |title=Apollo 11: 25 Years Later |last=Martin |first=Fred H. |date=July 1994 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software engineer [[Don Eyles]] concluded in a 2005 Guidance and Control Conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed LM in [[Apollo 5]]. Having the rendezvous radar on (so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort) should have been irrelevant to the computer, but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions, depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up. The extra spurious [[cycle stealing]], as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter, caused the computer alarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://klabs.org/history/apollo_11_alarms/eyles_2004/eyles_2004.htm |title=Tales from the Lunar Module Guidance Computer |last=Eyles |first=Don |date=February 6, 2004 |work=27th annual Guidance and Control Conference |publisher=[[American Astronautical Society]] |location=Breckenridge, Colorado |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landing ===

[[File:Apollo 11 Landing Site &amp; West Crater.png|thumb|Landing site relative to West crater]]

When Armstrong again looked outside, he saw that the computer's landing target was in a boulder-strewn area just north and east of a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|sp=us|-diameter}} crater (later determined to be [[West (lunar crater)|West crater]]), so he took semi-automatic control.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=196}}{{sfn|Mindell|2008|pp=195â€“197}} Armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it, but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high. Throughout the descent, Aldrin called out navigation data to Armstrong, who was busy piloting ''Eagle''. Now {{convert|107|ft|m|sp=us}} above the surface, Armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=197}}

Armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it. As he got closer, now {{convert|250|ft|m|sp=us}} above the surface, he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it. He cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground. They were now {{convert|100|ft|m|sp=us}} from the surface, with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining. Lunar dust kicked up by the LM's engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecraft's motion. Some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud, and Armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecraft's speed.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|pp=198â€“199}}

A light informed Aldrin that at least one of the {{convert|67|in|cm|0|adj=on}} probes hanging from ''Eagle''{{'s}} footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said: &quot;Contact light!&quot; Armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down, as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engine's own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode, but he forgot. Three seconds later, ''Eagle'' landed and Armstrong shut the engine down.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=199}} Aldrin immediately said &quot;Okay, engine stop. ACAâ€”out of [[detent]].&quot; Armstrong acknowledged: &quot;Out of detent. Auto.&quot; Aldrin continued: &quot;Mode controlâ€”both auto. Descent engine command override off. Engine armâ€”off. 413 is in.&quot;{{sfn|Mindell|2008|p=226}}
[[File:AP11 FINAL APPROACH.ogv|thumb|left|Landing on the Moon, July 20, 1969]]

ACA was the [[Attitude control|Attitude Control Assembly]]â€”the LM's control stick. Output went to the LGC to command the [[reaction control system]] (RCS) jets to fire. &quot;Out of Detent&quot; meant the stick had moved away from its centered position; it was spring-centered like the turn indicator in a car. LGC address 413 contained the variable that indicated the LM had landed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

''Eagle'' landed at 20:17:40 UTC on Sunday July 20 with {{convert|216|lb}} of usable fuel remaining. Information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the LM had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe,&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=295}} but post-mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horizons2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fjeld |first1=Paul |title=The Biggest Myth about the First Moon Landing |journal=Horizons |date=June 2013 |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=5â€“6 |url=http://www.aiaahouston.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Horizons_2013_05_and_06_low_resolution.pdf#page=5 |accessdate=March 29, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions, and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning. This was later found to be the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 1&quot; /&gt;

Armstrong acknowledged Aldrin's completion of the post landing checklist with &quot;Engine arm is off&quot;, before responding to the CAPCOM, Charles Duke, with the words, &quot;Houston, [[Tranquility Base]] here. The ''Eagle'' has landed.&quot; Armstrong's unrehearsed change of call sign from &quot;Eagle&quot; to &quot;Tranquility Base&quot; emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |type=TV production |title=Failure is Not an Option |publisher=[[The History Channel]] |date=August 24, 2003 |oclc=54435670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at Mission Control: &quot;Roger, Twanâ€”Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.

[[File:A New Look at the Apollo 11 Landing Site.ogg|thumb|[[Stereoscopy|3-D]] view from the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) of Apollo 11 landing site]]

Two and a half hours after landing, before preparations began for the EVA, Aldrin radioed to Earth:
{{quote|This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.postland.html |title=Post-landing Activities |date=1995 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He then took [[Eucharist|communion]] privately. At this time NASA was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (who had objected to the [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|Apollo{{nbsp}}8 crew reading from the Book of Genesis]]) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space. As such, Aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the Moon. Aldrin was an elder at the [[Webster, Texas|Webster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church, Dean Woodruff. Webster Presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the Moon and commemorates the event each year on the Sunday closest to July 20.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|pp=204, 623}} The schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period, but they chose to begin preparations for the EVA early, thinking they would be unable to sleep.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=21â€“22}}

Preparations for [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] to walk on the Moon began at 23:43.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=107}} These took longer than expected; three and a half hours instead of two.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 3&quot; /&gt; During training on Earth, everything required had been neatly laid out in advance, but on the Moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well, such as checklists, food packets, and tools.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=22}} Six hours and thirty-nine minutes after landing Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, and ''Eagle'' was depressurized.{{sfn|Cortright|1975|p=215}}

Apollo 11 used [[slow-scan television]] (TV) incompatible with broadcast TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor, and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing the quality of the picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blunder 5&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost Moon pictures |last=Macey |first=Richard |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-giant-blunder-for-mankind-how-nasa-lost-moon-pictures/2006/08/04/1154198328978.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |date=August 5, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signal was received at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] in the United States, but with better fidelity by [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] near [[Canberra]] in Australia.

While still on the ladder, Armstrong uncovered a [[lunar plaque|plaque]] mounted on the LM descent stage bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription, and signatures of the astronauts and President Nixon. The inscription read:

At the behest of the [[Nixon administration]] to add a reference to God, NASA included the vague date as a reason to include A.D., which stands for [[Anno Domini]], &quot;in the year of our Lord&quot; (although it should have been placed before the year, not after).{{sfn|Gardner|2017|p=143}}

Armstrong intended to say &quot;That's one small step for a man&quot;, but the word &quot;a&quot; is not audible in the transmission, and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast. When later asked about his quote, Armstrong said he believed he said &quot;for a man&quot;, and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the &quot;a&quot; in square brackets. One explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words &quot;for a&quot; together; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to Earth, partly because of storms near Parkes Observatory. More recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the &quot;a&quot; may have been spoken but obscured by static.&lt;ref&gt;{{snopes | link = http://www.snopes.com/quotes/onesmall.asp | title = One Small Step}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armstrong 'got Moon quote right' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5398560.stm |date=October 2, 2006 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armstrong's 'poetic' slip on Moon |first=Pallab |last=Ghosh |authorlink=Pallab Ghosh |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8081817.stm |date=June 3, 2009 |work=BBC News |location=London |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About seven minutes after stepping onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lsc/10010.pdf |title=Lunar Sample Compendium: Contingency Soil (10010) |last=Meyer |first=Charles |date=2009 |work=Astromaterials Research &amp; Exploration Science |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve minutes after the sample was collected,{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=108}} he removed the TV camera from the MESA and made a panoramic sweep, then mounted it on a tripod.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 3&quot; /&gt; The TV camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the EVA. Still photography was accomplished with a [[Hasselblad]] camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on Armstrong's [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|Apollo space suit]].{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=23}} Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface. He described the view with the simple phrase: &quot;Magnificent desolation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt;

Armstrong said moving in the [[Gravitation of the Moon|lunar gravity]], one-sixth of Earth's, was &quot;even perhaps easier than the simulations&amp;nbsp;... It's absolutely no trouble to walk around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; Aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around, including two-footed kangaroo hops. The PLSS backpack created a tendency to tip backward, but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance. Loping became the preferred method of movement. The astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead. The fine soil was quite slippery. Aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into ''Eagle''{{'s}} shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit, but the helmet was warmer in sunlight, so he felt cooler in shadow.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; The MESA failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow, slowing work somewhat. As they worked, the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|p=23}}

The astronauts planted the [[Lunar Flag Assembly]] containing a [[flag of the United States]] on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, &quot;Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theattic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A Flag on the Moon |url=https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/9/27/4j6861bez3j568c31rzj7lynevmtpt |website=The Attic |accessdate=October 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole a couple of inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) into the hard lunar surface. Aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of TV viewers. But he gave &quot;a crisp West Point salute&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theattic&quot; /&gt; Before Aldrin could take a photo of Armstrong with the flag, President Richard Nixon spoke to them through a telephone-radio transmission which Nixon called &quot;the most historic phone call ever made from the White House.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/apollo11.html |title=Exhibit: Apollo 11 and Nixon |date=March 1996 |work=American Originals |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call, but Frank Borman, who was at the White House as a NASA liaison during Apollo 11, convinced Nixon to keep his words brief.{{sfn|Borman|Serling|1988|pp=237â€“238}}
{{quote|'''Nixon:''' Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.
'''Armstrong:''' Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States, but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and curiosity, and men with a vision for the future.

They deployed the [[Early Apollo Scientific Experiments Package|EASEP]], which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure [[moonquake]]s and a [[Retroreflector#On the Moon|retroreflector]] array used for the [[lunar laser ranging experiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EASEP Deployment and Closeout&quot; /&gt; Then Armstrong walked {{convert|196|ft|m}} from the LM to snap photos at the rim of [[Little West (lunar crater)|Little West Crater]]&lt;!-- There is no &quot;East Crater&quot;, see https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11EastCraterRIP.html --&gt; while Aldrin collected two [[core sample]]s. He used the [[geologist's hammer]] to pound in the tubesâ€”the only time the hammer was used on Apollo 11â€”but was unable to penetrate more than {{convert|6|in|cm}} deep. The astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles. Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled {{convert|6|kg}} of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly.{{sfn|Harland|1999|pp=28â€“29}} Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: [[basalt]] and [[breccia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_11/samples/|title=Lunar Sample Overview|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|access-date=December 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts: [[armalcolite]], [[tranquillityite]], and [[pyroxferroite]].

Mission Control used a coded phrase to warn Armstrong his metabolic rates were high, and that he should slow down. He was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out. As metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk, Mission Control granted the astronauts a 15-minute extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;EASEP Deployment and Closeout&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.clsout.html |title=EASEP Deployment and Closeout |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |date=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited the first moonwalk's time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts' PLSS backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/10469-neil-armstrong-explains-famous-apollo-11-moonwalk.html |title=Neil Armstrong Explains His Famous Apollo 11 Moonwalk |date=December 10, 2010 |work=[[Space.com]] |publisher=[[TechMediaNetwork, Inc.]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lunar ascent ===

Aldrin entered ''Eagle'' first. With some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing {{convert|21.55|kg|lb}} of lunar surface material to the LM hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC). This proved to be an inefficient tool, and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the LM by hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 3&quot; /&gt; Armstrong reminded Aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket, and Aldrin tossed the bag down. Armstrong then jumped onto the ladder's third rung, and climbed into the LM. After transferring to LM [[life support]], the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their PLSS backpacks, lunar overshoes, an empty Hasselblad camera, and other equipment. The hatch was closed again at 05:11:13. They then pressurized the LM and settled down to sleep.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.posteva.html |title=Trying to Rest |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |date=1995 |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aldrin with experiment.jpg|thumb|left|Aldrin next to the Passive Seismic Experiment Package with ''Eagle'' in the background]]

Presidential speech writer [[William Safire]] had prepared an ''In Event of Moon Disaster'' announcement for Nixon to read in the event the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/white-house-lost-space-scenarios |title=White House 'Lost In Space' Scenarios |date=August 8, 2005 |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |location=New York |accessdate=May 25, 2013}} Scanned copy of the &quot;In Event of Moon Disaster&quot; memo.&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks were in a memo from Safire to Nixon's [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.

Haldeman]], in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Story of a Tragedy That Was Not to Be |first=Jim |last=Mann |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/07/news/mn-53678 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 7, 1999 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;safire&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Essay; Disaster Never Came |first=William |last=Safire |authorlink=William Safire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/12/opinion/essay-disaster-never-came.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 12, 1999 |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the plan, Mission Control would &quot;close down communications&quot; with the LM, and a clergyman would &quot;commend their souls to the deepest of the deep&quot; in a public ritual likened to [[burial at sea]]. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to [[Rupert Brooke]]'s First World War poem, &quot;[[The Soldier (poem)|The Soldier]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;safire&quot; /&gt;

While moving inside the cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the [[circuit breaker]] that would arm the main engine for lift off from the Moon. There was a concern this would prevent firing the engine, stranding them on the Moon. A felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch; had this not worked, the LM circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 6&quot; /&gt;

After more than {{frac|21|1|2}} hours on the lunar surface, in addition to the scientific instruments, the astronauts left behind: an [[Apollo 1]] mission patch in memory of astronauts&amp;nbsp;[[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]], [[Gus Grissom]], and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Edward White]], who died when their command module caught fire during a test in January 1967; two memorial medals of Soviet cosmonauts [[Vladimir Komarov]] and [[Yuri Gagarin]], who died in 1967 and 1968 respectively; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace; and a silicon message disk carrying the [[Apollo 11 goodwill messages|goodwill statements]] by Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-111507a.html|title=The untold story: how one small silicon disc delivered a giant message to the Moon|website=collectSPACE|access-date=November 20, 2019|date=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the US Congress, a listing of members of the four committees of the House and Senate responsible for the NASA legislation, and the names of NASA's past and present top management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages |date=July 13, 1969 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf |id=Release No: 69-83F |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After about seven hours of rest, the crew was awakened by Houston to prepare for the return flight. Two and a half hours later, at 17:54:00 UTC, they lifted off in ''Eagle''{{'s}} ascent stage to rejoin Collins aboard ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=108}} Film taken from the LM ascent stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine.

=== ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit ===

During his day flying solo around the Moon, Collins never felt lonely. Although it has been said &quot;not since [[Adam]] has any human known such solitude&quot;,{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}} Collins felt very much a part of the mission. In his autobiography he wrote: &quot;this venture has been structured for three men, and I consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}} In the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the Earth while ''Columbia'' passed round the far side of the Moon, the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness, but rather &quot;awareness, anticipation, satisfaction, confidence, almost exultation&quot;.{{sfn|Collins|2001|p=402}}

One of Collins' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground. To give Collins an idea where to look, Mission Control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about four miles off target. Each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site, he tried in vain to find the module. On his first orbits on the back side of the Moon, Collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the [[fuel cell]]s and preparing the cabin for Armstrong and Aldrin to return.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=401â€“407}}

Just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit, Mission Control informed Collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant. If it became too cold, parts of ''Columbia'' might freeze. Mission Control advised him to assume manual control and implement Environmental Control System Malfunction Procedure 17. Instead, Collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again, and carried on with normal housekeeping chores, while keeping an eye on the temperature. When ''Columbia'' came back around to the near side of the Moon again, he was able to report that the problem had been resolved. For the next couple of orbits, he described his time on the back side of the Moon as &quot;relaxing&quot;. After Aldrin and Armstrong completed their EVA, Collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous. While the flight plan called for ''Eagle'' to meet up with ''Columbia'', Collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly ''Columbia'' down to meet ''Eagle''.{{sfn|Collins|2001|pp=406â€“408, 410}}

=== Return ===

[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|right|''Eagle''{{'s}} ascent stage approaching ''Columbia'']]

''Eagle'' rendezvoused with ''Columbia'' at 21:24 UTC on July 21, and the two docked at 21:35. ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23:41.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} Just before the [[Apollo 12]] flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle''{{'s}} orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an &quot;uncertain location&quot; on the lunar surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |title=Apollo Tables |last=Williams |first=David R. |work=[[NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001125211/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |archivedate=October 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: {{quote|&amp;nbsp;... The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly&amp;nbsp;... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people&amp;nbsp;... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=222}}}}
Aldrin added: {{quote|This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown&amp;nbsp;... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. &quot;When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=222}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Psalm|8:3â€“4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Armstrong concluded: {{quote|The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.&quot;{{sfn|Collins|Aldrin|1975|p=222}} }}

On the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg was later thanked by Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The 10-year-old who helped Apollo 11, 40 years later |last=Rodriguez |first=Rachel |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/07/20/apollo11.irpt/index.html |work=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hornet'' was then at her home port of [[Long Beach, California]].{{sfn|Carmichael|2010|p=21}} On reaching [[Pearl Harbor]] on July 5, ''Hornet'' [[Embarkation|embarked]] the [[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King]] helicopters of [[HS-4]], a unit which specialized in recovery of Apollo spacecraft, specialized divers of [[Underwater Demolition Team|UDT]] Detachment Apollo, a 35-man NASA recovery team, and about 120 media representatives.

Weather satellites were not yet common, but US Air Force [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Hank Brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images. He realized that a storm front was headed for the Apollo recovery area. Poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult, and strong upper level winds which &quot;would have ripped their parachutes to shreds&quot; according to Brandli; posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2013/October%202013/1013weather.aspx|title=Weather or Not|website=Air Force Magazine|access-date=July 22, 2019|date=October 2013|last1=Richelson|first1=Jeffrey T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandli alerted Navy Captain Willard S. Houston Jr., the commander of the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Fleet Weather Center]] at Pearl Harbor, who had the required security clearance. On their recommendation, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Donald C.

This altered the flight plan. A different sequence of computer programs was used, one never before attempted. In a conventional entry, P64 was followed by P67. For a skip-out re-entry, P65 and P66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip. In this case, because they were extending the re-entry but not actually skipping out, P66 was not invoked and instead P65 led directly to P67. The crew were also warned they would not be in a full-lift (heads-down) attitude when they entered P67.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ Re-entry&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/ap11fj/26day9-reentry.html |publisher=Apollo Flight Journal |title=Day 9: Re-entry and Splashdown |via=NASA |first1=W.

Before dawn on July 24, ''Hornet'' launched four Sea King helicopters and three [[Grumman E-1 Tracer]]s.

The divers then passed biological isolation garments (BIGs) to the astronauts, and assisted them into the life raft. The possibility of bringing back [[pathogen]]s from the lunar surface was considered remote, but NASA took precautions at the recovery site. The astronauts were rubbed down with a [[sodium hypochlorite]] solution and ''Columbia'' wiped with [[Betadine]] to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter. BIGs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board ''Hornet''.

After Nixon departed, ''Hornet'' was brought alongside the {{convert|5|ST|adj=on}} ''Columbia'', which was lifted aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a [[Dolly (trailer)|dolly]] and moved next to the MQF. It was then attached to the MQF with a flexible tunnel, allowing the lunar samples, film, data tapes and other items to be removed. ''Hornet'' returned to Pearl Harbor, where the MQF was loaded onto a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]] and airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center. The astronauts arrived at the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] at 10:00 UTC on July 28. ''Columbia'' was taken to [[Ford Island]] for deactivation, and its pyrotechnics made safe. It was then taken to [[Hickham Air Force Base]], from whence it was flown to Houston in a [[Douglas C-133 Cargomaster]], reaching the Lunar Receiving Laboratory on July 30.{{sfn|Mission Evaluation Team|1969|pp=166, 171â€“173}}

== Legacy ==

=== Cultural significance ===

Humans walking on the Moon and returning safely to Earth accomplished Kennedy's goal set eight years earlier. In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy's speech flashed on the screen, followed by the words &quot;TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Launius&quot; /&gt; The success of Apollo 11 demonstrated the United States' technological superiority;&lt;ref name=&quot;Launius&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Apollomon/Apollo.html|title=Project Apollo: A Retrospective Analysis|last1=Launius|first1=Roger D.|access-date=January 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the success of Apollo 11, America had won the Space Race.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|page=57}}{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=288}}

New phrases permeated into the English language. &quot;If they can send a man to the Moon, why can't they&amp;nbsp;...?&quot; became a common saying following Apollo 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Washington Post |title=We Put a Man on the Moon, So Why Can't We ...? |first=David |last=Beard |first2=Nick |last2=Kirkpatrick |date=July 17, 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/07/17/we-put-a-man-on-the-moon-so-why-cant-we/?noredirect=on |access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong's words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|page=57}}

While most people celebrated the accomplishment, disenfranchised Americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in America, evidenced by protesters outside of Kennedy Space Center the day before Apollo 11 launched.{{sfn|Schefter|1999|p=283}} This is not to say they were not awed by it. [[Ralph Abernathy]], leading a protest march, was so captivated by the spectacle of the Apollo 11 launch that he forgot what he was going to say.{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=338}} Racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the Apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on Earth. A poem by [[Gil Scott-Heron]] called &quot;Whitey on the Moon&quot; illustrated the [[racial inequality in the United States]] that was highlighted by the Space Race.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|p=57}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/gil-scott-herons-poem-whitey-on-the-moon/239622/|title=Gil Scott-Heron's Poem, 'Whitey on the Moon'|last1=Madrigal|first1=Alexis C.|date=May 28, 2011|access-date=January 3, 2019|magazine=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitey&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthis-chiroux/whitey-on-the-moon-again_b_1188220.html|title=Whitey on the Moon, Again?|date=March 11, 2012|last1=Chiroux|first1=Matthis|work=Huffington Post|access-date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem starts with:

{{Poemquote|A rat done bit my sister Nell.

Twenty percent of the world's population watched humans walk on the Moon for the first time. While Apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world, the follow-on Apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Launius&quot; /&gt; One possible explanation was the shift in complexity. Landing someone on the Moon was an easy goal to understand; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person. Another is that Kennedy's goal of landing humans on the Moon had already been accomplished.{{sfn|Chaikin|2007|p=58}} A well-defined objective helped Project Apollo accomplish its goal, but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch14-7.html|title=Where No Man Has Gone Before: A History of Apollo Lunar Exploration Missions|journal=NASA Special Publication|volume=494|pages=420|last1=Compton|first1=William David|bibcode=1989NASSP.494..420C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/space-exploration/apollo-11|title=Apollo 11|publisher=History|date=August 23, 2018|access-date=January 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Americans were proud of their nation's achievements in space exploration, only once during the late 1960s did the [[Gallup Poll]] indicate that a majority of Americans favored &quot;doing more&quot; in space as opposed to &quot;doing less&quot;. By 1973, 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration. The Space Race had ended, and Cold War tensions were easing as the US and Soviet Union entered the era of [[dÃ©tente]]. This was also a time when [[inflation]] was rising, which put pressure on the government to reduce spending. What saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great. Drastic cuts, warned [[Caspar Weinberger]], the deputy director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], might send a signal that &quot;our best years are behind us&quot;.{{sfn|McCurdy|1997|pp=106â€“107}}

After the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. At the time the Soviet Union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically. The Soviets publicly denied there was a race to the Moon, and indicated they were not making an attempt.{{sfn|Chaikin|1994|p=631}} [[Mstislav Keldysh]] said in July 1969, &quot;We are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems.&quot; It was revealed in 1989 that the Soviets had tried to send people to the Moon, but were unable due to technological difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/18/us/russians-finally-admit-they-lost-race-to-moon.html|title=Russians Finally Admit They Lost Race to Moon|last1=Wilford|first1=John Noble|date=December 18, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public's reaction in the Soviet Union was mixed. The Soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing, which affected the reaction. A portion of the populace did not give it any attention, and another portion was angered by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/apollo-moon-khrushchev/|title=The Moon Landing through Soviet Eyes: A Q&amp;A with Sergei Khrushchev, son of former premier Nikita Khrushchev|magazine=Scientific American|date=July 16, 2009|access-date=January 7, 2019|last1=Das|first1=Saswato R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs &quot;Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins&quot; by [[The Byrds]] on the 1969 album ''[[Ballad of Easy Rider (album)|Ballad of Easy Rider]]'' and &quot;Coon on the Moon&quot; by [[Howlin' Wolf]] on the 1973 album ''The Back Door Wolf''.

The descent stage of the LM ''Eagle'' remains on the Moon.

The location is uncertain because ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/spacecraft/location/lm.cfm?dom=pscau |title=Location of Apollo Lunar Modules |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moon rocks ===

The main repository for the Apollo Moon rocks is the [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]] at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in [[Houston, Texas]]. For safekeeping, there is also a smaller collection stored at [[White Sands Test Facility]] near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. Most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture. They are handled only indirectly, using special tools. Over 100 research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples, and approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lun-fac.cfm |title=Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility |publisher=NASA |access-date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://world.wng.org/2016/09/the_mystery_of_the_missing_moon_rocks |title=The mystery of the missing Moon rocks |publisher=World |first=Kristen |last=Flavin |date=September 10, 2016 |access-date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1969, Nixon asked NASA to make up about 250 presentation [[Apollo 11 lunar sample display]]s for 135 nations, the fifty states of the United States and its possessions, and the United Nations. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11. The rice-sized particles were four small pieces of Moon soil weighing about 50&amp;nbsp;mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a [[Half dollar (United States coin)|United States half dollar coin]]. This acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust. The Apollo 11 lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by Nixon in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_apollo11.html |title=Where today are the Apollo 11 goodwill lunar sample displays? |first1=Robert |last1=Pearlman |authorlink=Robert Pearlman |publisher=collectSPACE |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Earth'' magazine, March 2011, pp. 42â€“51&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:

A documentary film, ''[[Apollo 11 (2019 film)|Apollo 11]]'', with restored footage of the 1969 event, premiered in [[IMAX]] on March 1, 2019, and broadly in theaters on March 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kenny |first=Glenn |title='Apollo 11' Review: The 1969 Moon Mission Still Has the Power to Thrill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/movies/apollo-11-review.html |date=February 27, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/apollo-11-documentary-imax-release-1203138469/|title='Apollo 11' Documentary Gets Exclusive Imax Release|magazine=Variety|date=February 13, 2019|last1=Rubin|first1=Rebecca|access-date=September 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian Institute's [[National Air and Space Museum]] and [[NASA]] sponsored the &quot;Apollo 50 Festival&quot; on the [[National Mall]] in Washington DC. The three day (July 18 to 20, 2019) outdoor festival featured hands-on exhibits and activities, live performances, and speakers such as [[Adam Savage]] and NASA scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/apollo-50-festival|title=Apollo 50 Festival|website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=July 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo 11 projected on the washington monmument.jpg|thumb|left|A photo of the rocket was projected onto the [[Washington Monument]] during the Apollo 11 50th anniversary show.]]

As part of the festival, a projection of the {{Convert|363|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Saturn V]] rocket was displayed on the east face of the {{Convert|555|ft|adj=on}} tall [[Washington Monument]] from July 16 through the 20th from 9:30{{Nbsp}}pm until 11:30{{Nbsp}}pm (EDT). The program also included a 17-minute show that combined full-motion video projected on the Washington Monument to recreate the assembly and launch of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. The projection was joined by a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} wide recreation of the [[Kennedy Space Center]] countdown clock and two large video screens showing archival footage to recreate the time leading up to the moon landing. There were three shows per night on July 19â€“20, with the last show on Saturday delayed slightly so the portion where Armstrong first set foot on the Moon would happen exactly 50 years to the second after the actual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/go-for-the-moon|title=Apollo 50 Go For the Moon|website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|access-date=July 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
