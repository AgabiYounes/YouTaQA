An '''adventure''' is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes [[risk]]y, undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]] or participating in [[extreme sports]]. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological [[arousal]] or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky manner.

==Motivation==
Adventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), &quot;If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?&quot;.{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|url=https://archive.org/details/opendoor00kell|url-access=registration|year=1957|publisher=Garden City, N.Y. Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[wikt:excitement|excitement]]: examples are [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

Author [[Jon Levy (behaviorist)|Jon Levy]] suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/science-of-the-best-night-ever|title=The Science of the Perfect Night Out|last=Snow|first=Shane|date=2 December 2016|website=GQ|language=en|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Be remarkable—that is, worth talking about
# Involve adversity and/or perceived risk
# Bring about personal growth

==Mythology and fiction==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |newspaper=nytimes.com |date=22 December 1996 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[knight errant]] was the form the &quot;adventure seeker&quot; character took in the late Middle Ages.

The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these &quot;protagonist on adventurous journey&quot; characteristics as do many popular feature [[Adventure film|films]], such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/archives/star-wars-a-trip-to-a-far-galaxy-thats-fun-and-funny.html|title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny|author=Vincent Canby|date=26 May 1977|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark|author=Vincent Canby|date=12 June 1981|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoors===
Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the [[wilderness]] or [[Mother Nature]]. Examples include books such as ''[[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]]'' or ''[[My Side of the Mountain]]''. These books are less about &quot;questing&quot;, such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

===Questing===
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles.

===Video games===
{{See also|Adventure game}}

In [[video game culture|video-game culture]], an adventure game is a [[video game]] in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and [[puzzle| puzzle-solving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Adams | first=Ernest | title=The Designer's Notebook: Three Problems for Interactive Storytellers |date=29 December 1999| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3414/the_designers_notebook_three_.php | website=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=9 June 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510155724/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3414/the_designers_notebook_three_.php| archivedate= 10 May 2010 | url-status= live|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Video game genres|genre]]'s focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other [[narrative]]-based media, [[literature]] and [[film]], encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games ([[List of text-based computer games|text]] and [[List of graphic adventure games|graphic]]) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Joe|title=Game Design Perspectives|chapter=Special Issues in Multi player Game Design|editor=François-Dominic Laramée|publisher=Charles River Media|year=2002|isbn=1584500905|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonfiction works==
{{Unsourced section|date=February 2019}}
From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'' by [[Tom Wolfe]], or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as ''Conquistadors of the Useless'' by [[Lionel Terray]]. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

==Adventure sports==
There are many sports classified as [[adventure game]]s or sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include [[mountain climbing]], [[skydiving]], or other [[extreme sports]].
