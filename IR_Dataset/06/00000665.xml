'''''A Modest Proposal For preventing the Children of Poor People From being a Burthen to Their Parents or Country, and For making them Beneficial to the Publick&lt;!-- NOTE: This is the original spelling. Please do not modify it. Thank you. --&gt;''''',&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm | title=A Modest Proposal, by Dr. Jonathan Swift | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] | date=27 July 2008 | accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as '''''A Modest Proposal''''', is a [[Juvenalian satire|Juvenalian satirical]] essay written and published anonymously by [[Jonathan Swift]] in 1729. The essay suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by [[human cannibalism|selling their children as food]] to rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical [[hyperbole]] mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy toward the Irish in general.

In English writing, the phrase &quot;a [[wikt:modest proposal|modest proposal]]&quot; is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.

==Synopsis==
Swift's essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states: &quot;A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg&quot; /&gt;

Swift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential [[William Petty]] and the [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of &quot;a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London&quot; and &quot;the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]&quot; (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706).

In the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by [[paralipsis]]:
{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.

Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}

==Population solutions==
George Wittkowsky argued that Swift's main target in ''A Modest Proposal'' was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p76&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p85&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift’s Modest Proposal'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; A memorable example of these sorts of schemes &quot;involved the idea of running the poor through a [[joint-stock company]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p85&quot;/&gt; In response, Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' was &quot;a burlesque of projects concerning the poor&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsk_p88&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; that were in vogue during the early 18th century.

''A Modest Proposal'' also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who &quot;regard people as commodities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p101&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, Swift adopts the &quot;technique of a political arithmetician&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p95&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.

Critics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically &quot;the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defence of crime (arrogated to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p95&quot;/&gt; Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that &quot;springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wittkowsky_p98&quot;&gt;Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==
Charles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a &quot;trap&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p135&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, &quot;details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty&quot; but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p136&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create &quot;two opposing points of view&quot; that &quot;alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p136&quot;/&gt;

Swift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses &quot;the vocabulary of animal husbandry&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p138&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn &quot;people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p138&quot;/&gt;

Swift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician [[Quintilian]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p139&quot;&gt;Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast between the &quot;careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme&quot; and &quot;the ridiculousness of the proposal&quot; create a situation in which the reader has &quot;to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_p139&quot;/&gt;

==Influences==
Scholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wrote ''A Modest Proposal''.

===Tertullian's ''Apology''===
James William Johnson argues that ''A Modest Proposal'' was largely influenced and inspired by [[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus|Apology]]'': a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p. 563&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works ''A Modest Proposal'' and ''Apology''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p562&quot;&gt;Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p. 562&lt;/ref&gt; In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that &quot;human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;/&gt; Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson_p563&quot;/&gt; In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic &quot;justification by ownership&quot; over the subject of sacrificing children—Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker_p219&quot;&gt;Baker, ''Tertullian and Swift's A Modest Proposal'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defoe's ''The Generous Projector''===
It has also been argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay ''The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children'' by Swift's rival [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/021909/books1.html | title=A modest but failed proposal | work=[[Montreal Mirror]] | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2012 | last=Waters | first=Juliet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandeville's ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' ===
[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' asked to introduce public and state controlled [[bordello]]s. The 1726 paper acknowledges women's interests and{{snd}}while not being a completely satirical text{{snd}}has also been discussed as an inspiration for Jonathan Swift's title.&lt;ref name=&quot;hur&quot;&gt;Eine Streitschrift…, Essay von Ursula Pia Jauch. Carl Hanser Verlag, München 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2V_HAAAAQBAJ |title=Bernard Mandeville's &quot;A Modest Defence of Publick Stews&quot;: Prostitution and Its Discontents in Early Georgian England |last=Primer |first=I. |date=15 March 2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781403984609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandeville had by 1705 already become famous for the [[The Fable of the Bees|Fable of The Bees]] and deliberations on private vices and public benefits.

=== John Locke's ''First Treatise of Government'' ===
[[John Locke]] commented: &quot;Be it then as Sir Robert says, that Anciently, it was usual for Men to sell and Castrate their Children. Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power, ''that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them'': If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto&quot;. (First Treatise, sec. 59).

==Economic themes==
Robert Phiddian's article &quot;Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal&quot; focuses on two aspects of ''A Modest Proposal'': the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that &quot;there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p6&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

While Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of &quot;Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet&quot;, argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of Swift's time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. &quot;[I]f one regards the ''Modest Proposal'' simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p3&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;People are the riches of a nation&quot;===
At the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that &quot;people are the riches of the nation&quot;, and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p4&quot;&gt;Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, &quot;in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry&quot;. In those times, the &quot;somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phiddian_p6&quot;/&gt;

Landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the Irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to &quot;become a source of wealth to the nation&quot; or else they &quot;must turn to begging and thievery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p161&quot; /&gt; This opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for, diversifying their professions, or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in Ireland. Landa wrote that, &quot;Swift is maintaining that the maxim—people are the riches of a nation—applies to Ireland only if Ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot; /&gt;

Louis A. Landa presents Swift's ''A Modest Proposal'' as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that &quot;people are the riches of a nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p161&quot;&gt;Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot;&gt;Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot; /&gt; Swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot; /&gt; Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa_p165&quot; /&gt;

== The public's reaction ==
Swift's writings created a backlash within the community after its publication. The work was aimed at the aristocracy, and they responded in turn. Several members of society wrote to Swift regarding the work. [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]]'s letter intimated that he certainly understood the message, and interpreted it as a work of comedy:

February 12, 1729–30:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I did immediately propose it to Lady Bathurst, as your advice, particularly for her last boy, which was born the plumpest, finest thing, that could be seen; but she fell in a passion, and bid me send you word, that she would not follow your direction, but that she would breed him up to be a parson, and he should live upon the fat of the land; or a lawyer, and then, instead of being eat himself, he should devour others. You know women in passion never mind what they say; but, as she is a very reasonable woman, I have almost brought her over now to your opinion; and having convinced her, that as matters stood, we could not possibly maintain all the nine, she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest: and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal; for, if he should happen to get twins, the selling of one might provide for the other. Or if, by any accident, while his wife lies in with one child, he should get a second upon the body of another woman, he might dispose of the fattest of the two, and that would help to breed up the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The more I think upon this scheme, the more reasonable it appears to me; and it ought by no means to be confined to Ireland; for, in all probability, we shall, in a very little time, be altogether as poor here as you are there. I believe, indeed, we shall carry it farther, and not confine our luxury only to the eating of children; for I happened to peep the other day into a large assembly [Parliament] not far from Westminster-hall, and I found them roasting a great fat fellow, [Walpole again] For my own part, I had not the least inclination to a slice of him; but, if I guessed right, four or five of the company had a devilish mind to be at him. Well, adieu, you begin now to wish I had ended, when I might have done it so conveniently&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HkEUAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdid=book-HkEUAAAAYAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=The Works of Jonathan Swift: Containing Additional Letters, Tracts, and Poems Not Hitherto Published; with Notes and a Life of the Author|last=Swift|first=Jonathan|last2=Scott|first2=Sir Walter|date=1814|publisher=A.

==Modern usage==
''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many literature courses as an example of [[Satire#Early modern western satire|early modern western satire]]. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.

The essay's approach has been copied many times. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), the evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and [[euthanasia]], imagining a future [[dystopia]] that advocates [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]], [[fetuses]], and some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the US [[pro-life]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as [[disability discrimination]].) In his book ''A Modest Proposal for America'' (2013), statistician [[Howard Friedman]] opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.

In the 1998 edition of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] there is a quote from ''A Modest Proposal'' before the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Handmaid's Tale|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale|website=www.goodreads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Modest Video Game Proposal'' is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] on 10 October 2005. He proposed that someone should &quot;create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game&quot; that would allow players to act out a scenario in which the game character kills video game developers.&lt;sup&gt;[[A Modest Video Game Proposal#cite note-ModestProposal-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in America|Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist]]'' includes a letter in which he uses Swift's approach in connection with the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he is going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. The letter protests against the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.

The 2012 film ''Butcher Boys,'' written by [[Kim Henkel]], is said{{By whom|date=April 2018}} to be loosely based on Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal.'' The film's opening scene takes place in a restaurant named &quot;J. Swift's&quot;.

On November 30, 2017, Jonathan Swift's 350th birthday, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a column entitled 'Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies&quot;, by [[Alexandra Petri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/11/30/why-alabamians-should-consider-eating-democrat-babies/|last=Petri|first=Alexandra|title=Why Alabamians should consider eating Democrats' babies|work=The Washington Post|date=November 30, 2017|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, [[E. Jean Carroll]] published a book titled ''[[What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal]]'', discussing problematic behaviour of male humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html|title=Donald Trump Assaulted Me, But He’s Not Alone on My List of Hideous Men|last=Carroll|first=E.

On October 3, 2019, a satirist spoke up at an event for [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], claiming that a solution to the [[Climate change|climate crisis]] was &quot;we need to eat the babies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=‘We Need to Eat the Babies!’ Climate Activist Confronts AOC at New York Town Hall|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HULW-ODeqLg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=‘We Need to Eat the Babies!’ Climate Activist Confronts AOC at New York Town Hall|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HULW-ODeqLg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
