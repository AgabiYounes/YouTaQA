===Arrival of Europeans and Spanish period===
The first Europeans to visit Aruba were [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in 1499, who claimed the island for [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aruba2&quot;/&gt; Both men described Aruba as an &quot;island of giants&quot;, remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquetíos.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]] from the island and described houses built into the ocean.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and the Spanish began colonising the island.&lt;ref name=advent&gt;{{cite book| last=Sullivan| first=Lynne M.| year=2006| title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire &amp; Curaçao| publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.| location=Edison, NJ| pages=57–58| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&amp;lpg=PA58| access-date=23 October 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514165106/https://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&amp;lpg=PA58| archive-date=14 May 2016| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite book| last=Sauer| first=Carl Ortwin| year=1966| title=The Early Spanish Main| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| page=112| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&amp;lpg=PA112| access-date=23 October 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503195247/https://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&amp;lpg=PA112| archive-date=3 May 2016| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alonso de Ojeda was appointed the island's first governor in 1508.

===Early Dutch period===
[[File:Bushiribana gold mine.jpg|thumb|right|Remains of a gold mine at Bushiribana]]
The Netherlands seized Aruba from Spain in 1636 in the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aruba2&quot;/&gt; [[Peter Stuyvesant]], later appointed to [[New Amsterdam]] (New York), was the first Dutch governor. Those Arawak who had survived the depredations of the Spanish were allowed to farm and graze livestock, with the Dutch using the island as a source of meat for their other possessions in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aruba2&quot;/&gt; Aruba's proximity to [[South America]] resulted in interactions with the cultures of the coastal areas; for example, architectural similarities can be seen between the 19th-century parts of Oranjestad and the nearby Venezuelan city of [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]] in [[Falcón State]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Historically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration; its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=Putte&gt;''Dede pikiña ku su bisiña: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd''. van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers&lt;/ref&gt; Students on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Van Putte 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the [[British Empire]] took control of the island, occupying it between 1806 and 1816, before handing it back to the Dutch as per the terms of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/aruba.htm|title=British Empire: Caribbean: Aruba|access-date=14 June 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FlEDeLGO?url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/aruba.htm|archive-date=9 April 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aruba2&quot;/&gt; Aruba subsequently became part of the [[Colony of Curaçao and Dependencies]] along with [[Bonaire]]. During the 19th century an economy based on [[gold mining]], [[phosphate]] production and [[aloe vera]] plantations developed, however the island remained a relatively poor backwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;

===20th-21st centuries===
The first oil refinery in Aruba was built in 1928 by [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. The facility was built just to the west of the capital city Oranjestad and was commonly called the Eagle. Immediately following this, another refinery was built by [[Lago Oil and Transport Company]] in an area now known as San Nicolas on the east end of Aruba. These refineries processed crude oil from the vast Venezuelan oil fields, bringing greater prosperity to the island.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gastmann, &quot;Suriname and the Dutch in the Caribbean&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 189. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery on Aruba grew to become one of the largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;

During World War II, the Netherlands was [[German occupation of the Netherlands|occupied by Nazi Germany]]. In 1940, the oil facilities in Aruba came under the administration of the [[Dutch government-in-exile]] in London, causing them to be [[Attack on Aruba|attacked]] by the German navy in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Central American and Caribbean Air Forces'', Daniel Hagedorn, Air Britain (Historians) Ltd., Tonbridge, 1993, p.135, {{ISBN|0 85130 210 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1947, Aruba presented its first ''Staatsreglement'' (constitution) for Aruba's ''[[Independence|status aparte]]'' as an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], prompted by the efforts of [[Henny Eman (AVP founder)|Henny Eman]], a noted Aruban politician. By 1954, the [[Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] was established, providing a framework for relations between Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robbers|first=Gerhard|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|volume=1|year=2007|location=New York City|page=649|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;lpg=PA649|isbn=0-8160-6078-9|access-date=23 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423233225/https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;lpg=PA649|archive-date=23 April 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created the [[Netherlands Antilles]], which united all of the Dutch colonies in the Caribbean into one administrative structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11511355 |title=Status change means Dutch Antilles no longer exists |date=10 October 2010 |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011042955/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11511355 |archive-date=11 October 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Arubans were unhappy at the arrangement, however, as the new polity was perceived as being dominated by Curaçao.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Betico Croes 1982cr.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Bettico Croes, a pivotal figure in Aruba's drive for greater autonomy in the 1970s-80s]]
In 1972, at a conference in [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]], [[Betico Croes]], a politician from Aruba, proposed the creation of a Dutch Commonwealth of four states: Aruba, the Netherlands, Suriname, and the [[Netherlands Antilles]], each to have its own nationality. Backed by his newly-created party (the [[People's Electoral Movement (Aruba)|Movimiento Electoral di Pueblo]]), Croes sought greater autonomy for Aruba, with the long-term goal of independence, adopting the trappings of an independent state in 1976 with the creation of a flag and national anthem.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; In March 1977, a [[1977 Aruban independence referendum|referendum]] was held with the support of the United Nations; 82% of the participants voted for complete independence from the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Aruba Profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20211986 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Aruba profile&amp;nbsp;— Timeline |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830102036/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-20211986 |archive-date=30 August 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions mounted as Croes stepped up the pressure on the Dutch government by organising a general strike in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; Croes later met with Dutch Prime Minister [[Joop den Uyl]], with the two sides agreeing to assign the Institute of Social Studies in [[The Hague]] to prepare a study for independence, entitled ''Aruba en Onafhankelijkheid, achtergronden, modaliteiten, en mogelijkheden; een rapport in eerste aanleg'' (Aruba and independence, backgrounds, modalities, and opportunities; a preliminary report) (1978).&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;

In March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985, Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles, officially becoming a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with full independence planned for 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; However, Croes was seriously injured in a traffic accident in 1985, slipping into a coma; he died in 1986, never seeing the enaction of ''status aparte'' for Aruba for which he had worked over many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; After his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed ''Libertador di Aruba''.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; Thus [[Henny Eman]] of the [[Aruban People's Party]] (AVP) became the first [[Prime Minister of Aruba]]. Meanwhile, Aruba's oil refinery shut, negatively impacting the economy. As a result, Aruba pushed for a dramatic increase in tourism, with this sector growing to become the island's largest industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt;

At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's Prime Minister [[Nelson Oduber]], the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely Aruba's transition to full independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiadiaruba1&quot;/&gt; The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.

===Cities and towns===
{{main|List of cities in Aruba}}
The island, with a population of about 116,600 people (July 2018 est.)&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; does not have major cities. It is divided into six districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aruba.com/us/our-island/regions|title=Cities in Aruba - Guide to Aruba's Biggest Cities|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223030115/https://www.aruba.com/us/our-island/regions|archive-date=23 December 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the island's population resides in or around the two major city-like districts of [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]] (the capital) and [[San Nicolaas]]. Oranjestad and San Nicolaas are both divided into two districts for census purposes only.&lt;ref name=&quot;census2010&quot;&gt;{{cite report|url=http://cbs.aw/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Fifth-Population-and-Housing-Census-Aruba.pdf|title=Fifth Population and Housing Census, 2010: Selected Tables|author=Aruba Central Bureau of Statistics|date=29 September 2010|pages=75–76|access-date=3 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113150931/http://cbs.aw/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Fifth-Population-and-Housing-Census-Aruba.pdf|archivedate=13 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The districts are as follows:

* [[Noord]]
* [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]
* [[Paradera]]
* [[San Nicolaas]]
* [[Santa Cruz, Aruba|Santa Cruz]]
* [[Savaneta]]

===Fauna===
The isolation of Aruba from the mainland of South America has fostered the [[evolution]] of multiple endemic animals. The island provides a habitat for the endemic [[Cnemidophorus arubensis|Aruban Whiptail]] and [[Crotalus unicolor|Aruba Rattlesnake]], as well as an endemic subspecies of [[Athene cunicularia|Burrowing Owl]] and [[Eupsittula pertinax|Brown-throated Parakeet]].
[[File:Natural Pool in Aruba-July 4, 2018.jpg|thumb|Natural Pool in Santa Cruz]]

===Flora===
[[File:Arikok NP.jpg|thumb|Cacti in [[Arikok National Park]]]]

The flora of Aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. [[Xeric scrublands]] are common, with various forms of [[cacti]], thorny shrubs, and evergreens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; [[Aloe vera]] is also present, its economic importance earning it a place on the [[Coat of Arms of Aruba]].

[[Cacti]] like ''[[Melocactus]]'' and ''[[Opuntia]]'' are represented on Aruba by species like ''[[Opuntia stricta]]''.
Trees like ''[[Caesalpina coriaria]]'' and ''[[Vachellia tortuosa]]'' are drought tolerant.

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Aruba}}
By the [[Köppen climate classification]], Aruba has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'').&lt;ref name=extremes /&gt; Mean monthly temperature in Oranjestad varies little from {{convert|26.7|°C|1}} to {{convert|29.2|C}}, moderated by constant [[trade winds]] from the Atlantic Ocean, which come from the north-east. Yearly rainfall barely exceeds {{convert|470|mm|in|1|disp=or}} in Oranjestad, although it is extremely variable&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; 'Geographical patterning in interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach'; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457–3466&lt;/ref&gt; and can range from as little as {{convert |150|mm|in|2|disp=or}} during strong [[El Niño]] years (e.g. 1911/1912, 1930/1931, 1982/1983, 1997/1998) to over {{convert|1000|mm|in|2|disp=or}} in [[La Niña]] years like 1933/1934, 1970/1971 or 1988/1989.

In terms of ethnic composition, the population is estimated to be 75% mixed European/Amerindian/African, 15% Black and 10% other ethnicities.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Arawak heritage is stronger on Aruba than on most Caribbean islands; although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch settlers, and to a lesser extent the various other groups that have settled on the island over time, such as various African peoples, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jews.

Recently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighbouring South American and Caribbean nations, attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Most notable are those from Venezuela, which lies just {{convert|18|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the south.

{{main|Languages of Aruba}}

The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Papiamento]]. However, whilst Dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchcaribbeanlegalportal.com/about-us/the-dutch-caribbean |title=About Us |website=DutchCaribbeanLegalPortal.com |accessdate=20 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052254/http://www.dutchcaribbeanlegalportal.com/about-us/the-dutch-caribbean |archive-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papiamento is the predominant language used on Aruba. It is a [[creole language]], spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], that incorporates words from Portuguese, various West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; [[English language|English]] is also spoken, its usage having grown due to tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Other common languages spoken, based on the size of their community, are Portuguese, German, Spanish, and French.

In recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of Papiamento. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The orthography differs per island, with Aruba using etymological Papiamento, and Curaçao and Bonaire a phonetic Papiamento. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. &quot;y&quot; instead of &quot;j&quot;), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.

The book ''[[History of the Buccaneers of America|Buccaneers of America]]'', first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the natives on Aruba spoke Spanish already.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Dede pikiña ku su bisiña: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd. van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venezuela]]n TV networks are received on the island, and Aruba also has significant Venezuelan and Colombian communities.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British took Curaçao, Aruba, and [[Bonaire]]. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials already noted wide use of the language.&lt;ref name=Putte /&gt;

Aruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'', and ''Awe Mainta'', and three in English: ''Aruba Daily'', ''Aruba Today'', and ''The News''.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} ''Amigoe'' is a newspaper published in Dutch.

===Politics===
The Aruban legal system is based on the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch model]]. In Aruba, legal jurisdiction lies with the ''Gerecht in Eerste Aanleg'' ([[Court of First Instance]]) on Aruba, the ''Gemeenschappelijk Hof van Justitie van Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, en van Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba'' ([[Joint Court of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, and of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba]]) and the ''[[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden]]'' (Supreme Court of Justice of the Netherlands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aruba.com/us/things-to-do|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215045034/http://www.aruba.com/ExploretheIsland/IslandFacts/law.aspx|url-status=dead|title=Best Things to do in Aruba - Aruba.com|archivedate=15 February 2013|website=www.aruba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Korps Politie Aruba'' ([[Aruba Police Force]]) is the island's law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in Oranjestad, Noord, San Nicolaas, and Santa Cruz, where it is headquartered.&lt;ref name=&quot;KPA-districts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|title=Korps Politie Aruba: district precincts|publisher=Aruba Police Force|accessdate=11 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226151741/http://www.kparuba.com/districts.html|archive-date=26 February 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deficit spending]] has been a staple in Aruba's history, and modestly high inflation has been present as well. By 2006, the government's debt had grown to 1.883 billion Aruban florins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Central Bureau of Statistics |title=Key Indicators General Government, 1997–2006 |url=http://www.cbs.aw/cbs/manageDocument.do?dispatch=view&amp;id=927 |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722232628/http://www.cbs.aw/cbs/manageDocument.do?dispatch=view&amp;id=927 |archivedate=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit. [[Direct tax]]es have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Foreign relations===
Like Bonaire and a few other Dutch dependencies, Aruba maintains economic and cultural relations with [[European Union]] and [[United States of America]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Military===
{{See also|Military of Aruba}}

Defence on Aruba is the responsibility of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; The [[Military of the Netherlands|Netherlands Military]] forces that protect Aruba include the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], the [[Netherlands Marine Corps]], and the [[Netherlands Coastguard]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Aruba}}

[[File:Aruba export map.png|thumb|upright=1.10|Graphical breakdown of Aruba's economy by exports]]

The island's economy is dominated by four main industries: tourism, [[aloe]] export, [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], and offshore banking.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the Caribbean region. The GDP per capita (PPP) for Aruba was estimated to be $37,500 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=CIA |title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |website=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=12 September 2019 |date=10 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main trading partners are Colombia, the United States, Venezuela, and the Netherlands.

The agriculture and manufacturing sectors are fairly minimal. [[Gold mining]] was formerly important in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; [[Aloe]] was introduced to Aruba in 1840 but did not become a big export until 1890. Cornelius Eman founded Aruba Aloe Balm, and over time the industry became very important to the economy. At one point, two-thirds of the island was covered in Aloe Vera fields, and Aruba become the largest exporter of aloe in the world. The industry continues today, though on a smaller scale.

The official exchange rate of the [[Aruban florin]] is pegged to the US dollar at 1.79 florins to US$1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.currency.me.uk/convert/usd/awg |title=Convert Dollars to Aruba Florin &amp;#124; USD to AWG Currency Converter |publisher=Currency.me.uk |accessdate=15 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703032115/http://www.currency.me.uk/convert/usd/awg |archive-date=3 July 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/AWG.aspx |title=Convert United States Dollar to Aruban Florin &amp;#124; USD to AWG Currency Converter |publisher=Themoneyconverter.com |accessdate=15 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731235431/http://themoneyconverter.com/USD/AWG.aspx |archive-date=31 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---note that currency fluctuates slightly because of the necessity of forcing the florin to the dollar by buying or selling florins or dollars---&gt; Because of this fact, and due to a large number of American tourists, many businesses operate using US dollars instead of florins, especially in the hotel and resort districts.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Tourism===
[[File:RIU Palace Antillas - Aruba.jpg|thumb|A tourist resort on the island]]

About three-quarters of the Aruban [[gross national product]] is earned through tourism and related activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most tourists are from North America, with a market-share of 73.3%, followed by Latin America with 15.2% and Europe with 8.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://antilliaansdagblad.com/aruba/19438-toerisme-aruba-naar-recordhoogte|title=Toerisme Aruba naar recordhoogte|publisher=Antilliaans Dagblad|date=5 May 2019|accessdate=24 May 2019|language=nl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506090901/https://antilliaansdagblad.com/aruba/19438-toerisme-aruba-naar-recordhoogte|archive-date=6 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For passengers whose destination is the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) has a full pre-clearance facility in Aruba which has been in effect since 1 February 2001 with the expansion of Queen Beatrix Airport.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}  Since 2008, Aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://highend-traveller.com/aruba/|title=Aruba|date=31 May 2016|work=HighEnd-traveller.com|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174753/https://highend-traveller.com/aruba/|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aruba has a varied culture. According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), in 2005 there were ninety-two different nationalities living on the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of &quot;[[Sinterklaas]]&quot; on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 27 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the King's birthday or &quot;Dia di Rey&quot; ([[Koningsdag]]) is celebrated.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

On 18 March, Aruba celebrates its National Day. Christmas and [[New Year's Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and ''[[Hallaca|ayaca]]'', ''[[ponche crema]]'', ham, and other typical foods and drinks. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on 24 June. Besides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are also holidays on the island.

The festival of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries. Its celebration in Aruba started in the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Curaçao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten, and Anguilla) who came to work for the oil refinery.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}  Over the years, the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January until the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (the Sunday before Ash Wednesday).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Tourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] in October and Thanksgiving Day in November.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
