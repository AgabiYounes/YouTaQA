'''Fantasy comedy''' or '''comic fantasy''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[fantasy]] that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Typically set in imaginary worlds, fantasy comedy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy.

==Literature==
The subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. Elements of fantasy comedy can be found in such nineteenth century works
as some of [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tales, [[Charles Dickens]]' &quot;Christmas Books&quot;, and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] books.&lt;ref name=&quot;pringle&quot;&gt;&quot;Humourous Fantasy&quot; in [[David Pringle]],ed, ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', (pp.31-33). London, Carlton,2006. {{ISBN|1-84442-110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first writer to specialize in the subgenre was &quot;[[Thomas Anstey Guthrie|F. Anstey]]&quot; in novels such as ''[[Vice Versa (novel)|Vice Versa]]'' (1882), where magic disrupts Victorian society with humorous results.&lt;ref name=&quot;pringle&quot; /&gt; Anstey's work was popular enough to inspire several imitations, including [[E. Nesbit]]'s light-hearted children's fantasies, ''[[The Phoenix and the Carpet]]'' (1904) and ''[[The Story of the Amulet]]'' (1906).&lt;ref name=&quot;pringle&quot; /&gt; The United States had several writers of fantasy comedy, including [[James Branch Cabell]], whose satirical fantasy ''[[Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice]]'' (1919) was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar MacDonald, &quot;James Branch Cabell&quot; in [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed.''Supernatural Fiction Writers'' (pp. .789-796). New York: Scribner's, 1985.  {{ISBN|0-684-17808-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another American writer in a similar vein was [[Thorne Smith]], whose works (such as ''[[Topper (novel series)|Topper]]'' and ''The Night Life of the Gods'') were popular and influential, and often adapted for film and television.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Neilson, &quot;Thorne Smith&quot; in Bleiler, ed.''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. (pp. 805-812), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Humorous fantasies narrated in a &quot;gentleman's club&quot; setting are common; they include [[John Kendrick Bangs]]' ''A Houseboat on the Styx'' (1895), [[Lord Dunsany]]'s &quot;[[Joseph Jorkens|Jorkens]]&quot; stories, and [[Maurice Richardson]]'s 
''The Exploits of Englebrecht'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Langford]], &quot;Humor&quot;, in 
''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005
{{ISBN|0313329516}},  (p.401-404).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Lin Carter]], [[T. H. White]]'s works exemplify fantasy comedy,&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ed. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery'', p 121–2. Doubleday and Company Garden City, NY, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]]'s [[Harold Shea]] stories are early exemplars.  The overwhelming bulk of de Camp's fantasy was comic.&lt;ref&gt;Carter. ''Kingdoms of Sorcery''.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt and de Camp were among several contributors to ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Worlds]]'', a [[pulp magazine]] which emphasized fantasy with a comedic element. The work of [[Fritz Leiber]] also appeared in ''Unknown Worlds'', including his [[Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser]] stories, a jocose take on the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre.&lt;ref name=&quot;pringle&quot; /&gt;

In more modern times, [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' books, [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Xanth]]'' books, [[Robert Asprin]]'s ''[[MythAdventures]]'' of Skeeve and Aahz books, and [[Tom Holt]]'s books provide good examples,&lt;ref name=&quot;pringle&quot; /&gt; as do many of the works by [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]. There are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including [[Chuck Whelon]]'s Pewfell series and the webcomics ''[[8-Bit Theater]]'' and ''[[The Order of the Stick]]''. Other recent authors in the genre include Toby Frost, Stuart Sharp, Nicholas Andrews, and DC Farmer, and the writing team of John P. Logsdon and Christopher P. Young.

==Other media==
The subgenre has also been represented in [[Fantasy television|television]], such as in the television series ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[Kröd Mändoon]]''. Examples on radio are the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Hordes of the Things (radio series)|Hordes of the Things]]'' and ''[[ElvenQuest]]''. fantasy comedy films can either be parodies (''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''), comedies with fantastical elements (''[[Being John Malkovich]]'') or animated (''[[Shrek]]''). It has also been used in the movie ''[[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle]]''.
