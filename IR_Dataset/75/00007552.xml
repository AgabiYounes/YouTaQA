* [[Abiogenesis]], the transition from nonliving elements to living systems
* [[Astrochemistry]], the study of the abundance and reactions of molecules in the universe, and their interaction with radiation
* [[Cosmochemistry]], the study of the chemical compositions in the universe and the processes that led to them
* [[Evolution of metal ions in biological systems]], incorporation of metallic ions into living organisms and how it has changed over time
* [[Gas evolution reaction]], the process of a gas bubbling out from a solution
* [[Molecular evolution]], evolution at the scale of molecules
* [[Oxygen evolution]], the process of generating molecular oxygen through chemical reaction
* [[Stellar nucleosynthesis]], the creation of chemical elements by stellar thermonuclear fusion or supernovae
