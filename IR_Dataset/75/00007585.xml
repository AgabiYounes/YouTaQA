'''Chaim Topol''' ({{lang-he|חיים טופול}}, born September 9, 1935),{{sfn|Maltin|1994|p=881}} also spelled '''Haym Topol''',{{sfn|Monaco|1991|p=537}} [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] known as '''Topol''',&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; is an [[Israel|Israeli]] actor, singer, comedian, voice artist, film producer, author, and illustrator. He is best known for his portrayal of [[Tevye|Tevye the Dairyman]], the lead role in the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', on both stage and screen, having performed this role more than 3,500 times in shows and revivals from the late 1960s through to 2009.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Lifestyle/One-more-fiddle-for-the-road|title=One More Fiddle for the Road|first=Robert|last=Slater|date=February 6, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2017|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topol began his acting career during his [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] service in the [[Nahal]] entertainment troupe, and later toured Israel with [[kibbutz]] theatre and satirical theatre companies. He was a co-founder of the [[Haifa Theatre]]. His breakthrough film role came in 1964 as the title character in ''[[Sallah Shabati]]'', by Israeli writer [[Ephraim Kishon]], for which he won a [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor|Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer—Male]]. Topol went on to appear in more than 30 films in Israel and the United States, including ''[[Galileo (1975 film)|Galileo]]'' (1975), ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' (1980) and ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981). He was described as Israel's only internationally recognized entertainer from the 1960s through the 1980s. He won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe for Best Actor]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his 1971 [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|film portrayal]] of Tevye, and was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical|Tony Award for Best Actor]] for a 1991 Broadway revival of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.

==Early life==
Topol was born on September 9, 1935, in [[Tel Aviv]],{{sfn|Monaco|1991|p=537}} in what was then [[Mandatory Palestine]] (now [[Israel]]). His father, Jacob Topol, had [[aliyah|immigrated to Mandatory Palestine]] from Poland in the early 1930s and worked as a plasterer;&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;{{sfn|Bonfante|1971|p=90}}  he also served in the [[Haganah]] paramilitary organization.&lt;ref name=i24&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/culture/144142-170501-chaim-topol-a-fiddler-for-life|title= EXCLUSIVE: Fiddler on the Roof's Chaim Topol and his memories of Israeli independence|first=Maya|last=Margit|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=November 25, 2017|work=[[i24news]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Imrela &quot;Rel&quot; (née Goldman) Topol, was a seamstress.&lt;ref name=ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/86/Topol.html|title=Topol Film Reference biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/0024-D-56621-00.html|title=חיים טופול - החיים כמשחק|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Chaim Topol: Life as a Game|first=Shulamit|last=Kisri|date=February 10, 2011|accessdate=November 28, 2017|work=[[News1]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Topol's parents had been involved in the [[Betar]] Zionist youth movement in Poland before immigrating. His father had [[Hasidic Jews|Hasidic]] roots, with a mother coming from a family of [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer Hasidim]], while his father came from [[Aleksander (Hasidic dynasty)|Aleksander Hasidim]].

Chaim and his two younger sisters grew up in the South Tel Aviv working-class neighborhood of [[Florentin, Tel Aviv|Florentin]]. As a young child, although he wanted to become a commercial artist, his [[elementary school]] teacher, the writer [[Yemima Avidar-Tchernovitz]], saw a theatrical side to him, and encouraged him to act in school plays and read stories to the class.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

At age 14 he began working as a printer at the ''[[Davar]]'' newspaper while pursuing his high school studies at night.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; He graduated high school at age 17 and moved to [[Kibbutz]] [[Geva]]. A year later, he enlisted in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] and became a member of the [[Nahal]] entertainment troupe, singing and acting in traveling shows.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Bial|2005|p=80}} He rose in rank to troupe commander.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

Twenty-three days after being discharged from military service on October 2, 1956, and two days after marrying Galia Finkelstein, a fellow Nahal troupe member, Topol was called up for [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] in the [[Suez Crisis|Sinai Campaign]]. He performed for soldiers stationed in the desert. After the war, he and his wife settled in Kibbutz [[Mishmar David]], where Topol worked as a garage mechanic.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Topol assembled a kibbutz theatre company made up of friends from his Nahal troupe; the group toured four days a week, worked on their respective kibbutzim for two days a week, and had one day off. The theatre company was in existence from early 1957 to the mid-1960s. Topol both sang and acted with the group, doing both &quot;loudly&quot;.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

Between 1960 and 1964, Topol performed with the [[Batzal Yarok]] (&quot;Green Onion&quot;) satirical theatre company, which also toured Israel.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Kronish|Safirman|2003|p=215}} Other members of the group included [[Uri Zohar]], [[Nechama Hendel]], [[Zaharira Harifai]], [[Arik Einstein]], and [[Oded Kotler]].&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; In 1960, Topol co-founded the [[Haifa Theatre|Haifa Municipal Theatre]] with Yosef Milo, serving as assistant to the director and acting in plays by Shakespeare, Ionesco, and Brecht.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Hartnoll|Found|1996}} In 1965 he performed in the [[Cameri Theatre]] in Tel Aviv.{{sfn|Hartnoll|Found|1996}}

Topol's first film appearance was in the 1961 film ''[[I Like Mike (film)|I Like Mike]]'', followed by the 1963 Israeli film ''[[El Dorado (1963 film)|El Dorado]]''.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; His breakthrough role came as the lead character in the 1964 film ''[[Sallah Shabati]]''.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/iconic-actor-chaim-topol-reflects-on-long-career/|title=Iconic actor Chaim Topol reflects on long career|first=Aron|last=Heller|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=August 21, 2018|work=[[The Times of Israel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adapted for the screen by [[Ephraim Kishon]] from his original play, the social satire depicts the hardships of a Sephardic immigrant family in the rough conditions of [[ma'abarot]], immigrant absorption camps in Israel in the 1950s, satirizing &quot;just about every pillar of Israeli society: the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] establishment, the pedantic bureaucracy, corrupt political parties, rigid kibbutz ideologues and ... the [[Jewish National Fund]]'s tree-planting program&quot;.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jewishjournal.com/old_stories/541/|title=Israeli Satire and Mystery|first=Tom|last=Tugend|date=November 13, 1997|accessdate=November 26, 2017|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rivka&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playstosee.com/chaim-topol-in-conversation-with-rivka-jacobson/ |title=Chaim Topol in conversation with Rivka Jacobson|work=Plays to See|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topol, who was 29 during the filming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9400EFDE1730E33ABC4B52DFB667838E679EDE|title='Sallah,' Comedy, Opens at Little Carnegie|first=A.H.|last=Weiler|date=October 13, 1965|accessdate=November 26, 2017|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; was familiar playing the role of the family patriarch, having performed skits from the play with his Nahal entertainment troupe during his army years.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; He contributed his own ideas for the part, playing the character as a more universal [[Mizrahi Jew]] instead of specifically a [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi]], or [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jew]], and asking Kishon to change the character's first name from [[Saadia (given name)|Saadia]] (a recognizably Yemenite name) to Sallah (a more general Mizrahi name).&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

The film won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Best Foreign Language Film]], and Topol won the 1964 [[San Francisco International Film Festival#Golden Gate Awards|Golden Gate Award]] for Best Actor at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] and the 1965 [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor|Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer—Male]],&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Kronish|Safirman|2003|p=215}}&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;{{sfn|Franks|2004|p=280}} alongside [[Harve Presnell]] and [[George Segal]]. ''Sallah Shabati'' was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], losing to the Italian-language ''[[Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

In 1966, Topol made his [[English language|English-language]] film debut as Abou Ibn Kaqden in the [[Mickey Marcus]] biopic ''[[Cast a Giant Shadow]]''.&lt;ref name=ref/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Tevye the Dairyman==
Topol came to greatest prominence in his portrayal of [[Tevye|Tevye the Dairyman]] on stage and screen. He first played the lead role in the Israeli production of the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' in 1966,&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; replacing [[Shmuel Rodensky]] for 10 weeks when Rodensky fell ill.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; [[Harold Prince]], producer of the original ''Fiddler on the Roof'' that opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1964, had seen Topol in ''Sallah Shabati'' and called him to audition for the role of the fifty-something Tevye in a new production scheduled to open at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London on February 16, 1967.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=86}} Not yet fluent in English, Topol memorized the score from the Broadway [[Cast recording|cast album]] and learned the lyrics with a British native.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=86}} When Topol arrived at the audition, Prince was surprised that this 30-year-old man had played Shabati, a character in his sixties. Topol explained, &quot;A good actor can play an old man, a sad face, a happy man. Makeup is not an obstacle&quot;.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Topol also surprised the producers with his familiarity with the staging, since he had already acted in the Israeli production, and was hired.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=87}} He spent six months in London learning his part phonetically with vocal coach [[Cicely Berry]].{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=87}} [[Jerome Robbins]], director and choreographer of the 1964 Broadway show who came over to direct the London production, &quot;re-directed&quot; the character of Tevye for Topol and helped the actor deliver a less caricatured performance.{{sfn|Lawrence|2001|p=248}}{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=88}} Topol's performance received positive reviews.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=88}}

A few months after the opening, Topol was called up for reserve duty in the [[Six-Day War]] and returned to Israel. He was assigned to an army entertainment troupe on the [[Golan Heights]].{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=88}} Afterward he returned to the London production, appearing in a total of 430 performances.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=89}}

It was during the London run that he began being known by his last name only, as the English producers were unable to pronounce the [[voiceless uvular fricative]] consonant [[Heth#Hebrew Ḥet|Ḥet]] at the beginning of his first name, Chaim, instead calling him &quot;Shame&quot;.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

}}
In casting the 1971 [[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|film version]] of ''Fiddler on the Roof'', director [[Norman Jewison]] and his production team sought an actor other than [[Zero Mostel]] for the lead role. This decision was a controversial one, as Mostel had made the role famous in the long-running Broadway musical and wanted to star in the film.{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|pp=103–104}} But Jewison and his team felt Mostel would eclipse the character with his larger-than-life personality.{{sfn|Bial|2005|p=78}}{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=102}}{{sfn|Vogel|2003|p=289}} Jewison flew to London in February 1968 to see Topol perform as Tevye during his last week with the London production, and chose him over [[Danny Kaye]], [[Herschel Bernardi]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Walter Matthau]], [[Richard Burton]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], who had also expressed interest in the part.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=102}}{{sfn|Bial|2005|pp=78–79}}

Then 36 years old, Topol was made to look 20 years older and {{convert|30|lb}} heavier with makeup and costuming.{{sfn|Bonfante|1971|p=90}} As in his role as Shabati, Topol used the technique of &quot;locking his muscles&quot; to convincingly play an older character.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|pp=87–88}} He later explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a young man, I had to make sure that I didn't break the illusion for the audience. You have to tame yourself. I'm now someone who is supposed to be 50, 60 years old. I cannot jump. I cannot suddenly be young. You produce a certain sound [in your voice] that is not young.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For his performance, Topol won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture –  Musical or Comedy]],{{sfn|Franks|2004|p=283}} the [[Sant Jordi Award]] for Best Performance in a Foreign Film,&lt;ref name=greer&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Grapevine-Between-the-Negev-and-the-Galilee-396472|title=Grapevine: Between the Negev and the Galilee|first=Greer Fay|last=Cashman|date=April 7, 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1972 [[David di Donatello for Best Foreign Actor]], sharing the latter with [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bogcms.haifa.ac.il/images/stories/honor_2014/Chaim_Topol.pdf|title=University of Haifa|date=May 27, 2014|accessdate=November 24, 2017|publisher=[[University of Haifa]] Board of Governors}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for the 1971 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], losing to [[Gene Hackman]] in ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]''.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;

In 1983 Topol reprised the role of Tevye in a revival of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' in [[West End theatre]].{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=89}} In 1989, he played the role in a 30-city U.S. touring production.&lt;ref name=theater&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/theater/theater-sunrise-sunset.html|title=THEATER; Sunrise, Sunset|first=Richard F.|last=Shepard|date=November 18, 1990|accessdate=November 23, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was by then the approximate age of the character, he commented, &quot;I didn't have to spend the energy playing the age&quot;.&lt;ref name=theater/&gt; In 1990–1991, he again starred as Tevye in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of ''Fiddler'' at the [[Gershwin Theatre]].&lt;ref name=theater/&gt;{{sfn|Dietz|2016|p=33}} In 1991, he was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical]],{{sfn|Dietz|2016|p=34}} losing to [[Jonathan Pryce]] in ''[[Miss Saigon]]''. Topol again played Tevye in a 1994 London revival,{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=89}} which became a touring production. In that production, the role of one of his daughters was played by his own daughter, Adi Topol Margalith.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;{{sfn|Isenberg|2014|p=142}}

Topol reprised the role of Tevye for a 1997–1998 touring production in Israel, as well as a 1998 show at the [[Regent Theatre, Melbourne|Regent Theatre]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=list/&gt; In September 2005 he returned to Australia for a ''Fiddler on the Roof'' revival at the [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] in [[Sydney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/arts/topols-model-role/2005/08/23/1124562863587.html|title=Topol's Model Role|first=Monica|last=Nye|date=August 24, 2005|accessdate=November 26, 2017|work=[[The Age]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an April 2006 production at the [[Lyric Theatre, Brisbane|Lyric Theatre]] in [[Brisbane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/local/reviews/2006/04/07/1611265.htm|title=Fiddler on the Roof|first= Nigel |last=Munro-Wallis|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=November 26, 2017|work=[[ABC Radio Brisbane]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 2006 production at [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne|Her Majesty's Theatre]] in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=list&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/400539|title=Chaim Topol|publisher=AusStage|year=2017|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, he starred in a production in the [[Auckland]] [[Civic Theatre (Auckland)|Civic Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0705/S00206/topol-auckland-has-in-its-midst-a-champion.htm|title= Topol – Auckland Has In Its Midst A Champion|first=Selwyn|last=Manning|date=May 10, 2007|accessdate=November 26, 2017|work=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2009, Topol began a farewell tour of ''Fiddler on the Roof'' as Tevye, opening in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. He was forced to withdraw from the tour in [[Boston]] owing to a shoulder injury, and was replaced by [[Theodore Bikel]] and [[Harvey Fierstein]], both of whom had portrayed Tevye on Broadway.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Topol estimated that he performed the role more than 3,500 times.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=toi/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap/&gt;

==Other stage and film roles==
In 1976, Topol played the lead role of the baker, Amiable, in the new musical ''[[The Baker's Wife]]'', but was fired after eight months by producer [[David Merrick]]. In her autobiography, [[Patti LuPone]], his co-star in the production, claimed that Topol had behaved unprofessionally on stage and had a strained relationship with her off-stage.{{sfn|LuPone|2010|pp=84–86}} The show's composer, [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], claimed that Topol's behavior greatly disturbed the cast and directors and resulted in the production not reaching Broadway as planned.{{sfn|De Giere|2008|p=121ff}} In 1988, Topol starred in the title role in ''Ziegfeld'' at the [[London Palladium]].{{sfn|Hartnoll|Found|1996}} He returned to the London stage in 2008 in the role of Honoré, from [[Maurice Chevalier]]'s 1958 film ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;
