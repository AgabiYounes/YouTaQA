'''John Craig Venter''' (born October 14, 1946) is an American [[biotechnology|biotechnologist]] and businessman. He is known for leading the first draft sequence of the [[human genome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title=The Blueprint Of Life |first=Jamie |last=Shreeve |accessdate=December 6, 2007 |date=October 31, 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130184339/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |archivedate=November 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lemonick |first1=Michael |title=J.

==Early life and education==
Venter was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], the son of Elizabeth and John Venter.&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=John Craig Venter (1946-)|url=http://www.dnaftb.org/39/bio.html|website=DNA from the beginning|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoded&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = J.

&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoded&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1–20}} According to his biography, ''A Life Decoded'', he was said to never be a terribly engaged student, having Cs and Ds on his eighth-grade report cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoded&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1–20}} He graduated from [[Mills High School]] in [[Millbrae, California|Millbrae]], [[California]].

Although he opposed the [[Vietnam War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = J. Craig Venter| title = A Life Decoded| chapter-url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16004438| date = 2007| publisher = Viking| isbn = 978-0-670-06358-1| oclc = 165048736| chapter = Introduction| quote = For many years I have been trying to make sense and meaning out of the lives I saw destroyed or maimed due to the government policies that involved us in the war in Vietnam.| url = https://archive.org/details/lifedecodedmygen00vent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter was drafted and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] where he worked in the intensive-care ward of a field hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Breakthrough Awards 2010: Pioneering New Life | journal = Popular Mechanics | date = November 2010 | first = Logan | last = Ward | volume = 187 | issue = 11 | pages = 62–5| type = Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Vietnam, he attempted suicide by swimming out to sea, but changed his mind more than a mile out.&lt;ref name=&quot;God of Small Things&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Atlantic Magazine |date=January–February 2007

Being confronted with severely injured and dying marines on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine,&lt;ref&gt;'Artificial life' breakthrough announced by scientists, BBC, 21 May 2010. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science_and_environment/10138849.stm&lt;/ref&gt; although he later switched to [[biomedical research]].

Venter began his college education at a [[community college]], [[College of San Mateo]] in [[California]], and later transferred to the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he studied under biochemist [[Nathan O. Kaplan]]. He received a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[biochemistry]] in 1972 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physiology]] and [[pharmacology]] in 1975 from UCSD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taubes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct97/sw_sep-oct97_page3.htm |title=Craig Venter Takes Aim at the Big Questions |journal=[[ScienceWatch]] |date=September–October 1997 |volume=8 |issue=5 |accessdate=June 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018030726/http://archive.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct97/sw_sep-oct97_page3.htm |archivedate=October 18, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;abfamb&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/science/the-god-of-small-things/2007/01/25/1169594430068.html?page=fullpage |title=The god of small things |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=January 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After working as an [[associate professor]], and later as full professor, at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], he joined the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 1984.

===EST controversy===
While an employee of the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]], Venter learned how to identify [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] and began to learn more about those expressed in the human brain. The short [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] sequence fragments he was interested in are called [[expressed sequence tag]]s, or ESTs.  The [[NIH Office of Technology Transfer]] and Venter decided to take the ESTs discovered by others in an attempt to [[Biological patents in the United States|patent the genes]] identified based on studies of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] expression in the human brain.  When Venter disclosed this strategy during a Congressional hearing, a firestorm of controversy erupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Roberts | first = Leslie | date = October 11, 1991 | title = Genome patent fight erupts: an NIH plan to patent thousands of random DNA sequences will discourage industrial investment and undercut the Genome Project itself, the plan's critics charge | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 254 | issue = 5029 | pages = 184–186 | doi = 10.1126/science.1925568| pmid = 1925568 |bibcode = 1991Sci...254..184R | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4a010c4ac448e7775250210416c29aa9a401ef75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIH later stopped the effort and abandoned the patent applications it had filed, following public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | date = 2006 | journal = [[Harvard Law Review]] | volume = 119 | title = Patent Law—Utility—Federal Circuit holds that expressed sequence tags lack substantial and specific utility unless underlying gene function is identified.—''In re Fisher'', 421 F.3d 1365 (Fed.

===Human Genome Project===
{{main|Human Genome Project}}
Venter was passionate about the power of genomics to radically transform healthcare. Venter believed that [[shotgun sequencing]] was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weber | first1 = James L.  | last2 = Myers | first2 = Eugene W.  | date = 1997 | journal = [[Genome Research]] | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Human Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequencing | pages = 401–409 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.401  | pmid=9149936
| citeseerx = 10.1.1.117.8090}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method was rejected by the Human Genome Project however, since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans, that it would be logistically more difficult, and that it would cost significantly more.&lt;ref&gt;Gannett, Lisa, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/human-genome/ The Human Genome Project Entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]  (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Green1997&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Green | first =  Philip | date = 1997 | journal = Genome Research | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | title = Against a Whole-Genome Shotgun | pages = 410–417 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7.5.410 | pmid = 9149937  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venter viewed the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome project as an opportunity to continue his interest in patenting genes, so he sought funding from the private sector to birth [[Celera Genomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Victor K. McElheny| title = Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project| date = 2010| publisher = Basic Books (AZ)| isbn = 978-0-465-04333-0| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/drawingmapoflife0000mcel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company planned to profit from their work by creating genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. Venter's effort won him renown as he and his team at [[Celera Corporation]] shared credit for sequencing the first draft human genome with the publicly funded [[Human Genome Project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dna switch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Singer |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/19328/?a=f |title=Craig Venter's Genome |newspaper=[[MIT Technology Review]] |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014| quote=The genome we published at Celera was a composite of five people. ... After leaving Celera in 2002, Venter announced that much of the genome that had been sequenced there was his own.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Venter and [[Francis Collins (geneticist)|Francis Collins]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blueprint&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=Shreeve |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |title=The Blueprint of Life |newspaper=[[U.S. News and World Report]] |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502000233/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/051031/31genome.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venter and Collins thus shared an award for &quot;Biography of the Year&quot; from [[A&amp;E Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;montgomery&quot;&gt;&quot;{{cite press release |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mc/news/press/00-463.html |title=Time Magazine Dubs Montgomery County &quot;DNA Alley&quot; |publisher=[[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County, Maryland Government]] |date=December 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013151412/http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/mc/news/press/00-463.html |archivedate=October 13, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 February 2001, the Human Genome Project consortium published the first Human Genome in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], and was followed, one day later, by a Celera publication in Science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venter2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Venter | first1 = J.

Venter was fired by Celera in early 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Antonio |last=Regalo |title=Maverick biologist at work on next goal: creating life |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |date=July 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his biography, Venter was fired due to a conflict with the main investor, Tony White, specifically barring him from attending the White House ceremony celebrating the achievement of sequencing the human genome.

===Global Ocean Sampling Expedition===
The [[Global Ocean Sampling Expedition]] (GOS) is an [[ocean exploration]] [[genome project]] with the goal of assessing the [[genetic diversity]] in [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[microbial communities]] and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003, Venter announced the full Expedition on 4 March 2004. The project, which used Venter's personal yacht, ''Sorcerer II'', started in Halifax, Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;for sale&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Yacht for Sale: Suited for Sailing, Surfing, and Seaborne Metagenomics |work=GenomeWeb.com |publisher=GenomeWeb News|author=Larkman, Kirell |date=September 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic Genomics===
[[Image:J. Craig Vernter Institute Rockville Maryland.jpg|right|thumb|J.&amp;nbsp;Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, Maryland, location]]
In June 2005, Venter co-founded [[Synthetic Genomics]], a firm dedicated to using modified [[microorganisms]] to produce [[clean fuels]] and biochemicals. In July 2009, [[ExxonMobil]] announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;exxon&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/07/14/14greenwire-exxon-sinks-600m-into-algae-based-biofuels-in-33562.html |title=Exxon Sinks $600M Into Algae-Based Biofuels in Major Strategy Shift|website=NYTimes.com|date=July 14, 2009 | first=Katie | last=Howell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2016 Venter reported the creation of Syn 3.0, a synthetic genome  having the fewest genes of any freely living organism (473 genes).  Their aim was to strip away all nonessential genes, leaving only the minimal set necessary to support life.
This stripped-down, fast reproducing cell is expected to be a valuable tool for researchers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthetic microbe has fewest genes, but many mysteries|first=Robert F.|last=Service|date=25 March 2016|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6280|pages=1380–1381|doi=10.1126/science.351.6280.1380|pmid=27013708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Venter retired as chairman of the board, saying he wanted to focus on his work at the J. Craig Venter Institute. He will remain as a scientific advisor to the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sdbj.com/news/2018/aug/14/venter-retires-chairman-synthetic-genomics-board/|title=Venter Retires as Chairman of Synthetic Genomics Board|last=Whitlock|first=Jared|date=August 14, 2018|work=San Diego Business Journal|accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===J. Craig Venter Institute===
Venter is currently the chief executive officer of the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], a nonprofit which conducts research in [[synthetic biology]]. Venter founded the organization in 2006. It has facilities in La Jolla and in [[Rockville, Maryland]] and employs over 200 people.

===Individual human genome===
On September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published one of the first genomes of an individual human—Venter's own DNA sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;PloS_VG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=10|title=The Diploid Genome Sequence of an Individual Human|author=Levy S | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050254|pages=e254|pmid=17803354|pmc=1964779|author2=Sutton G|author3=Ng PC|author4=Feuk L|author5=Halpern AL|display-authors=5|last6=Walenz|first6=Brian P.|last7=Axelrod|first7=Nelson|last8=Huang|first8=Jiaqi|last9=Kirkness|first9=Ewen F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=117800|title=Omim - Ear Wax, Wet/Dry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Ncbi.nlm.mih.gov|accessdate=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased risk of antisocial behavior, [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] and [[cardiovascular diseases]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoded&quot;/&gt; This publication was especially interesting because it attempted to separate the two [[haplotypes]] (the two copies of each chromosome), although it only accomplished this in a limited way.{{Original research inline|date=October 2009}} The genome as published only had 3 billion bases, rather than the full 6 billion that would comprise a fully diploid sequence. Another 10 years passed before the first haplotype-resolved human genomes began to appear.

The Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using [[microfluidic Sanger sequencing]], assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million [[Mutation|DNA variation]]s identified by genome analysis. These variants include [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), block [[point mutation|substitutions]], short and large [[indel]]s, and structural variations like [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[chromosome inversion|inversions]] and [[copy number variation|copy number changes]].

The browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] and [[Ensembl]] annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the [[haplotype]] blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including [[dbSNP]], Ensembl, [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] (OMIM) and [[Gene Ontology]] (GO).

Users can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef [[contig]] or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.

===Human Longevity, Inc.===
On March 4, 2014 Venter and co-founders [[Peter Diamandis]] and Robert Hariri announced the formation of [[Human Longevity]], Inc., a company focused on extending the healthy, &quot;high performance&quot; human lifespan.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Human Longevity Inc.

Human Longevity's mission is to extend healthy human lifespan by the use of high-resolution [[big data]] diagnostics from [[genomics]], [[Metabolome|metabolomics]], [[Microbiome|microbiomics]], and [[proteomics]], and the use of [[stem cell therapy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HuffP&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Robin L.  | title = The Regeneration Generation: A Conversation With Bob Hariri, Vice-Chairman and Co-Founder of Human Longevity Inc.  | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | date = 11 November 2014  | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robin-l-smith/the-regeneration-generati_b_6199076.html | accessdate = 2014-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published books==
Venter is the author of two books, the first of which was an autobiography titled ''A Life Decoded''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoded&quot;/&gt; Venter's second book was titled ''Life at the Speed of Light'' in which he announced his theory that this is the generation in which there appears to be a dovetailing of the two previously diverse fields of science represented by computer programming and the genetic programming of life by DNA sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=J.

In a 2007 interview with ''[[New Scientist]]'', when asked &quot;Assuming you can make [[Synthetic life|synthetic bacteria]], what will you do with them?&quot;, Venter replied: &quot;Over the next 20 years, synthetic genomics is going to become the standard for making anything. The chemical industry will depend on it. Hopefully, a large part of the energy industry will depend on it. We really need to find an alternative to taking carbon out of the ground, burning it, and putting it into the atmosphere. That is the single biggest contribution I could make.&quot;

He was on the 2007 [[Time 100]] most influential people in the world list made by ''Time'' magazine. In 2007 he also received the [[Golden Eurydice Award]] for contributions to [[biophilosophy]].

== Works ==
Venter has authored over 200 publications in [[scientific journal]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;HighlyCited&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Venter, J. Craig |work=[[ISIHighlyCited.com]] |url=http://hcr3.isiknowledge.com/author.cgi?&amp;link1=Browse&amp;link2=Results&amp;id=770 |url-access=subscription |date=August 19, 2003 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--LIST CRITERIA--&gt;
&lt;!-- For inclusion on this list, a publication must meet ALL of the following criteria (see exceptions below):
(1) Include Venter as a ''primary'' author. He will invariably be listed first or last. THERE IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CRITERION.
(2) Be cited in a peer-reviewed scientific journal with an [[impact factor]] of at least 10.
(3) It must have at least an average of 100 citations PER YEAR. If you are using ISIknowledge, just click on the number of times cited, then click on &quot;analyze results&quot;, and rank by publication year. To calculate this manually, take the number of citations the article has (try using ISIknowledge.com) and divide it by the number of years since it was published. This rule is more flexible for articles published in the 20th century, as most can reasonably be expected not to be cited often anymore.

Exceptions to criteria 3 are:
(1) his autobiography
(2) an article that is a BIG DEAL but is too recent to have been so highly cited (for example, &quot;Environmental genome shotgun sequencing of the Sargasso Sea&quot; was a huge deal, but was only cited 60 times in 2004, a very low number for a Venter article)
(3) a review, editorial, etc., that is often cited and that provides a broad overview OF HIS OWN WORKS.

The criteria may seem incredibly high, but they account for the fact that Venter's articles are hugely cited and WP is not a directory.
--&gt;
&lt;!--NOTE: the use of the ellipsis is prescribed by the [[APA]] when a work has more than 7 authors and a later one needs mentioning. For the purposes of this section (and with a modification so that it matches the output of citation templates), the first 7 authors are listed, followed by the spaced ellipsis, followed by the author (Venter), and, if necessary, followed by ''et al''.--&gt;
