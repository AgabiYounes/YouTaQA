'''Commodore International''' (other names include '''Commodore International Limited''', or just simply '''Commodore''') was an American [[home computer]] and electronics manufacturer founded by [[Jack Tramiel]]. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the [[home computer|home]]–[[personal computer]] industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed the world's best-selling desktop computer, the [[Commodore 64]] (1982),&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/05/09/commodore.64.reborn/|title=The Commodore 64, that '80s computer icon, lives again|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released its [[Amiga]] computer [[Product lining|line]] in July 1985. With quarterly sales ending 1983 of $49 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|49|1983}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}), Commodore was one of the world's largest [[personal computer]] manufacturers.{{Inflation/fn|US-GDP}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/15/business/commodore-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 15, 1984|title=COMMODORE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company that would become Commodore Business Machines, Inc. was founded in 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=262677 |title=Commodore International B.V.: Private Company Information |publisher=Investing.businessweek.com |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418020556/http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=262677 |archivedate=April 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Toronto]] as the Commodore Portable Typewriter Company by [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] immigrant and [[Auschwitz]] survivor [[Jack Tramiel]]. For a few years he had been living in New York, driving a taxicab, and running a small business repairing typewriters, when he managed to sign a deal with a [[Czechoslovakia]]n company to manufacture their designs in Canada. He moved to Toronto to start production. By the late 1950s a wave of Japanese machines forced most North American typewriter companies to cease business, but Tramiel instead turned to [[adding machine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/9/2936643/commodore-founder-jack-tramiel-dies|title=Commodore founder Jack Tramiel dies |work= The verge |date=April 9, 2012|access-date= December 8, 2017 |last=Sottek |first=T.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the company was formally incorporated as Commodore Business Machines, Inc. (CBM) in Canada. In 1962 Commodore went public on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), under the name of Commodore International Limited. In the late 1960s, history repeated itself when Japanese firms started producing and exporting adding machines. The company's main investor and chairman, [[Irving Gould]], suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to understand how to compete. Instead, Tramiel returned with the new idea to produce electronic [[calculator]]s, which were just coming on the market.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Commodore soon had a profitable calculator line and was one of the more popular brands in the early 1970s, producing both consumer as well as scientific/programmable calculators. However, in 1975, [[Texas Instruments]], the main supplier of calculator parts, entered the market directly and put out a line of machines priced at less than Commodore's cost for the parts. Commodore obtained an infusion of cash from Gould, which Tramiel used beginning in 1976 to purchase several second-source chip suppliers, including [[MOS Technology|MOS Technology, Inc.]], in order to assure his supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Scientist Sep 1976&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Calculator maker integrates downwards |magazine=New Scientist |volume=71 |issue=1017 |page=541 |date=September 9, 1976 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUAV0VcszIQC&amp;pg=PA541 |issn=0262-4079 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318175222/http://books.google.com/books?id=xUAV0VcszIQC&amp;pg=PA541 |archivedate=March 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed to buy MOS, which was having troubles of its own, only on the condition that its chip designer Chuck Peddle join Commodore directly as head of engineering.

Through the 1970s Commodore also produced numerous peripherals and consumer electronic products such as the [[Peter_R._Jennings#ChessMate|Chessmate]], a chess computer based around a MOS 6504 chip, released in 1978.

In December 2007, when Tramiel was visiting the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]], for the 25th anniversary of the Commodore 64, he was asked why he called his company Commodore. He said: &quot;I wanted to call my company General, but there's so many Generals in the U.S.: [[General Electric]], [[General Motors]]. Then I went to Admiral, but [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|that was taken]]. So I wind up in Berlin, Germany, with my wife, and we were in a cab, and the cab made a short stop, and in front of us was an [[Opel Commodore]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Software Development Times (January 1, 2008), Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Tramiel gave this account in many interviews, but Opel's Commodore didn't debut until 1967, years after the company had been named.&lt;ref&gt;Kretzinger, Boris: Commodore - Aufstieg und Fall eines Computerriesen, Morschen 2005, p. 14, Fn 18. {{ISBN|3-938199-04-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PET2001.jpg|right|thumb|Commodore PET 2001 (1977)]]
Once [[Chuck Peddle]] had taken over engineering at Commodore, he convinced Jack Tramiel that calculators were already a dead end, and that they should turn their attention to [[home computer]]s. Peddle packaged his [[single-board computer]] design in a metal case, initially with a keyboard using calculator keys, later with a full-travel [[QWERTY]] keyboard, [[monochrome]] [[computer monitor|monitor]], and [[Datassette|tape recorder]] for program and data storage, to produce the [[Commodore PET]] (Personal Electronic Transactor). From PET's 1977 debut, Commodore would be a computer company.

Commodore had been reorganized the year before into Commodore International, Ltd., moving its financial headquarters to the [[Bahamas]] and its operational headquarters to [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], near the MOS Technology site. The operational headquarters, where research and development of new products occurred, retained the name Commodore Business Machines, Inc. In 1980 Commodore launched production for the European market in [[Braunschweig]] ([[Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerwoche.de/a/commodore-bald-aus-braunschweig,1189763 |title=Computer aus Zonenrandgebiet:: Commodore bald aus Braunschweig |publisher=computerwoche.de |accessdate=2015-07-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502182823/http://www.computerwoche.de/a/commodore-bald-aus-braunschweig%2C1189763 |archivedate=May 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, Commodore was one of the three largest microcomputer companies, and the largest in the [[Common Market]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hogan19810831&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=From Zero to a Billion in Five Years |work=InfoWorld |date=August 31, 1981 |accessdate=February 15, 2015 |author=Hogan, Thom |pages=6–7 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301153806/https://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA6 |archivedate=March 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had lost its early domestic-market sales leadership, however; by mid-1981 its US market share was less than 5%, and US computer magazines rarely discussed Commodore products.&lt;ref name=&quot;hogan19810914state&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mj0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=State of Microcomputing / Some Horses Running Neck and Neck |last=Hogan |first=Thom |date=1981-09-14 |access-date=2019-04-08 |pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BYTE'' stated of the business computer market that &quot;the lack of a marketing strategy by Commodore, as well as its past nonchalant attitude toward the encouragement and development of good software, has hurt its credibility, especially in comparison to the other systems on the market&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dickerman198208&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-08/1982_08_BYTE_07-08_Logo#page/n365/mode/2up |title=The Commodore 8032 Business System |work=BYTE |date=August 1982 |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Dickerman, Harold |page=366 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315220147/http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-08/1982_08_BYTE_07-08_Logo |archivedate=March 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of ''Programming the PET/CBM'' (1982) stated in its introduction that &quot;CBM's product manuals are widely recognized to be unhelpful; this is one of the reasons for the existence of this book&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;west1982&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Programming the PET/CBM |last=West |first=Raeto Collin |publisher=Compute!

Commodore reemphasized the US market with the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]].{{r|hogan19810914state}} The PET computer line was used primarily in schools, where its tough all-metal construction and ability to share printers and disk drives on a simple [[local area network]] were advantages, but PETs did not compete well in the home setting where graphics and sound were important. This was addressed with the VIC-20 in 1981, which was introduced at a cost of US$299 and sold in retail stores. Commodore bought aggressive advertisements featuring [[William Shatner]] asking consumers &quot;Why buy just a video game?&quot; The strategy worked and the VIC-20 became the first computer to ship more than one million units. A total of 2.5 million units were sold over the machine's lifetime&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, Brian (2006). ''On the Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore'', Variant Press.

In 1982, Commodore introduced the [[Commodore 64]] as the successor to the VIC-20. Thanks to a well-designed set of [[integrated circuit|chips]] designed by MOS Technology, the Commodore 64, (also referred to as C64), possessed remarkable sound and graphics for its time and is often credited with starting the computer [[demo scene]]. Its US$595 price was high compared with that of the VIC-20, but it was still much less expensive than any other 64K computer on the market. Early C64 advertisements boasted, &quot;You can't buy a better computer at twice the price.&quot; Australian adverts in the mid-1980s used a tune speaking the words &quot;Are you keeping up with the Commodore? Because the Commodore is keeping up with you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Are_You_Keeping_Up_With_Your_Commodore_1983_Commodore_AU |title=Computer Commercial: Are You Keeping Up With Your Commodore (1983)(Commodore)(AU).mp4 |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=November 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322033741/https://archive.org/details/Are_You_Keeping_Up_With_Your_Commodore_1983_Commodore_AU |archivedate=March 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Tramiel decided to focus on market share and cut the price of the VIC-20 and C64 dramatically, starting what would be called the &quot;[[History of personal computers#Commodore/Atari price war and crash|home computer war]]&quot;. TI responded by cutting prices on its [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]], which had been introduced in 1981. Soon there was an all-out price war involving Commodore, TI, [[Atari]], and practically every vendor other than [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. Commodore began selling the VIC-20 and C64 through mass-market retailers such as [[Kmart|K-Mart]], in addition to traditional computer stores. By the end of this conflict, Commodore had shipped somewhere around 22 million C64s, making the C64 the best selling computer of all time.

At the June 1983 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], Commodore lowered the retail price of the 64 to $300, and stores sold it for as little as $199. At one point the company was selling as many computers as the rest of the industry combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell19830906&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gn0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tYoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5584%2C3561802 | title=A summer-CES report | work=Boston Phoenix | date=September 6, 1983 | accessdate=January 10, 2015 | author=Mitchell, Peter W. |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its prices for the VIC-20 and 64 were $50 lower than Atari's prices for the 600XL and 800XL.&lt;ref name=&quot;mace19840227&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=Can Atari Bounce Back? |work=InfoWorld |date=February 27, 1984 |accessdate=January 18, 2015 |author=Mace, Scott |page=100 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304173218/https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA100 |archivedate=March 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commodore's strategy was to, according to a spokesman, devote 50% of its efforts to the under-$500 market, 30% on the $500–1000 market, and 20% on the over-$1000 market. Its vertical integration and Tramiel's focus on cost control helped Commodore do well during the price war, with $1 billion in 1983 sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;leemon198405&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_05_1984-05_Ion_International_US#page/n43/mode/2up |title=The Future of Commodore? |work=Ahoy! |date=May 1984 |accessdate=June 27, 2014 |author=Leeman, Sheldon |page=44 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316115719/https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_05_1984-05_Ion_International_US |archivedate=March 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the company and Tramiel's focus on cost cutting over product testing caused some hardware defects in the initial 64, some resolved in later iterations&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee85&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wallich |first2=Paul |date=March 1985 |title=Design case history: the Commodore 64 |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/ns/pdfs/commodore64_mar1985.pdf |journal=IEEE Spectrum |pages=48–58 |issn=0018-9235 |last1=Perry |first1=Tekla S. |accessdate=2011-11-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513181613/http://spectrum.ieee.org/ns/pdfs/commodore64_mar1985.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by early 1984 [[Synapse Software]]—the largest provider of third-party Atari 8-bit software—received 65% of sales from the Commodore market,{{r|mace19840227}} and Commodore sold almost three times as many computers as Atari that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;kleinfield19841222&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/22/business/trading-up-in-computer-gifts.html?pagewanted=all |title=Trading Up in Computer Gifts |work=The New York Times |date=December 22, 1984 |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |author=Kleinfield, N.

Although by early 1984 ''[[Creative Computing]]'' compared Commodore to &quot;a well-armed battleship [which] rules the micro waves&quot; and threatened to destroy rivals like Atari and [[Coleco]],&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson198403&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1984-03/Creative_Computing_v10_n03_1984_Mar#page/n57/mode/2up |title=Commodore |work=Creative Computing |date=March 1984 |accessdate=February 6, 2015 |author=Anderson, John J. |page=56 |authorlink=John J.

An internal power struggle resulted; in January 1984, Tramiel resigned due to intense disagreement with the chairman of the board, [[Irving Gould]]. Gould replaced Tramiel with Marshall F. Smith, a steel executive who had no experience with computers or consumer marketing.&lt;ref name=&quot;maher20130728&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filfre.net/2013/07/a-computer-for-every-home/ |title=A Computer for Every Home? |work=The Digital Antiquarian |date=July 28, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2014 |author=Maher, Jimmy |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711193125/http://www.filfre.net/2013/07/a-computer-for-every-home/ |archivedate=July 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DAK54&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Marty | last = Herzog | date = January 1988 | title = Neil Harris | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 41–51 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1985). {{YouTube|id=NImJFV3wH88#t=9m25s|title=Jack Tramiel Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tramiel founded a new company, Tramel Technology (spelled differently so people would pronounce it correctly), and hired away a number of Commodore engineers to begin work on a next-generation computer design.

Now it was left to the remaining Commodore management to salvage the company's fortunes and plan for the future. It did so by buying a small startup company called [[Amiga Corporation]] in February 1984, for $25 million ($12.8 million in cash and 550,000 in common shares) which became a subsidiary of Commodore, called Commodore-Amiga, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;David Needle. &quot;Special Report&quot; p.90 Personal Computing, (August 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Commodore brought this new [[32-bit]] computer design (initially codenamed &quot;Lorraine&quot;) from 1979, and had been called High-Toro from 1980 to 1981 then later dubbed the Amiga, under Amiga Inc. in early 1982. There were three unsuccessful attempts to release the Amiga by [[Jay Miner]] and company. These were: 1982, 1983 and one more after Commodore bought Amiga in 1984, after which it was released only to the local public. Then in 1985 Commodore re-released it to the world. Cost was $1000-$1300.

But Tramiel had beaten Commodore to the punch. His design was 95% completed by June. In July 1984 he bought the consumer side of Atari Inc. from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]] which allowed him to strike back and release the [[Atari ST]] earlier in 1985 for about $800. The Atari ST was technology-wise almost out, however the Amiga was out sooner.

During development in 1981, Amiga had exhausted venture capital and was desperate for more financing. Jay Miner and company had approached former employer [[Atari]], and the Warner-owned Atari had paid Amiga to continue development work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOP SECRET: Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723091215/http://www.atarimuseum.com/articles/mickey.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-23 |date=November 1981 |work=Atari Historical Society |accessdate=2006-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return Atari was to get one-year exclusive use of the design as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete Amiga computer. The Atari Museum has acquired the Atari-Amiga contract and Atari engineering logs revealing that the Atari Amiga was originally designated as the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named &quot;Mickey&quot;, and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed &quot;Minnie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html |title=&quot;Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement&quot; and &quot;Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor&quot; |publisher=Archives.atarimuseum.com |accessdate=2009-08-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415111352/http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html |archivedate=April 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Tramiel discovered that [[Warner Communications]] wanted to sell Atari, which was rumored to be losing about $10,000 a day. Interested in Atari's overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer, he approached Atari and entered negotiations. After several on-again/off-again talks with Atari in May and June 1984, Tramiel had secured his funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July.

As more execs and researchers left Commodore after the announcement to join up with Tramiel's new company [[Atari Corp.]], Commodore followed by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets in late July. This was intended, in effect, to bar Tramiel from releasing his new computer.

One of Tramiel's first acts after forming Atari Corp. was to fire most of Atari's remaining staff, and to cancel almost all ongoing projects, in order to review their continued viability. In late July/early August, Tramiel representatives discovered the original Amiga contract from the previous fall. Seeing a chance to gain some leverage, Tramiel immediately used the contract to counter-sue Commodore through its new subsidiary, Amiga, on August 13.

The Amiga crew, still suffering serious financial problems, had sought more monetary support from investors that entire spring. At around the same time that Tramiel was in negotiations with Atari, Amiga entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions ultimately led to Commodore's intentions to purchase Amiga outright, which would (from Commodore's viewpoint) cancel any outstanding contracts - including Atari Inc.'s. This &quot;interpretation&quot; is what Tramiel used to counter-sue, and sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing any resembling technology. This was an attempt to render Commodore's new acquisition (and the source for its next generation of computers) useless. The resulting court case lasted for several years, with both companies releasing their respective products. In the end, the Amiga computer outlasted the Atari.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay Miner&quot;&gt;Jay Miner&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the life of the ST and Amiga platforms, a ferocious Atari-Commodore rivalry raged. While this rivalry was in many ways a holdover from the days when the Commodore 64 had first challenged the Atari 800 (among others) in a series of scathing television commercials, the events leading to the launch of the ST and Amiga only served to further alienate fans of each computer, who fought vitriolic [[Flame war#Holy wars|holy wars]] on the question of which platform was superior. This was reflected in sales numbers for the two platforms until the release of the [[Amiga 500]] in 1987, which led the Amiga sales to exceed the ST by about 1.5 to 1,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} despite reaching the market later. However, the battle was in vain, as neither platform captured a significant share of the world computer market and only the Apple Macintosh would survive the industry-wide shift to [[Wintel|Microsoft Windows running on PC clones]].

===Post-Commodore International Ltd.===
Following its liquidation, Commodore's former assets went their separate ways, with none of the descendant companies repeating Commodore's early success. Both Commodore and Amiga product lines were produced in the 21st century, but separately with [[Amiga, Inc.]] being its own company and Commodore computers being produced by [[Commodore USA]], an unrelated Florida-based company that had purchased the brand name. Other companies develop operating systems and manufacture computers for both Commodore and Amiga brands as well as software.

{{Rquote|left|&quot;Commodore's high point was the Amiga 1000 (1985). The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody--including Commodore's marketing department--could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.&lt;br /&gt;--''[[Byte Magazine]],'' August 1994}}

Commodore UK was the only subsidiary to survive the bankruptcy and even placed a bid to buy out the rest of the operation, or at least the former parent company. For a time it was considered the front runner in the bid, and numerous reports surfaced during the 1994–1995 time frame that Commodore UK had made the purchase. Commodore UK stayed in business by selling old inventory and making computer speakers and some other types of computer peripherals. However, Commodore UK withdrew its bid at the start of the auction process after several larger companies, including [[Gateway Computers]] and [[Dell Inc.]], became interested, primarily for Commodore's 47 patents relating to the Amiga. Ultimately, the successful bidder was [[Germany|German]] PC conglomerate [[Escom (computer company)|Escom]], and Commodore UK went into liquidation on August 30, 1995.

In 1995 Escom paid US$14 million for the assets of Commodore International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amigareport.com/ar307/news1.html |title=Commodore Auction Report |accessdate=November 29, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223240/http://www.amigareport.com/ar307/news1.html |archivedate=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It separated the Commodore and Amiga operations into separate divisions and quickly started using the Commodore brand name on a line of PCs sold in [[Europe]]. However, it soon started losing money due to over-expansion, went bankrupt on July 15, 1996, and was liquidated.

In September 1997, the Commodore brand name was acquired by Dutch computer maker [[Tulip Computers NV]].

In July 2004, Tulip announced a new series of products using the Commodore name: fPET, a flash memory-based USB Flash drive; mPET, a flash-based MP3 Player and digital recorder; eVIC, a 20 GB music player. Also, it licensed the Commodore trademark and &quot;chicken lips&quot; logo to the producers of the [[C64 Direct-to-TV|C64 DTV]].

In late 2004, Tulip sold the Commodore trademarks to [[Yeahronimo Media Ventures]] for €22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.com/2004/12/29/tulip_sells_commodore/|title=Tulip offloads Commodore brand|publisher=|accessdate=November 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed in March 2005 after months of negotiations. Yeahronimo Media Ventures soon renamed itself to ''Commodore International Corporation'' and started an operation intended to relaunch the Commodore brand. The company launched its ''Gravel'' line of products: personal multimedia players equipped with Wi-Fi, with the hope the Commodore brand would help them take off. The ''Gravel'' was never a success and was discontinued. On June 24, 2009, CIC renamed itself to Reunite Investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/24/idUS193371+24-Jun-2009+MW20090624 |work=Reuters |title=Commodore International Corporation Changed Its Company Name to Reunite Investments, Inc. |date=June 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142341/http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/06/24/idUS193371%2B24-Jun-2009%2BMW20090624 |archivedate=September 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CIC's founder, Ben van Wijhe, bought a Hong Kong-based company called Asiarim,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415813/000145786009000002/0001457860-09-000002-index.htm |title=EDGAR Filing Documents for 0001457860-09-000002 |publisher=Sec.gov |accessdate=November 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015130640/http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415813/000145786009000002/0001457860-09-000002-index.htm |archivedate=October 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is now owned by C= Holdings (formerly Commodore International B.V.):&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Court&quot;&gt;{{cite court

The Commodore Semiconductor Group (formerly MOS Technology, Inc.) was bought by its former management and in 1995, resumed operations under the name GMT Microelectronics, utilizing a troubled facility in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]] that Commodore had closed in 1992. By 1999 it had $21 million in revenues and 183 employees. However, in 2001 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] shut the plant down. GMT ceased operations and was liquidated.

Ownership of the remaining assets of Commodore International, including the copyrights and patents, and the Amiga trademarks, passed from Escom to U.S. PC clone maker [[Gateway Computers|Gateway 2000]] in 1997, who retained the patents and sold the copyrights and trademarks, together with a license to use the patents, to Amiga, Inc., a Washington company founded, among others, by former Gateway subcontractors Bill McEwen and Fleecy Moss in 2000. On March 15, 2004, Amiga, Inc. announced that on April 23, 2003 it had transferred its rights over past and future versions of the Amiga OS (but not yet over other intellectual property) to Itec, LLC, later acquired by KMOS, Inc., a Delaware company. Shortly afterwards, on the basis of some loans and security agreements between Amiga, Inc. and Itec, LLC, the remaining intellectual property assets were also transferred from Amiga, Inc. to KMOS, Inc. On March 16, 2005, KMOS, Inc. announced that it had completed all registrations with the State of Delaware to change its corporate name to Amiga, Inc. The Commodore/Amiga copyrights were later sold to Cloanto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloanto confirms transfers of Commodore/Amiga copyrights |publisher=amiga-news.de |url=http://amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2015-02-00027-EN.html |accessdate=2015-02-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221054319/http://amiga-news.de/en/news/AN-2015-02-00027-EN.html |archivedate=February 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AmigaOS]] (as well as spin-offs [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]]) is still maintained and updated. Several companies produce related hardware and software today.

Commodore's former US headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania, is currently the headquarters to [[QVC]].

In February 2017 an exhibition room for about 200 Commodore products was opened in Braunschweig, commemorating the European production site of Commodore which had up to 2000 employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;bz&quot;&gt;Braunschweiger Zeitung: ''Erinnerung an einen Konzern mit Weltruf'', February 17, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Commodore's own software had a poor reputation; ''InfoWorld'' in 1984, for example, stated that &quot;so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mace19840409&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Atarisoft vs. Commodore |work=InfoWorld |date=April 9, 1984 |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |author=Mace, Scott |page=50 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318135131/http://books.google.com/books?id=jC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA50 |archivedate=March 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third parties developed the vast majority of software for Commodore computers.
