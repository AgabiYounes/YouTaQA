The '''history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991''' spans the period from [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s [[Death and state funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|death and funeral]] until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. Due to the years of [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet military]] buildup at the expense of domestic development, economic growth stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the United States against the [[Soviet Union]]'s forces in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Baltic republics and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;WorldBook online&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|Soviet leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], created an [[Glasnost|atmosphere of open criticism]] of the [[Communist state|communist regime]]. The dramatic drop of the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil in 1985 and 1986]] profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.&lt;ref name='AEI-Gaidar-Grain and Oil'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Tikhonov]], the [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]], was succeeded by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and [[Vasili Kuznetsov (politician)|Vasili Kuznetsov]], the acting [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], was succeeded by [[Andrei Gromyko]], the former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

Several [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]] began resisting central control, and increasing [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] led to a weakening of the central government. The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when [[Boris Yeltsin]] seized power in the aftermath of a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|failed coup]] that had attempted to topple [[Perestroika|reform-minded]] Gorbachev.

==Leadership transition==
By 1982, the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the U.S. throughout the 1970s, but the system was so firmly entrenched that any real change seemed impossible. A huge rate of defense spending consumed large parts of the economy. The transition period that separated the Brezhnev and Gorbachev eras resembled the former much more than the latter, although hints of reform emerged as early as 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire'' (1998) pp 319, 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andropov interregnum===
Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982. Two days passed between his death and the announcement of the election of [[Yuri Andropov]] as the new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]], suggesting to many outsiders that a power struggle had occurred in the Kremlin. Andropov maneuvered his way into power both through his KGB connections and by gaining the support of the military by promising not to cut defense spending. For comparison, some of his rivals such as Konstantin Chernenko were skeptical of a continued high military budget. Aged 69, he was the oldest person ever appointed as General Secretary and 11 years older than Brezhnev when he acquired that post. In June 1983, he assumed the post of chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, thus becoming the ceremonial [[head of state]]. It had taken Brezhnev 13 years to acquire this post. Andropov began a thorough house-cleaning throughout the party and state bureaucracy, a decision made easy by the fact that the Central Committee had an average age of 69. He replaced more than one-fifth of the Soviet ministers and regional party first secretaries and more than one-third of the department heads within the Central Committee apparatus. As a result, he replaced the aging leadership with younger, more vigorous administrators. But Andropov's ability to reshape the top leadership was constrained by his own age and poor health and the influence of his rival (and longtime ally of Leonid Brezhnev) [[Konstantin Chernenko]], who had previously supervised personnel matters in the Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire'' (1998) pp 329-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition of power from Brezhnev to Andropov was notably the first one in Soviet history to occur completely peacefully with no one being imprisoned, killed, or forced from office.

====Domestic policies====
Andropov's domestic policy leaned heavily towards restoring discipline and order to Soviet society. He eschewed radical political and economic reforms, promoting instead a small degree of candor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to those that had been associated with the late [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]]'s initiatives [[1965 Soviet economic reform|in the mid-1960s]]. In tandem with such economic experiments, Andropov launched an anti-corruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks. Unlike Brezhnev, who possessed several mansions and a fleet of luxury cars, he lived quite simply. While visiting Budapest in early 1983, he expressed interest in [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]'s [[Goulash Communism]] and that the sheer size of the Soviet economy made strict top-down planning impractical. Changes were needed in a hurry for 1982 had witnessed the country's worst economic performance since [[World War II]], with real [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth at almost zero percent.

====Foreign policies====

Andropov faced a series of foreign policy crise: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, Troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the &quot;Second Cold War&quot; launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the &quot;[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]&quot;. Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the Cold War, emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence T. Caldwell, and Robert Legvold, &quot;Reagan through Soviet eyes.&quot; ''Foreign Policy'' 52 (1983): 3-21 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148230 Online].&lt;/ref&gt; The main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget, and supplying billions of dollars worth of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the PLO, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies. Andropov's main goal was to avoid an open war.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire''  (1998) pp 358–360.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Downing, ''Reagan, Andropov, and a World on the Brink'' (2018) pp 34 – 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Steele|title=Soviet Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYqQYs8lnWQC&amp;pg=PA4|year=1984|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy, the [[Soviet–Afghan War|conflict in Afghanistan]] continued even though Andropov—who now felt the invasion was a mistake—half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov's rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the [[United States]]. During a much-publicized &quot;walk in the woods&quot; with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat [[Paul Nitze]] suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matlock |first=Jack F., Jr. |title=Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2005|location=New York |pages=41–46 |isbn=978-0-8129-7489-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kwizinskij|first=Julij A. |title=Vor dem Sturm: Erinnerungen eines Diplomaten |publisher=Siedler Verlag |year=1993 |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-88680-464-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 March 1983, during Andropov's reign as General Secretary, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] famously labeled the Soviet Union an &quot;[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]&quot;. The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defense would be &quot;consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty&quot;. However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that &quot;It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pravda]]'', 27 March 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1983, Andropov made an announcement that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. One of his most notable acts was in response to a letter from a 10-year-old American child from Maine named [[Samantha Smith]], inviting her to the Soviet Union. She came but Andropov's severe illness was made public when he was too ill to see her.  Meanwhile, Soviet–U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Church|first=George J.|title=Person of the Year 1983: Ronald Reagan and Yuri Andropov|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=1 January 1984 |url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1983.html|accessdate=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Massive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, [[Korean Air Flight KAL-007]], which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea. Andropov kept secret the fact that the Soviet Union held in its possession the [[Flight recorder|black box]] from KAL 007 Which proved the pilot had made a typographical error when entering data in the automatic pilot.  The Soviet system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Haslam,  &quot;The KAL shootdown (1983) and the state of Soviet air defence.&quot; ''Intelligence and National Security'' 3.4 (1988): 128-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with its low credibility explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only aimed at people who already were committed friends of the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error&lt;ref&gt;Gail Warshofsky Lapidus, &quot;KAL 007 and Chernobyl: The Soviet management of crises.&quot; Survival 29.3 (1987): 215-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

US−Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly especially after March 1983, when Reagan dubbed the Soviet Union an &quot;[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]&quot;. The official press agency TASS accused Reagan of &quot;thinking only in terms of confrontation and bellicose, lunatic anti-communism&quot;. Further Soviet outrage was directed at Reagan's stationing of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe. In [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Nicaragua and elsewhere, under the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the US began undermining Soviet-supported governments by supplying arms to anti-communist resistance movements in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;Chester Pach,  &quot;The Reagan Doctrine: Principle, Pragmatism, and Policy.&quot; ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 36.1 (2006): 75-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Reagan's decision to deploy medium-range [[Pershing II]] missiles in Western Europe met with mass protests in countries such as France and West Germany, sometimes numbering 1 million people at a time. Many Europeans became convinced that the US and not the Soviet Union was the more aggressive country, and there was fear over the prospect of a war, especially since there was a widespread conviction in Europe that the US, being separated from the Red Army by two oceans as opposed to a short land border, was insensitive to the people of Germany and other countries. Moreover, the memory of World War II was still strong and many Germans could not forget the destruction and mass rapes committed by Soviet troops in the closing days of that conflict. This attitude was helped along by the Reagan Administration's comments that a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would not necessarily result in the use of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Howard, &quot;A European perspective on the Reagan years.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'' 66.3 (1987): 478-493.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andropov's health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, and he became the first Soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that November. He died in February 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months. His most significant legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point, Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout Andropov's illness, Gorbachev's time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire'' (1998) pp 369-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chernenko interregnum===
At 71, [[Konstantin Chernenko]] was in poor health, suffering from emphysema, and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen, after lengthy discussion, to succeed Andropov. But Chernenko's short time in office did bring some significant policy changes. The personnel changes and investigations into corruption undertaken under Andropov's tutelage came to an end. Chernenko advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture. He also called for a reduction in the CPSU's micromanagement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion. However, KGB repression of Soviet dissidents also increased. In February 1983, Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Organization in protest of that group's continued complaints about the use of psychiatry to suppress dissent. This policy was underlined in June when Vladimir Danchev, a broadcaster for Radio Moscow, referred to the Soviet troops in Afghanistan as &quot;invaders&quot; while conducting English-language broadcasts. After refusing to retract this statement, he was sent to a mental institution for several months. Valery Senderov, a leader of an unofficial union of professional workers, was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp early in the year for speaking out on discrimination practiced against Jews in education and the professions.&lt;ref&gt;Volkogonov, ''Autopsy for an empire'' (1998) pp 383-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Chernenko had called for renewed ''[[détente]]'' with the West, little progress was made towards closing the rift in East−West relations during his rule. The Soviet Union boycotted the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, retaliating for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. In September 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/07/world/honecker-s-west-german-visit-divided-meaning.html?pagewanted=all Honecker's West German Visit: Divided Meaning], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 7 September 1987&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet Union also prevented a visit to West Germany by East German leader [[Erich Honecker]]. Fighting in the [[Afghan Democratic Republic]] also intensified, but in the late autumn of 1984 the United States and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985.

==Rise of Gorbachev==
In addition to the flailing economy, the prolonged war in Afghanistan, often referred to as the Soviet Union's &quot;Vietnam War&quot;, led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. Also, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added motive force to Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reforms, which eventually spiraled out of control and caused the Soviet system to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;William Zimmerman and Robert Axelrod, &quot;The 'lessons' of Vietnam and Soviet foreign policy.&quot; ''World Politics'' 34.1 (1981): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ousting the old guard ==

After years of stagnation, the &quot;new thinking&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anatoli Cherniaev, ‘Gorbachev’s Foreign Policy: The Concept’ in [[Kiron Skinner|Skinner, Kiron]] (ed.) [https://www.hoover.org/research/turning-points-ending-cold-war Turning Points in Ending the Cold War], (Hoover Institution Press: 2008), pp.&amp;nbsp;111–140 [online] [accessed 22–23 February 2012], p.&amp;nbsp;131.&lt;/ref&gt; of younger Communist apparatchik began to emerge. Following the death of terminally ill Konstantin Chernenko, the Politburo elected Mikhail Gorbachev to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in March 1985. At 54, Gorbachev was the youngest person since [[Joseph Stalin]] to become General Secretary and the country's first head of state born a Soviet citizen instead of a subject of the tsar. During his official confirmation on March 11, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko spoke of how the new Soviet leader had filled in for Chernenko as CC Secretariat, and praised his intelligence and flexible, pragmatic ideas instead of rigid adherence to party ideology. Gorbachev was aided by a lack of serious competition in the Politburo. He immediately began appointing younger men of his generation to important party posts, including [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], Secretary of Economics, Viktor Cherbrikov, KGB Chief, Foreign Minister [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] (replacing the 75-year-old Gromyko), Secretary of Defense Industries {{ill|Lev Zaikov|ru|Зайков, Лев Николаевич}}, and Secretary of Construction [[Boris Yeltsin]]. Removed from the Politburo and Secretariat was [[Grigory Romanov]], who had been Gorbachev's most significant rival for the position of General Secretary. Gromyko's removal as Foreign Minister was the most unexpected change given his decades of unflinching, faithful service compared to the unknown, inexperienced Shevardnadze.

More predictably, the 80-year-old [[Nikolai Tikhonov]], the [[List of Premiers of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union|Council of Ministers]], was succeeded by [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and [[Vasili Kuznetsov (politician)|Vasili Kuznetsov]], the acting [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]], was succeeded by [[Andrei Gromyko]], the former [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

Further down the chain, up to 40% of the first secretaries of the ''oblasts'' (provinces) were replaced with younger, better educated, and more competent men. The defense establishment was also given a thorough shakeup with the commanders of all 16 military districts replaced along with all theaters of military operation, as well as the three Soviet fleets. Not since World War II had the Soviet military had such a rapid turnover of officers. Sixty-eight-year-old Marshal [[Nikolai Ogarkov]] was fully rehabilitated after having fallen from favor in 1983–84 due to his handling of the [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|KAL 007]] shootdown and his ideas about improving Soviet strategic and tactical doctrines were made into an official part of defense policy, although some of his other ambitions such as developing the military into a smaller, tighter force based on advanced technology were not considered feasible for the time being. Many, but not all, of the younger army officers appointed during 1985 were proteges of Ogarkov.

Gorbachev got off to an excellent start during his first months in power. He projected an aura of youth and dynamism compared to his aged predecessors and made frequent walks in the streets of the major cities answering questions from ordinary citizens. He became the first leader that spoke with the [[Soviet people]] in person. When he made public speeches, he made clear that he was interested in constructive exchanges of ideas instead of merely reciting lengthy platitudes about the excellence of the Soviet system. He also spoke candidly about the slackness and run-down condition of Soviet society in recent years, blaming [[alcohol abuse]], poor workplace discipline, and other factors for these situations. Alcohol was a particular nag of Gorbachev's, especially as he himself did not drink, and he made one of his major policy aims curbing the consumption of it.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Lewin, ''The Gorbachev phenomenon: a historical interpretation'' (U of California Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
In terms of foreign policy, the most important one, relations with the United States, remained twitchy through 1985. In October, Gorbachev made his first visit to a non-communist country when he traveled to France and was warmly received. The fashion-conscious French were also captivated by his wife Raisa and political pundits widely believed that the comparatively young Soviet leader would have a PR advantage over President Reagan, who was 20 years his senior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Kramer|title=The Star Wars plan has stimulated the first real Soviet arms-control response in years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdUBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA36|date=11 November 1985|publisher=New York Magazine|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reagan and Gorbachev met for the first time in Geneva in November. The three weeks preceding the summit meeting were marked by an unprecedented Soviet media campaign against the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), taking advantage of opposition at home in the US to the program. When it finally took place, the two superpower leaders established a solid rapport that boded well for the future despite Reagan's refusal to compromise on abandonment of SDI. A joint communique by both parties stated that they were in agreement that nuclear war could not be won by either side and must never be allowed to happen. It was also agreed that Reagan and Gorbachev would carry out two more summit meetings in 1986–87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Svetlana Savranskaya|author2=Thomas S. Blanton|title=The Last Superpower Summits:  Gorbachev, Reagan, and Bush.

[[Jimmy Carter]] had decisively ended the policy of détente, by financially aiding the [[Mujahideen]] movement in neighboring [[Socialist Afghanistan]], which served as a pretext for the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]] six months later, with the aims of supporting the Afghan government, controlled by the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]]. Tensions between the superpowers increased during this time, when Carter placed trade embargoes on the Soviet Union and stated that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was &quot;the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;State of the Union Address, 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/speeches/su80jec/ | author = Carter, Jimmy | title = State of the Union Address, 1980 | publisher = Jimmy Carter Library and Museum | accessdate = 12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
East-West tensions increased during the first term of US President [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981–85), reaching levels not seen since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] as Reagan increased US military spending to 7% of the GDP.  To match the military buildup, the Soviet Union increased its own military spending to 27% of its GDP and froze production of civilian goods at 1980 levels, causing a sharp economic decline in the already failing Soviet economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamid Karimianpour|title=Nation Building, Or Democracy by Other Means|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bPugI2sAzUC&amp;pg=PA90|year=2011|publisher=Algora Publishing|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US financed the training for the [[Mujahideen]] warlords such as [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]], [[Gulbudin Hekmatyar]] and [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] eventually culminated to the fall of the Soviet satellite the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGjAsQJh7OM&amp;feature=channel|title=Brzezinski and the Afghan War Pt2|date=15 January 2010|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the CIA and MI6 and the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China financed the operation along with the Pakistan government against the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;S.

Sharpe. p. 158. {{ISBN|0765613182}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually the Soviet Union began looking for a withdrawal route and in 1988 the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]] were signed between Communist-Afghanistan and the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]]; under the terms Soviet troops were to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/Accords%20Treaties/geneva_accords_1988_pakistan_afghanistan.htm|title=Die neuesten Studien im Internet|work=Die neuesten Studien im Internet|accessdate=7 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404121059/http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/Accords%20Treaties/geneva_accords_1988_pakistan_afghanistan.htm|archive-date=4 April 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the withdrawal was complete the Pakistan ISI continued to support the [[Mujahideen]] against the Communist Government and by 1992, the government collapsed. US President Reagan also actively hindered the Soviet Union's ability to sell natural gas to Europe whilst simultaneously actively working to keep gas prices low, which kept the price of Soviet oil low and further starved the Soviet Union of foreign capital.  This &quot;long-term strategic offensive,&quot; which &quot;contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of &quot;[[containment]]&quot;, accelerated the fall of the Soviet Union by encouraging it to overextend its economic base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm |title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan |publisher=Wais.stanford.edu |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposition that special operations by the CIA in Saudi Arabia affected the prices of Soviet oil was refuted by [[Marshall Goldman]]—one of the leading experts on the economy of the Soviet Union—in his latest book. He pointed out that the Saudis decreased their production of oil in 1985 (it reached a 16-year low), whereas [[1980s oil glut|the peak of oil production]] was reached in 1980. They increased the production of oil in 1986, reduced it in 1987 with a subsequent increase in 1988, but not to the levels of 1980 when production reached its highest level. The real increase happened in 1990, by which time the Cold War was almost over. In his book he asked why, if Saudi Arabia had such an effect on Soviet oil prices, did prices not fall in 1980 when the production of oil by Saudi Arabia reached its highest level—three times as much oil as in the mid-eighties—and why did the Saudis wait till 1990 to increase their production, five years after the CIA's supposed intervention? Why didn't the Soviet Union collapse in 1980 then?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/petrostateputinp00gold |url-access=registration |quote=Marshall Goldman William Casey oil USSR. |title=Petrostate: Putin, power, and the New Russia |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/petrostateputinp00gold/page/49 49] |year=2008 |isbn=0-19-534073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time Gorbachev ushered in the process that would lead to the dismantling of the Soviet administrative [[command economy]] through his programs of  ''[[uskoreniye]]'' (speed-up of economic development) and ''perestroika'' (political and economic restructuring) announced in 1986, the Soviet economy suffered from both hidden inflation and pervasive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open black market that undermined the official economy.  Additionally, the costs of superpower status—the military, space program, subsidies to client states—were out of proportion to the Soviet economy. The new wave of industrialization based upon information technology had left the Soviet Union desperate for Western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing backwardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry William Ickes|title=Soviet Macroeconomic Policy and Performance: Implications for Perestroika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-cJAQAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Department of Economics, Pennsylvania State University|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Law on Cooperatives]] enacted in May 1988 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.

''Glasnost'' resulted in greater freedom of speech and the press becoming far less controlled. Thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were also released.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Soviet social science became free to explore and publish on many subjects that had previously been off limits, including conducting public opinion polls. The All−Union Center for Public Opinion Research ([[Russian Public Opinion Research Center|VCIOM]])—the most prominent of several polling organizations that were started then— was opened. State archives became more accessible, and some social statistics that had been kept secret became open for research and publication on sensitive subjects such as income disparities, crime, suicide, abortion, and infant mortality. The first center for gender studies was opened within a newly formed Institute for the Socio−Economic Study of Human Population.

In January 1987, Gorbachev called for democratization: the infusion of democratic elements such as multi-candidate elections into the Soviet political process. A 1987 conference convened by Soviet economist and Gorbachev adviser [[Leonid Abalkin]], concluded: &quot;Deep transformations in the management of the economy cannot be realized without corresponding changes in the political system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Voprosy Ekonomiki'' (Moscow), no. 2 (1988), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988, at the CPSU's Nineteenth Party Conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aLbv8p_mmlcC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=In+June+1988,+at+the+CPSU+Nineteenth+Party+Conference&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j9ridqP7aZ&amp;sig=viqnbkpe9KTE6QujW_H6_S1ewEQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn5ryS2tnYAhXJXLwKHVrcCwQQ6AEIUjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20June%201988,%20at%20the%20CPSU%20Nineteenth%20Party%20Conference&amp;f=false|title=Imagined Economies: The Sources of Russian Regionalism|last=Herrera|first=Yoshiko M.|date=2007-03-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521534734|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. On 1 December 1988, the Supreme Soviet amended the Soviet constitution to allow for the establishment of a [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] as the Soviet Union's new supreme legislative body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Stephen|date=1990|title='Democratisation' in the USSR|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/152160|journal=Soviet Studies|volume=42|issue=1|pages=3–24|issn=0038-5859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1989 Soviet Union legislative election|Elections to the new Congress of People's Deputies]] were held throughout the USSR in March and April 1989. Gorbachev, as General Secretary of the Communist Party, could be forced to resign at any moment if the communist elite became dissatisfied with him. To proceed with reforms opposed by the majority of the communist party, Gorbachev aimed to consolidate power in a new position, [[President of the Soviet Union]], which was independent from the CPSU and the soviets (councils) and whose holder could be impeached only in case of direct violation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/people/?pid=226 Российская история | Персонажи | Горбачев Михаил Сергеевич&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227214102/http://www.sgu.ru/rus_hist/people/?pid=226 |date=27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive president. At the same time, [[Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution|Article 6]] of the constitution was changed to deprive the CPSU of a monopoly on political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ria.ru/spravka/20100314/213855855.html |title=Отмена 6-й статьи Конституции СССР о руководящей роли КПСС. Справка |publisher=RIA Novosti |date=14 March 2010|accessdate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintended consequences===
Gorbachev's efforts to streamline the Communist system offered promise, but ultimately proved uncontrollable and resulted in a cascade of events that eventually concluded with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initially intended as tools to bolster the Soviet economy, the policies of ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' soon led to [[unintended consequences]].

Relaxation under ''glasnost'' resulted in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the media. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied and actively concealed. Problems receiving increased attention included poor housing, alcoholism, [[Substance abuse|drug abuse]], pollution, outdated Stalin-era factories, and petty to large-scale corruption, all of which the official media had ignored. Media reports also exposed crimes committed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and the Soviet regime, such as the [[gulag]]s, [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|his treaty with Adolf Hitler]], and the [[Great Purges]], which had been ignored by the official media. Moreover, the ongoing [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]], and the mishandling of the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], further damaged the credibility of the Soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing.

In all, the positive view of Soviet lifelong presented to the public by the official media was rapidly fading, and the negative aspects of life in the Soviet Union were brought into the spotlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy&quot;&gt;Acton, Edward,, (1995) ''Russia, The Tsarist and Soviet Legacy'', Longmann Group Ltd (1995) {{ISBN|0-582-08922-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This undermined the faith of the public in the Soviet system and eroded the Communist Party's social power base, threatening the identity and integrity of the Soviet Union itself.

Fraying amongst the members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and instability of its western allies, first indicated by [[Lech Wałęsa]]'s 1980 rise to leadership of the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], accelerated, leaving the Soviet Union unable to depend upon its Eastern European satellite states for protection as a buffer zone. By 1989, following his doctrine of &quot;[[new political thinking]]&quot;, Gorbachev had repudiated the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies (&quot;[[Sinatra Doctrine]]&quot;). Gradually, each of the Warsaw Pact countries saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and, in the case of [[Romania]], a [[Romanian Revolution|violent uprising]]. By 1990, the governments of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], all of which had been imposed after [[World War II]], were brought down as [[Revolutions of 1989|revolutions swept Eastern Europe]].

The Soviet Union also began experiencing upheaval as the political consequences of ''glasnost'' reverberated throughout the country. Despite efforts at containment, the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the USSR. In elections to the regional assemblies of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, nationalists as well as radical reformers swept the board. As Gorbachev had weakened the system of internal political repression, the ability of the USSR's central Moscow government to impose its will on the USSR's constituent republics had been largely undermined. Massive peaceful protests in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] such as the [[Baltic Way]] and the [[Singing Revolution]] drew international attention and bolstered independence movements in various other regions.

The rise of nationalism under ''freedom of speech'' soon re-awakened simmering ethnic tensions in various Soviet republics, further discrediting the ideal of a unified Soviet people. One instance occurred in February 1988, when the government in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], a predominantly ethnic Armenian region in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]], passed a resolution calling for unification with the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]]. Violence against local Azerbaijanis was reported on Soviet television, provoking [[Sumgait pogrom|massacres of Armenians]] in the Azerbaijani city of [[Sumqayit|Sumgait]].

Emboldened by the liberalized atmosphere of ''glasnost'', public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more overt than ever before in the Soviet period. Although ''perestroika'' was considered bold in the context of Soviet history, Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country's chronically sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms made some inroads in decentralization, but Gorbachev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] system, including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production.

The value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1990 in retail prices was about 459 billion rubles ($2.1 trillion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JSwstF6SEAkC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=ussr+output+ruble&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V9GzYYG6fV&amp;sig=FZpZnEpfYwmcNjTa4VX3SNbMjt0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ussr%20output%20ruble&amp;f=false|title=The Former Soviet Union in Transition|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. Tax revenues declined as republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The anti−alcohol campaign reduced tax revenues as well, which in 1982 accounted for about 12% of all state revenue. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supplier−producer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralization caused new production bottlenecks.

==Dissolution of the USSR==
{{Main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
The dissolution of the Soviet Union' was a process of systematic [[Societal collapse|disintegration]], which occurred in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economy]], social structure and [[Politics of the Soviet Union|political structure]]. It resulted in the abolition of the Soviet Federal Government (&quot;the Union center&quot;) and independence of the USSR's republics on 26 December 1991. The process was caused by a weakening of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]], which led to disintegration and took place from about 19 January 1990 to 26 December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbenedictcollege.org/stlucija/files/Sandro%20Sciberras/Form%205%20Option%20European%20History/The%20Dismantlement%20of%20the%20USSR.pdf|title=Welcome stbenedictcollege.org - BlueHost.com|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=Vt5OLD3vp4UC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;dq=26+december+1991+ussr&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hxNfBDGN_P&amp;sig=fAZWN5NzjiNnn8gO7SRV0x_YtrA&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwir8Yuj7o3dAhWtx4UKHYzZCzMQ6AEwGXoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=26%20december%201991%20ussr&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The process was characterized by many of the [[republics of the Soviet Union]] declaring their independence and being recognized [[Post-Soviet states|as sovereign nation-states]].

Andrei Grachev, the Deputy Head of the Intelligence Department of the Central Committee, summed up the denouement of the downfall quite cogently:

&quot;Gorbachev actually put the sort of final blow to the resistance of the Soviet Union by killing the fear of the people. It was still that this country was governed and kept together, as a structure, as a government structure, by the fear from Stalinist times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/sovietcollapse.htm|title=The Economic Collapse of the Soviet Union|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2011}}
The principal elements of the old Soviet political system were Communist Party dominance, the hierarchy of [[Soviet (council)|soviets]],  state socialism, and [[ethnic federalism]]. Gorbachev's programs of ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) and ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) produced radical unforeseen effects that brought that system down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|513251|Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a means of reviving the Soviet state, Gorbachev repeatedly attempted to build a coalition of political leaders supportive of reform and created new arenas and bases of power. He implemented these measures because he wanted to resolve serious economic problems and political inertia that clearly threatened to put the Soviet Union into a state of long-term stagnation.

But by using structural reforms to widen opportunities for leaders and popular movements in the union republics to gain influence, Gorbachev also made it possible for nationalist, orthodox communist, and populist forces to oppose his attempts to liberalize and revitalize Soviet communism. Although some of the new movements aspired to replace the Soviet system altogether with a liberal democratic one, others demanded independence for the national republics. Still others insisted on the restoration of the old Soviet ways. Ultimately, Gorbachev could not forge a compromise among these forces and the consequence was the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

==Post-Soviet restructuring==
{{Main|History of Russia (1991–present)}}
To restructure the Soviet administrative command system and implement a transition to a [[market economy]], Yeltsin's [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock program]] was employed within days of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The subsidies to money-losing farms and industries were cut, price controls abolished, and the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] moved towards [[convertibility]]. New opportunities for Yeltsin's circle and other entrepreneurs to seize former state property were created, thus restructuring the old state-owned economy within a few months.

After obtaining power, the vast majority of &quot;idealistic&quot; reformers gained huge possessions of state property using their positions in the government and became [[business oligarch]]s in a manner that appeared antithetical to an emerging democracy. Existing institutions were conspicuously abandoned prior to the establishment of new legal structures of the market economy such as those governing private property, overseeing financial markets, and enforcing taxation.

Market economists believed that the dismantling of the administrative command system in Russia would raise GDP and living standards by allocating resources more efficiently. They also thought the collapse would create new production possibilities by eliminating central planning, substituting a decentralized market system, eliminating huge macroeconomic and structural distortions through liberalization, and providing incentives through privatization.

Since the USSR's collapse, Russia faced many problems that [[free market]] proponents in 1992 did not expect. Among other things, 25% of the population lived below the poverty line, life expectancy had fallen, birthrates were low, and the GDP was halved. There was a sharp increase in [[economic inequality]] between 1988/1989 and 1993/1995, with the [[Gini ratio]] increasing by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| location =Princeton| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s, which nearly led to the election of Yeltsin's Communist challenger, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], in the [[1996 Russian presidential election|1996 presidential election]]. In recent years, the economy of Russia has begun to improve greatly, due to major investments and business development and also due to high prices of natural resources.
