A '''cocktail''' is  [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic]] [[mixed drink]], which is either a combination of [[liquor|spirits]], or one or more spirits mixed with other ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. There are various types of cocktails, based on the number and kind of ingredients added. The origins of the cocktail are debated.

== Usage and related terms ==
The Oxford Dictionaries define cocktail as &quot;An alcoholic drink consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients, such as fruit juice or cream&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cocktail |title=cocktail – Definition of cocktail in English by Oxford Dictionaries |website=Oxford Dictionaries – English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A cocktail can contain alcohol, a sugar, and a bitter/citrus. When a mixed drink contains only a [[distilled beverage|distilled spirit]] and a [[Drink mixer|mixer]], such as [[Carbonated water|soda]]  or [[fruit juice]], it is a [[highball]]. Many of the International Bartenders Association [[IBA Official Cocktail|Official Cocktails]] are highballs.  When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a [[liqueur]], it is a [[List of duo and trio cocktails|duo]], and when it adds a mixer, it is a [[List of duo and trio cocktails|trio]]. Additional ingredients may be [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[milk]], [[cream]], and  various [[herb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Craft of the Cocktail |author=DeGroff, Dale |year=2002 |publisher=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble cocktails are known as &quot;[[Non-alcoholic mixed drink|mocktails]]&quot; or &quot;virgin cocktails&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word cocktail is disputed. The first recorded use of cocktail not referring to a horse is found in ''The Morning Post and Gazetteer'' in London, England, March 20, 1798:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jared Brown &amp; Anistatia Miller |title=Spirituous Journey: A History of Drink, Book Two |publisher=Mixellany Limited |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9760937-9-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Oxford English dictionary|''The Oxford English Dictionary'']] cites the word as originating in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cocktail |title=cocktail – definition of cocktail in English – Oxford Dictionaries |publisher= |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use of ''cocktail'' as a beverage (possibly non-alcoholic) in the United States appears in ''The Farmer's Cabinet'', April 28, 1803:&lt;ref name=&quot;Wondrich&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Imbibe!: From Absinthe Cocktail to Whiskey Smash, a Salute in Stories and Drinks to &quot;Professor&quot; Jerry Thomas, Pioneer of the American Bar |first=David |last=Wondrich |publisher=Perigee Trade |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-399-53287-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The first definition of Cocktail.jpg|thumb|240px|The first definition of a Cocktail by Harry Croswell]]

The first definition of cocktail known to be an alcoholic beverage appeared in ''The Balance and Columbian Repository'' ([[Hudson, New York]]) May 13, 1806; editor [[Harry Croswell]] answered the question, &quot;What is a cocktail?&quot;:

{{quote|''Cock-tail'' is a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and [[bitters]]—it is vulgarly called ''bittered sling'', and is supposed to be an excellent electioneering potion, in as much as it renders the heart stout and bold, at the same time that it fuddles the head. It is said, also to be of great use to a [[United States Democratic-Republican Party|democratic]] candidate: because a person, having swallowed a glass of it, is ready to swallow any thing else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imbibemagazine.com/images/Balance_5-13-1806.pdf ''The Balance and Columbian Repository''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713113329/http://www.imbibemagazine.com/images/Balance_5-13-1806.pdf |date=2014-07-13 }}, May 13, 1806, No. 19, Vol. V, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Etymologist [[Anatoly Liberman]] endorses as &quot;highly probable&quot; the theory advanced by  Låftman (1946), which Liberman summarizes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Liberman, Anatoly. &quot;The State of English Etymology&quot;, in {{cite book |title=Studies in the History of the English Language V: Variation and Change in English Grammar and Lexicon: Contemporary Approaches |first=Robert A. et al. (ed.) |last=Cloutier |pages=161–185 |year=2010 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-022033-9 |location=Berlin, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was customary to dock the tails of horses that were not thoroughbred ... They were called ''cocktailed horses'', later simply ''cocktails''. By extension, the word ''cocktail'' was applied to a vulgar, ill-bred person raised above his station, assuming the position of a gentleman but deficient in gentlemanly breeding. ... Of importance [in the 1806 citation above] is ... the mention of water as an ingredient. ... Låftman concluded that cocktail was an acceptable alcoholic drink, but diluted, not a &quot;purebred&quot;, a thing &quot;raised above its station&quot;. Hence the highly appropriate slang word used earlier about inferior horses and sham gentlemen.}}

In his book ''Imbibe!'' (2007), David Wondrich also speculates that ''cocktail'' is a reference to a practice for perking up an old horse by means of a ginger suppository so that the animal would &quot;cock its tail up and be frisky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Origin of &quot;Cocktail&quot; Is Not What You Think |url=http://liquor.com/articles/the-origin-of-cocktail-is-not-what-you-think/#gs.Ke8aTTo |website=Liquor.com |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lack of clarity on the origins of cocktails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/1256/the-surprising-history-of-the-cocktail.html |website=telegraph.co.uk |title=The surprising history of the cocktail |accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally cocktails were a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and [[bitters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Professor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=How To Mix Drinks: or, The bon-vivant's companion... |url=https://archive.org/details/howtomixdrinkso00schugoog |last=Thomas |first=Jerry |year=1862}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, however, a cocktail frequently included a [[liqueur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Democracy in Trouble |journal=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=Feb 15, 1880 |volume=1880 |page=4 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/172179593.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Feb+15%2C+1880&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+%281872-1922%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=THE+DEMOCRACY+IN+TROUBLE. |accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Professor&quot; /&gt;

The first publication of a [[bartender]]s' guide which included cocktail recipes was in 1862 – ''How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion'', by &quot;Professor&quot; [[Jerry Thomas (bartender)|Jerry Thomas]]. In addition to recipes for punches, sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks were 10 recipes for &quot;cocktails&quot;. A key ingredient differentiating cocktails from other drinks in this compendium was the use of [[bitters]]. Mixed drinks popular today that conform to this original meaning of &quot;cocktail&quot; include the [[Old fashioned (cocktail)|Old Fashioned]] whiskey cocktail, the [[Sazerac]] cocktail, and the [[Manhattan (cocktail)|Manhattan]] cocktail.

The ingredients listed (spirits, sugar, water, and bitters) match the ingredients of an [[Old fashioned (cocktail)|Old Fashioned]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern American Drinks: How to Mix and Serve All Kinds of Cups and Drinks |url=https://archive.org/details/modernamericandr00kapp |author=Kappeler |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; which originated as a term used by late 19th century bar patrons to distinguish cocktails made the  &quot;old-fashioned&quot; way from newer, more complex cocktails.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wondrich&quot; /&gt;

In the 1869 recipe book ''Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks'', by William Terrington, cocktails are described as:&lt;ref name=&quot;Terrington1869&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=William Terrington |title=Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7T8CAAAAQAAJ |year=1869 |publisher=George Routledge and Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|text=Cocktails are compounds very much used by &quot;early birds&quot; to fortify the inner man, and by those who like their consolations hot and strong.}}

The term [[highball]] appears during the 1890s to distinguish a drink composed only of a [[distilled beverage|distilled spirit]] and a [[Drink mixer|mixer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=High Ball Etymology |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=highball |website=Etymonline.com |accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first &quot;cocktail party&quot; ever thrown was allegedly by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], in May 1917. Walsh invited 50 guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party lasted an hour, until lunch was served at 1 pm. The site of this first cocktail party still stands. In 1924, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis]] bought the Walsh mansion at 4510 Lindell Boulevard, and it has served as the local archbishop's residence ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB119161653517750477.html |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |title=St. Louis -- Party Central |first=Eric |last=Felten |date=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1920–1933), when alcoholic beverages were illegal, cocktails were still consumed illegally in establishments known as [[speakeasy|speakeasies]]. The quality of the liquor available during Prohibition was much worse than previously.&lt;ref name=Regan&gt;{{cite book |title=The Joy of Mixology |author=Regan, Gary |year=2003 |publisher=Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a shift from [[whiskey]] to [[gin]], which does not require aging and is therefore easier to produce illicitly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrating Cinco de Drinko |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=November 28, 2008 |author=Eric Felton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Honey, fruit juices, and other flavorings served to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors. Sweet cocktails were easier to drink quickly, an important consideration when the establishment might be raided at any moment. With wine and beer less readily available, liquor-based cocktails took their place, even becoming the centerpiece of the new [[cocktail party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Jeffrey |title=The Prohibition-era origins of the modern craft cocktail movement |url=https://theconversation.com/the-prohibition-era-origins-of-the-modern-craft-cocktail-movement-109623 |accessdate=17 January 2019 |work=The Conversation |date=15 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocktails became less popular in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, until resurging in the 1980s with [[vodka]] often substituting the original gin in drinks such as the [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]. Traditional cocktails began to make a comeback in the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Anthony Dias Blue |title=The Complete Book of Spirits |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |year=2004 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail culture in a style typically referred to as mixology that draws on traditional cocktails for inspiration but utilizes novel ingredients and often complex flavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jared Brown |title=Mixologist: The Journal of the American Cocktail |publisher=[[Ready Writers Publishing Company]] |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
