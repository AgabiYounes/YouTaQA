&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Cholera is caused by a number of [[serotype|types]] of ''Vibrio cholerae'', with some types producing more severe disease than others.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; It is spread mostly by [[waterborne diseases|unsafe water]] and [[foodborne illness|unsafe food]] that has been contaminated with [[human feces]] containing the bacteria.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Undercooked [[seafood]] is a common source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources of Infection &amp; Risk Factors|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/infection-sources.html|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=November 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312223337/http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/infection-sources.html|archivedate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are the only animal affected.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; [[Risk factors]] for the disease include poor [[sanitation]], not enough clean [[drinking water]], and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; There are concerns that [[rising sea level]]s will increase rates of disease.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Cholera can be diagnosed by a [[stool test]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cholera vaccines: WHO position paper|journal=Wkly.

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to [[drinking water|clean water]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2012 /&gt; [[Cholera vaccine]]s that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by ''[[Escherichia coli|E.&amp;nbsp;coli]]''.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; The primary treatment is [[oral rehydration therapy]]—the replacement of fluids with [[electrolytes|slightly sweet and salty solutions]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; Rice-based solutions are preferred.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; [[Zinc supplementation]] is useful in children.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Zinc&gt;{{cite web|title=Cholera – Vibrio cholerae infection Treatment|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/treatment/index.html|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=November 7, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311042338/http://www.cdc.gov/cholera/treatment/index.html|archivedate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In severe cases, [[intravenous fluid]]s, such as [[Ringer's lactate]], may be required, and [[antibiotic]]s may be beneficial.&lt;ref name=WHO2010 /&gt; [[Antibiotic sensitivity|Testing to see which antibiotic]] the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Pro /&gt;

Fever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic, and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. [[Kussmaul breathing]], a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of [[acidosis]] from [[Human feces|stool]] [[bicarbonate]] losses and [[lactic acidosis]] associated with poor [[perfusion]]. [[Blood pressure]] drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, [[seizures]], or even [[coma]] due to [[electrolyte imbalance]]s are common, especially in children.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt;

=== Transmission ===
Cholera bacteria have been found in [[shellfish]] and [[plankton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet2004&quot; /&gt;

[[Transmission (medicine)|Transmission]] is usually through the [[fecal-oral route]] of contaminated food or water caused by poor [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2010&quot; /&gt; Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in the developing world it is more often water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet2004&quot; /&gt; Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as [[oyster]]s in waters infected with [[sewage]], as ''Vibrio cholerae'' accumulates in [[plankton]]ic [[copepod|crustaceans]] and the oysters eat the [[zooplankton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bakerinstitute.org&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/videos/civic-scientist-lecture-series-rita-colwell-oceans-climate-and-health-cholera-model-infectious-diseases-changing-environment/|title=Oceans, Climate, and Health: Cholera as a Model of Infectious Diseases in a Changing Environment|publisher=James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy|people=[[Rita Colwell]]|accessdate=2013-10-23|location=Rice University|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026030733/http://bakerinstitute.org/videos/civic-scientist-lecture-series-rita-colwell-oceans-climate-and-health-cholera-model-infectious-diseases-changing-environment/|archivedate=2013-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as &quot;rice-water&quot;, contaminates water used by others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherris&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Sherris Medical Microbiology|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8385-8529-0|edition=4th|pages=376–7|editor1=Ryan KJ |editor2=Ray CG}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of ''V. cholerae'' in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/cholera-biology-and-genetics|title=Cholera Biology and Genetics {{!}} NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, [[groundwater]] or [[drinking water]] supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as [[shellfish]] living in the affected [[waterway]], can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely [[contagious disease|spread directly from person to person]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

''V. cholerae'' also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], or [[Biotic material|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] detritus.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=EJ|last2=Harris|first2=JB|last3=Morris|first3=JG|last4=Calderwood|first4=SB|last5=Camilli|first5=A| title=Cholera transmission: the host, pathogen and bacteriophage dynamic|journal=Nat Rev Microbiol|date=7 October 2009|volume=7|issue=10|pages=693–702|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2204|pmid=19756008|pmc=3842031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of ''V. cholerae'' to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as '[[viable but non-culturable]]' (VBNC) or more conservatively '[[active but non-culturable]]' (ABNC).&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt; One study indicates that the culturability of ''V. cholerae'' drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.&lt;ref name=NEJOct2009review /&gt;&lt;ref name=NEJOct2008plos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson |first1=EJ |last2=Chowdhury |first2=A |last3=Flynn |first3=J |last4=Schild |first4=Stefan |last5=Bourassa |first5=L |last6=Shao |first6=Yue |last7=LaRocque|first7=RC|last8=Calderwood|first8=SB|last9=Qadri|first9=F|last10=Camilli|first10=A| title=Transmission of ''Vibrio cholerae'' Is Antagonized by Lytic Phage and Entry into the Aquatic Environment|journal=PLoS Pathog|date=24 October 2008|volume=4|issue=10|pages=e1000187|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000187|pmid=18949027|pmc=2563029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both toxic and non-toxic strains exist.

=== Susceptibility ===
About 100{{nbsp}}million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; This dose, however, is less in those with lowered [[gastric acid]]ity (for instance those using [[proton pump inhibitors]]).&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their [[blood type]], with those with [[type O blood]] being the most susceptible.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt; Persons with [[immunodeficiency|lowered immunity]], such as persons with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] or [[malnutrition|malnourished]] children, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected.&lt;ref name=WHOpreventionandcontrolofoutbreaks&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf Prevention and control of cholera outbreaks: WHO policy and recommendations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122092541/http://www.emro.who.int/csr/Media/PDF/cholera_whopolicy.pdf |date=2011-11-22 }}, World Health Organization, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, undated but citing sources from '07, '04, '03, '04, and '05.&lt;/ref&gt; Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional [[health care provider]].{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cystic fibrosis]] genetic [[mutation]] known as [[delta-F508]] in humans has been said to maintain a selective [[heterozygous advantage]]: [[heterozygous]] carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to ''V. cholerae'' infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertranpetit_1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=1996|title=Genetic and geographical variability in cystic fibrosis: evolutionary considerations|journal=Ciba Found.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Cholera role of biofilm in intestinal colonization.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The role of [[biofilm]] in the intestinal colonization of ''Vibrio cholerae''.]]
When consumed, most bacteria do not survive the [[Gastric acid|acidic]] conditions of the [[stomach|human stomach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BliskaAlmagro-Moreno2015&quot; /&gt; The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored [[nutrient]]s during the passage through the stomach by shutting down [[protein]] production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the [[small intestine]], they must propel themselves through the thick [[Mucus#Digestive system|mucus]] that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;BliskaAlmagro-Moreno2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Almagro-Moreno|first1=S|last2=Pruss|first2=K|last3=Taylor|first3=RK|title=Intestinal Colonization Dynamics of Vibrio cholerae.|journal=PLOS Pathog.|date=May 2015|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e1004787|pmid=25996593|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004787|pmc=4440752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the [[flagellum|flagella]] to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein [[flagellin]] to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins which they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, ''V. cholerae'' start producing the [[exotoxin|toxic proteins]] that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of ''V. cholerae'' bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

The [[cholera toxin]] (CTX or CT) is an [[oligomer]]ic complex made up of six [[protein subunit]]s: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a [[disulfide bond]]. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to [[GM1]] [[ganglioside]]s on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that [[ADP-ribosylation|ADP-ribosylates]] [[G protein]]s, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]]. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called [[ADP-ribosylation factor 6]] (Arf6).&lt;ref name=O&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Neal CJ, Jobling MG, Holmes RK, Hol WG | title = Structural basis for the activation of cholera toxin by human ARF6-GTP | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5737 | pages = 1093–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16099990 | doi = 10.1126/science.1113398 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1093O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the [[Gs alpha subunit]] of the [[heterotrimeric G protein]]. This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called [[CTXφ Bacteriophage|CTXφ]].

Microbiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiRita&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ | title = Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae | journal = Proc.

The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}

By inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiRita&quot; /&gt; Current{{when|date=August 2017}} research aims at discovering &quot;the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DiRita&quot; /&gt;

=== Genetic structure ===
{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}
[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]] [[DNA profiling|fingerprinting]] of the pandemic [[genetic isolate|isolates]] of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two [[gene cluster|clusters]] have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=December 2013}} {{cite journal |vauthors=Lan R, Reeves PR | title = Pandemic Spread of Cholera: Genetic Diversity and Relationships within the Seventh Pandemic Clone of Vibrio cholerae Determined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism | journal = J.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
In many areas of the world, [[antibiotic resistance]] is increasing within cholera bacteria. In [[Bangladesh]], for example, most cases are resistant to [[tetracycline]], [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]], and [[erythromycin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NEJM2006&quot; /&gt; Rapid diagnostic [[assay]] methods are available for the identification of [[multiple drug resistance|multi-drug resistant]] cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Real-Time PCR in microbiology: From diagnosis to characterization|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-904455-18-9|editor=Mackay IM}}&lt;/ref&gt; New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in ''in vitro'' studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramamurthy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Vibrio cholerae: Genomics and molecular biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-904455-33-2|chapter=Antibiotic resistance in ''Vibrio cholerae''|author=Ramamurthy T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
A rapid [[dipstick]] test is available to determine the presence of ''V. cholerae''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEJM2006&quot; /&gt; In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEJM2006&quot; /&gt; In [[epidemic]] situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a [[medical history|patient history]] and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.

Stool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is ''V. cholerae'' O1. If ''V. cholerae'' [[serotype|serogroup]] O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for ''V. cholerae'' O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.

Infection with ''V. cholerae'' O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by ''V. cholerae'' O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC_Diag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/pdf/Laboratory-Methods-for-the-Diagnosis-of-Epidemic-Dysentery-and-Cholera.pdf|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera|year=1999|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=2017-06-30|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623024004/https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/pdf/laboratory-methods-for-the-diagnosis-of-epidemic-dysentery-and-cholera.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper [[sanitation]] practices are followed. In [[developed countries]], due to nearly universal advanced [[water treatment]] and sanitation practices present there, cholera is rare.

Effective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Sterilization: Proper disposal and treatment of all materials that may have come into contact with cholera victims' feces (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. These should be [[Disinfection|sanitized]] by washing in hot water, using [[chlorine]] [[bleach]] if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.
* [[Sewage]] and [[fecal sludge management]]: In cholera-affected areas, sewage and fecal sludge need to be treated and managed carefully in order to stop the spread of this disease via [[human excreta]]. Provision of [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] is an important preventative measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot; /&gt; [[Open defecation]], release of untreated sewage, or dumping of fecal sludge from [[pit latrine]]s or [[septic tank]]s into the environment need to be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=AGQVBeNM_80C&amp;pg=PA5|title=Urban Water Security: Managing Risks: UNESCO-IHP|last=Cisneros|first=Blanca Jimenez|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|date=2009-03-24|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-88162-0|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cholera affected zones, there is a low degree of [[sewage treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rd3zCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=GBS.PA24|title=Cholera and the Ecology of Vibrio cholerae|last=Drasar|first=B.

* Sources: Warnings about possible cholera contamination should be posted around contaminated water sources with directions on how to [[decontamination|decontaminate]] the water (boiling, chlorination etc.) for possible use.
* [[Water purification]]: All water used for drinking, washing, or cooking should be sterilized by either boiling, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozone water treatment, ultraviolet light sterilization (e.g., by [[solar water disinfection]]), or antimicrobial filtration in any area where cholera may be present. Chlorination and boiling are often the least expensive and most effective means of halting transmission. [[Cloth filter]]s or [[#Sari filtration|sari filtration]], though very basic, have significantly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in [[Bangladesh]] that rely on untreated surface water. Better antimicrobial filters, like those present in advanced individual water treatment hiking kits, are most effective. Public health education and adherence to appropriate sanitation practices are of primary importance to help prevent and control transmission of cholera and other diseases.

[[Hand washing|Handwashing]] with soap or ash after using a [[toilet]] and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cholera and food safety |url=http://who.insomnation.com/sites/default/files/pdf/fan_cholera%20fact%20sheet7.pdf |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |accessdate=2017-08-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821044840/http://who.insomnation.com/sites/default/files/pdf/fan_cholera%20fact%20sheet7.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance ===
[[File:Using Precipitation Data to Assess Risk of Cholera Outbreaks.webm|thumb|upright=1.3|A modelling approach using satellite data can enhance our ability to develop cholera risk maps in several regions of the globe.]]
Surveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during [[Wet season|rainy seasons]]. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |title=Cholera: prevention and control |publisher=WHO |work=Health topics |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214042133/http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/control/en/index.html |archivedate=2008-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.&lt;ref name=Lancet2004 /&gt;

Although much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human [[feces]] and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]], and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the [[Americas]] for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blake PA | title = Epidemiology of cholera in the Americas | journal = Gastroenterol.

Spanish physician [[Jaume Ferran i Clua]] developed a cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others#EVT_101034 onlinelibrary.wiley.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211100824/http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/others |date=2015-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian-Jewish bacteriologist [[Waldemar Haffkine]] developed the first cholera vaccine in July 1892.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm haffkineinstitute.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024552/http://www.haffkineinstitute.org/waldemar.htm |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] (1813–1858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Charles E. |title=The cholera years: the United States in 1832, 1849 and 1866 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-72677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major &quot;state of the art&quot; review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human [[sewage]] contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Dr John Snow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 ''The mode of communication of cholera''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106215135/https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP5 |date=2015-11-06 }}, 2nd ed. (London, England:  John Churchill, 1855).&lt;/ref&gt; His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so.

Cities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, [[Robert Koch]] identified ''V. cholerae'' with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Aberth, John. Plagues in World History. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2011, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hemendra Nath Chatterjee]], a Bengali scientist, who first formulated and demonstrated the effectiveness of [[oral rehydration salt]] (ORS) for [[diarrhea]].  In his 1953 paper, published in [[The Lancet]], he states that [[promethazine]] can stop [[vomiting]] during cholera and then oral rehydration is possible. The formulation of the fluid replacement solution  was 4&amp;nbsp;g of [[sodium chloride]], 25&amp;nbsp;g of [[glucose]] and 1000&amp;nbsp;ml of [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruxin |first1=JN |title=Magic bullet: the history of oral rehydration therapy. |journal=Medical History |date=October 1994 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=363–97 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300036905 |pmid=7808099|pmc=1036912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=CHATTERJEE |first1=HN |title=Control of vomiting in cholera and oral replacement of fluid. |journal=Lancet |date=21 November 1953 |volume=265 |issue=6795 |pages=1063 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(53)90668-0 |pmid=13110052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Allan Phillips]], working at the US [[Naval Medical Research Unit Two]] in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the [[Lasker Foundation]] to award him its prize in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/treatment-of-cholera/ |title= Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award |publisher= Lasker Foundation |accessdate= June 30, 2017 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170901014519/http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/show/treatment-of-cholera/ |archivedate= September 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2002, Alam, ''et al.'', studied stool samples from patients at the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh|International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease]] in [[Dhaka, Bangladesh]]. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the &quot;rice water&quot; stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merrell2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Merrell DS, Butler SM, Qadri F, Dolganov NA, Alam A, Cohen MB, Calderwood SB, Schoolnik GK, Camilli A | title = Host-induced epidemic spread of the cholera bacterium | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6889 | pages = 642–5 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050664 | pmc = 2776822 | doi = 10.1038/nature00778 | ref = harv | bibcode = 2002Natur.417..642M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cholera vaccines. A brief summary of the March 2010 position paper&quot; (PDF). World Health Organization. Retrieved September 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]] was due partly to the government's role, according to a report from the [[James Baker Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bakerinstitute.org&quot; /&gt; The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21142690&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walton DA, Ivers LC | title = Responding to cholera in post-earthquake Haiti | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 364 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–5 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21142690 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1012997 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bcb5cb9231d09647b921d70d49758b20a72946ab }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, South Africa's cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14758861&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pauw J | title = The politics of underdevelopment: metered to death-how a water experiment caused riots and a cholera epidemic | journal = Int. J. Health Serv. | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 819–30 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14758861 | doi = 10.2190/kf8j-5nqd-xcyu-u8q7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rita R. Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakerinstitute.org&quot; /&gt; Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be &quot;Cholera-affected&quot;; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.&lt;ref name=&quot;John, T. Jacob 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=John TJ, Rajappan K, Arjunan KK | title = Communicable diseases monitored by disease surveillance in Kottayam district, Kerala state, India | journal = Indian J. Med. Res. | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–93 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15347857 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts.&lt;ref name=&quot;John, T. Jacob 2004&quot; /&gt; Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1500643&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985–1991 | journal = J.

According to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the [[Zimbabwean cholera outbreak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bakerinstitute.org&quot; /&gt; While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedirect.com&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeRoeck D, Clemens JD, Nyamete A, Mahoney RT | title = Policymakers' views regarding the introduction of new-generation vaccines against typhoid fever, shigellosis and cholera in Asia | journal = Vaccine | volume = 23 | issue = 21 | pages = 2762–2774 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15780724 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.11.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Choe | first1 = Chongwoo | last2 = Raschky | first2 = Paul A. | title = Media, institutions, and government action: prevention vs. palliation in the time of cholera | journal = [[Eur.

Besides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp, Clare 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kapp C | title = Zimbabwe's humanitarian crisis worsens | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9662 | pages = 447 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19205080 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60151-3 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090827090207/http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60151-3/fulltext | archivedate = 2009-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A country's government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapp, Clare 2009&quot; /&gt;
