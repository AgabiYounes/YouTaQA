On television, she is best known for her roles as the [[Ally McBeal (character)|title character]] on ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (1997–2002), [[Kitty Walker]] on ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'' (2006–2011), and [[Cat Grant]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' (2015–2019).

Flockhart has received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and been nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]].

==Early life==
Calista Kay Flockhart was born in [[Freeport, Illinois]], the daughter of Kay Calista, an [[English studies|English]] teacher, and Ronald Flockhart, a [[Kraft Foods]] executive.&lt;ref name=elp&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Schneider|first=Karen S.|title=Arguing Her Case|magazine=People Magazine|date=1998-11-09|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126712,00.html|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents are retired and live in [[Morristown, Tennessee]]. She has one older brother, Gary. Her mother reversed her own first and middle names in naming her Calista Kay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theworldnewsmedia.org/Calista+Flockhart+child+of+Ronald+and+Kay+Calista|title=News - Calista Flockhart child of Ronald and Kay Calista|work=theworldnewsmedia.org|access-date=2013-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312001053/http://theworldnewsmedia.org/Calista+Flockhart+child+of+Ronald+and+Kay+Calista|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because her father's job required the family to move often, Flockhart and her brother grew up in several places including [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Norwich, New York]]. As a child, she wrote a play called ''Toyland'' which she performed at a dinner party.

Flockhart attended [[Shawnee High School (New Jersey)|Shawnee High School]] in [[Medford Township, New Jersey]]. Following graduation in 1983, Flockhart attended Glassboro State College (now [[Rowan University]]) her freshman year, then subsequently attended the [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]] at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. While there, she attended a specialized and competitive class, lasting from 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. In her sophomore year at Rutgers, Flockhart met aspiring actress [[Jane Krakowski]], the best friend of her roommate. Later, they both would work together on ''Ally McBeal''.

People began recognizing Flockhart's acting ability when William Esper (Mason Gross' theatre director and Flockhart's acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though this venue usually is reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform there in his production of [[William Inge]]'s ''Picnic''. Flockhart graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in Theatre in 1988 as one of the few students who successfully completed the course. Rutgers inducted her into the  Hall of Distinguished Alumni on May 3, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Former 'Ally McBeal' actress named Rutgers distinguished alumna|last=|first=|date=May 5, 2003|work=The Associated Press State &amp; Local Wire|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Flockhart moved to [[New York City]] in 1989 and began seeking auditions, living with three other women in a two-bedroom apartment and working as a [[waitress]] and [[aerobics instructor]]. She remained until 1997.

==Career==

===Early career===
In spring 1989, Flockhart made her first television appearance in a minor role in an episode of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' as a babysitter. Also, she played a teenager battling an eating disorder on a one-hour Afternoon Special on TV. Flockhart made her professional debut on the New York stage, appearing in ''Beside Herself'' alongside [[Melissa Joan Hart]], at the Circle Repertory Theatre. Two years later, Flockhart appeared in the television movie ''Darrow''. Though she later appeared in films ''[[Naked in New York]]'' (1993) and ''Getting In'' (1994), her first substantial speaking part in a film was in ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]].

Flockhart debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1994, as Laura in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''. Actress [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] felt Flockhart should be hired without further auditions, claiming that she seemed ideal for the part.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Flockhart received a [[Clarence Derwent Award]] for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] when she appeared in the movie ''Drunks''. Later that year, Flockhart starred in ''Jane Doe'' as a drug addict. In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of [[Dianne Wiest]] and [[Gene Hackman]]'s characters in ''[[The Birdcage]]''. Throughout that year, she continued to work on Broadway, playing the role of Natasha in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]''.

===''Ally McBeal''===
{{main|Ally McBeal}}
In 1997, Flockhart was asked to audition for the starring role in [[David E. Kelley]]'s [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television]] series ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though she initially hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiable contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the June 29, 1998, cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=TIME Magazine Cover: Is Feminism Dead?|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19980629,00.html|date=June 29, 1998|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; placed as the newest iteration in the evolution of [[feminism]], relating to the ongoing debate about the role depicted by her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988616,00.html|title=It's All About Me!|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Ginia Bellafante|date=June 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flockhart starred on the show until it was canceled in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/18/ally.mcbeal.canceled/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Brothers &amp; Sisters''===
{{main|Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)}}
Flockhart performed in a starring role as [[Kitty Walker]], opposite [[Sally Field]], [[Rachel Griffiths]] and [[Matthew Rhys]], in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] critically acclaimed prime time series ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'', which premiered in September 2006 in the time slot after ''Desperate Housewives''. The show was cancelled in May 2011 after running for five years. Flockhart's character was significant throughout the series' first four years, but her appearances were reduced for the 2010–2011 season, coinciding with the departure of TV husband [[Rob Lowe]].

===Other work===
Flockhart played the role of Helena in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', a 1999 film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s play. In 2000, she appeared in ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'' and ''[[Bash: Latter-Day Plays]]'', later accompanying [[Eve Ensler]] to [[Kenya]] in order to protest violence against women, particularly [[Female genital cutting|female genital mutilation]]. Flockhart also starred in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Ensler's ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.

In 2004, Flockhart appeared as [[Matthew Broderick]]'s deranged girlfriend in ''[[The Last Shot]]''. In the same year, Flockhart travelled to [[Spain]] for the filming of ''[[Fragile (film)|Fragile]]'', which premiered in September 2005 at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. She was offered the role of [[Susan Mayer]] on ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' but declined, and the role later went to [[Teri Hatcher]].&lt;ref name=&quot;original&quot;&gt;[http://television.aol.com/photos/tv-star-castings &quot;Coulda Been a Contender&quot;], slide 7 of 14. [[AOL Television]]. Retrieved December 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Flockhart landed a role in ''Full Circle''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s second season, as mob boss Ellen. It was expected to air in 2015. This had been Flockhart's first acting role in three years, after her hiatus when [[Brothers &amp; Sisters (TV series)|''Brothers &amp; Sisters'']] ended.

In 2015, Flockhart was cast in the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' as [[Cat Grant]], a &quot;self-made media magnate and founder of CatCo&quot; and boss to Kara (Supergirl's alter ego).&lt;ref name=&quot;Supergirl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/23/calista-flockhart-cast-as-cat-grant-in-supergirl|title=Calista Flockhart Cast As Cat Grant In Supergirl|last=Nicholson|first=Matt|website=IGN|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on October 26, 2015, on [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/cbs-supergirl-premiere-october-26/|title=CBS ‘Supergirl’ Sets October Premiere, Plus More Fall Schedules|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Kevin|publisher=Screencrush|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the network's wish to reduce the show's budget, it was moved to sister network [[The CW]] after its first season, along with a move to filming in Vancouver. Flockhart remained with the show (albeit as a recurring character), despite her previous aversion to working outside Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvline.com/2016/08/01/calista-flockhart-supergirl-season-2-returning-cat-grant/ | title=Calista Flockhart Sets Supergirl Return (But Not as a Series Regular) | publisher=TV Line | date=August 1, 2016 | accessdate=August 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
