==Etymology==
{{main|Etymology of Edinburgh}}
&quot;Edin&quot;, the root of the city's name, derives from ''[[Eidyn]]'', the name for this region in [[Cumbric]], the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language formerly spoken there. The name's meaning is unknown.&lt;ref name=Gelling&gt;{{cite book | last1= Gelling | first1= Margaret | author-link1= Margaret Gelling | last2= Nicolaisen| first2= W. F. H.| author-link2= W. F. H. Nicolaisen| last3= Richards| first3= Melville | author-link3= |date= 1970 |title= The Names of Towns and Cities in Britain | location= |publisher= Batsford |pages= 88–89 |isbn= 978-0-7134-5235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district of Eidyn centred on the stronghold Din Eidyn, the [[dun]] or [[hillfort]] of Eidyn.&lt;ref name=Gelling/&gt; This stronghold is believed to have been located at [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]], now the site of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. Eidyn was conquered by the [[Angles]] of [[Bernicia]] in the 7th century and later by the Scots in the 10th century.&lt;ref name=Driscoll229&gt;{{cite book | last1= Driscoll | first1= Stephen | last2= Yeoman | first2= Peter A. |date= 1997 |series= Society of Antiquaries of Scotland monograph series|title= Excavations within Edinburgh Castle in 1988–91 |volume= 12 |publisher= [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] |page=229 |isbn= 978-0-903-903127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the language shifted to [[Old English]], and subsequently to modern English and [[Scots language|Scots]], the Brittonic ''din'' in Din Eidyn was replaced by ''[[burh]]'', producing ''Edinburgh''. Similarly, ''din'' became ''dùn'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], producing ''Dùn Èideann''.&lt;ref name=Gelling/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Placenames of the World |last=Room |first=Adrian |year=2006 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |pages=118–119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C |accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remark on a poem in an 1800 collection of the poems of [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] said, &quot;Auld Reeky.

[[Thomas Carlyle]] said, &quot;Smoke cloud hangs over old Edinburgh,—for, ever since [[Pope Pius II|Aeneas Silvius]]'s time and earlier, the people have the art, very strange to Aeneas, of burning a certain sort of black stones, and Edinburgh with its chimneys is called 'Auld Reekie' by the country people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Carlyle | first1 = Thomas | authorlink1 = Thomas Carlyle | title = Historical Sketches.... | pages = 304–305 | url = https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketc00carlgoog#page/n322/mode/2up | publisher = Chapman and Hall | year = 1898 | access-date = 19 July 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305081942/http://www.archive.org/stream/historicalsketc00carlgoog#page/n322/mode/2up | archive-date = 5 March 2016 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] who said that the sobriquet could not be traced before the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] attributed the name to a [[Fife]] laird, Durham of Largo, who regulated the bedtime of his children by the smoke rising above Edinburgh from the fires of the tenements. &quot;It's time now bairns, to tak' the beuks, and gang to our beds, for yonder's Auld Reekie, I see, putting on her nicht -cap!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Traditions of Edinburgh | page = 168 | url = https://archive.org/stream/traditionsofedin00cham#page/168/mode/2up | publisher = W. &amp; R.

Some have called Edinburgh the ''Athens of the North'' for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]]. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s character Archie, of ''[[Jumpers]]'', said, perhaps playing on [[Reykjavík]] meaning &quot;smoky bay&quot;, that the &quot;Reykjavík of the South&quot; would be more appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoppard|first= Tom|author-link=Tom Stoppard|title=Jumpers|title-link=Jumpers|publisher= Grove Press|date=1972|p= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has also been known by several Latin names, such as ''Aneda'' or ''Edina''. The adjectival form of the latter, ''Edinensis'', can often be seen inscribed on educational buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grässe1909&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Grässe|first=Johann Georg Theodor |authorlink=Johann Georg Theodor Grässe|title=Orbis latinus: oder Verzeichnis der wichtigsten lateinischen Orts- und Ländernamen|edition=2nd|trans-title=Orbis latinus : or List of the most important latin place and country names|year=1909|publisher=Richard Carl Schmidt|location=Berlin |language=de|title-link=Orbis Latinus|orig-year=1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.herbdatanz.com/pharmaceutical_latin_abbreviations.htm |title=Pharmaceutical Latin Abbreviations |publisher=Herbdatanz.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505111506/http://www.herbdatanz.com/pharmaceutical_latin_abbreviations.htm |archivedate=5 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scots poets [[Robert Fergusson]] and [[Robert Burns]] used the city's Latin name, ''Edina'', in their poems. [[Ben Jonson]] described it as &quot;Britaine's other eye&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 The Cambridge Companion to Ben Jonson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817133048/http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521641136_CCOL0521641136A003 |date=17 August 2011 }}.

[[File:Arthurs seat edinburgh.jpg|thumb|right|Edinburgh, showing Arthur's Seat, one of the earliest known sites of human habitation in the area]]

When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] arrived in Lothian at the end of the 1st century AD, they found a [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] Celtic tribe whose name they recorded as the [[Votadini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ritchie |first=J.

In 638, the Gododdin stronghold was besieged by forces loyal to [[Oswald of Northumbria|King Oswald]] of [[Northumbria]], and around this time control of Lothian passed to the [[Angles]]. Their influence continued for the next three centuries until around 950, when, during the reign of [[Indulf]], son of [[Constantine II of Scotland|Constantine II]], the &quot;burh&quot; (fortress), named in the 10th-century ''[[Pictish Chronicle]]'' as ''oppidum Eden'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson |first=William |title=The Celtic Place Names of Scotland |year=1926 |isbn=978-1-906566-35-7 |page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; was abandoned to the Scots.

In the 17th century, Edinburgh's boundaries were still defined by the city's defensive [[Edinburgh town walls|town walls]].

From the 1770s onwards, the professional and business classes gradually deserted the Old Town in favour of the more elegant &quot;one-family&quot; residences of the New Town, a migration that changed the city's social character. According to the foremost historian of this development, &quot;Unity of social feeling was one of the most valuable heritages of old Edinburgh, and its disappearance was widely and properly lamented.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Youngson |first=A J  |title=The Making of Classical Edinburgh |year=1988 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-85224-576-7|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s a new &quot;financial district&quot;, including the [[Edinburgh International Conference Centre]], has grown mainly on demolished railway property to the west of the castle, stretching into [[Fountainbridge]], a run-down 19th-century industrial suburb which has undergone radical change since the 1980s with the demise of industrial and brewery premises.

==Geography==

===Cityscape===
Situated in Scotland's [[Central Belt]], Edinburgh lies on the Firth of Forth's southern shore. The city centre is {{convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} southwest of the shoreline of [[Leith]] and {{convert|26|mi|km}} inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the [[North Sea]] at [[Dunbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |title=Geographia Atlas of the World |year=1984 |publisher=Geographia Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-09-202840-3 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on [[Hills in Edinburgh|seven hills]], namely Calton Hill, [[Corstorphine Hill]], Craiglockhart Hill, [[Braid Hills|Braid Hill]], [[Blackford Hill]], Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |title=Seven Hills of Edinburgh |accessdate=28 February 2013 |publisher=[[VisitScotland]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080149/http://www.seven-hills.org.uk/course.asp |archive-date=9 May 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to allusions to the [[seven hills of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |title=Voltaire said: Athens of the North |publisher=Scotland.org |date=September 2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427212622/http://www.scotland.org/features/voltaire-said |archive-date=27 April 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupying a narrow gap between the Firth of Forth to the north and the [[Pentland Hills]] and their outrunners to the south, the city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciation.

Edinburgh includes former towns and villages that retain much of their original character as settlements in existence before they were absorbed into the expanding city of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/areas |title=Edinburgh Areas |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115223740/http://edinburghguide.com/areas |archive-date=15 January 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas, such as [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]] contain residences that are multi-occupancy buildings known as [[tenement]]s, although the more southern and western parts of the city have traditionally been more affluent with a greater number of detached and semi-detached villas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |title=Edinburgh area guide |publisher=timeout.com |accessdate=9 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218202447/http://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/features/146/edinburgh-area-guide |archive-date=18 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edinburgh map.png|thumb|Map showing the areas of central Edinburgh]]
The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided in two by the broad green swathe of [[Princes Street Gardens]]. To the south, the view is dominated by Edinburgh Castle, built high on Castle Rock, and the long sweep of the Old Town descending towards Holyrood Palace. To the north lie Princes Street and the New Town.

The West End includes the financial district, with insurance and banking offices as well as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre.

Edinburgh's Old and New Towns were listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1995 in recognition of the unique character of the Old Town with its medieval street layout and the planned Georgian New Town, including the adjoining Dean Village and Calton Hill areas. There are over 4,500 [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed buildings]] within the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;www.edinburgh.org world-heritage-site&quot;/&gt; a higher proportion relative to area than any other city in the United Kingdom.

The [[Royal Mile]] runs downhill and terminates at Holyrood Palace. Minor streets (called closes or [[wynd]]s) lie on either side of the main spine forming a herringbone pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |title=Old and New Towns of Edinburgh |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=9 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120141829/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/728 |archive-date=20 January 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The street has several fine public buildings such as St Giles' Cathedral, the [[Edinburgh City Chambers|City Chambers]] and the [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Law Courts]]. Other places of historical interest nearby are [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] and the [[Grassmarket]]. The street layout is typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities.

The castle is perched on top of a rocky crag (the remnant of an extinct volcano) and the Royal Mile runs down the crest of a ridge from it. Due to space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of this landform, the Old Town became home to some of the earliest &quot;high rise&quot; residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings known as ''lands'' were the norm from the 16th century onwards with ten and eleven storeys being typical and one even reaching fourteen or fifteen storeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | authorlink1 = Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) | title = Notices of the most remarkable fires in Edinburgh: from 1385 to 1824&amp;nbsp;... | publisher = C.

The New Town was an 18th-century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded city which had been confined to the ridge sloping down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design a &quot;New Town&quot; was won by [[James Craig (architect)|James Craig]], a 27-year-old architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cruft, Kitty |title=James Craig 1739–1795: Correction of his Date of Birth |journal=Book of the Old Edinburgh Club |volume=New Series Vol. 5 |pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted in well with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]], running along the natural ridge to the north of what became known as the &quot;Old Town&quot;. To either side of it are two other main streets: Princes Street and Queen Street. Princes Street has become Edinburgh's main shopping street and now has few of its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings in their original state. The three main streets are connected by a series of streets running perpendicular to them. The east and west ends of George Street are terminated by [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]] and [[Charlotte Square]] respectively. The latter, designed by [[Robert Adam]], influenced the architectural style of the New Town into the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |title=Scottish Architects Homecoming |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=18 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119084414/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/architectsactive.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bute House]], the official residence of the [[First Minister of Scotland]], is on the north side of Charlotte Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |title=Bute House |publisher=edinburghguide.com |accessdate=9 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120143843/http://edinburghguide.com/venue/butehouse |archive-date=20 January 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hollow between the Old and New Towns was formerly the [[Nor Loch]], which was created for the town's defence but came to be used by the inhabitants for dumping their [[sewage]]. It was drained by the 1820s as part of the city's northward expansion. Craig's original plan included an ornamental canal on the site of the loch,&lt;ref name=&quot;princeshist&quot;/&gt; but this idea was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129|title=From monks on strike to dove's dung|publisher=scotsman.com|accessdate=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513214124/http://www.scotsman.com/news/from-monks-on-strike-to-dove-s-dung-1-881129|archive-date=13 May 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil excavated while laying the foundations of buildings in the New Town was dumped on the site of the [[loch]] to create the slope connecting the Old and New Towns known as [[The Mound]].

In the middle of the 19th century the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and [[Royal Scottish Academy Building]] were built on The Mound, and tunnels for the railway line between [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket]] and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Waverley]] stations were driven through it.

The Southside is a popular residential part of the city, which includes the districts of St Leonards, [[Marchmont]], [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]], [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]], [[Sciennes]], [[The Grange, Edinburgh|the Grange]] and [[Blackford, Edinburgh|Blackford]]. The Southside is broadly analogous to the area covered formerly by the [[Burgh Muir]], and grew in popularity as a residential area after the opening of the [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|South Bridge]] in the 1780s. The Southside is particularly popular with families (many state and private schools are here), young professionals and students (the central University of Edinburgh campus is based around [[George Square, Edinburgh|George Square]] just north of Marchmont and [[The Meadows (park)|the Meadows]]), and [[Napier University]] (with major campuses around Merchiston and Morningside). The area is also well provided with hotel and &quot;bed and breakfast&quot; accommodation for visiting festival-goers. These districts often feature in works of fiction. For example, [[Church Hill, Edinburgh|Church Hill]] in Morningside, was the home of [[Muriel Spark]]'s Miss Jean Brodie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |publisher=geraldinemcewan.com |accessdate=9 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209070917/http://www.geraldinemcewan.com/JeanBrodie.html |archive-date=9 February 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ian Rankin]]'s [[Inspector Rebus]] lives in Marchmont and works in St Leonards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |title=Inspector Rebus Novels |publisher=ianrankin.net |accessdate=9 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303085742/https://www.ianrankin.net/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=12 |archivedate=3 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leith]] was historically the port of Edinburgh, an arrangement of unknown date that was confirmed by the royal charter Robert the Bruce granted to the city in 1329.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edinburgh Corporation |title=Edinburgh 1329–1929, Sexcentenary of Bruce Charter |year=1929 |publisher=Oliver And Boyd |location=Edinburgh |isbn= |page=xxvii }}&lt;/ref&gt; The port developed a separate identity from Edinburgh, which to some extent it still retains, and it was a matter of great resentment when the two burghs merged in 1920 into the City of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/33.htm|title=The Story of Leith XXXIII.

With the redevelopment, Edinburgh has gained the business of cruise liner companies which now provide cruises to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The coastal suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] is characterised by Georgian villas, Victorian tenements, a popular beach and [[promenade]] and cafés, bars, restaurants and independent shops. There are rowing and sailing clubs and a restored Victorian swimming pool, including [[Turkish bath]]s.

The [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Settlements|urban area]] of Edinburgh is almost entirely within the [[The City of Edinburgh Council|City of Edinburgh Council]] boundary, merging with [[Musselburgh]] in East Lothian. Towns within easy reach of the city boundary include [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]], [[Tranent]], [[Prestonpans]], [[Dalkeith]], [[Bonnyrigg]], [[Loanhead]], [[Penicuik]], [[Broxburn, West Lothian|Broxburn]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Dunfermline]].

Given Edinburgh's position between the coast and hills, it is renowned as &quot;the windy city&quot;, with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west, which is often associated with warm, unstable air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that can give rise to rainfall – although considerably less than cities to the west, such as Glasgow.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt; Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but considerably colder, and may be accompanied by [[haar (fog)|haar]], a persistent coastal fog. Vigorous Atlantic depressions, known as [[European windstorm]]s, can affect the city between October and May.&lt;ref name=&quot;temperature&quot;/&gt;

There is also a weather station in Gogarbank on the city's outskirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn|title=Edinburgh Gogarbank Climate Averages 1981–2010|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=11 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909205528/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/gcvw5vmsn|archive-date=9 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slightly inland station has a slightly wider temperature span between seasons, is cloudier and somewhat wetter, but differences are minor.

Edinburgh has a high proportion of young adults, with 19.5% of the population in their 20s (exceeded only by Aberdeen) and 15.2% in their 30s which is the highest in Scotland. The proportion of Edinburgh's population born in the UK fell from 92% to 84% between 2001 and 2011, while the proportion of White Scottish-born fell from 78% to 70%.

Some 13,000 people or 2.7% of the city's population are of [[Poles in the United Kingdom|Polish]] descent. 39,500 people or 8.2% of Edinburgh's population class themselves as Non-White which is an increase from 4% in 2001. Of the Non-White population, the largest group by far are [[Asian-Scots|Asian]], totalling 26,264 people. Within the Asian population, people of [[British Chinese|Chinese]] descent are now the largest sub-group, with 8,076 people, amounting to about 1.7% of the city's total population. The city's population of [[British Indian|Indian]] descent amounts to 6,470 (1.4% of the total population), while there are some 5,858 of [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] descent (1.2% of the total population). Although they account for only 1,277 people or 0.3% of the city's population, Edinburgh has the highest number and proportion of people of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] descent in Scotland. Over 7,000 people were born in African countries (1.6% of the total population) and nearly 7,000 in the Americas. With the notable exception of Inner London, Edinburgh has a higher number of people born in the United States (over 3,700) than any other city in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;edinburgh.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;

The proportion of people born outside the UK was 15.9% compared with 8% in 2001.

A census by the Edinburgh presbytery in 1592 recorded a population of 8,003 adults spread equally north and south of the High Street which runs along the spine of the ridge sloping down from the Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Michael |title=The Oxford Companion to Scottish History |url= |accessdate= |year=2001 |publisher=OUP Oxford |location= |isbn=978-0-19-969305-4 |page=219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th and 19th centuries, the population expanded rapidly, rising from 49,000 in 1751 to 136,000 in 1831, primarily due to migration from rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards2005&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} As the population grew, problems of overcrowding in the Old Town, particularly in the cramped [[tenement]]s that lined the present day Royal Mile and the [[Cowgate]], were exacerbated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards2005&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} Poor sanitary arrangements resulted in a high incidence of disease,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards2005&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} with outbreaks of [[cholera]] occurring in 1832, 1848 and 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Gilbert  |editor-first=W M |title= Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century |year=1967 |publisher=J &amp; R Allan Ltd. |location= Edinburgh |origyear= 1901 |pages=95, 120, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the New Town from 1767 onwards witnessed the migration of the professional and business classes from the difficult living conditions in the Old Town to the lower density, higher quality surroundings taking shape on land to the north.
&lt;ref name=&quot;etmoac46&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Edinburgh: The Making of a Capital City |last1=Edwards |first1=Brian |last2=Jenkins |first2=Paul |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7486-1868-2  |publisher= |page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion southwards from the Old Town saw more tenements being built in the 19th century, giving rise to [[Victorian era|Victorian]] suburbs such as [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]], Newington, Marchmont and Bruntsfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;etmoac46&quot;/&gt;

Early-20th-century population growth coincided with lower-density suburban development. As the city expanded to the south and west, detached and semi-detached villas with large gardens replaced tenements as the predominant building style. Nonetheless, the 2001 census revealed that over 55% of Edinburgh's population were still living in tenements or blocks of flats, a figure in line with other Scottish cities, but much higher than other British cities, and even central London.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwellings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318032701/http://download.edinburgh.gov.uk/Census_2001_City_Comparisons/CCTable4Dwellings.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |title=Edinburgh Comparisons – Dwellings |accessdate=8 February 2009 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early to mid 20th century the growth in population, together with slum clearance in the Old Town and other areas, such as [[Dumbiedykes]], [[Leith]], and [[Fountainbridge]], led to the creation of new estates such as [[Stenhouse, Edinburgh|Stenhouse]] and [[Saughton]], [[Craigmillar]] and [[Niddrie, Edinburgh|Niddrie]], [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]] and [[Muirhouse]], [[Piershill]], and [[Sighthill, Edinburgh|Sighthill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND |accessdate=9 February 2013 |publisher=localhistories.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117002911/http://localhistories.org/edinburgh.html |archive-date=17 January 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Edinburgh has entered into 14 international [[town twinning|twinning]] arrangements since 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh twinning&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/685/european_international_and_parliamentary_relations/3 |title=Twin and Partner Cities |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |accessdate=16 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614133841/http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/685/european_international_and_parliamentary_relations/3 |archivedate=14 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the arrangements are styled as 'Twin Cities' but the agreement with [[Kraków]] is designated as a 'Partner City',&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh twinning&quot;/&gt; and the agreement with [[Kyoto Prefecture]] is officially styled as a 'Friendship Link', reflecting its status as the only region to be twinned with Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh twinning&quot;/&gt;
