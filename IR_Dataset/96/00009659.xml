'''Endocarditis''' is an [[inflammation]] of the inner layer of the [[heart]], the [[endocardium]]. It usually involves the [[heart valve]]s. Other structures that may be involved include the [[interventricular septum]], the [[chordae tendineae]], the mural endocardium, or the surfaces of intracardiac devices. Endocarditis is characterized by lesions, known as ''[[Vegetation (pathology)|vegetations]]'', which is a mass of [[platelet]]s, [[fibrin]], [[microcolony|microcolonies]] of microorganisms, and scant inflammatory cells.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite book | vauthors= Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser S, Longo DL, Jameson JL | author3-link= Anthony Fauci | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] |date=May 2005 | pages = 731–40  | isbn = 978-0-07-139140-5 | oclc = 54501403| title-link= Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[subacute]] form of infective endocarditis, the vegetation may also include a center of [[granuloma|granulomatous tissue]], which may fibrose or calcify.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Mitchell RS, Kumar V, Robbins SL, Abbas AK, Fausto N |title=Robbins Basic Pathology |publisher=Saunders/Elsevier |edition= 8th |year=2007 |pages=406–8 |isbn=978-1-4160-2973-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways to classify endocarditis. The simplest classification is based on cause: either ''infective'' or ''non-infective'', depending on whether a [[microorganism]] is the source of the inflammation or not. Regardless, the diagnosis of endocarditis is based on clinical features, investigations such as an [[echocardiogram]], and [[blood culture]]s demonstrating the presence of endocarditis-causing microorganisms.

Signs and symptoms include fever, chills, sweating, malaise, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, [[splenomegaly]], flu-like feeling, cardiac murmur, heart failure, [[petechia]] (red spots on the skin), [[Osler's node]]s (subcutaneous nodules found on hands and feet), [[Janeway lesion]]s (nodular lesions on palms and soles), and [[Roth's spot]]s (retinal hemorrhages).

==Infective endocarditis==
{{main|Infective endocarditis}}
&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
Infective endocarditis is an [[infection]] of the [[endocardium|inner surface of the heart]], usually the [[heart valve|valves]].&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; Symptoms may include [[fever]], [[petechia|small areas of bleeding into the skin]], [[heart murmur]], feeling tired, and [[anemia|low red blood cells]].&lt;ref name=Mer2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Infective Endocarditis - Cardiovascular Disorders|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/en-ca/professional/cardiovascular-disorders/endocarditis/infective-endocarditis|website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|accessdate=11 December 2017|language=en-CA|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complications may include [[valvular insufficiency]], [[heart failure]], [[stroke]], and [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=Nj2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Njuguna|first1=B|last2=Gardner|first2=A|last3=Karwa|first3=R|last4=Delahaye|first4=F|title=Infective Endocarditis in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.|journal=Cardiology Clinics|date=February 2017|volume=35|issue=1|pages=153–163|doi=10.1016/j.ccl.2016.08.011|pmid=27886786|hdl=1805/14046}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause is typically a [[bacterial infection]] and less commonly a [[fungal infection]].&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; Risk factors include [[valvular heart disease]] including [[rheumatic disease]], [[congenital heart disease]], [[artificial valves]], [[hemodialysis]], [[intravenous drug use]], and [[electronic pacemaker]]s.&lt;ref name=Amb2017/&gt; The bacterial most commonly involved are [[streptococci]] or [[staphylococci]].&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and supported by [[blood cultures]] or [[ultrasound]].&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
The usefulness of [[antibiotics]] following [[dental procedure]]s for prevention is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cahill|first1=TJ|last2=Harrison|first2=JL|last3=Jewell|first3=P|last4=Onakpoya|first4=I|last5=Chambers|first5=JB|last6=Dayer|first6=M|last7=Lockhart|first7=P|last8=Roberts|first8=N|last9=Shanson|first9=D|last10=Thornhill|first10=M|last11=Heneghan|first11=CJ|last12=Prendergast|first12=BD|title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Heart|date=June 2017|volume=103|issue=12|pages=937–944|doi=10.1136/heartjnl-2015-309102|pmid=28213367|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/112532/7/Cahill_et_al_13_12_16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recommend them in those at high risk.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; Treatment is generally with [[intravenous antibiotics]].&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; The choice of antibiotics is based on the blood cultures.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; Occasionally [[heart surgery]] is required.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
The number of people affected is about 5 per 100,000 per year.&lt;ref name=Amb2017/&gt; Rates, however, vary between regions of the world.&lt;ref name=Amb2017/&gt; Males are affected more often than females.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt; The risk of death among those infected is about 25%.&lt;ref name=Amb2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ambrosioni|first1=J|last2=Hernandez-Meneses|first2=M|last3=Téllez|first3=A|last4=Pericàs|first4=J|last5=Falces|first5=C|last6=Tolosana|first6=JM|last7=Vidal|first7=B|last8=Almela|first8=M|last9=Quintana|first9=E|last10=Llopis|first10=J|last11=Moreno|first11=A|last12=Miro|first12=JM|last13=Hospital Clinic Infective Endocarditis|first13=Investigators|title=The Changing Epidemiology of Infective Endocarditis in the Twenty-First Century.|journal=Current Infectious Disease Reports|date=May 2017|volume=19|issue=5|pages=21|doi=10.1007/s11908-017-0574-9|pmid=28401448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment it is almost universally fatal.&lt;ref name=Mer2017/&gt;

==Non-infective endocarditis==
{{main|Noninfective endocarditis}}
[[Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis]] (NBTE) is most commonly found on previously undamaged valves.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  As opposed to infective endocarditis, the vegetations in NBTE are small, sterile, and tend to aggregate along the edges of the valve or the cusps.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  Also unlike infective endocarditis, NBTE does not cause an inflammation response from the body.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  NBTE usually occurs during a hypercoagulable state such as system-wide bacterial infection, or pregnancy, though it is also sometimes seen in patients with venous catheters.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  NBTE may also occur in patients with cancers, particularly mucinous adenocarcinoma&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; where [[Trousseau syndrome]] can be encountered. Typically NBTE does not cause many problems on its own, but parts of the vegetations may break off and embolize to the heart or brain, or they may serve as a focus where bacteria can lodge, thus causing infective endocarditis.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;

Another form of sterile endocarditis is termed [[Libman–Sacks endocarditis]]; this form occurs more often in patients with [[lupus erythematosus]] and is thought to be due to the deposition of immune complexes.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  Like NBTE, Libman-Sacks endocarditis involves small vegetations, while infective endocarditis is composed of large vegetations.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;  These immune complexes precipitate an inflammation reaction, which helps to differentiate it from NBTE.  Also unlike NBTE, Libman-Sacks endocarditis does not seem to have a preferred location of deposition and may form on the undersurfaces of the valves or even on the endocardium.&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;
