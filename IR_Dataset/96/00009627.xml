'''Elizabeth Barrett Browning''' (née '''Moulton-Barrett''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aʊ|n|ɪ|ŋ}}; 6 March 1806 – 29 June 1861) was an English poet of the [[Victorian era]], popular in Britain and the United States during her lifetime.

Born in [[County Durham]], the eldest of 12 children, Elizabeth Barrett wrote poetry from the age of eleven. Her mother's collection of her poems forms one of the largest [[extant literature|extant]] collections of [[juvenilia]] by any English writer. At 15 she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life she also developed lung problems, possibly [[tuberculosis]]. She took [[laudanum]] for the pain from an early age, which is likely to have contributed to her frail health. 

In the 1840s Elizabeth was introduced to literary society through her cousin, [[John Kenyon (patron)|John Kenyon]]. Her first adult collection of poems was published in 1838 and she wrote prolifically between 1841 and 1844, producing poetry, translation and prose. She campaigned for [[Abolitionism in the United States|the abolition of slavery]] and her work helped influence reform in the [[Factories Act 1847|child labour legislation]]. Her prolific output made her a rival to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] as a candidate for [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] on the death of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]].

Elizabeth's volume ''Poems'' (1844) brought her great success, attracting the admiration of the writer [[Robert Browning]]. Their correspondence, courtship and marriage were carried out in secret, for fear of her father's disapproval. Following the wedding she was indeed disinherited by her father. The couple moved to Italy in 1846, where she would live for the rest of her life. They had one son, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning]], whom they called Pen. She died in [[Florence]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/152 Poets.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; A collection of her last poems was published by her husband shortly after her death.

Elizabeth's work had a major influence on prominent writers of the day, including the American poets [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Emily Dickinson]]. She is remembered for such poems as &quot;[[Sonnets from the Portuguese#Number 43|How Do I Love Thee?]]&quot; (Sonnet 43, 1845) and ''[[Aurora Leigh]] ''(1856).

==Life and career==
===Family background===
&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE: The repetition of &quot;Barrett&quot; is *not* an error --&gt;
Some of Elizabeth Barrett's family had lived in [[Jamaica]] since 1655. Their wealth derived mainly from Edward Barrett (1734–1798), owner of {{convert|10000|acre|ha}} in the estates of [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|Cinnamon Hill]], [[Cornwall County, Jamaica|Cornwall]], [[Cambridge, Jamaica|Cambridge]] and Oxford in northern Jamaica. Elizabeth's maternal grandfather owned [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], [[sugar cane mill|mills]], glassworks and ships that traded between Jamaica and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Biographer Julia Markus states the poet &quot;believed that she had African blood through her grandfather Charles Moulton&quot;, but&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JnOSQ7xrcA8C&amp;pg=PA97|date=May 1995|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence of this – although other branches of her family had African blood through relationships between plantation owners and [[slavery|slaves]]. What the family believed to be their genealogy in relation to Jamaica is unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;&gt;Marjorie Stone, &quot;Browning, Elizabeth Barrett (1806–1861)&quot;, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family wished to hand down their name, stipulating that Barrett should always be held as a surname. In some cases inheritance was given on condition that the name was used by the beneficiary; the English gentry and &quot;squirearchy&quot; had long encouraged [[Name change#Historical usage|this sort of name changing]]. Given this strong tradition, Elizabeth used &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett&quot; on legal documents and before she was married often signed herself &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Barrett&quot; or &quot;EBB&quot; (initials which she was able to keep after her wedding).&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

Elizabeth's father chose to raise his family in England while his business enterprises remained in Jamaica. The fortune of Elizabeth's mother's line, the Graham Clarke family, also derived in part from slave labour, and was considerable.

===Early life===
Elizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett was born on 6 March 1806, in Coxhoe Hall, between the villages of [[Coxhoe]] and [[Kelloe]] in County Durham, England. Her parents were Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett and Mary Graham Clarke; Elizabeth was the eldest of 12 children (eight boys and four girls). All lived to adulthood except for one girl, who died at the age of three, when Elizabeth was eight.

The children all had nicknames: Elizabeth was &quot;Ba&quot;. She rode her pony, went for family walks and picnics, socialised with other county families, and participated in home theatrical productions. But unlike her siblings, she immersed herself in books as often as she could get away from the social rituals of her family.

She was baptized in 1809 at Kelloe parish church, although she had&lt;ref&gt;Taplin, Gardner B. &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Browning.&quot; Victorian Poets Before 1850. Ed. William E. Fredeman and Ira Bruce Nadel. Detroit: Gale Research, 1984. ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' Vol. 32. Literature Resource Center. Web. 7 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; already been baptised by a family friend in her first week of life.

In 1809, the family moved to Hope End, a {{convert|500|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate near the [[Malvern Hills]] in [[Ledbury]], Herefordshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; Her father converted the Georgian house into stables and built a new mansion of opulent Turkish design, which his wife described as something from the ''Arabian Nights Entertainments''.

The interior's brass balustrades, mahogany doors inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and finely carved fireplaces were eventually complemented by lavish landscaping: ponds, grottos, kiosks, an ice house, a hothouse, and a subterranean passage from house to gardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, Beverly 1999&quot;&gt;Taylor, Beverly. &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Browning.&quot; Victorian Women Poets. Ed. William B. Thesing. Detroit: Gale Research, 1999. ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'' Vol. 199. Literature Resource Center. Web. 5 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Her time at Hope End would inspire her in later life to write her most ambitious work, ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), which went through more than 20 editions by 1900, but none between 1905 and 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, Beverly 1999&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Barrett Browning 2.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Elizabeth Barrett in her youth]]

She was educated at home and tutored by Daniel McSwiney with her oldest brother.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Mermin (1989), ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning: The Origins of a New Poetry', University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226520391}}, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; She began writing verses at the age of four.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning, Elizabeth Barrett 2005&quot;&gt;&quot;Browning, Elizabeth Barrett: Introduction.&quot; Jessica Bomarito and Jeffrey W. Hunter (eds). ''Feminism in Literature: A Gale Critical Companion''. Vol. 2: 19th Century, Topics &amp; Authors (A-B). Detroit: Gale, 2005. 467–469. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 7 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Hope End period, she was an intensely studious, precocious child.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Taplin, Gardner B. ''The Life of Elizabeth Browning'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that at the age of six she was reading novels, at eight entranced by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]]'s translations of [[Homer]], studying Greek at ten, and at eleven writing her own [[Homeric epic]], ''[[The Battle of Marathon: A Poem]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

In 1820 Mr Barrett privately published ''The Battle of Marathon'', an epic-style poem, though all copies remained within the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Browning, Elizabeth Barrett 2005&quot;/&gt; Her mother compiled the child's poetry into collections of &quot;Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett&quot;. Her father called her the &quot;[[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] of Hope End&quot; and encouraged her work. The result is one of the largest collections of juvenilia of any English writer. [[Mary Russell Mitford]] described the young Elizabeth at this time, as having &quot;a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face; large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam.&quot;

At about this time, Elizabeth began to battle with illness, which the medical science of the time was unable to diagnose.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; All three sisters came down with the syndrome although it lasted only with Elizabeth. She had intense head and spinal pain with loss of mobility. Various biographies link this to a riding accident at the time (she fell while trying to dismount a horse), but there is no evidence to support the link.  Sent to recover at the Gloucester spa, she was treated – in the absence of symptoms supporting another diagnosis – for a spinal problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, Beverly 1999&quot;/&gt; Though this illness continued for the rest of her life, it is believed to be unrelated to the lung disease which she developed in 1837.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

She began to take opiates for the pain, [[laudanum]] (an [[opium]] concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use from an early age may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this may also have contributed to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayter, Alethea (1962). ''Mrs. Browning: a poet's work and its setting''. Faber and Faber, pp. 61–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1821 she had read [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), and become a passionate supporter of Wollstonecraft's ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; The child's intellectual fascination with the classics and metaphysics was reflected in a religious intensity which she later described as &quot;not the deep persuasion of the mild Christian but the wild visions of an enthusiast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Everett, Glenn (2002). ''Life of Elizabeth Browning''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Barretts attended services at the nearest [[Dissenter|Dissenting]] chapel, and Edward was active in Bible and [[Missionary#The British missionary societies|Missionary societies]].

[[File:Panasonic GM5 black 8GB 13 1040230.JPG|thumb|upright|Blue plaque outside &quot;Belle Vue&quot; in [[Sidmouth]], Devon, where Elizabeth Barrett lived with her family from 1833 to 1835]]

Elizabeth's mother died in 1828, and is buried at St Michael's Church, Ledbury, next to her daughter Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth's aunt, helped to care for the children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth's strong will. In 1831 Elizabeth's grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and put up for sale to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted by the idea that they might have to move to Jamaica.

Between 1833 and 1835, she was living, with her family, at Belle Vue in Sidmouth. The site has now been renamed Cedar Shade and redeveloped. A blue plaque at the entrance to the site attests to this. In 1838, some years after the sale of Hope End, the family settled at 50 [[Wimpole Street]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

During 1837–38 the poet was struck with illness again, with symptoms today suggesting [[Tuberculosis|tuberculous]] ulceration of the lungs. That same year, at her physician's insistence, she moved from London to [[Torquay]], on the Devonshire coast.  Two tragedies then struck. In February 1840 her brother Samuel died of a fever in Jamaica.  Then her favourite brother Edward (&quot;Bro&quot;) was drowned in a sailing accident in Torquay in July. This had a serious effect on her already fragile health. She felt guilty as her father had disapproved of Edward's trip to Torquay. She wrote to Mitford, &quot;That was a very near escape from madness, absolute hopeless madness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; The family returned to Wimpole Street in 1841.

At Wimpole Street Barrett Browning spent most of her time in her upstairs room. Her health began to improve, though she saw few people other than her immediate family.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; One of those was Kenyon, a wealthy friend of the family and patron of the arts. She received comfort from a spaniel named Flush, a gift from Mary Mitford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond, Meredith, and Mary Rose Sullivan, eds.&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|author2=Mary Rose Sullivan|title=The letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to Mary Russell Mitford, 1836–1854|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersofelizabe0001brow|url-access=registration|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=1983|publisher=Armstrong Browning Library of Baylor University|isbn=978-0-911459-00-5|author3=Mary Russell Mitford|author4=Meredith B. Raymond}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Virginia Woolf]] later fictionalised the life of the dog, making him the protagonist of her 1933 novel ''[[Flush: A Biography]]'').

Between 1841 and 1844 Barrett Browning was prolific in poetry, translation and prose. The poem &quot;[[The Cry of the Children (poem)|The Cry of the Children]]&quot;, published in 1842 in ''[[Blackwoods Magazine|Blackwoods]]'', condemned child labour and helped bring about child-labour reforms by raising support for [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s [[Factories Act 1847|Ten Hours Bill]] (1844).&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; At about the same time, she contributed critical prose pieces to Richard Henry Horne's ''A New Spirit of the Age''.

In 1844 she published two volumes of ''Poems'', which included &quot;A Drama of Exile&quot;, &quot;A Vision of Poets&quot;, and &quot;Lady Geraldine's Courtship&quot; and two substantial critical essays for 1842 issues of ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]''. &quot;Since she was not burdened with any domestic duties expected of her sisters, Barrett Browning could now devote herself entirely to the life of the mind, cultivating an enormous correspondence, reading widely&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollock, Mary Sanders 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Sanders Pollock|title=Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning: a creative partnership|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IfuY5sdwphYC|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3328-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her prolific output made her a rival to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] as a candidate for poet laureate in 1850 on the death of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

===Robert Browning and Italy===

Her 1844 volume ''Poems'' made her one of the most popular writers in the country, and inspired [[Robert Browning]] to write to her.  He wrote, &quot;I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett,&quot; praising their &quot;fresh strange music, the affluent language, the exquisite pathos and true new brave thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

Kenyon arranged for Browning to meet Elizabeth on 20 May 1845, in her rooms, and so began one of the most famous courtships in literature. Elizabeth had already produced a large amount of work, but Browning had a great influence on her subsequent writing, as did she on his: two of Barrett's most famous pieces were written after she met Browning, ''[[Sonnets from the Portuguese]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Burr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|title=Sonnets from the Portuguese: A Celebration 0f Love|date=15 August 1986|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-74501-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sonnetsfromportu00brow_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Aurora Leigh.'' Robert's ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' is also a product of that time.

Some critics state that her activity was, in some ways, in decay before she met Browning: &quot;Until her relationship with [[Robert Browning]] began in 1845, Barrett's willingness to engage in public discourse about social issues and about aesthetic issues in poetry, which had been so strong in her youth, gradually diminished, as did her physical health. As an intellectual presence and a physical being, she was becoming a shadow of herself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollock, Mary Sanders 2003&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Lettre de Robert Browning à Elizabeth Barrett Browning datée en 1846.jpg|left|thumb|Letter from [[Robert Browning]] to Elizabeth Barrett, 10 September 1846]]

The courtship and marriage between Robert Browning and Elizabeth were carried out secretly, as she knew her father would disapprove. After a private marriage at [[St Marylebone Parish Church]], they honeymooned in Paris before moving to Italy, in September 1846, which became their home almost continuously until her death. Elizabeth's loyal nurse, Wilson, who witnessed the marriage, accompanied the couple to Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

Mr Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did each of his children who married. Elizabeth had foreseen her father's anger but had not anticipated her brothers' rejection.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; As Elizabeth had some money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy. The Brownings were well respected, and even famous. Elizabeth grew stronger and in 1849, at the age of 43, between four miscarriages, she gave birth to a son, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning]], whom they called Pen. Their son later married, but had no legitimate children.

At her husband's insistence, Elizabeth's second edition of ''Poems'' included her love sonnets; as a result, her popularity increased (as well as critical regard), and her artistic position was confirmed.

The couple came to know a wide circle of artists and writers including [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], sculptor [[Harriet Hosmer]] (who, she wrote, seemed to be the &quot;perfectly emancipated female&quot;) and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. In 1849 she met [[Margaret Fuller]], and the female French novelist [[George Sand]] in 1852, whom she had long admired. Among her intimate friends in Florence was the writer [[Isa Blagden]], whom she encouraged to write novels.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Isa Blagden&quot;, in: ''The Brownings' Correspondence''. [http://www.browningscorrespondence.com/biographical-sketches/?id=123. Retrieved 13 May 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; They met [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] in Paris, and [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], [[Samuel Rogers]] and the Carlyles in London, later befriending [[Charles Kingsley]] and [[John Ruskin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

===Decline and death===
[[File:Tomb - Elizabeth Barrett Browning.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth Barrett Browning's tomb, [[English Cemetery, Florence]]. 2007]]

After the death of an old friend, G. B. Hunter, and then of her father, Barrett Browning's health started to deteriorate. The Brownings moved from [[Florence]] to [[Siena]], residing at the ''Villa Alberti''. Engrossed in Italian politics, she issued a small volume of political poems titled ''Poems before Congress'' (1860) &quot;most of which were written to express her sympathy with [[Risorgimento|the Italian cause]] after [[Second Italian War of Independence|the outbreak of fighting in 1859]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson&quot;/&gt; They caused a furore in England, and the conservative magazines ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' labelled her a fanatic. She dedicated this book to her husband. Her last work was ''A Musical Instrument'', published posthumously.

Barrett Browning's sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple spent the winter of 1860–61 in Rome where Barrett Browning's health further deteriorated and they returned to Florence in early June 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; She became gradually weaker, using morphine to ease her pain. She died on 29 June 1861 in her husband&lt;nowiki&gt;'s arms. Browning said that she died &quot;smilingly, happily, and with a face like a girl's.... Her last word was... ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Beautiful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; She was buried in the Protestant [[English Cemetery of Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetsgraves.co.uk/barrett-_browning.htm Poetsgraves.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;On Monday July 1 the shops in the area around Casa Guidi were closed, while Elizabeth was mourned with unusual demonstrations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The nature of her illness is still unclear. Some modern scientists speculate her illness may have been [[hypokalemic periodic paralysis]], a genetic disorder that causes weakness and many of the other symptoms she described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=A|author2=Weiss, EB|title=Of sad and wished-for years: Elizabeth Barrett Browning's lifelong illness|journal=Perspect Biol Med|date=Autumn 2011|volume=54|issue=4|pages=479–503|pmid=22019536|doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
[[File:ElizabethBarrettBrowning.jpg|thumb|right|An engraving of Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, published in ''Eclectic Magazine'']]
Barrett Browning's first known poem was written at the age of six or eight, &quot;On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VdJCp3RDkR0C&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=on%20the%20cruelty%20of%20forcement%20to%20man%2C%20elizabeth%20barrett|work =Elizbeth Barrett Browning Selected Poems|title=On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man Alluding to the Press Gang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript, which protests against [[impressment]], is currently in the [[Berg Collection]] of the [[New York Public Library]]; the exact date is controversial because the &quot;2&quot; in the date 1812 is written over something else that is scratched out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|title=&quot;The&quot; works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning|year=2010|isbn=978-1-85196-900-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first independent publication was &quot;Stanzas Excited by Reflections on the Present State of Greece&quot; in ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' of May 1821;&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; followed two months later by &quot;Thoughts Awakened by Contemplating a Piece of the Palm which Grows on the Summit of the Acropolis at Athens&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson&quot;/&gt;

Her first collection of poems, ''An Essay on Mind, with Other Poems,'' was published in 1826 and reflected her passion for Byron and Greek politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson&quot;/&gt; Its publication drew the attention of a blind scholar of the Greek language, [[Hugh Stuart Boyd]], and of another Greek scholar, [[Uvedale Price]], with whom she maintained sustained correspondence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; Among other neighbours was Mrs James Martin from Colwall, with whom she also corresponded throughout her life. Later, at Boyd's suggestion, she translated [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (published in 1833; retranslated in 1850). During their friendship Barrett studied Greek literature, including [[Homer]], [[Pindar]] and [[Aristophanes]].

Elizabeth opposed slavery and published two poems highlighting the barbarity of slavers and her support for the abolitionist cause: &quot;The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point&quot;; and &quot;A Curse for a Nation&quot;. In &quot;Runaway&quot; she describes a slave woman who is whipped, raped, and made pregnant as she curses the slavers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt; Elizabeth declared herself glad that the slaves were &quot;virtually free&quot; when the [[Emancipation Act]] abolishing slavery in British colonies was passed in 1833, despite the fact that her father believed that [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionism]] would ruin his business.

The date of publication of these poems is in dispute, but her position on slavery in the poems is clear and may have led to a rift between Elizabeth and her father. She wrote to [[John Ruskin]] in 1855 &quot;I belong to a family of West Indian slaveholders, and if I believed in curses, I should be afraid&quot;. After the [[Baptist War|Jamaican slave uprising]] of 1831–32, her father and uncle continued to treat the slaves humanely.

In London, John Kenyon, a distant cousin, introduced Elizabeth to literary figures including [[William Wordsworth]], [[Mary Russell Mitford]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Elizabeth continued to write, contributing &quot;The Romaunt of Margaret&quot;, &quot;The Romaunt of the Page&quot;, &quot;The Poet's Vow&quot; and other pieces to various periodicals. She corresponded with other writers, including [[Mary Russell Mitford]], who would become a close friend and who would support Elizabeth's literary ambitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONDB&quot;/&gt;

In 1838 ''The Seraphim and Other Poems'' appeared, the first volume of Elizabeth's mature poetry to appear under her own name.

''[[Sonnets from the Portuguese]]'' was published in 1850. There is debate about the origin of the title. Some say it refers to the series of sonnets of the 16th-century Portuguese poet [[Luís de Camões]]. However, &quot;my little Portuguese&quot; was a pet name that Browning had adopted for Elizabeth and this may have some connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Jennifer Kingma|title=Love and Marriage: How Biographical Interpretation affected the Reception of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's &quot;Sonnets from the Portuguese&quot; (1850)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ebb/wall1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=2 January 2015|quote=&quot;the title was actually a reference to a term of endearment Robert had for Elizabeth, my little Portuguese, a reference to her dark complexion&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verse-novel ''Aurora Leigh,'' her most ambitious and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems, appeared in 1856. It is the story of a female writer making her way in life, balancing work and love, and based on Elizabeth's own experiences. ''Aurora Leigh'' was an important influence on [[Susan B. Anthony]]'s thinking about the traditional roles of women, with regard to marriage versus independent individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alma Lutz| title=Susan B. Anthony Rebel, Crusader, Humanitarian|url=https://archive.org/details/susanbanthonyreb00lutz|url-access=registration|year=1959|publisher=Boston, Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[North American Review]]'' praised Elizabeth's poem: &quot;Mrs. Browning's poems are, in all respects, the utterance of a woman — of a woman of great learning, rich experience, and powerful genius, uniting to her woman's nature the strength which is sometimes thought peculiar to a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|title=Aurora Leigh, and other poems|year=2001|publisher=Women's Press|isbn=978-0-7043-3820-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual influence==
Much of Barrett Browning's work carries a religious theme. She had read and studied such works as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. She says in her writing, &quot;We want the sense of the saturation of Christ's blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the [[Sphinx]] of our humanity, expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among [[Byzantine literature|the Greek Christian poets]], something which would have been much with a stronger faculty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ebb/cornhill.html|title=Biog|publisher=Victorianweb.org|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that &quot;Christ's religion is essentially poetry – poetry glorified&quot;. She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.

She was interested in theological debate, had learned Hebrew and read the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda M. Lewis|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning's spiritual progress: face to face with God|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethbarrett00lewi|url-access=registration|accessdate=22 October 2011|date=January 1998|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0-8262-1146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her seminal ''Aurora Leigh'', for example, features religious imagery and allusion to the apocalypse. The critic Cynthia Scheinberg notes that female characters in ''Aurora Leigh'' and her earlier work &quot;The Virgin Mary to the Child Jesus&quot; allude to the female character Miriam from the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galchinsky 551–553&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women's Poetry and Religion in Victorian England: Jewish Identity and Christian Culture (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/victorian_studies/v045/45.3galchinsky.html|journal = Victorian Studies|date = 1 January 2003|issn = 1527-2052|pages = 551–553|volume = 45|issue = 3|doi = 10.1353/vic.2003.0122|first = Michael|last = Galchinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allusions to Miriam in both poems mirror the way in which Barrett Browning herself drew from Jewish history, while distancing herself from it, in order to maintain the public appearance of a Christian woman poet of the Victorian Age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galchinsky 551–553&quot;/&gt;

In the correspondence Barrett Browning kept with the Reverend William Merry from 1843 to 1844 on predestination and salvation by works, she identifies herself as a [[Congregationalist]]: &quot;I am not a Baptist — but a Congregational Christian, — in the holding of my private opinions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1057/9781403980892_11|chapter = &quot;Poetry is Where God is&quot;: The Importance of Christian Faith and Theology in Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Life and Work|title = Victorian Religious Discourse|pages = 235–252|year = 2004|last1 = Wörn|first1 = Alexandra M.

==Barrett Browning Institute==
In 1892, Ledbury, Herefordshire, held a design competition to build an Institute in honour of Barrett Browning. [[Brightwen Binyon]] beat 44 other designs. It was based on the timber-framed Market House, which was opposite the site. It was completed in 1896. However, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] was not impressed by its style. In 1938, it became a public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barrett Browning Institute|url=http://www.victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk/explore/items/barrett-browning-institute |publisher=victoriacountyhistory.ac.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been [[Listed building#England and Wales|Grade II-listed]] since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barrett Browning Institute, Ledbury|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-502783-barrett-browning-institute-ledbury-|publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote  =&lt;poem&gt;
'''How Do I Love Thee?'''

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
:Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
:I shall but love thee better after death.

Barrett Browning was widely popular in the United Kingdom and the United States during her lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burr&quot;/&gt; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was inspired by her poem ''Lady Geraldine's Courtship'' and specifically borrowed the poem's metre for his poem ''[[The Raven]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawn B. Sova|title=Edgar Allan Poe, A-Z: The Essential Reference to His Life and Work|year=2001|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=978-0-8160-4161-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/edgarallanpoetoz0000sova}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe had reviewed Barrett Browning's work in the January 1845 issue of the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'', saying that &quot;her poetic inspiration is the highest – we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Meyers|title=Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy|date=5 September 2000|publisher=Cooper Square Press|isbn=978-0-8154-1038-6|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, she praised ''[[The Raven]]'', and Poe dedicated his 1845 collection ''The Raven and Other Poems'' to her, referring to her as &quot;the noblest of her sex&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dwight Thomas|author2=David Kelly Jackson|title=Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe, 1809–1849|date=1 September 1995|publisher=G K Hall|isbn=978-0-7838-1401-8|page=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett Browning's poetry greatly influenced [[Emily Dickinson]], who admired her as a woman of achievement. Her popularity in the United States and Britain was further advanced by her stands against social injustice, including slavery in the United States, injustice toward Italian citizens by foreign rulers, and child labour.

[[Lilian Whiting]] published a biography of Barrett Browning (1899) which describes her as &quot;the most philosophical poet&quot; and depicts her life as &quot;a Gospel of applied Christianity&quot;. To Whiting, the term &quot;art for art's sake&quot; did not apply to Barrett Browning's work, as each poem, distinctively purposeful, was borne of a more &quot;honest vision&quot;. In this critical analysis, Whiting portrays Barrett Browning as a poet who uses knowledge of Classical literature with an &quot;intuitive gift of spiritual divination&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whiting&quot;&gt;Whiting, Lilian. ''A study of Elizabeth Barrett Browning''. Little, Brown and Company (1899)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning'', Angela Leighton suggests that the portrayal of Barrett Browning as the &quot;pious iconography of womanhood&quot; has distracted us from her poetic achievements. Leighton cites the 1931 play by [[Rudolf Besier]], ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', as evidence that 20th-century literary criticism of Barrett Browning's work has suffered more as a result of her popularity than poetic ineptitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leighton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela Leighton|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethbarrett00leig|url-access=registration|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-25451-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/elizabethbarrett00leig/page/8 8]–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was popularized by actress [[Katharine Cornell]], for whom it became a signature role. It was an enormous success, both artistically and commercially, and was revived several times and adapted twice into movies.

Throughout the 20th century, literary criticism of Barrett Browning's poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the women's movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women's rights principles, suggesting in letters to [[Mary Russell Mitford]] and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In ''Aurora Leigh'', however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she &quot;is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes...&quot;&lt;ref name=Leighton/&gt; A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donaldson&quot;/&gt;
