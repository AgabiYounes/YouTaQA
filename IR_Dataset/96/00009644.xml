The '''European Environment Agency''' ('''EEA''') is the [[agency of the European Union]] (EU) which provides independent information on the environment.

==Definition==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the [[agency of the European Union]] (EU) which provides independent information on the environment. 
Its goal is to help those involved in developing, implementing and evaluating [[environmental policy]], and to inform the general public.

==Organization==
The EEA was established by the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) Regulation 1210/1990 (amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999 and EC Regulation 401/2009) and became operational in 1994,  headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

The agency is governed by a management board composed of representatives of the governments of its 33 member states, a [[European Commission]] representative and two scientists appointed by the [[European Parliament]], assisted by a committee of scientists.
The current Executive Director of the agency is Professor [[Hans Bruyninckx]], who has been appointed for a five-year term. He is the successor of Professor [[Jacqueline McGlade]].

==Member countries==
The [[Member states of the European Union|member states]] of the union are members; however other states may become members of it by means of agreements concluded between them and the EU.

It was the first EU body to open its membership to the 13 candidate countries (pre-[[enlargement of the EU|2004 enlargement]]).

The EEA has 33 member countries and six cooperating countries. The 33 member countries include the 27 [[European Union member state]]s together with [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Turkey]].

The six [[Western Balkans|Western Balkan]] countries are cooperating countries: [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]] as well as [[Kosovo]] under the [[UN Security Council]] Resolution 1244/99.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/countries-and-eionet Countries and Eionet], European Environment Agency, Retrieved on 24 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These cooperation activities are integrated into Eionet and are supported by the EU under the &quot;Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance&quot;.

The EEA is an active member of the [[EPA Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epanet.ew.eea.europa.eu/ European Network of the Heads of Environment Protection Agencies.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reports ==
The European Environment Agency (EEA) reported in 2017 that climate-related extreme events accounted ca €400 billion ($430 billion) of economic losses in EEA area from 1980 to 2013, and were responsible for 85,000 deaths during 1980-2013.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Chestney [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-climatechange-idUSKBN15912K South, southeast face Europe's most adverse climate change impact: agency]  Reuters, January 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==European environment information and observation network==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}} 
{{unreferenced section |date=July 2018}} 
The European environment information and observation network (Eionet) is a partnership network of the EEA and the countries. The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities. To do so, the EEA works closely together with national focal points (NFP´s), typically national environment agencies or environment ministries which are responsible for coordinating national networksof the National Reference Centres (NRCs) involving many institutions (about 350 in all).

Apart from the NFPs and NRCs, Eionet covers six European Topic Centres (ETCs) in the areas of air and climate change, biological diversity, climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, water, land use and spatial information and analysis and [[sustainable consumption]] and production.

==Annual discharge process==
In February 2012, the [[European Parliament]]'s Committee on Budgetary Control published a draft report, identifying areas of concern in the use of funds and its influence for the 2010 budget such as a 26%  budget increase  from 2009 to 2010 to €50 600 000.&lt;ref name= budg&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120215ATT38159/20120215ATT38159EN.pdf Draft Report on discharge on the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2010] 14 pages, 6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} and questioned that maximum competition and value-for-money principles were honored in hiring, also possible fictitious employees.&lt;ref name= budg/&gt;{{rp|10}}

The EEA's Executive Director refuted allegations of irregularities in a public hearing.&lt;ref&gt;Valentina Pop [http://euobserver.com/18/115429 EU agencies rebuked over spending] 2 March 2012. EU Observer website.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2012 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted on the report &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/organes/cont/cont_20120327_1500.htm Agenda for March 27, 2011 meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control.]&lt;/ref&gt; and commended the cooperation between the Agency and NGOs working in the environmental area.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} On 23 October 2012, the European Parliament voted and granted the discharge to the European Environment Agency for its 2010 budget.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In April 2013, the MEPs voted and granted the discharge to the EEA for its 2011 budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201305/20130523ATT66610/20130523ATT66610EN.pdf European Parliament.
