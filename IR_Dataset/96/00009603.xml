He performed the first artificially induced [[nuclear reaction]] in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. As a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which, in 1919, he called the &quot;hydrogen atom&quot; but, in 1920, he more accurately named the [[proton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/14786440608635919|title =Collision of α particles with light atoms.

Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge  in 1919. Under his leadership the [[neutron]] was discovered by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932 and in the same year the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under his direction, [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]]. After his death in 1937, he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] near [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s tomb. The chemical element [[rutherfordium]] (element 104) was named after him in 1997.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
[[File:Ernest Rutherford 1892.jpg|thumb|left|Rutherford aged 21]]
Ernest Rutherford was the son of James Rutherford, a farmer, and his wife Martha Thompson, originally from [[Hornchurch]], Essex, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=A.H.|last=McLintock|encyclopedia=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|title=Rutherford, Sir Ernest (Baron Rutherford of Nelson, O.M., F.R.S.)|edition=1966|date=18 September 2007|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/rutherford-sir-ernest/1|publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand| isbn=978-0-478-18451-8|accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; James had emigrated to New Zealand from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland, &quot;to raise a little [[flax]] and a lot of children&quot;. Ernest was born at [[Brightwater]], near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand. His first name was mistakenly spelled 'Earnest' when his birth was registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Rutherford, Ernest 1871–1937|id=3R37|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford's mother Martha Thompson was a schoolteacher.&lt;ref&gt;By J.L. Heilbron - ''Ernest Rutherford And the Explosion of Atoms'' - Oxford University Press - {{ISBN|0-19-512378-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[Havelock School, New Zealand|Havelock School]] and then [[Nelson College]] and won a [[Bursary|scholarship]] to study at [[University of Canterbury#History|Canterbury College]], [[University of New Zealand]], where he participated in the [[debating society]] and played [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=John|last=Campbell|encyclopedia=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|title=Rutherford, Ernest|date=30 October 2012|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/biographies/3r37/rutherford-ernest|publisher=Te Ara – The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining his BA, [[Master of Arts|MA]] and BSc, and doing two years of research during which he invented a new form of radio receiver, in 1895 Rutherford was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],&lt;ref&gt;1851 Royal Commission Archives&lt;/ref&gt; to travel to England for postgraduate study at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Venn&quot;&gt;{{acad|id=RTRT895E|name=Rutherford, Ernest}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first of the 'aliens' (those without a Cambridge degree) allowed to do research at the university, under the leadership of [[J. J. Thomson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;aps&quot;/&gt; which aroused jealousies from the more conservative members of the Cavendish fraternity. With Thomson's encouragement, he managed to detect radio waves at half a mile and briefly held the world record for the distance over which electromagnetic waves could be detected, though when he presented his results at the [[British Association]] meeting in 1896, he discovered he had been outdone by another lecturer, by the name of [[Guglielmo Marconi]].

In 1898, Thomson recommended Rutherford for a position at [[McGill University]] in Montreal, Canada. He was to replace [[Hugh Longbourne Callendar]] who held the [[William Christopher Macdonald|chair of Macdonald Professor of physics]] and was coming to Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford was accepted, which meant that in 1900 he could marry Mary Georgina Newton (1876–1954)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3r37/rutherford-ernest TEARA:The Encyclopedia of New Zealand] Story: Rutherford, Ernest&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bdmhistoricalrecords.dia.govt.nz Birth, Death and Marriage Historical Records, New Zealand Government] Registration number 1954/19483&lt;/ref&gt; to whom he had become engaged before leaving New Zealand; they married at [[St Paul's Anglican Church, Papanui]] in [[Christchurch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/560019/Family-history-in-from-the-cold |title=Family history in from the cold |date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Fiona|last=Summerfield|url=http://anglicantaonga.org.nz/news/tikanga_pakeha/new_lease_of_life_for_historic_chch_church|title=Historic St Paul's Church in the Christchurch suburb of Papanui is being fully restored|website=Anglican Taonga|date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had one daughter, Eileen Mary (1901–1930), who married [[Ralph Fowler]]. In 1901, he gained a [[DSc]] from the University of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Venn&quot;/&gt; In 1907, Rutherford returned to Britain to take the [[Chair (academic department)|chair]] of physics at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]].

===Later years and honours===
Rutherford was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=12647 |date=27 February 1914 |page=269 |city=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, he worked on a top secret project to solve the practical problems of submarine detection by [[sonar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-scientist-ernest-rutherford-revealed-8078891 |title=Manchester scientist Ernest Rutherford revealed as top secret mastermind behind sonar technology |author=Alan Selby |date=2014-11-09 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, he was awarded the [[Hector Memorial Medal]]. In 1919, he returned to the Cavendish succeeding J. J. Thomson as the Cavendish professor and Director. Under him, Nobel Prizes were awarded to [[James Chadwick]] for discovering the neutron (in 1932), [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] for an experiment which was to be known as ''splitting the atom'' using a [[particle accelerator]], and [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]] for demonstrating the existence of the [[ionosphere]]. In 1925, Rutherford pushed calls to the [[Government of New Zealand]] to support education and research, which led to the formation of the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)]] in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emma |last=Brewerton |date=2014-12-15 |title=Ernest Rutherford |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/ernest-rutherford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1925 and 1930, he served as [[President of the Royal Society]], and later as president of the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]] which helped almost 1,000 university refugees from Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;/&gt; He was appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in the [[1925 New Year Honours]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=14089 |date=2 January 1925 |page=4 |city=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised to the peerage as Baron Rutherford of Nelson, of Cambridge in the County of Cambridge in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=33683 |date=23 January 1931 |page=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; a title that became extinct upon his unexpected death in 1937. In 1933, Rutherford was one of the two inaugural recipients of the [[T. K. Sidey Medal]], set up by the [[Royal Society of New Zealand]] as an award for outstanding scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Background of the Medal |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/sidey-medal/background/ |publisher=[[Royal Society of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Recipients |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/awards/sidey-medal/recipients/ |publisher=[[Royal Society of New Zealand]] |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SirErnieWestminster.JPG|thumb|Lord Rutherford's grave in [[Westminster Abbey]]]]
For some time before his death, Rutherford had a small [[hernia]], which he had neglected to have fixed, and it became strangulated, causing him to be violently ill.  Despite an emergency operation in London, he died four days afterwards of what physicians termed &quot;intestinal paralysis&quot;, at Cambridge.&lt;ref name=compeerage&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII – Peerage Creations, 1901–1938|year=1949|publisher=St Catherine's Press|page=495}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]],&lt;ref name=compeerage /&gt;  he was given the high honour of burial in [[Westminster Abbey]], near [[Isaac Newton]] and other illustrious British scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron, J.

[[File:Ernest Rutherford 1905.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Ernest Rutherford at McGill University in 1905]]
At Cambridge, Rutherford started to work with [[J. J. Thomson]] on the conductive effects of X-rays on gases, work which led to the discovery of the [[electron]] which Thomson presented to the world in 1897. Hearing of [[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]]'s experience with [[uranium]], Rutherford started to explore its [[radioactivity]], discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power. Continuing his research in Canada, he coined the terms [[alpha ray]] and [[beta ray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trenn|first=Thaddeus J.|date=1976|title=Rutherford on the Alpha-Beta-Gamma Classification of Radioactive Rays|journal=Isis|volume=67|issue=1|pages=61–75|jstor=231134|doi=10.1086/351545}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of [[radioactivity|radiation]]. He then discovered that [[thorium]] gave off a gas which produced an emanation which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=2012-02-05|title=Rutherford, Radioactivity, and the Atomic Nucleus|eprint=1202.0954|class=physics.hist-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that a sample of this radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay – its &quot;[[half-life]]&quot; (11½ minutes in this case).

From 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations. Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named [[thoron]] (later found to be an isotope of [[radon]]). They also found another type of thorium they called Thorium X, and kept on finding traces of helium. They also worked with samples of &quot;Uranium X&quot; from [[William Crookes]] and [[radium]] from [[Marie Curie]].

In 1903, they published their &quot;Law of Radioactive Change,&quot; to account for all their experiments. Until then, atoms were assumed to be the indestructible basis of all matter and although Curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea. Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of atoms into other, as yet, unidentified matter. [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908] was awarded to Ernest Rutherford &quot;for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances&quot;.

In 1903, Rutherford considered a type of radiation discovered (but not named) by French chemist [[Paul Villard]] in 1900, as an emission from [[radium]], and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. Rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of [[gamma ray]]. All three of Rutherford's terms are in standard use today – other types of [[radioactive decay]] have since been discovered, but Rutherford's three types are among the most common.

In Manchester, he continued to work with alpha radiation. In conjunction with [[Hans Geiger]], he developed zinc sulfide [[zinc sulfide|scintillation screens]] and ionisation chambers to count alphas. By dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, Rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two. In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. As they [[atomic emission spectroscopy|sparked the tube into discharge]], the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. Eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei.

A long-standing myth existed, at least as early as 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nobel Prize for Physics : Prof. P. M. S. Blackett, F.R.S |journal=Nature |volume=162 |issue=4126 |year=1948 |pages=841 |doi=10.1038/162841b0|bibcode=1948Natur.162R.841. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exploring the atom |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/Resources/adventures_atom.htm |work=The Manhattan Project - Adventures Inside the Atom|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy - Office of History and Heritage Resources |accessdate=19 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; running at least to 2017, that Rutherford was the first scientist to observe and report an artificial [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of a stable element into another element: nitrogen into oxygen.

===Gold foil experiment===
[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|right|thumb|''Top:'' Expected results: [[alpha particle]]s passing through the [[plum pudding model]] of the atom undisturbed.&lt;br/&gt;
''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating [[Atomic nucleus|a small, concentrated charge]]. Diagram is not to scale; in reality the nucleus is vastly smaller than the electron shell.]]
Rutherford performed his most famous work after receiving the Nobel prize in 1908. Along with [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] in 1909, he carried out the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]], which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting [[alpha particles]] passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. Such deflections, though rare, were found, and proved to be a smooth but high-order function of the deflection angle. It was Rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom in 1911{{snd}}that a very small [[charge (physics)|charged]]&lt;ref name=charge /&gt; [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], containing much of the atom's mass, was [[orbit]]ed by low-mass [[electron]]s.

In 1919–1920, Rutherford found that nitrogen and other light elements ejected a proton, which he called a &quot;hydrogen atom&quot;, when hit with α (alpha) particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Atop the Physics Wave: Rutherford back in Cambridge, 1919–1937 |url=http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html |website=Rutherford's Nuclear World: The Story of the Discovery of the Nucleus |publisher=American Institute of Physics |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result showed Rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well). Such a construction had been suspected for many years on the basis of atomic weights which were whole numbers of that of hydrogen; see [[Prout's hypothesis]]. Hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei. Now, because of all these considerations, Rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known from the nucleus that was lighter. Thus, confirming and extending the work of [[Wilhelm Wien]] who in 1898 discovered the proton in streams of [[ionized gas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/andp.18943180404|title = Über positive Elektronen und die Existenz hoher Atomgewichte|journal = Annalen der Physik|volume = 318|issue = 4|pages = 669–677|year = 1904|last1 = Wien|first1 = W.|bibcode = 1904AnP...318..669W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford postulated the hydrogen nucleus to be a new particle in 1920, which he dubbed the ''[[proton]]''.

In 1921, while working with [[Niels Bohr]] (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), Rutherford theorized about the existence of [[neutron]]s, (which he had christened in his 1920 [[Bakerian Lecture]]), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of [[proton]]s by causing an attractive [[nuclear force]] and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of &quot;nuclear electrons&quot; which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons). But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery.

Rutherford's theory of [[neutron]]s was proved in 1932 by his associate [[James Chadwick]], who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

Rutherford is considered to have been among the greatest scientists in history. At the opening session of the 1938 Indian Science Congress, which Rutherford had been expected to preside over before his death, astrophysicist [[James Jeans]] spoke in his place and deemed him &quot;one of the greatest scientists of all time,&quot; saying:

{{quote|...In his flair for the right line of approach to a problem, as well as in the simple directness of his methods of attack, [Rutherford] often reminds us of Faraday, but he had two great advantages which Faraday did not possess, first, exuberant bodily health and energy, and second, the opportunity and capacity to direct a band of enthusiastic co-workers. Great though Faraday's output of work was, it seems to me that to match Rutherford's work in quantity as well as in quality, we must go back to Newton. In some respects he was more fortunate than Newton. Rutherford was ever the happy warrior - happy in his work, happy in its outcome, and happy in its human contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Viceroy Opens The Congress - Sir James Jeans's Address|url= |work=The Times |location=Calcutta |date=3 January 1938 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nuclear physics===
Rutherford's research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. [[Patrick Blackett]], a research fellow working under Rutherford, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated ''induced'' [[nuclear transmutation]]. Rutherford's team later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated ''artificially-induced'' nuclear reactions and transmutation. He is known as the father of nuclear physics. Rutherford died too early to see [[Leó Szilárd]]'s idea of controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]s come into being. However, a speech of Rutherford's about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed in 12 September 1933 London paper ''[[The Times]]'', was reported by Szilárd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Szilard had this idea while walking in London, on the same day.

Rutherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] in &quot;splitting&quot; lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today). Rutherford's speech in part, read:

{{quote|We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ The Times archives], 12 September 1933, &quot;The British association – breaking down the atom&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Incidences of cancer at Rutherford's former laboratory==
The Coupland Building at [[Manchester University]], at which Rutherford conducted many of his experiments, has been the subject of a [[cancer cluster]] investigation. There has been a statistically high incidence of [[pancreatic cancer]], [[brain cancer]], and [[motor neuron disease]] occurring in and around Rutherford's former laboratories and, since 1984, a total of six workers have been stricken with these ailments.  In 2009, an independent commission concluded that the very slightly elevated levels of various radiation related to Rutherford's experiments decades earlier are not the likely cause of such cancers and ruled the illnesses a coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/news.2009.965 |title= Rutherford Building cancers a 'coincidence' |journal= Nature |author= Brumfiel, Geoff |date= 30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
