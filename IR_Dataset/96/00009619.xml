==Characteristics==
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that [[microbial life]] has great flexibility for surviving in extreme environments—niches that are acidic or extraordinarily hot, for example—that would be completely inhospitable to [[complex organisms]]. Some scientists even concluded that life may have begun on Earth in [[hydrothermal vent]]s far under the ocean's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/merlaunch.pdf |title=Mars Exploration Rover Launches - Press kit |access-date=14 July 2009 |date=June 2003 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
There are many classes of extremophiles that range all around the globe; each corresponding to the way its environmental niche differs from mesophilic conditions.  These classifications are not exclusive. Many extremophiles fall under multiple categories and are classified as '''polyextremophiles'''. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are thermophilic and barophilic such as ''Thermococcus barophilus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marteinsson VT, Birrien JL, Reysenbach AL, Vernet M, Marie D, Gambacorta A, Messner P, Sleytr UB, Prieur D | title = Thermococcus barophilus sp. nov., a new barophilic and hyperthermophilic archaeon isolated under high hydrostatic pressure from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent | journal = International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology | volume = 49 Pt 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 351–9 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10319455 | doi = 10.1099/00207713-49-2-351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A polyextremophile living at the summit of a mountain in the [[Atacama Desert]] might be a [[radioresistant]] [[xerophile]], a [[psychrophile]], and an [[oligotroph]]. Polyextremophiles are well known for their ability to tolerate both high and low [[pH]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Yadav AN, Verma P, Kumar M, Pal KK, Dey R, Gupta A, Padaria JC, Gujar GT, Kumar S, Suman A, Prasanna R | display-authors = 6 |date=2014-05-31|title=Diversity and phylogenetic profiling of niche-specific Bacilli from extreme environments of India|journal=Annals of Microbiology|volume=65|issue=2|pages=611–629|doi=10.1007/s13213-014-0897-9| url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b86ec6f93e4c33e57ecdc0ce95a4df9b0072ed37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In astrobiology ==
[[Astrobiology]] is the study of the [[abiogenesis|origin]], [[evolution]], distribution, and future of [[life]] in the [[universe]]: [[extraterrestrial life]] and [[Earliest known life forms|life on Earth]]. Astrobiology makes use of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[solar physics]], [[biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[ecology]], [[planetary science]], [[geography]], and [[geology]] to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize [[biosphere]]s that might be different from that on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and death of planet Earth | vauthors = Ward PD, Brownlee D |date=2004 |publisher=Owl Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8050-7512-0 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrobiologists are particularly interested in studying extremophiles,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160912&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth | name-list-format = vanc |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth's Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Terrestrial analogue sites|their habitats may be analogous]] to conditions on other planets. For example, analogous deserts of [[Antarctica]] are exposed to harmful [[UV radiation]], low temperature, high salt concentration and low mineral concentration. These conditions are similar to those on [[Mars]]. Therefore, finding viable microbes in the subsurface of Antarctica suggests that there may be microbes surviving in [[Endolith|endolithic communities]] and living under the Martian surface. Research indicates it is unlikely that Martian microbes exist on the surface or at shallow depths, but may be found at subsurface depths of around 100 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Wynn-Williams DA, Newton EM, Edwards HG |title=Exo-/astro-biology : proceedings of the first European workshop, 21 - 23 May 2001, ESRIN, Fracscati, Italy|journal=Exo-/Astro-Biology|volume=496|date=2001|isbn=978-92-9092-806-5|page=226|bibcode=2001ESASP.496..225W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research carried out on extremophiles in [[Japan]] involved a variety of [[bacteria]] including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' being subject to conditions of extreme gravity. The bacteria were cultivated while being rotated in an [[ultracentrifuge]] at high speeds corresponding to 403,627 [[Gravity of Earth|g]] (i.e. 403,627 times the gravity experienced on Earth). ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' was one of the bacteria which displayed not only survival but also robust cellular growth under these conditions of hyperacceleration which are usually found only in cosmic environments, such as on very massive stars or in the shock waves of [[supernova]]s. Analysis showed that the small size of [[prokaryotic cell]]s is essential for successful growth under [[hypergravity]]. The research has implications on the feasibility of [[panspermia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/04/110425-gravity-extreme-bacteria-e-coli-alien-life-space-science/|title=Bacteria Grow Under 400,000 Times Earth's Gravity |author=Than, Ker |date=25 April 2011 |website=National Geographic- Daily News|publisher=National Geographic Society |access-date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deguchi S, Shimoshige H, Tsudome M, Mukai SA, Corkery RW, Ito S, Horikoshi K | title = Microbial growth at hyperaccelerations up to 403,627 x g | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 19 | pages = 7997–8002 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21518884 | pmc = 3093466 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1018027108 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/04/20/1018027108.abstract | bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.7997D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/07/harvard-study-suggests-asteroids-might-play-key-role-in-spreading-life/|title=Harvard study suggests asteroids might play key role in spreading life|last=Reuell|first=Peter|date=2019-07-08|website=Harvard Gazette|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery is significant because it indicates that not only bacterial spores, but also growing cells can be remarkably resistant to strong UV radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mastascusa V, Romano I, Di Donato P, Poli A, Della Corte V, Rotundi A, Bussoletti E, Quarto M, Pugliese M, Nicolaus B | title = Extremophiles survival to simulated space conditions: an astrobiology model study | journal = Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–7 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25573749 | pmc = 4669584 | doi = 10.1007/s11084-014-9397-y | bibcode = 2014OLEB...44..231M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2016, scientists from Brigham Young University conclusively reported that [[endospore]]s of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were able to survive high speed impacts up to 299±28&amp;nbsp;m/s, extreme shock, and extreme deceleration. They pointed out that this feature might allow endospores to survive and to be transferred between planets by traveling within meteorites or by experiencing atmosphere disruption. Moreover, they suggested that the landing of spacecraft may also result in interplanetary spore transfer, given that spores can survive high-velocity impact while ejected from the spacecraft onto the planet surface. This is the first study which reported that bacteria can survive in such high-velocity impact. However, the lethal impact speed is unknown, and further experiments should be done by introducing higher-velocity impact to bacterial endospores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Barney BL, Pratt SN, Austin DE |title=Survivability of bare, individual Bacillus subtilis spores to high-velocity surface impact: Implications for microbial transfer through space|journal=Planetary and Space Science|date=June 2016|volume=125|pages=20–26|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2016.02.010|bibcode=2016P&amp;SS..125...20B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples and recent findings==
New sub-types of -philes are identified frequently and the sub-category list for extremophiles is always growing. For example, microbial life lives in the liquid [[asphalt]] lake, [[Pitch Lake]]. Research indicates that extremophiles inhabit the asphalt lake in populations ranging between 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells/gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25051/ Microbial Life Found in Hydrocarbon Lake.] ''the physics arXiv blog'' 15 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulze-Makuch, Haque, Antonio, Ali, Hosein, Song, Yang, Zaikova, Beckles, Guinan, Lehto, Hallam. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2047 Microbial Life in a Liquid Asphalt Desert.]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, until recently [[boron]] tolerance was unknown but a strong borophile was discovered in bacteria. With the recent isolation of ''Bacillus boroniphilus'', borophiles came into discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahmed I, Yokota A, Fujiwara T | title = A novel highly boron tolerant bacterium, Bacillus boroniphilus sp. nov., isolated from soil, that requires boron for its growth | journal = Extremophiles | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–24 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17072687 | doi = 10.1007/s00792-006-0027-0 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/234b722a95086d87819469584642c6c0c9747460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying these borophiles may help illuminate the mechanisms of both boron toxicity and boron deficiency.

In July 2019, a scientific study of [[Kidd Mine]] in Canada discovered [[sulfur-breathing organisms]] which live 7900 feet below the surface, and which breathe sulfur in order to survive. These organisms are also remarkable due to eating rocks such as pyrite as their regular food source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01490451.2019.1641770?journalCode=ugmb20 ‘Follow the Water’: Hydrogeochemical Constraints on Microbial Investigations 2.4 km Below Surface at the Kidd Creek Deep Fluid and Deep Life Observatory], Garnet S.

The thermoalkaliphilic [[catalase]], which initiates the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, was isolated from an organism, ''[[Thermus brockianus]]'', found in [[Yellowstone National Park]] by [[Idaho National Laboratory]] researchers. The catalase operates over a temperature range from 30&amp;nbsp;°C to over 94&amp;nbsp;°C and a pH range from 6–10. This catalase is extremely stable compared to other catalases at high temperatures and pH. In a comparative study, the ''T. brockianus'' catalase exhibited a half life of 15 days at 80&amp;nbsp;°C and pH 10 while a catalase derived from ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' had a half life of 15 seconds under the same conditions. The catalase will have applications for removal of hydrogen peroxide in industrial processes such as pulp and paper bleaching, textile bleaching, food pasteurization, and surface decontamination of food packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/community/idaho_national_laboratory_biological_systems/352/bioenergy_and_industrial_microbiology/2660 |title=Bioenergy and Industrial Microbiology |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |website=Idaho National Laboratory |access-date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA transfer==
Over 65 prokaryotic species are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation, the ability to transfer DNA from one cell to another cell followed by integration of the donor DNA into the recipient cell's chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnsborg O, Eldholm V, Håvarstein LS | title = Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function | journal = Research in Microbiology | volume = 158 | issue = 10 | pages = 767–78 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17997281 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several extremophiles are able to carry out species-specific DNA transfer, as described below.  However, it is not yet clear how common such a capability is among extremophiles.

The bacterium ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' is one of the most radioresistant organisms known.  This bacterium can also survive cold, dehydration, vacuum and acid and is thus known as a polyextremophile.  ''D. radiodurans'' is competent to perform [[Transformation (genetics)|genetic transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moseley BE, Setlow JK | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 61 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–83 | date = September 1968 | pmid = 5303325 | pmc = 285920 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.61.1.176 | bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recipient cells are able to repair DNA damage in donor transforming DNA that had been UV irradiated as efficiently as they repair cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.  The extreme thermophilic bacterium ''Thermus thermophilus'' and other related ''Thermus'' species are also capable of genetic transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koyama Y, Hoshino T, Tomizuka N, Furukawa K | title = Genetic transformation of the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus and of other Thermus spp | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 166 | issue = 1 | pages = 338–40 | date = April 1986 | pmid = 3957870 | pmc = 214599 | doi = 10.1128/jb.166.1.338-340.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Halobacterium volcanii]]'', an extreme halophilic ([[salinity|saline]] tolerant) archaeon, is capable of natural genetic transformation.  Cytoplasmic bridges are formed between cells that appear to be used for DNA transfer from one cell to another in either direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenshine I, Tchelet R, Mevarech M | title = The mechanism of DNA transfer in the mating system of an archaebacterium | journal = Science | volume = 245 | issue = 4924 | pages = 1387–9 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2818746 | doi = 10.1126/science.2818746 | bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1387R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' and ''[[Sulfolobus acidocaldarius]]'' are hyperthermophilic archaea. Exposure of these organisms to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C induces species-specific cellular aggregation.&lt;ref name=Frols2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fröls S, Ajon M, Wagner M, Teichmann D, Zolghadr B, Folea M, Boekema EJ, Driessen AJ, Schleper C, Albers SV | title = UV-inducible cellular aggregation of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus is mediated by pili formation | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 938–52 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18990182 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2008.06459.x | displayauthors = etal | url = https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/uvinducible-cellular-aggregation-of-the-hyperthermophilic-archaeon-sulfolobus-solfataricus-is-mediated-by-pili-formation(0dd2a8eb-0f4b-4382-805d-158a870be95e).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ajon2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ajon M, Fröls S, van Wolferen M, Stoecker K, Teichmann D, Driessen AJ, Grogan DW, Albers SV, Schleper C | title = UV-inducible DNA exchange in hyperthermophilic archaea mediated by type IV pili | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 82 | issue = 4 | pages = 807–17 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21999488 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07861.x | displayauthors = etal | url = https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/6771142/2011MolMicrobiolAjon.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  UV-induced cellular aggregation of ''S. acidocaldarius'' mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency.&lt;ref name=Ajon2011 /&gt;  Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude.  Frols et al.&lt;ref name=Frols2008 /&gt; and Ajon et al.&lt;ref name=Ajon2011 /&gt; hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between ''Sulfolobus'' cells in order to repair damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination.  Van Wolferen et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Wolferen M, Ajon M, Driessen AJ, Albers SV | title = How hyperthermophiles adapt to change their lives: DNA exchange in extreme conditions | journal = Extremophiles | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 545–63 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23712907 | doi = 10.1007/s00792-013-0552-6 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50874cfec6f240318d301e55ab9d91264117f436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that this DNA exchange process may be crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperatures. It has also been suggested that DNA transfer in ''Sulfolobus'' may be an early form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that involve species-specific DNA transfer leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage (and see [[Transformation (genetics)]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

Extracellular membrane vesicles (MVs) might be involved in DNA transfer between different hyperthermophilic archaeal species.&lt;ref name=Gaudin_viral&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudin M, Krupovic M, Marguet E, Gauliard E, Cvirkaite-Krupovic V, Le Cam E, Oberto J, Forterre P | title = Extracellular membrane vesicles harbouring viral genomes | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 1167–75 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24034793 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that both [[plasmid]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudin M, Gauliard E, Schouten S, Houel-Renault L, Lenormand P, Marguet E, Forterre P | title = Hyperthermophilic archaea produce membrane vesicles that can transfer DNA | journal = Environmental Microbiology Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 109–16 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23757139 | doi = 10.1111/j.1758-2229.2012.00348.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and viral [[genome]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaudin_viral&quot; /&gt; can be transferred via MVs. Notably, a horizontal plasmid transfer has been documented between hyperthermophilic ''[[Thermococcus]]'' and ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'' species, respectively belonging to the orders ''Thermococcales'' and ''Methanococcales''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krupovic M, Gonnet M, Hania WB, Forterre P, Erauso G | title = Insights into dynamics of mobile genetic elements in hyperthermophilic environments from five new Thermococcus plasmids | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e49044 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23326305 | pmc = 3543421 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0049044 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...849044K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
