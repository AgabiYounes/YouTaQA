==History==
===Indigenous presence===

The first people to settle in the Eugene area were known as the [[Kalapuya]]ns, also written Calapooia or Calapooya. They made &quot;seasonal rounds,&quot; moving around the countryside to collect and preserve local foods, including acorns, the bulbs of the [[Sagittaria latifolia|wapato]] and [[Camassia|camas]] plants, and berries. They stored these foods in their permanent winter village. When crop activities waned, they returned to their winter villages and took up hunting, fishing, and trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/kalapuyans-seasonal-lifeways-tek-anthropolocene/|title=Kalapuyans: Seasonal Lifeways, Tek, Anthropocene|date=November 8, 2016|website=NDN History Research: Critical and Indigenous Anthropology|last1=Lewis, Ph.D|first1=David G.|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Oregonians|date=2007|publisher=Oregon Council for the Humanities|isbn=9781880377024|edition=2nd|location=Portland, Oregon|pages=307–315|last1=Berg|first1=Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were known as the Chifin Kalapuyans and called the Eugene area where they lived &quot;Chifin&quot;, sometimes recorded as &quot;Chafin&quot; or &quot;Chiffin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2016/05/23/chafin-band-reservation-and-village-1855/|title=Chafin Band Reservation and Village 1855|date=May 23, 2016|website=NDN History Research: Critical and Indigenous Anthropology|last1=Lewis, Ph.D.|first1=David G.|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springfield.k12.or.us/Page/738|title=Chifin Native Youth Center|last=|first=|date=|website=Springfield Public Schools|publisher=Springfield, Oregon, Public Schools|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Honey bee on camas 3.jpg|thumb|Camas flower]]
Other Kalapuyan tribes occupied villages that are also now within Eugene city limits. Pee-you or Mohawk Calapooians, Winefelly or Pleasant Hill Calapooians, and the Lungtum or Long Tom. They were close-neighbors to the Chifin, intermarried, and were political allies. Some authorities suggest the Brownsville Kalapuyans (Calapooia Kalapuyans) were related to the Pee-you. It is likely that since the Santiam had an alliance with the Brownsville Kalapuyans that the Santiam influence also went as far at Eugene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ndnhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/chifin-kalapuya-village/|title=Chifin Kalapuya Village|last=Lewis, Ph.D.|first=David G.|date=December 8, 2014|website=NDN History Research: Critical and Indigenous Anthropology|access-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to archeological evidence, the ancestors of the Kalapuyans may have been in Eugene for as long as 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kalapuyans: A Sourcebook on the Indians of the Willamette Valley|last=Mackey, Ph.D.|first=Harold|publisher=Mission Mill Museum Association, Inc.and the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde|year=2004|isbn=9780975348406|location=Salem, Oregon, and Grand Ronde, Oregon|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s their traditional way of life faced significant changes due to devastating epidemics and settlement, first by French fur traders and later by an overwhelming number of American settlers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth-Century Oregon, 1812-1859|last=Jette|first=Melinda Marie|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870715976|location=Corvallis, Oregon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North American fur trade|French fur traders]] had settled seasonally in the Willamette Valley by the beginning of the 19th century. Their settlements were concentrated in the &quot;French Prairie&quot; community in Northern Marion County but may have extended south to the Eugene area. Having already developed relationships with Native communities through intermarriage and trade, they negotiated for land from the Kalapuyans. By 1828 to 1830 they and their Native wives began year-round occupation of the land, raising crops and tending animals. In this process, the mixed race families began to impact Native access to land, food supply, and traditional materials for trade and religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859|last=Jette|first=Melinda Marie|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870715976|location=Corvallis, Oregon|pages= 12–61, p. 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1830, &quot;intermittent fever&quot; struck the lower Columbia region and a year later, the Willamette Valley. Natives traced the arrival of the disease, then new to the Northwest, to the U.S. ship, Owyhee, captained by John Dominis. &quot;Intermittent fever&quot; is thought by researchers now to be [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859|last=Jette|first=Melinda Marie|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870715976|location=Corvallis, Oregon|pages=61–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert T. Boyd, an anthropologist at Portland State University, the first three years of the epidemic, &quot;probably constitute the single most important epidemiological event in the recorded history of what would eventually become the state of Oregon&quot;.  In his book ''The Coming of the Spirit Pestilence'' Boyd reports there was a 92% population loss for the Kalapuyans between 1830 and 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859|last=Jette|first=Melinda Marie|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870715976|location=Corvallis, Oregon|pages=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This catastrophic event shattered the social fabric of Kalapuyan society and altered the demographic balance in the Valley. This balance was further altered over the next few years by the arrival of Anglo-American settlers, beginning in 1840 with 13 people and growing steadily each year until within 20 years more than 11,000 American settlers, including Eugene Skinner, had arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859|last=Jette|first=Melinda Marie|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870715976|location=Corvallis, Oregon|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the demographic pressure from the settlers grew, the remaining Kalapuyans were forcibly removed to [[Indian reservation]]s. Though some Natives escaped being swept into the reservation, most were moved to the [[Grand Ronde Community|Grand Ronde reservation]] in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest|last=Ruby|first=Robert, MD, John A.

Native Americans could not leave the reservation without traveling papers and white people could not enter the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Oregonians, Second Edition|last=Berg|first=Laura|publisher=Oregon Council for the Humanities|year=2007|isbn=9781880377024|location=Portland, Oregon|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugene Skinner|Eugene Franklin Skinner]], after whom Eugene is named, arrived in the [[Willamette Valley]] in 1846 with 1,200 other settlers that year.

The &quot;isolated hill&quot; is now known as [[Skinner Butte|Skinner's Butte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zenk|first=Henry|year=2008|title=Notes on Native American Place-names of the Willamette Valley Region|url=|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|volume=109|pages=6–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin was used as a [[trading post]] and was registered as an official post office on January 8, 1850.

At this time the settlement was known by Anglos as Skinner's Mudhole. It was relocated in 1853 and named Eugene City in 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Eugene-Oregon|title=Eugene, Oregon, United States|last=|first=|date=|website=www.britannica.com|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally incorporated as a city in 1862, it was named simply Eugene in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2010/09/founders_wife_suggests_unique.html|title=Founder's wife suggests unique name for city of Eugene|last=Terry|first=John|date=September 4, 2010|work=The Oregonian|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Skinner ran a ferry service across the [[Willamette River]] where the [[Ferry Street Bridge (Eugene, Oregon)|Ferry Street Bridge]] now stands.

=== Educational institutions ===

The first major educational institution in the area was [[Columbia College (Oregon)|Columbia College]], founded a few years earlier than the University of Oregon. It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again.&lt;ref name=&quot;ohq 1955&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Perry D.|date=December 1955|title=Columbia College 1856-60|journal=Oregon Historical Quarterly|publisher=Oregon Historical Society|volume=56|issue=4|pages=326–351|jstor=20612220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College. There is no college there today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Survey&quot;&gt;[http://02c9d6e.netsolhost.com/archive_docs/history_college_hill.html College Hill Neighborhood and History.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803054747/http://02c9d6e.netsolhost.com/archive_docs/history_college_hill.html |date=August 3, 2017 }} College Hill Cultural Resource Survey (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the University of Oregon, with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member [[James Henry Dickey Henderson|J.H.D. Henderson]] donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2012/11/university_of_oregon_history_i.html|title=University of Oregon history in a nutshell, from campus historian|last=Richard|first=Terry|last2=O'Neal|first2=Jennifer|date=2012-11-10|website=oregonlive|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president. The first students registered on October 16, 1876. The first building was completed in 1877; it was named Deady Hall in honor of the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge [[Matthew Deady|Matthew P. Deady]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uo&quot;&gt;[http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/deady.html Deady Hall: Architecture of the University of Oregon.] University of Oregon Libraries. Retrieved on January 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twentieth century ===

Eugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment. By 1985, the industry had recovered and Eugene began to attract more high-tech industries, earning it the moniker the &quot;Emerald Shire&quot;.

[[File:Eugene skyline crop.jpg|thumb|upright|450px|alt=The flat-roofed buildings of downtown Eugene in front of Spencer Butte, a prominent forested hill|[[Spencer Butte]] can be seen from much of the city.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|43.74|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|43.72|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.02|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 12, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene is at an elevation of {{convert|426|ft|0}}.

To the north of downtown is [[Skinner Butte]]. Northeast of the city is the [[Coburg Hills]]. [[Spencer Butte]] is a prominent landmark south of the city. [[Mount Pisgah (Lane County, Oregon)|Mount Pisgah]] is southeast of Eugene and includes [[Mount Pisgah Arboretum]] and [[Howard Buford Recreation Area]], a Lane County Park. Eugene is surrounded by foothills and forests to the south, east, and west, while to the north the land levels out into the Willamette Valley and consists of mostly farmland.

The [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[McKenzie River (Oregon)|McKenzie]] Rivers run through Eugene and its neighboring city, [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]]. Another important stream is [[Amazon Creek]], whose headwaters are near Spencer Butte. The creek discharges west of the city into [[Fern Ridge Reservoir]], maintained for winter flood control by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. The [[Eugene Yacht Club]] hosts a sailing school and sailing regattas at Fern Ridge during summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.eugeneyachtclub.org/|title = Eugene Yacht Club at Fern Ridge Lake|date = 2014|accessdate = August 10, 2014|website = Eugene Yacht Club|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the city council unanimously approved a new slogan for the city: &quot;World's Greatest City for the Arts &amp; Outdoors&quot;. While Eugene has a vibrant arts community for a city its size, and is well situated near many outdoor opportunities, this slogan was frequently criticized by locals as embarrassing and ludicrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last= Dietz|first= Diane|work= [[The Register-Guard]]|date= December 21, 2006|title= Not the World's Greatest Slogan?

All vendors must create or grow all their own products. The market reappears as the &quot;Holiday Market&quot; between Thanksgiving and New Year's in the Lane County Events Center at the fairgrounds.

===Community===
Eugene is noted for its &quot;community inventiveness.&quot; Many U.S. trends in community development originated in Eugene. The University of Oregon's participatory [[planning]] process, known as [[The Oregon Experiment]], was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by [[Christopher Alexander]], whose works also directly inspired the creation of the [[Wiki]]. Some research for the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', which inspired the [[Design Patterns]] movement and [[Extreme Programming]], was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. Decades after its publication, ''A Pattern Language'' is still one of the best-selling books on urban design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WWuTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232 |title= Place and Plexus: Metropolitan Land Use and Transport |last= Levinson |first= David M. |first2= Kevin J. |last2= Krizek|publisher= [[Routledge]] |year= 2008 |page= 232 |accessdate= November 10, 2014|isbn= 9781135974565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower's Market, downtown near the [[Amtrak]] depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene's trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as the Tango Center and the [[Center for Appropriate Transport]]. In 2006, an initiative began to create a tenant-run development process for downtown Eugene.

The City of Eugene has an active Neighborhood Program. Several neighborhoods are known for their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 1970s that has re-purposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco-village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a [[permaculture]] hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems, food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. Citizen volunteers are working with the City of Eugene to restore a 65-tree [[hazelnut|filbert]] grove on public property. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.

====Music====
{{Main|Music of Oregon#Eugene}}
Because of its status as a [[college town]], Eugene has been home to many music genres, musicians and bands, ranging from [[electronic dance music]] such as [[dubstep]] and [[drum and bass]] to [[garage rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Eugene also has a growing [[reggae]] and street-performing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[jug band]] scene. Multi-genre act the [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] became a prominent figure in Eugene's music scene and became the [[house band]] at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall. In the late 1990s, their contributions to the [[swing revival]] movement propelled them to national stardom. Rock band [[Floater (band)|Floater]] originated in Eugene as did the Robert Cray blues band. Doom metal band [[Yob (band)|YOB]] is among the leaders of the Eugene heavy music scene.

Eugene is home to &quot;[[Classical Gas]]&quot; Composer and two-time Grammy award winner [[Mason Williams]] who spent his years as a youth living between his parents in [[Oakridge, Oregon]] and Oklahoma. Mason Williams puts on a yearly Christmas show at the Hult center for performing arts with a full orchestra produced by author, audio engineer and University of Oregon professor [[Don Latarski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mason Williams biography|url=http://www.masonwilliams-online.com/mwguitarbio05.pdf|date=January 2005|publisher=MasonWilliams-online.com|pages=2, 11|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Film====
The Eugene area has been used as a filming location for several Hollywood films, most famously for 1978's ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', which was also filmed in nearby [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]]. [[John Belushi]] had the idea for the film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' during filming of ''Animal House'' when he happened to meet [[Curtis Salgado]] at what was then the Eugene Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~pringle/bluesbros/article.html|title=The Original Blues Brother: Curtis Salgado|publisher=Csse.monash.edu.au|date=|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Getting Straight]]'', starring [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Candice Bergen]], was filmed at [[Lane Community College]] in 1969. As the campus was still under construction at the time, the &quot;occupation scenes&quot; were easier to shoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Trivia for Getting Straight (1970)|publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]]|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065775/trivia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Chicken Salad on Toast&quot; scene in the 1970 [[Jack Nicholson]] movie ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' was filmed at the [[Denny's]] restaurant at the southern [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|I-5]] freeway interchange near [[Glenwood, Lane County, Oregon|Glenwood]]. Nicholson directed the 1971 film ''[[Drive, He Said]]'' in Eugene.

''[[How to Beat the High Co$t of Living]]'', starring [[Jane Curtin]], [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Susan St. James]], was filmed in Eugene in the fall of 1979. Locations visible in the film include [[Valley River Center]] (which is a driving force in the plot), Skinner Butte and [[Ya-Po-Ah Terrace]], the Willamette River and River Road Hardware.

Several [[track and field]] movies have used Eugene as a setting and/or a filming location. ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'', starring [[Mariel Hemingway]], was filmed in Eugene in 1982. The film centered on a group of women who are trying to qualify for the Olympic track and field team. Two track and field movies about the life of [[Steve Prefontaine]], ''[[Prefontaine (film)|Prefontaine]]'' and ''[[Without Limits]]'', were released within a year of each other in 1997–1998. [[Kenny Moore]], Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in ''Prefontaine'', co-wrote the screenplay for ''Without Limits''. ''Prefontaine'' was filmed in Washington because the ''Without Limits'' production bought out [[Hayward Field]] for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/running/history/pre-legends/|title=Steve Prefontaine and Running Legends|publisher=Eugene Cascades &amp; Coast|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of [[Bill Bowerman]], played in ''Without Limits'' by [[Donald Sutherland]] back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in ''Animal House''. Moore had also had a role in ''Personal Best''.

''[[Stealing Time]]'', a 2003 independent film, was partially filmed in Eugene. When the film premiered in June 2001 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], it was titled ''Rennie's Landing'' after a popular bar near the University of Oregon campus. The title was changed for its DVD release. ''[[Zerophilia]]'' was filmed in Eugene in 2006.

For nearly 40 years, Eugene has been the &quot;Track and Field Capital of the World.&quot; Oregon's most famous track icon is the late world-class distance runner [[Steve Prefontaine]], who was killed in a car crash in 1975.

Eugene's jogging trails include [[Pre's Trail]] in Alton Baker Park, [[Rexius Trail]], the [[Adidas Oregon Trail]], and the [[Ridgeline Trail]]. Jogging was introduced to the U.S. through Eugene, brought from [[New Zealand]] by Bill Bowerman, who wrote the best-selling book &quot;Jogging&quot;, and coached the champion University of Oregon track and cross country teams. During Bowerman's tenure, his &quot;Men of Oregon&quot; won 24 individual [[NCAA]] titles, including titles in 15 out of the 19 events contested. During Bowerman's 24 years at Oregon, his track teams finished in the top ten at the NCAA championships 16 times, including four team titles (1962, '64, '65, '70), and two second-place trophies. His teams also posted a dual meet record of 114–20.

Bowerman also invented the waffle sole for running shoes in Eugene, and with Oregon alumnus [[Phil Knight]] founded shoe giant Nike. Eugene's miles of running trails, through its unusually large park system, are the most extensive in the U.S. The city has dozens of running clubs. The climate is cool and temperate, good both for jogging and record-setting. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon's Hayward Field track, which hosts numerous collegiate and amateur track and field meets throughout the year, most notably the [[Prefontaine Classic]]. Hayward Field was host to the 2004 [[AAU Junior Olympic Games]], the 1989 [[World Masters Athletics Championships]], the track and field events of the 1998 [[World Masters Games]], the 2006 [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pacific-10]] track and field championships, the 1971, 1975, 1986, 1993, 1999, 2001, 2009, and 2011 [[USA Track &amp; Field Outdoor Championships]] and the 1972, 1976, 1980, 2008, 2012, and 2016 [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|U.S. Olympic trials]].

On April 16, 2015, it was announced by the [[IAAF]] that Eugene had been awarded the right to host the [[2021 World Athletics Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/eugene-awarded-2021-iaaf-world-championships|title=Eugene awarded 2021 IAAF World Championships}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city bid for the [[2019 World Athletics Championships|2019 event]] but lost narrowly to [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].

Eugene is also home to the [[Eugene Emeralds]], a short-season Class A [[minor-league baseball|minor-league baseball team]]. The &quot;Ems&quot; play their home games in PK Park, also the home of the University of Oregon baseball team.

The [[Nationwide Tour]]'s golfing event [[Oregon Classic]] takes place at Shadow Hills Country Club, just north of Eugene. The event has been played every year since 1998, except in 2001 when it was slated to begin the day after the [[9/11]] terrorist attacks. The top 20 players from the Nationwide Tour are promoted to the PGA Tour for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonclassic.com/History.htm |title=The history of the Oregon Classic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719043604/http://www.oregonclassic.com/History.htm |archive-date=July 19, 2011 |work=Oregon Classic |access-date=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eugene Jr. Generals, a Tier III Junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey team belonging to the Northern Pacific Hockey League (NPHL) consisting of 8 teams throughout Oregon and Washington, plays at the Lane County Ice Center.

==Parks and recreation==
[[File:Hendricks Park.jpg|thumb|[[Hendricks Park]]]]
Spencer Butte Park at the southern edge of town provides access to Spencer Butte, a dominant feature of Eugene's skyline. [[Hendricks Park]], situated on a knoll to the east of downtown, is known for its [[rhododendron]] garden and nearby memorial to Steve Prefontaine, known as [[Steve Prefontaine#Death|Pre's Rock]], where the legendary University of Oregon runner was killed in an auto accident. [[Alton Baker Park]], next to the Willamette River, contains Pre's Trail. Also next to the Willamette are Skinner Butte Park&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.eugene-or.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/55|title = City Facilities - Skinner Butte Park|date = 2014|accessdate = August 24, 2014|website = Eugene, OR|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Owen Memorial Rose Garden, which is home to more than 4,500 roses of over 400 varieties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owen Rose Garden|url=http://www.eugene-or.gov/facilities.aspx?RID=124&amp;Page=detail|publisher=City of Eugene|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 150-year-old [[Black Tartarian]] Cherry tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Tartarian Cherry at Owen Memorial Rose Garden|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4KCG|publisher=Waymark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Oregon Heritage Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oregon Heritage Trees|url=http://ortravelexperience.com/oregon-heritage-trees/|publisher=Oregon Travel Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Eugene maintains an [[urban forest]]. The University of Oregon campus is an [[arboretum]], with over 500 species of trees. The city operates and maintains scenic hiking trails that pass through and across the ridges of a cluster of hills in the southern portion of the city, on the fringe of residential neighborhoods. Some trails allow biking, and others are for hikers and runners only.

The nearest ski resort, [[Willamette Pass ski area|Willamette Pass]], is one hour from Eugene by car. On the way, along [[Oregon Route 58]], are several reservoirs and lakes, the Oakridge [[mountain biking|mountain bike]] trails, [[hot spring]]s, and waterfalls within [[Willamette National Forest]]. Eugene residents also frequent the [[Hoodoo (ski area)|Hoodoo]] and [[Mt. Bachelor ski area|Mount Bachelor]] ski resorts. The [[Three Sisters Wilderness]], the [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area]], and [[Smith Rock State Park|Smith Rock]] are just a short drive away.

==Government==
In 1944, Eugene adopted a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] form of government, replacing the day-to-day management of city affairs by the part-time mayor and volunteer [[city council]] with a full-time professional [[city manager]]. The subsequent history of Eugene city government has largely been one of the dynamics—often contentious—between the city manager, the mayor and city council.

The mayor of Eugene is [[Lucy Vinis]], who has been in office since winning the popular vote in 2017. [[List of mayors of Eugene, Oregon|Recent mayors]] include Edwin Cone (1958–69), Les Anderson (1969–77) Gus Keller (1977–84), Brian Obie (1985–88), Jeff Miller (1989–92), [[Ruth Bascom]] (1993–96), [[Jim Torrey]] (1997–2004) and Kitty Piercy (2005-2017).

Summertime events and festivals frequently have bike parking &quot;corrals&quot; that are often filled to capacity by three hundred or more bikes. Many people commute to work by bicycle every month of the year. Bike trails take commuting and recreational bikers along the Willamette River past a scenic rose garden, along Amazon Creek, through the downtown, and through the University of Oregon campus.

[[File:NorthBankTrails.jpg|thumb|left|The North Bank Bike Path is a popular trail for cyclists.]]

In 2009, the [[League of American Bicyclists]] cited Eugene as 1 of 10 &quot;Gold-level&quot; cities in the U.S. because of its &quot;remarkable commitments to bicycling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene one of top cities in nation for bicycling|url=http://www.kval.com/news/65085087.html|date=October 20, 2009|publisher=KVAL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/pdfs/bfc_master_list_web.pdf|title= Bicycle Friendly Community Master List: October 2009|date= October 20, 2009|publisher= League of American Bicyclists|access-date= March 10, 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100331035018/http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/pdfs/bfc_master_list_web.pdf|archive-date= March 31, 2010|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene OR Receives Gold-Level from LAB|url=http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/communities/bfc_eugene.php|access-date=April 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105032042/http://www.bikeleague.org/programs/bicyclefriendlyamerica/communities/bfc_eugene.php|archive-date=January 5, 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[Bicycling (magazine)|Bicycling]]'' magazine named Eugene the 5th most bike-friendly city in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;bikes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Earns Top Five Ranking in List of Most Bike-Friendly Cities in America|url=https://www.eugene-or.gov/archives/61/BikeFriendly.pdf|publisher=City of Eugene|date=April 6, 2010|accessdate=December 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424124518/https://www.eugene-or.gov/archives/61/BikeFriendly.pdf|archive-date=April 24, 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bikes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bicycling's top 50|url=http://www.bicycling.com/news/featured-stories/bicyclings-top-50|publisher=www.bicycling.com|access-date=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318044813/http://www.bicycling.com/news/featured-stories/bicyclings-top-50|archive-date=March 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Census Bureau's annual [[American Community Survey]] reported that Eugene had a bicycle commuting [[mode share]] of 7.3% in 2011, the fifth highest percentage nationwide among U.S. cities with 65,000 people or more, and 13 times higher than the national average of 0.56%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/bike-to-work-map-us-cities-census-data.html|title=New Data Shows Where Americans Bike to Work|author=Maciag, Mike|magazine=[[Governing (magazine)|Governing]]|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Highways====
Highways traveling within and through Eugene include:
*[[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]]: Interstate 5 forms much of the eastern city limit, acting as an effective, though unofficial boundary between Eugene and Springfield.

To the south, I-5 leads to [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]], and the southwestern portion of the state. In full, Interstate 5 continues north to the Canada–US border at Blaine, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia and extends south to the Mexico–US border at Tijuana and San Diego.
*[[Oregon Route 126|Officer Chris Kilcullen Memorial Highway]]: Oregon Route 126 is routed along the Eugene-Springfield Highway, a limited-access freeway.

*[[Oregon Route 569|Randy Papé Beltline]]: Beltline is a limited-access freeway which runs along the northern and western edges of incorporated Eugene.
*[[Delta Highway (Eugene, Oregon)|Delta Highway]]: The Delta Highway forms a connector of less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} between Interstate 105 and Beltline Highway.
*[[Oregon Route 99]]: Oregon Route 99 forks off Interstate 5 south of Eugene, and forms a major surface artery in Eugene. It continues north into the Willamette valley, parallel to I-5. It is sometimes called the &quot;scenic route&quot; since it has a great view of the Coast Range and also stretches through many scenic farmlands of the Willamette Valley.

===Utilities===
Eugene is the home of Oregon's largest publicly owned [[electric utility|water and power utility]], the [[Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board]] (EWEB). EWEB got its start in the first decade of the 20th century, after an epidemic of [[typhoid]] found in the groundwater supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweb.org/history &quot;History of EWEB&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919053419/http://eweb.org/history |date=September 19, 2010 }}. [[Eugene Water &amp; Electric Board]]. Retrieved October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Eugene condemned Eugene's private water utility and began treating river water (first the Willamette; later the McKenzie) for domestic use. EWEB got into the electric business when power was needed for the water pumps. Excess electricity generated by the EWEB's [[hydropower]] plants was used for street lighting.

Natural gas service is provided by [[NW Natural]].

Wastewater treatment services are provided by the Metropolitan Wastewater Management Commission, a partnership between the Cities of Eugene and Springfield and Lane County.

===Healthcare===
