'''Eusebius Amort''' (November 15, 1692{{snd}}February 5, 1775) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[theology|theologian]].

==Life==
Amort was born at Bibermuhle, near [[Tolz]], in Upper [[Bavaria]].  He studied at [[Munich]], and at an early age joined the [[Canons Regular]] at [[Polling Abbey|Polling]], where, shortly after his ordination in 1717, he taught theology and [[philosophy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=876}}
The [[Parnassus Boicus]] learned society was based on a plan started in 1720 by three Augustinian fathers: Eusebius Amort, Gelasius Hieber (1671–1731), a famous preacher in the [[German language]] and Agnellus Kandler (1692–1745), a genealogist and librarian. The initial plans fell through, but in 1722 they issued the first volume of the ''Parnassus Boicus'' journal, communicating interesting information from the arts and sciences.{{sfn|Blackall|1954|p=98}}

In 1733 Amort went to [[Rome]] as theologian to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Niccolo Maria Lercari]] (died 1757).
He returned to Polling in 1735 and devoted the rest of his life to the revival of learning in Bavaria.  He died at Polling in 1775.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=876}}

==Works==
Amort, who had the reputation of being the most learned man of his age, was a voluminous writer on every conceivable subject, from [[poetry]] to [[astronomy]], from dogmatic theology to [[mysticism]].  His best known works are:

*A manual of theology in 4 vols, ''Theologia eclectica, moralis et scholastica'' (Augsburg, 1752; revised by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] for the 1753 edition published at Bologna)
*A defence of Catholic doctrine, entitled ''Demonstratio critica religionis Catholicae'' (Augsburg, 1751)
*A work on indulgences, which has often been criticized by [[Protestant]] writers, ''De Origine, Progressu, Valore, et Fructu Indulgentiorum'' (Augsburg, 1735)
*A treatise on mysticism, ''De Revelationibus et Visionibus, etc.'' (2 vols, 1744)
*The astronomical work ''Nova philosophiae planetarum et artis criticae systemata'' (Nuremberg, 1723).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=876–877}}

The list of his other works, including his three erudite contributions to the question of authorship of the ''Imitatio Christi'', will be found in [[C. Toussaint]]'s scholarly article in [[Alfred Vacant]]'s ''Dictionnaire de theologie'' (1900, cols 1115-1117).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=877}}
