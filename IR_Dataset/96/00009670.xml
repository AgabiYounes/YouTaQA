      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Evolutionism''' is a term used (often derogatorily) to denote the [[theory of evolution]]. Its exact meaning has changed over time as the study of evolution has progressed. In the 19th century, it was used to describe the belief that organisms deliberately improved themselves through progressive inherited change ([[orthogenesis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-550-11000-3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carneiro | first=Robert, L. | title=Evolutionism in cultural anthropology : a critical history | publisher=Westview Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-8133-3766-1 | pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[teleological]] belief went on to include [[cultural evolution]] and [[social evolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-550-11000-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allen, R.

The belief was also extended to cultures and societies, and to living organisms. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was used to describe the idea &quot;that human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Trigger|Trigger, Bruce]]  (1986) ''A History of Archeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is most often used by [[creationist]]s to describe adherence to the scientific consensus on evolution as equivalent to a [[secular religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRMuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-visit/linke.html|title=A Visit to the ICR Museum|author=Linke, Steven|date=August 28, 1992|publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]|accessdate=2008-12-05|quote=In fact, true science supports the Biblical worldview...

==19th-century teleological use ==
Before its use to describe biological evolution, the term &quot;evolution&quot; was originally used to refer to any orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start.&lt;ref name=Carneiro&gt;Carneiro, Robert L.(Léonard) (2003) ''Evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history'' Westview Press pg 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first five editions of Darwin's in ''Origin of Species'' used the word &quot;evolved&quot;, but the word &quot;evolution&quot; was only used in its sixth edition in 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;penguin origin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Origin of Species|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=978-0-14-043205-3|edition=reprint of 1st|editor=Burrow, JW|page=460|quote=...from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, ''evolved'' (italics not in original)|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/originofspecies000darw}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, [[Herbert Spencer]] had developed the concept theory that organisms strive to evolve due to an internal &quot;driving force&quot; ([[orthogenesis]]) in 1862.&lt;ref name=Carneiro/&gt;  Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term &quot;evolution&quot; to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of [[unilineal evolution|unilineal (social) evolution]] used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900).&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce (1986) ''A History of Archaeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolutionism subsequently came to be used for the now discredited theory that evolution contained a deliberate component, rather than the selection of [[Beneficial mutation|beneficial traits]] from [[Genetic variation|random variation]] by [[Survival of the fittest|differential survival]].

==Modern use by creationists==
The term ''[[evolution]]'' is widely used, but the term ''evolutionism'' is not used in the [[scientific community]] to refer to [[evolutionary biology]] as it is redundant and anachronistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dichotomy&quot;/&gt;

However, the term has been used by creationists in discussing the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dichotomy&quot; /&gt; For example, the [[Institute for Creation Research]], in order to imply placement of evolution in the category of 'religions', including [[atheism]], [[fascism]], [[humanism]] and [[occultism]], commonly uses the words ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief.&lt;ref name=ICRMuseum/&gt; The [[BioLogos Foundation]], an organization that promotes the idea of [[theistic evolution]], uses the term &quot;evolutionism&quot; to describe &quot;the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse.&quot; It views this as a subset of [[scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/biologos-id-creationism|title=How is BioLogos different from Evolutionism, Intelligent Design, and Creationism|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation|quote= While BioLogos accepts evolution, it emphatically rejects evolutionism, the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse. Proponents of evolutionism believe every aspect of life will one day be explained with evolutionary theory. In this way it is a subset of scientism, the broader view that the only real truth is that which can be discovered by science. These positions are commonly held by materialists (also called philosophical naturalists) who deny the existence of the supernatural.|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{npsn|date=January 2020}}
