In many-worlds, the subjective appearance of wavefunction collapse is explained by the mechanism of [[quantum decoherence]]. Decoherence approaches to interpreting quantum theory have been widely explored and developed since the 1970s,&lt;ref name=zeh&gt;[[H. Dieter Zeh]], On the Interpretation of Measurement in Quantum Theory, ''Foundations of Physics'', vol. 1, pp. 69–76, (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zurek91&gt;[[Wojciech Hubert Zurek]], Decoherence and the transition from quantum to classical, ''Physics Today'', vol. 44, issue 10, pp. 36–44, (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zurek03&gt;[[Wojciech Hubert Zurek]], Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical, ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 75, pp 715–775, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and have become quite popular. MWI is currently considered a mainstream interpretation along with the other decoherence interpretations, [[collapse theory|collapse theories]] (including the Copenhagen interpretation), and [[hidden variable theories]] such as [[De Broglie–Bohm theory|Bohmian mechanics]].

==History==
In 1952 [[Erwin Schrödinger]] gave a lecture in Dublin in which at one point he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might &quot;seem lunatic&quot;. He went on to assert that what the [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] that won him a Nobel prize seems to be describing is several different histories, they are &quot;not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously&quot;. This is the earliest known reference to the many-worlds.&lt;ref&gt;David Deutsch. The Beginning of infinity. Page 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9188438/Erwin-Schrodinger-and-the-Quantum-Revolution-by-John-Gribbin-review.html |title=Erwin Schrödinger and the Quantum Revolution by John Gribbin: review |last=Blincoe |first=Nicholas |date=2012-04-05 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=2019-02-10 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of MWI originated in Everett's [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis &quot;The Theory of the [[Universal Wavefunction]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; developed under his thesis advisor [[John Archibald Wheeler]], a shorter summary of which was published in 1957 entitled &quot;Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics&quot; (Wheeler contributed the title &quot;relative state&quot;;&lt;ref name=wheeler&gt;[[John Archibald Wheeler]], ''Geons, Black Holes &amp; Quantum Foam'', {{ISBN|0-393-31991-1}}. pp 268–270&lt;/ref&gt; Everett originally called his approach the &quot;Correlation Interpretation&quot;, where &quot;correlation&quot; refers to [[quantum entanglement]]). The phrase &quot;many-worlds&quot; is due to [[Bryce DeWitt]],&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt; who was responsible for the wider popularisation of Everett's theory, which had been largely ignored for the first decade after publication. DeWitt's phrase &quot;many-worlds&quot; has become so much more popular than Everett's &quot;Universal Wavefunction&quot; or Everett–Wheeler's &quot;Relative State Formulation&quot; that many forget that this is only a difference of terminology; the content of both of Everett's papers and DeWitt's popular article is the same.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

==Overview of the interpretation==
{{original research|section|reason=unsourced statements, interpretations of sourced statements, and statements made about a source that are themselves unsourced|date=February 2020}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Hugh-Everett.jpg|188px|thumb|right|Hugh Everett III (1930–1982) was the first [[physicist]] who proposed the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of [[quantum physics]], which he termed his &quot;relative state&quot; formulation.]] --&gt;
Although several versions of many-worlds have been proposed since [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]'s original work,&lt;ref name=everett57/&gt; they all contain one key idea: the equations of physics that model the time evolution of systems ''without'' embedded observers are sufficient for modelling systems which ''do'' contain observers; in particular there is no observation-triggered [[wave function collapse]] which the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] proposes. Provided the theory is [[linear]] with respect to the wavefunction, the exact form of the [[quantum]] dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], [[relativistic quantum field theory]] or some form of [[quantum gravity]] or [[string theory]], does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a [[metatheory]] applicable to all linear [[quantum mechanics|quantum theories]], and there is no experimental evidence for any non-linearity of the wavefunction in physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberglinearitydoft&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberglinearityannalsop&quot;/&gt; MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or [[multiverse]] in this context) is composed of a [[quantum superposition]] of very many, possibly even [[Uncountable set|non-denumerably]] [[Infinity|infinitely]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Heresy&quot;/&gt; many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.&lt;ref name=dewitt73/&gt;

The many-worlds interpretation shares many similarities with later, other &quot;post-Everett&quot; interpretations of quantum mechanics which also use [[decoherence]] to explain the process of measurement or wavefunction collapse. MWI treats the other histories or worlds as real since it regards the universal wavefunction as the &quot;basic physical entity&quot;&lt;ref name=everett57/&gt;{{rp|455}} or &quot;the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;everett56&quot;/&gt;{{rp|115}} The other decoherent interpretations, such as [[consistent histories]], the [[Existential Interpretation]] etc., either regard the extra quantum worlds as metaphorical in some sense, or are [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] about their reality; it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the different varieties. MWI is distinguished by two qualities: it assumes [[philosophical realism|realism]], which it assigns to the wavefunction, and it has the minimal formal structure possible, rejecting any [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]], [[quantum potential]], any form of a collapse postulate (i.e., [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagenism]]) or mental postulates (such as the [[many-minds interpretation]] makes).

Decoherent interpretations of many-worlds using [[einselection]] to explain how a small number of classical [[pointer state]]s can emerge from the enormous [[Hilbert space]] of superpositions have been proposed by [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]. &quot;Under scrutiny of the environment, only pointer states remain unchanged. Other states decohere into mixtures of stable pointer states that can persist, and, in this sense, exist: They are einselected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZurekNature2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zurek | first = Wojciech | authorlink = Wojciech Hubert Zurek | title = Quantum Darwinism | date = March 2009 | arxiv = 0903.5082 |bibcode = 2009NatPh...5..181Z |doi = 10.1038/nphys1202 | volume=5 | issue=3 | journal=Nature Physics | pages=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas complement MWI and bring the interpretation in line with our perception of reality.

Many-worlds is often referred to as a [[theory]], rather than just an interpretation, by those who propose that many-worlds can make testable predictions (such as [[David Deutsch]]) or is [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] (such as Everett) or by those who propose that all the other, non-MW interpretations, are inconsistent, illogical or unscientific in their handling of measurements; [[Hugh Everett]] argued that his formulation was a [[metatheory]], since it made statements about other interpretations of quantum theory; that it was the &quot;only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/ Everett&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch is dismissive that many-worlds is an &quot;interpretation&quot;, saying that calling it an interpretation &quot;is like talking about dinosaurs as an 'interpretation' of fossil records.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MAD&quot;/&gt;

===Formulation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Many-worlds-bloch.png|thumb|400px|Schematic representation of pair of &quot;smallest possible&quot; quantum mechanical systems prior to interaction: Measured system '''S''' and measurement apparatus '''M'''. Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] --&gt;
In Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.

[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]
For example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin &quot;up&quot; and the south pole, spin &quot;down&quot;. The superposition states of the system are described by (the surface of) a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system is described by a state that ranges over a six-dimensional space (the reason for the number six is explained in the article on the Bloch sphere). This six-dimensional object can also be regarded as a quantum superposition of two &quot;alternative histories&quot; of the original system '''S''', one in which &quot;up&quot; was observed and the other in which &quot;down&quot; was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.

The accepted terminology is somewhat misleading because it is incorrect to regard the universe as splitting at certain times; at any given instant there is one state in one universe.

===Relative state===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
In his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].

Since Everett's original work, there have appeared a number of similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.

The many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett's work, who had referred to the combined observer–object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a possible tree as shown in the graphic above. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term &quot;world&quot; to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree.

Under the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schrödinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer–object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many &quot;worlds&quot;. Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.

If a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and it is no longer possible to consider them independent of one another. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.

===Properties===

MWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]]. Since the role of the observer lies at the heart of most if not all &quot;quantum paradoxes,&quot; this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s &quot;boundary problem&quot; and even [[wave-particle duality]]. [[Quantum cosmology]] also becomes intelligible, since there is no need anymore for an observer outside of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

MWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], arguably [[local realism|local]] theory, akin to [[classical physics]] (including the [[theory of relativity]]), at the expense of losing [[counterfactual definiteness]]. MWI achieves this by removing [[wavefunction collapse]], which is indeterministic and non-local, from the [[deterministic]] and [[local realism|local]] equations of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref name=rubinlocality&gt;[[Mark A. Rubin]], Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics Letters'', 14, (2001) , pp.&amp;nbsp;301–322, {{arxiv|quant-ph/0103079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI (or other, broader [[multiverse]] considerations) provides a context for the [[anthropic principle]] which may provide an explanation for the [[fine-tuned universe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], ''Other Worlds'', chapters 8 &amp; 9 ''The Anthropic Principle'' &amp; ''Is the Universe an accident?'', (1980) {{ISBN|0-460-04400-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], ''The Accidental Universe'', (1982) {{ISBN|0-521-28692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI, being a [[quantum decoherence|decoherent]] formulation, is axiomatically more streamlined than the [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagen]] and other [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] interpretations; and thus favoured under certain interpretations of [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref name=vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia/&gt; Of course there are other decoherent interpretations that also possess this advantage with respect to the collapse interpretations.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

MWI depends crucially on the linearity of quantum mechanics. If the final [[theory of everything]] is non-[[linear]] with respect to [[wave function|wavefunctions]] then many-worlds would be invalid.&lt;ref name=&quot;dewitt71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;everett57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dewitt67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dewitt72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dewitt73&quot;/&gt;. While quantum gravity or [[string theory]] may be non-linear in this respect&lt;ref name=&quot;penrose&quot;/&gt;  there is no evidence to indicate this at the moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberglinearitydoft&quot;&gt;[[Steven Weinberg]], ''Dreams of a Final Theory: The Search for the Fundamental Laws of Nature'' (1993), {{ISBN|0-09-922391-0}}, pg 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberglinearityannalsop&quot;&gt;[[Steven Weinberg]] ''Testing Quantum Mechanics'', Annals of Physics Vol 194 #2 (1989), pg 336–386&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpreting wavefunction collapse===
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}

As with the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the [[double-slit experiment]]. When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) are passed through the double slit, a calculation assuming wave-like behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.

Some versions of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics proposed a process of &quot;[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]&quot; in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to &quot;explain&quot; this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''&lt;ref&gt;Wimmel Hermann. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I63sCgAAQBAJ Quantum Physics And Observed Reality: A Critical Interpretation Of Quantum Mechanics], p.45, World Scientific, May 26, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.

Everett's Ph.D. work provided such an alternative interpretation. Everett stated that for a composite system &amp;ndash; for example a subject (the &quot;observer&quot; or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the &quot;observed&quot; system, such as a particle) &amp;ndash; the statement that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]; we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.

Everett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone decreed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject–object wavefunction contains two &quot;relative states&quot;: a &quot;collapsed&quot; object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject–object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;einstein26&quot;&gt;&quot;Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed.&quot; [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968, quoted by [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;) Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.

===Testability===

In 1985, David Deutsch proposed a variant of the [[Wigner's friend]] thought experiment as a test of Many-Worlds versus the Copenhagen interpretation.&lt;ref name=&quot;deutsch1985&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch |first=D. |authorlink=David Deutsch |year=1985 |title=Quantum theory as a universal physical theory |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=24 |number=1 |pages=1–41 |doi=10.1007/BF00670071 |bibcode=1985IJTP...24....1D}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of an experimenter (Wigner's friend) making a measurement on a quantum system in an isolated laboratory, and another experimenter (Wigner) that would make a measurement on the first one. According to the Many-Worlds theory, the first experimenter would end up in a macroscopic superposition of seeing one result of the measurement in one branch, and another result in another branch. The second experimenter could then interfere these two branches in order to test whether it is in fact in a macroscopic superposition, or it had collapsed into a single branch as predicted by the Copenhagen interpretation.  Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals.&lt;ref name=&quot;vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals require placing macroscopic objects in a coherent superposition and interfering them, a task which is currently outside experimental capability.

==Probability and the Born rule==

Since the inception of the Many-Worlds interpretation physicists have been puzzled about the role of probability in the theory. As put by Wallace, there are two facets to the question:&lt;ref name=&quot;wallace2003&quot;/&gt; the ''incoherence problem'', which asks why should we assign probabilities at all to outcomes that are certain to occur in some worlds, and the ''quantitative problem'', which asks why should the probabilities be given by the Born rule. 

Everett tried to answer these questions in the very paper that introduced Many-Worlds. To address the ''incoherence problem'', he argued that an observer that made a sequence of measurements on a quantum system will in general have an apparently random sequence of results in their memory, which justifies the use of probabilities to describe the measurement process.&lt;ref name=everett56/&gt;{{rp|69-70}} To address the ''quantitative problem'', Everett proposed a derivation of the Born rule based on the properties that a measure on the branches of the wavefunction should have.&lt;ref name=everett56/&gt;{{rp|70-72}} His derivation has been criticized as relying on unmotivated assumptions.&lt;ref name=ballentine1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L. E.

===Frequentism===

Derivations of the Born rule based on a [[Frequentist probability|frequentist]] interpretation of probability have been proposed by [[Bryce DeWitt|DeWitt]] and Graham&lt;ref name=&quot;dewitt73&quot;/&gt; and Farhi et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Edward Farhi |author2=Jeffrey Goldstone |author3=Sam Gutmann |title=How probability arises in quantum mechanics |journal=Annals of Physics |date=1989 |volume=192 |issue=2 |pages=368-382 |doi=10.1016/0003-4916(89)90141-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, among others. They tried to show that in the limit of infinitely many measurements there would exist no worlds where the relative frequencies didn't match the probabilities given by the Born rule, but these derivations were shown to be mathematically incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carlton M.

==The preferred basis problem==

As originally formulated by Everett and DeWitt, the Many-Worlds interpretation had a privileged role for measurements: they determined which [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of a quantum system would give rise to the eponymous worlds. Without this the theory was ambiguous, as a quantum state can be equally well be described (e.g.) as having a well-defined position, or as being a superposition of two delocalised states. The assumption that the preferred basis to use is the one coming from a measurement of position results in worlds having objects in well-defined positions, instead of worlds with delocalised objects (which would be grossly incompatible with experiment). This special role for measurements is problematic for the theory, as it contradicts Everett and DeWitt's goal of having a reductionist theory, and undermines their criticism of the ill-defined measurement postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation.&lt;ref name=ballentine1973/&gt; This is known today as the ''preferred basis problem''.

The preferred basis problem has been solved, according to Saunders and Wallace, among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Simon|chapter=Many Worlds? An Introduction|title=Many Worlds?

In this way measurements do not play a special role anymore, but rather any interaction that causes decoherence causes the world to split.

There is a wide range of claims that are considered &quot;many-worlds&quot; interpretations. It was often claimed by those who do not believe in MWI&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey A. Barrett]], ''The Quantum Mechanics of Minds and Worlds'', Oxford University Press, 1999. According to Barrett (loc. cit. Chapter 6) &quot;There are many many-worlds interpretations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that Everett himself was not entirely clear&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Barrett |first=Jeffrey A. |title=Everett's Relative-State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-first=Edward N. |editor-last=Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/qm-everett/ |year=2010 |edition=Fall 2010}} Again, according to Barrett &quot;It is... unclear precisely how this was supposed to work.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as to what he believed; however, MWI adherents (such as [[Bryce DeWitt|DeWitt]], [[Max Tegmark|Tegmark]], [[David Deutsch|Deutsch]] and others) believe they fully understand Everett's meaning as implying the literal existence of the other worlds. Additionally, recent biographical sources make it clear that Everett believed in the literal reality of the other quantum worlds.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAD&quot;&gt;Peter Byrne, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0199552274 The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III: Multiple Universes, Mutual Assured Destruction, and the Meltdown of a Nuclear Family], {{ISBN|978-0-19-955227-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Oliver Everett|Everett's son]] reported that Hugh Everett &quot;never wavered in his belief over his many-worlds theory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsciMark&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Aldhous | first = Peter | title = Parallel lives can never touch | magazine = New Scientist | issue = 2631 |date=2007-11-24 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626311.800-interview-parallel-lives-can-never-touch.html | accessdate = 2007-11-21 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of MWI's strongest advocates is [[David Deutsch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deutsch98&quot;&gt;[[David Deutsch]], ''The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes And Its Implications'', Penguin Books (1998), {{ISBN|0-14-027541-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deutsch, the single photon interference pattern observed in the [[double slit experiment]] can be explained by interference of photons in multiple universes. Viewed in this way, the single photon interference experiment is indistinguishable from the multiple photon interference experiment. In a more practical vein, in one of the earliest papers on quantum computing,&lt;ref name=&quot;deutsch85&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = David | authorlink = David Deutsch | year = 1985 | title = Quantum theory, the Church–Turing principle and the universal quantum computer | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A | volume = 400 | issue = 1818| pages = 97–117 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1985.0070|bibcode = 1985RSPSA.400...97D | citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.7936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggested that parallelism that results from the validity of MWI could lead to &quot;''a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it''&quot;. Deutsch has also proposed that when [[Reversible computing|reversible computers]] become conscious then MWI will be testable (at least against &quot;naive&quot; Copenhagenism) via the reversible observation of spin.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis86&quot;&gt;[[Paul C.W. Davies]], J.R.

[[Asher Peres]] was an outspoken critic of MWI. For example, a section in his 1993 textbook had the title ''Everett's interpretation and other bizarre theories''. Peres argued that all of the varieties of many-worlds interpretations merely shifted the arbitrariness or vagueness of the collapse postulate to the question of when &quot;worlds&quot; can be regarded as separate, and that no objective criterion for that separation can actually be formulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Peres|first=Asher|title=Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=1995|isbn=0-7923-2549-4|location=|pages=374|author-link=Asher Peres}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MWI is considered by some&lt;ref name=Bunge&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bunge, M. |year=2012 |title=Evaluating Philosophies |chapter=Parallel Universes?

Others&lt;ref name=&quot;davis86&quot;/&gt; claim MWI is directly testable.

=== Polls ===
Advocates of MWI often cite a poll of 72 &quot;leading [[cosmologist]]s and other quantum field theorists&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=35–36 |title= The Universe – Solved! |first= Jim |last= Elvridge. |isbn= 978-1-4243-3626-5 |date= 2008-01-02 |oclc= 247614399 |quote= 58% believed that the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) was true, including Stephen Hawking and Nobel Laureates [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and Richard Feynman }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the American political scientist David Raub in 1995 showing 58% agreement with &quot;Yes, I think MWI is true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote= [the poll was] published in the French periodical ''Sciences et Avenir'' in January 1998 |page= [https://archive.org/details/beyondbleep00alex/page/33 33] |title= Beyond the bleep : the definitive unauthorized guide to What the bleep do we know!? |url= https://archive.org/details/beyondbleep00alex |url-access= registration |first= Alexandra |last= Bruce. |isbn= 978-1-932857-22-1 |chapter= How does reality work?|year= 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the poll is controversial. For example, [[Victor J. Stenger]] remarks that [[Murray Gell-Mann]]'s published work explicitly rejects the existence of simultaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name=&quot;stenger1995&quot;/&gt; Collaborating with [[James Hartle]], Gell-Mann had been, before his death, working toward the development a more &quot;palatable&quot; ''post-Everett quantum mechanics''. Stenger thinks it's fair to say that most physicists dismiss the many-world interpretation as too extreme, while noting it &quot;has merit in finding a place for the observer inside the system being analyzed and doing away with the troublesome notion of wave function collapse&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;stenger1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=V.J. |last=Stenger |year=1995 |title=The Unconscious Quantum: Metaphysics in Modern Physics and Cosmology |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-57392-022-3 |lccn=lc95032599 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZbvAAAAMAAJ |page=176 |quote=Gell-Mann and collaborator James Hartle, along with a score of others, have been working to develop a more palatable interpretation of quantum mechanics that is free of the problems that plague all the interpretations we have considered so far.

I will not be overly concerned with the detailed differences between these characterizations and will use the terms more or less interchangeably.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] also reports the result of a &quot;highly unscientific&quot; poll taken at a 1997 quantum mechanics workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html Max Tegmark on many-worlds (contains MWI poll)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tegmark, &quot;The many worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the [[consistent histories]] and [[Bohm interpretation|Bohm&amp;nbsp;interpretations]].&quot; Such polls have been taken at other conferences, for example, in response to [[Sean M.

Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence.&quot; However, Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: [[Asher Peres]] &quot;got a huge and sustained round of applause… when he got up at the end of the polling and asked 'And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/000060.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040520222807/http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/000060.html |first=Michael |last=Nielsen |title=Michael Nielsen: The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics | archivedate=20 May 2004 |date=3 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 poll of fewer than 40 students and researchers taken after a course on the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics at the Institute for Quantum Computing University of Waterloo found &quot;Many Worlds (and decoherence)&quot; to be the least favored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqc.ca/~qipcourse/interpret/survey.html Survey Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104152717/http://www.iqc.ca/~qipcourse/interpret/survey.html |date=2010-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 poll of 33 participants at an Austrian conference found 6 endorsed MWI, 8 &quot;Information-based/information-theoretical&quot;, and 14 Copenhagen;&lt;ref name=poll2011&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1301.1069|last1=Schlosshauer|first1=Maximilian|title=A Snapshot of Foundational Attitudes Toward Quantum Mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222–230|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors remark that MWI received a similar percentage of votes as in Tegmark's 1997 poll.&lt;ref name=poll2011/&gt;

==Debate if the other worlds are real==

According to [[Martin Gardner]], the &quot;other&quot; worlds of MWI have two different interpretations: real or unreal; he claimed that [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Steven Weinberg]] both favour the unreal interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021033103/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_26/ai_85932634 A response to Bryce DeWitt], Martin Gardner, May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured by the majority of physicists, whereas the &quot;realist&quot; view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and [[Bryce DeWitt]]. Hawking has said that &quot;according to Feynman's idea&quot;, all the other histories are as &quot;equally real&quot; as our own,&lt;ref name=&quot;hawkingreal&quot;&gt;Award winning 1995 Channel 4 documentary &quot;Reality on the rocks: Beyond our Ken&quot; {{cite web|url=http://www.windfallfilms.com/html/awards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022030220/http://www.windfallfilms.com/html/awards.htm |archivedate=2007-10-22 }} where, in response to [[Ken Campbell]]'s question &quot;all these trillions of Universes of the Multiverse, are they as real as this one seems to be to me?&quot; Hawking states, &quot;Yes.... According to Feynman's idea, every possible history (of Ken) is equally real.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Gardner]] reports Hawking saying that MWI is &quot;trivially true&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Gardner | title = Are universes thicker than blackberries? | publisher = W.W.

I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferris | first = Timothy | authorlink = Timothy Ferris | title = The Whole Shebang | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | year= 1997 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=qjYbQ7EBAKwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 345] | isbn = 978-0-684-81020-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the &quot;reality&quot; of physical theories with that of his colleague [[Roger Penrose]], saying, &quot;He's a [[Platonic realism|Platonist]] and I'm a [[Positivism|positivist]]. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hawking | first = Stephen |author2=Roger Penrose | title = The Nature of Space and Time | publisher = Princeton University Press | year= 1996 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=LstaQTXP65cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 121] | isbn = 978-0-691-03791-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of [[quantum gravity]] negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.&lt;ref name=&quot;penrose&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Penrose |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Penrose |title=Roger Penrose Looks Beyond the Classic-Quantum Dichotomy |publisher=Sciencewatch |date=August 1991 |url=http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/roger_penrose2.htm |accessdate=2007-10-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023063403/http://www.sciencewatch.com/interviews/roger_penrose2.htm |archivedate=2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculative implications==

===Quantum suicide thought experiment===
{{main|Quantum suicide and immortality}}
''Quantum suicide'' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[philosophy of physics]]. Purportedly, it can distinguish between the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics and the many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the [[Schrödinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], from the cat's point of view. ''Quantum immortality'' refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;mit_edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/quantum.html#immortality|title=Quantum immortality|last=Tegmark|first=Max|date=November 1998|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most experts believe that the experiment would not work in the real world,&lt;ref name=wallace/&gt;{{rp|371}} because the world with the surviving experimenter has a lower &quot;measure&quot; than the world prior to the experiment, making it less likely that the experimenter will go on to experience their survival.&lt;ref name=wallace&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wallace |first1=David |title=The Emergent Multiverse: Quantum Theory According to the Everett Interpretation |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954696-1 |pages=369-372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqfnu1o26cEC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vaidman_stanfordencyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean |title=[[Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime]] |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781524743024 |chapter=The Human Side - Living and Thinking in a Quantum Universe}} At [https://books.google.com/books?id=f16IDwAAQBAJ Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=David |year=2011 |chapter=The Beginning|title=The Beginning of Infinity |publisher=Penguin Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absurdly improbable timelines===
Bryce Seligman DeWitt has stated that &quot;[Everett, Wheeler and Graham] do not in the end exclude any element of the superposition. All the worlds are there, even those in which everything goes wrong and all the statistical laws break down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1063/1.3022331|title = Quantum mechanics and reality|journal = Physics Today|volume = 23|issue = 9|pages = 30–35|year = 1970|last1 = DeWitt |first1 = Bryce S.|bibcode = 1970PhT....23i..30D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing a phase from [[T.H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Murray Gell-Mann describes the implications of his [[Totalitarian principle]], as &quot;Everything not forbidden is compulsory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. (1999). Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann and the Revolution in Twentieth-Century Physics. Knopf. p. 224. {{ISBN|978-0-679-43764-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Tegmark has affirmed that absurd or highly unlikely events are inevitable under the MWI interpretation. To quote Tegmark, &quot;Things inconsistent with the laws of physics will never happen - everything else will ... it's important to keep track of the statistics, since even if everything conceivable happens somewhere, really freak events happen only exponentially rarely.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Max Tegmark: [http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html &quot;Max' multiverse FAQ: frequently asked questions&quot; &gt; &quot;Multiverse philosophy&quot; &gt; &quot;Will I rob a gas station?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
