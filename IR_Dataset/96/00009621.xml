'''Ellensburg''' is a city in and [[county seat]] of [[Kittitas County, Washington|Kittitas County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. The population was 20,977 in a July 2018 census estimate. Located just east of the [[Cascade Range]] on [[Interstate 90 in Washington|Interstate 90]], Ellensburg is the  most centrally located city in the state, and is the home of [[Central Washington University]] (CWU).

The surrounding Kittitas Valley is internationally known for the [[timothy hay]] that it produces. There are several local [[hay]] brokering and processing operations that ship to [[Pacific Rim]] countries.
Downtown Ellensburg has many historic buildings, many of which were constructed in the late 19th century. This is a legacy of its bid to be the state capital, which it lost to [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=7549|title=Ellensburg loses its bid to become state capital on November 4, 1890. - HistoryLink.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWU being placed there is another product of that legacy. The state legislature selected Ellensburg as the location for the then Normal School as a consolation prize.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Kirk, Carmela Alexander. ''Exploring Washington's Past: A Road Guide to History.'' University of Washington Press, 1995. p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:2008-1019-02-CentralWashingtonUniversity.jpg|thumb|left|Barge Hall at&lt;br&gt;Central Washington University]]
Ellensburg was officially incorporated on November 26, 1883. [[John Alden Shoudy]] came to the [[Kittitas Valley]] in 1871, and purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson &quot;A.J.&quot; Splawn, called &quot;Robber's Roost.&quot;   Robber's Roost was the first business in the valley, other than the early trading that occurred among Native Americans, cattle drivers, trappers, and miners. Robber's Roost was located on the present-day 3rd Avenue, just west of Main Street near the alley.  There is a placard on the wall commemorating the location, as well as a small stone monument against the wall on the sidewalk.  Shoudy named the town after his wife, Mary Ellen Shoudy, thus officially began the city of Ellensburgh around 1872. Shoudy was not the first settler in the [[Kittitas Valley]], nor was he the first businessperson, but he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh in the 1870s, and he was the person who named the streets in the downtown district.

The city was originally named '''Ellensburgh''', until the final -''h'' was dropped under standardization pressure from the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[United States Board on Geographic Names|Board of Geography Names]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk (1995:123)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several early newspapers in Ellensburg.  The Daily Record, however, began in 1909 and is the name of the local newspaper today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Visit Ellensburg&quot;/&gt;

Concerns over the state of Ellensburg's historic downtown led to the formation of the Ellensburg Downtown Association to work on revitalizing the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellensburgdowntown.org|title=Shop, Dine, Visit - Ellensburg Downtown Association - Ellensburg, WA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
