{{trade bloc}}

An '''economic and monetary union''' (MCU) is a type of [[trade bloc]] that features a combination of a [[common market]], [[customs union]], and [[monetary union]]. Established via a [[trade pact]], an MCU constitutes the sixth of seven stages in the process of [[economic integration]]. An MCU agreement usually combines a customs union with a common market. A typical MCU establishes free trade and a common external [[tariff]] throughout its jurisdiction. It is also designed to protect freedom in the movement of goods, services, and people. This arrangement is distinct from a [[monetary union]] (e.g., the [[Latin Monetary Union]]), which does not usually involve a common market. As with the economic and monetary union established among the 28 member states of the [[European Union]] (EU), an MCU may affect different parts of its jurisdiction in different ways. Some areas are subject to separate customs regulations from other areas subject to the MCU. These various arrangements may be established in a formal agreement, or they may exist on a ''[[de facto]]'' basis. For example, not all EU member states use the [[Euro]] established by its [[currency union]], and not all EU member states are part of the [[Schengen Area]]. Some EU members participate in both unions, and some in neither.

[[Territories of the United States]], [[Australian External Territories]] and [[Realm of New Zealand|New Zealand]] territories each share a currency and, for the most part, the [[Single market|market]] of their respective mainland states. However, they are generally not part of the same [[Customs territory|customs territories]].

== History ==
Several countries initially attempted to form an MCU at the Hague Summit in 1969. Afterward, a &quot;draft plan&quot; was announced. During this time, the main member presiding over this decision was [[Pierre Werner]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Luxembourg|Prime Minister of Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/d1cfaf4d-8b5c-4334-ac1d-0438f4a0d617/01b8a864-db8b-422c-915e-a47d5e86593e|title=The Hague Summit (1–2 December 1969): completion, enlargement, deepening - Pierre Werner and the European integration process: from the Schuman Plan to the Fontainebleau Summit - CVCE Website|website=www.cvce.eu|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to form the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]] (EMU) was accepted in {{nowrap|December 1991,}} which later became part of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (the Treaty on European Union).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-and-monetary-union/what-economic-and-monetary-union-emu_en|title=What is the Economic and Monetary Union? (EMU)|website=European Commission - European Commission|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes in the European MCU ==
{{main|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}
The EMU involves four main activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/economic-and-monetary-union/how-economic-and-monetary-union-works_en|title=How the Economic and Monetary Union works|website=European Commission - European Commission|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first responsibility is to be in charge of implementing effective monetary policy for the [[Eurozone|euro area]] with price stability. There is a group of economists whose only role is studying how to improve the monetary policy while maintaining price stability. They conduct research, and their results are presented to the leaders of the EMU. Thereafter, the role of the leaders is to find a suitable way to implement the economists' work into their country's policies. Maintaining price stability is a long-term goal for all states in the EU, due to the effects it might have on the Euro as a currency.

Secondly, the EMU must coordinate economic and fiscal policies in EU countries. They must find an equilibrium between the implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. They will advise countries to have greater coordination, even if that means having countries tightly coupled with looser monetary and tighter fiscal policy. Not coordinating the monetary market could result in risking an unpredictable situation. The EMU also deliberates on a mixed policy option, which has been shown to be beneficial in some empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blinder|first=Alan|date=September 1982|title=Issues in the Coordination of Monetary and Fiscal Policy|location=Cambridge, MA|doi=10.3386/w0982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, the EMU ensures that the single market runs smoothly. The member countries respect the decisions made by the EMU and ensure that their actions will be in favor of a stable market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.europa.eu/web pub/com/factsheets/emu/en/|title=The EU and economic and monetary union|website=publications.europa.eu|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, regulations of the EMU aid in supervising and monitoring financial institutions. There is an imperative need for all members of the EMU to act in unison. Therefore, the EMU has to have institutions supervising all the member states to protect the main aim of the EMU.

===Roles of national governments===
The economic roles of nations within the EMU are to:
* control fiscal policy that concerns government budgets
* control tax policies that determine how income is raised
* control structural policies that determine pension systems, labor, and capital-market regulations
