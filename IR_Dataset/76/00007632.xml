'''Cerebrospinal fluid''' ('''CSF''') is a clear, colorless [[Extracellular fluid#Transcellular fluid|body fluid]] found in the [[human brain|brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. It is produced by specialised [[Ependyma|ependymal cells]] in the [[choroid plexus]]es of the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] of the brain, and absorbed in the [[arachnoid granulation]]s. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500&amp;nbsp;mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer, providing basic mechanical and [[immunological]] protection to the brain inside the [[Human skull|skull]]. CSF also serves a vital function in the [[cerebral autoregulation]] of [[cerebral blood flow]].

CSF occupies the [[subarachnoid space]] (between the [[arachnoid mater]] and the [[pia mater]]) and the [[ventricular system]] around and inside the brain and spinal cord. It fills the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] of the brain, [[subarachnoid cisterns|cisterns]], and [[Sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]], as well as the [[central canal]] of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the [[bony labyrinth]] of the [[inner ear]] via the [[perilymphatic duct]] where the [[perilymph]] is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid. The ependymal cells of the choroid plexuses have multiple [[Cilium#Motile cilia|motile cilia]] on their apical surfaces that beat to move the CSF through the ventricles.

A sample of CSF can be taken via [[lumbar puncture]]. This can reveal the [[intracranial pressure]], as well as indicate diseases including [[encephalitis|infections of the brain]] or [[meningitis|its surrounding meninges]]. Although noted by [[Hippocrates]], it was only in the 18th century that [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] was credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 [[Harvey Cushing]] demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.

===Circulation===
[[File:NPH MRI 272 GILD.gif|thumb|MRI showing pulsation of CSF]][[File:dist vent.png|thumb|Distribution of CSF|350x350px]]

There is about 125–150&amp;nbsp;mL of CSF at any one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt; This CSF circulates within the [[ventricular system]] of the brain. The ventricles are a series of cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two [[lateral ventricles]]. From here, CSF passes through the [[Interventricular foramina (neuroanatomy)|interventricular foramina]] to the [[third ventricle]], then the [[cerebral aqueduct]] to the [[fourth ventricle]]. From the fourth ventricle, the fluid passes into the [[subarachnoid space]] through four openings{{snd}} the [[central canal]] of the spinal cord, the [[median aperture]], and the two [[lateral aperture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt; CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the [[sacrum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the [[bony labyrinth]] of the [[inner ear]] making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the [[perilymph]] in 93% of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakka|first1=L.|last2=Coll|first2=G.|last3=Chazal|first3=J.|title=Anatomy and physiology of cerebrospinal fluid|journal=European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases|date=December 2011|volume=128|issue=6|pages=309–316|doi=10.1016/j.anorl.2011.03.002|pmid=22100360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSF moves in a single outward direction from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by the beating of the heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Some authors dispute this, posing that there is no unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-from cranio-spinal CSF movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmc4118619&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klarica M, Orešković D |title=A new look at cerebrospinal fluid movement |journal=Fluids Barriers CNS |volume=11 |issue= |pages= 16|year=2014 |pmc=4118619 |doi=10.1186/2045-8118-11-16 |pmid=25089184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contents===
CSF is derived from [[blood plasma]] and is largely similar to it, except that CSF is nearly protein-free compared with plasma and has some different [[electrolyte]] levels. Due to the way it is produced, CSF has a higher [[chloride]] level than plasma, and an equivalent [[sodium]] level.&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=SALADIN2012 /&gt;

CSF contains approximately 0.3% plasma proteins, or approximately 15 to 40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL, depending on sampling site.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid4456012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Felgenhauer K |title=Protein size and CSF composition |journal=Klin.

==Development==
At around the third week of [[human embryogenesis|development]], the [[embryo]] is a three-layered disc, covered with [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]]. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the [[notochord]]. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue.&lt;ref name=LARSEN2009/&gt; The [[neural tube]], forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior to the development of the choroid plexuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; The open [[neuropore]]s of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

As the [[Brain#Development|brain develops]], by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the [[central nervous system]]: the [[prosencephalon]], [[mesencephalon]] and [[rhombencephalon]].&lt;ref name=LARSEN2009/&gt; Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is visible from the 41st day.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

The developing forebrain surrounds the neural cord. As the forebrain develops, the neural cord within it becomes a ventricle, ultimately forming the lateral ventricles. Along the inner surface of both ventricles, the ventricular wall remains thin, and a [[choroid plexus]] develops, producing and releasing CSF.&lt;ref name=LARSEN2009 /&gt; CSF quickly fills the neural canal.&lt;ref name=LARSEN2009&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gary C. |last1=Schoenwolf |first2=William James |last2=Larsen |title=Larsen's human embryology |year=2009 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-443-06811-9 |chapter=Development of the Brain and Cranial Nerves |edition=4th}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arachnoid villi are formed around the 35th week of development, with arachnoid granulations noted around the 39th, and continuing developing until 18 months of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

The [[subcommissural organ]] secretes [[SCO-spondin]], which forms [[Reissner's fiber]] within CSF assisting movement through the cerebral aqueduct. It is present in early intrauterine life but disappears during early development.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

==Physiology==

===Function===
CSF serves several purposes:

#'''Buoyancy:''' The actual [[mass]] of the [[human brain]] is about 1400–1500 grams; however, the net [[weight]] of the brain suspended in CSF is equivalent to a mass of 25-50 grams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Human Nervous System |last= Noback |first= Charles |author2=Norman L. Strominger|author3=Robert J. Demarest|author4=David A. Ruggiero |year= 2005 |publisher= Humana Press  |isbn= 978-1-58829-040-3 |page= 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lai|first2=James T. F.|last3=Sinclair|first3=Alexandra J.|date=26 January 2012|title=Cerebrospinal fluid and lumbar puncture: a practical review|journal=Journal of Neurology|volume=259|issue=8|pages=1530–1545|doi=10.1007/s00415-012-6413-x|pmid=22278331|last1=Wright|first1=Ben L. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain therefore exists in [[neutral buoyancy]], which allows the brain to maintain its [[density]] without being impaired by its own weight, which would cut off blood supply and kill [[neuron]]s in the lower sections without CSF.&lt;ref name=SALADIN2012 /&gt;
#'''Protection:''' CSF protects the brain tissue from injury when jolted or hit, by providing a fluid buffer that acts as a [[shock absorber]] from some forms of mechanical injury.&lt;ref name=WRIGHT2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SALADIN2012 /&gt;
#'''Prevention of brain [[ischemia]]:''' The prevention of brain ischemia is aided by decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total [[intracranial pressure]] and facilitates blood [[perfusion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt;
#'''[[Homeostasis]]:''' CSF allows for regulation of the distribution of substances between cells of the brain,&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;  and [[neuroendocrine]] factors, to which slight changes can cause problems or damage to the nervous system. For example, high [[glycine]] [[concentration]] disrupts [[temperature]] and [[blood pressure]] control, and high CSF [[pH]] causes [[dizziness]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SALADIN2012&quot; /&gt;
#'''Clearing waste:''' CSF allows for the removal of waste products from the brain,&lt;ref name=WRIGHT2012 /&gt; and is critical in the brain's [[lymphatic system]].&lt;ref name=Iliff&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Iliff JJ, Wang M, Liao Y |title=A paravascular pathway facilitates CSF flow through the brain parenchyma and the clearance of interstitial solutes, including amyloid β |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=147 |pages=147ra111 |date=August 2012  |pmid=22896675 |pmc=3551275 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3003748|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metabolic waste products [[diffusion|diffuse]] rapidly into CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF is absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;Allan H.

The brain produces roughly 500&amp;nbsp;mL of cerebrospinal fluid per day,&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; at a rate of about 25&amp;nbsp;mL an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt; This [[transcellular fluid]] is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125–150&amp;nbsp;mL is present at any one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt;

CSF volume is higher on a mL/kg basis in children compared to adults. Infants have a CSF volume of 4 mL/kg, children have a CSF volume of 3 mL/kg, and adults have a CSF volume of 1.5-2 mL/kg. A high CSF volume is why a larger dose of local anesthetic, on a mL/kg basis, is needed in infants.  Additionally, the larger CSF volume may be one reason as to why children have lower rates of postdural puncture headache.&lt;ref&gt;Janssens E, et al. &quot;Post-dural puncture headaches in children. A literature review.&quot; European Journal of Peds. 2003:162(3);117-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Sites of production--&gt;Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is produced by the [[choroid plexus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the [[Ventricular system|four ventricles]] of the brain. It is present throughout the [[ventricular system]] except for the [[cerebral aqueduct]], and the  [[Lateral ventricles#Structure|frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles]].&lt;ref name=Young292&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Paul A.|title=Basic clinical neuroscience|year=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-5319-7|page=292|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; CSF is also produced by the [[simple columnar epithelium|single layer of column-shaped]] [[ependymal cell]]s which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the [[subarachnoid space]]; and a small amount directly from the [[perivascular space|tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels]] around the brain.&lt;ref name=GH2005&gt;{{cite book |first1=Arthur C. |last1=Guyton |first2=John Edward |last2=Hall |title=Textbook of medical physiology |year=2005 |publisher=W.B.

&lt;!--Mechanism of production in choroid plexi--&gt;CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of [[blood plasma|plasma]] moves from [[Capillary#Fenestrated|fenestrated capillaries]] in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space,&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt; with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; This fluid then needs to pass through the [[epithelium]] cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[chloride]] that draws water into CSF by creating [[osmotic pressure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain [[tight junctions]] between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into CSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology|date=2011|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4160-4574-8|edition=12th|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|page=749|last1=Hall|first1=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cilium#Motile cilia|Cilia]] on the apical surfaces of the ependymal cells beat to help transport the CSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kishimoto&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishimoto|first=N|last2=Sawamoto|first2=K|date=February 2012|title=Planar polarity of ependymal cilia.|url=|journal=Differentiation|volume=83|issue=2|pages=86–90|pmid=22101065|doi=10.1016/j.diff.2011.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Second step--&gt;[[Water]] and [[carbon dioxide]] from the interstitial fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, [[carbonic anhydrase]] converts the substances into [[bicarbonate]] and [[hydrogen ions]]. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen.&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; This creates [[osmotic pressure]] and draws water into CSF,&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; facilitated by [[aquaporin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain [[Pauling's principle of electroneutrality|electroneutrality]].&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of CSF.&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein.&lt;ref name=SALADIN2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saladin |first1=Kenneth |title=Anatomy and Physiology |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2012 |pages=519–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, [[iodine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Venturi S, Venturi M |title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective |journal=Human Evolution- |volume= 29 |issue= 1–3 |pages=185–205 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vitamin B1|vitamins B1]], [[Vitamin B12|B12]], [[Vitamin C|C]], [[folate]], [[beta-2 microglobulin]], [[arginine vasopressin]] and [[nitric oxide]] into CSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; A [[Na-K-Cl cotransporter]] and [[Na/K ATPase]] found on the surface of the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt;

Orešković and Klarica hypothesise that CSF is not primarily produced by the choroid plexus, but is being permanently produced inside the entire CSF system, as a consequence of water filtration through the capillary walls into the interstitial fluid of the surrounding brain tissue, regulated by [[Aquaporin 4|AQP-4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmc4118619&quot;/&gt;

There are circadian variations in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating to differences in the activation of the [[autonomic nervous system]] over the course of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

Choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle produces CSF from the arterial blood provided by the [[anterior choroidal artery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zagórska-Świeży|first=K.|last2=Litwin|first2=J.

===Reabsorption===
CSF returns to the vascular system by entering the [[dural venous sinuses]] via [[arachnoid granulation]]s.&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; These are outpouchings of the [[arachnoid mater]] into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage.&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; CSF has also been seen to drain into [[lymph]]atic vessels,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid156243202&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=The importance of lymphatics in cerebrospinal fluid transport|journal=Lymphat. Res. Biol.|volume=1|issue=1|pages=41–4|doi=10.1089/15396850360495682|pmid=15624320|author=Johnston M}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the [[olfactory nerve]] through the [[cribriform plate]]. The pathway and extent are currently not known,&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt; but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the [[neonate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; CSF turns over at a rate of three to four times a day.&lt;ref name=GH2005/&gt; CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of [[cranial nerves|cranial]] and [[spinal nerve]] sheathes, and through the ependyma.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

===Regulation===
The composition and rate of CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there is less of a pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; The [[autonomic nervous system]] influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the [[sympathetic nervous system]] increasing secretion and the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] decreasing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Changes in the [[pH#Living systems|pH of the blood]] can affect the activity of [[carbonic anhydrase]], and some drugs (such as [[frusemide]], acting on the [[Na-Cl cotransporter]]) have the potential to impact membrane channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

CSF pressure, as measured by [[lumbar puncture]], is 10–18&amp;nbsp;[[Centimetre of water|cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (8–15&amp;nbsp;[[mmHg]] or 1.1–2&amp;nbsp;[[kilopascal|kPa]]) with the patient lying on the side and 20–30 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (16–24&amp;nbsp;mmHg or 2.1–3.2&amp;nbsp;kPa) with the patient sitting up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter14/chapter14CSF.html|title=Chapter 14 – Cerebrospinal Fluid :THE NORMAL CSF|date=May 2011|publisher=Northeast Ohio Medical University|work=Neuropathology|author=Dimitri Agamanolis|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 [[centimetre of water|cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] (4.4–7.3&amp;nbsp;mmHg or 0.78–0.98&amp;nbsp;kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of [[jugular vein]]s in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the [[intracranial pressure]].

[[Hydrocephalus]] is an abnormal accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Nicki R. |editor1-last=Colledge |editor2-first=Brian R. |editor2-last=Walker |editor3-first=Stuart H. |editor3-last=Ralston |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine |year=2010 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7020-3084-0 |edition=21st |pages=1220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocephalus can occur because of [[obstructive hydrocephalus|obstruction]] of the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or [[congenital abnormality]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017 /&gt; [[normal pressure hydrocephalus|Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure]] may also occur.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt; Symptoms can include [[gait dysfunction|problems with gait]] and [[Motor coordination|coordination]], [[urinary incontinence]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], and progressively impaired [[cognition]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017 /&gt; In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as the bones of the skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness.&lt;ref name=NIH2017 /&gt; A [[CT scan]] or [[MRI scan]] may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions,&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017 /&gt; and [[lumbar puncture]] may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasper|first1=Dennis|last2=Fauci|first2=Anthony|last3=Hauser|first3=Stephen|last4=Longo|first4=Dan|last5=Jameson|first5=J.|last6=Loscalzo|first6=Joseph|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|date=2015|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-180215-4|edition=19|p=2606–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, such as a [[ventriculo-peritoneal shunt]], which diverts fluid to another part of the body.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NIH2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Hydrocephalus-Fact-Sheet|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|publisher=National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension]] is a condition of unknown cause characterized by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, [[double vision]], difficulties seeing, and a [[Papilledema|swollen optic disc]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt; It can occur in association with the use of Vitamin A and [[tetracycline]] antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger [[obese]] women.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt; Management may include ceasing any known causes, a [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]] such as [[acetazolamide]], repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010B /&gt;

===CSF leak===
[[Cerebrospinal fluid leak|CSF can leak]] from the [[dura mater|dura]] as a result of different causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from [[idiopathy|no known cause]] when it is termed a [[spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt; It is usually associated with [[intracranial hypotension]]: low CSF pressure.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2015 /&gt; It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing,&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2015 /&gt; as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to &quot;sag&quot; downwards and put pressure on its lower structures.&lt;ref name=HARRISONS2015 /&gt; If a leak is identified, a [[beta-2 transferrin]] test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Nicki R. |editor1-last=Colledge |editor2-first=Brian R. |editor2-last=Walker |editor3-first=Stuart H. |editor3-last=Ralston |title=Davidson's principles and practice of medicine |year=2010 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-7020-3084-0 |edition=21st |pages=1147–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medical imaging]] such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified.&lt;ref name=&quot;PALDINO2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paldino|first1=Michael|last2=Mogilner|first2=Alon Y.|last3=Tenner|first3=Michael S.|title=Intracranial hypotension syndrome: a comprehensive review|journal=Neurosurgical Focus|date=December 2003|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1 p following ECP4|doi=10.3171/foc.2003.15.6.8|pmid=15376362}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caffeine]], given either orally or [[intravenous]]ly, often offers symptomatic relief.&lt;ref name=PALDINO2003 /&gt; Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural space (an [[epidural blood patch]]), [[spinal surgery]], or [[fibrin glue]].&lt;ref name=PALDINO2003 /&gt;

===Lumbar puncture===
[[Image:4 vials of human cerebrospinal fluid.jpg|thumb|Vials containing human cerebrospinal fluid.]]
{{Main|Lumbar puncture}}
CSF can be tested for the diagnosis of a variety of [[neurological disease]]s, usually obtained by a procedure called [[lumbar puncture]].&lt;ref name=AMP2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seehusen DA, Reeves MM, Fomin DA |title=CSF analysis |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=1103–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14524396 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20030915/1103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth [[lumbar vertebrae]]. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt; About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture,&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt; and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, [[meningitis]] or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.&lt;ref name=WRIGHT2012/&gt;

Testing often including observing the colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying [[white blood cell|white]] and [[red blood cell]]s within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and [[Microbiological culture|culturing]] the fluid.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMP2003&quot; /&gt; The presence of red blood cells and [[xanthochromia]] may indicate [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]; whereas [[central nervous system]] infections such as [[meningitis]], may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels.&lt;ref name=AMP2003/&gt; A CSF culture may yield the [[microorganism]] that has caused the infection,&lt;ref name=&quot;DAVIDSONS2010&quot;/&gt; or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] may be used to identify a viral cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMP2003&quot; /&gt; Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]], [[paraneoplastic syndrome]]s, [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[neurosarcoidosis]], [[cerebral angiitis]];&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt; and specific [[antibodies]] such as [[Aquaporin 4]] may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of [[autoimmune]] conditions.&lt;ref name=WRIGHT2012/&gt; A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including [[idiopathic intracranial hypertension]] and [[normal pressure hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name=WRIGHT2012/&gt;

Lumbar puncture can also be performed to measure the [[intracranial pressure]], which might be increased in certain types of [[hydrocephalus]]. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if increased intracranial pressure is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because it can lead to fatal [[brain herniation]].&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONS2010 /&gt;

===Anaesthesia and chemotherapy===
{{See also|Blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier}}
Some [[anesthetic|anaesthetics]] and [[chemotherapy]] are injected [[intrathecal]]ly into the subarachnoid space, where they spread around CSF, meaning substances that cannot cross the [[blood-brain barrier]] can still be active throughout the central nervous system.&lt;ref name=HOCKING2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrathecal Chemotherapy for Cancer Treatment {{!}} CTCA|url=http://www.cancercenter.com/treatments/intrathecal-chemotherapy/|website=CancerCenter.com|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Baricity]] refers to the density of a substance compared to the density of human cerebrospinal fluid and is used in [[regional anesthesia]] to determine the manner in which a particular drug will spread in the [[intrathecal]] space.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOCKING2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hocking|first1=G.|title=Intrathecal drug spread|journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia|date=1 October 2004|volume=93|issue=4|pages=568–578|doi=10.1093/bja/aeh204|pmid=15220175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Various comments by ancient physicians have been read as referring to CSF. [[Hippocrates]] discussed &quot;water&quot; surrounding the brain when describing congenital [[hydrocephalus]], and [[Galen]] referred to &quot;excremental liquid&quot; in the ventricles of the brain, which he believed was purged into the nose. But for some 16 intervening centuries of ongoing anatomical study, CSF remained unmentioned in the literature. This is perhaps because of the prevailing autopsy technique, which involved cutting off the head, thereby removing evidence of CSF before the brain was examined.&lt;ref name=CSFhistory /&gt;

The modern rediscovery of CSF is credited to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. In a manuscript written between 1741 and 1744, unpublished in his lifetime, Swedenborg referred to CSF as &quot;spirituous lymph&quot; secreted from the roof of the fourth ventricle down to the medulla oblongata and spinal cord. This manuscript was eventually published in translation in 1887.&lt;ref name=CSFhistory&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hajdu SI |title=A note from history: discovery of the cerebrospinal fluid |journal=Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=334–6 |year=2003 |pmid=12956452 |url=http://www.annclinlabsci.org/content/33/3/334.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albrecht von Haller]], a Swiss physician and physiologist, made note in his 1747 book on physiology that the &quot;water&quot; in the brain was secreted into the ventricles and absorbed in the veins, and when secreted in excess, could lead to hydrocephalus.&lt;ref name=CSFhistory/&gt; [[Francois Magendie]] studied the properties of CSF by vivisection. He discovered the foramen Magendie, the opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle, but mistakenly believed that CSF was secreted by the [[pia mater]].&lt;ref name=CSFhistory/&gt;

[[Thomas Willis]] (noted as the discoverer of the [[circle of Willis]]) made note of the fact that the consistency of CSF is altered in meningitis.&lt;ref name=CSFhistory/&gt; In 1869 [[Gustav Schwalbe]] proposed that CSF drainage could occur via lymphatic vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;WRIGHT2012&quot; /&gt;

In 1891, [[W. Essex Wynter]] began treating tubercular meningitis by removing CSF from the subarachnoid space, and [[Heinrich Quincke]] began to popularize lumbar puncture, which he advocated for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref name=CSFhistory/&gt; In 1912, a neurologist William Mestrezat gave the first accurate description of the chemical composition of CSF.&lt;ref name=CSFhistory/&gt; In 1914, [[Harvey W. Cushing]] published conclusive evidence that CSF is secreted by the [[choroid plexus]].&lt;ref name=CSFhistory/&gt;

==Other animals==
During [[phylogenesis]], CSF is present within the [[neuraxis]] before it circulates.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; The CSF of [[Teleostei]] fish is contained within the ventricles of the brains, but not in a nonexistent subarachnoid space.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, CSF is present in it.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt; Absorption of CSF is seen in [[amniote]]s and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAKKA2011&quot;/&gt;

The amount of cerebrospinal fluid varies by size and species.&lt;ref name=&quot;REECE2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reece|first1=William O.|title=Functional Anatomy and Physiology of Domestic Animals|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-68589-1|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C_q3Q-IpkNMC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=cerebrospinal+fluid+and+animals#v=onepage|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and other [[mammal]]s, cerebrospinal fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed in a similar manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3–5 times a day.&lt;ref name=REECE2013 /&gt; Problems with CSF circulation leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.&lt;ref name=REECE2013 /&gt;
