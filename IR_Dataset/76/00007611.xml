She is best remembered as a leader in the fight for [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], as a co-founder and co-editor with her brother [[Max Eastman]] of the radical arts and politics magazine ''[[The Liberator (magazine)|The Liberator]],'' co-founder of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], and co-founder in 1920 of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. In 2000 she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Crystal Catherine Eastman in 1915.jpg|left|thumb|Crystal Catherine Eastman in 1915.]]
Crystal Eastman was born in [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]], on June 25, 1881, the third of four children. Her oldest brother, Morgan, was born in 1878 and died in 1884. The second brother, Anstice Ford Eastman, who became a general surgeon, was born in 1878 and died in 1937. Max was the youngest, born in 1882.

In 1883 their parents, Samuel Elijah Eastman and Annis Bertha Ford, moved the family to [[Canandaigua, New York]].  In 1889, their mother became one of the first women ordained as a [[Protestant]] minister in America when she became a minister of the [[Congregational church]].&lt;ref&gt;Ida Harper Husted, &quot;A Woman Minister Who Presides Over a Large Eastern Church.&quot; ''The San Francisco Chronicle,'' January 27, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was also a Congregational minister, and the two served as pastors at the church of [[Thomas K. Beecher]] near [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]]. Her parents were friendly with writer [[Mark Twain]]. From this association young Crystal also became acquainted with him.

This part of New York was in the so-called &quot;[[Burned-over district|Burnt Over District]].&quot; During the [[Second Great Awakening]] earlier in the 19th century, its frontier had been a center of evangelizing and much religious excitement, which resulted in the founding of the [[Shakers]] and [[Mormonism]]. During the antebellum period, some were inspired by religious ideals to support such progressive social causes as [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] and the [[Underground Railroad]].

Crystal and her brother [[Max Eastman]] were influenced by this humanitarian tradition. He became a [[socialism|socialist]] activist in his early life, and Crystal had several common causes with him. They were close throughout her life, even after he had become more conservative.&lt;ref name=nwhm&gt;

The siblings lived together for several years on 11th Street in [[Greenwich Village]] among other radical activists.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Humphrey, ''Children of Fantasy: The First Rebels of Greenwich Village'' (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The group, including [[Ida Rauh]], [[Inez Milholland]], [[Floyd Dell]], and [[Doris Stevens]], also spent summers and weekends in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Eastman, ''Love and Revolution: My Journey Through an Epoch,'' (New York: Random House, 1964): 79–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastman graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1903 and received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in sociology (then a relatively new field) from [[Columbia University]] in 1904. Gaining her law degree from [[New York University Law School]], she graduated second in the class of 1907.&lt;ref name=brittanica /&gt;&lt;ref name=vassar&gt;{{cite web

==Social efforts==

Social work pioneer and journal editor [[Paul Kellogg]] offered Eastman her first job, investigating labor conditions for [[The Pittsburgh Survey]] sponsored by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]].&lt;ref name=brittanica /&gt;&lt;ref name=iup&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her report, ''Work Accidents and the Law'' (1910), became a classic and resulted in the first [[workers' compensation]] law, which she drafted while serving on a New York state commission.&lt;ref name=brittanica /&gt;

She continued to campaign for occupational safety and health while working as an investigating attorney for the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations during [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency. She was at one time called the &quot;most dangerous woman in America,&quot; due to her [[free-love]] idealism and outspoken nature.

==Emancipation==

During a brief marriage to Wallace J. Benedict, which ended in divorce, Eastman moved to [[Milwaukee]] with him. There she managed the unsuccessful 1912 [[Wisconsin]] [[suffrage]] campaign.&lt;ref name=nwhm /&gt;

When she returned east in 1913, she joined [[Alice Paul]], [[Lucy Burns]], and others in founding the militant [[Congressional Union]], which became the [[National Woman's Party]]. After the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] gave women the right to vote in 1920, Eastman and Paul wrote the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], first introduced in 1923. One of the few socialists to endorse the ERA, Eastman warned that protective legislation for women would mean only discrimination against women. Eastman claimed that one could assess the importance of the ERA by the intensity of the opposition to it, but she felt that it was still a struggle worth fighting. She also delivered the speech, &quot;Now We Can Begin&quot;, following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, outlining the work that needed to be done in the political and economic spheres to achieve gender equality.

==Peace efforts==

[[File:Eastman-Crystal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Crystal Eastman was a noted anti-militarist, who helped found the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].]]
During [[World War I]], Eastman was one of the founders of the [[Woman's Peace Party]], soon joined by [[Jane Addams]], [[Lillian D. Wald]], and others.&lt;ref name=msmagazine&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as president of the New York City branch. Renamed the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]] in 1921, it remains the oldest extant women's peace organization. Eastman also became executive director of the [[American Union Against Militarism]], which lobbied against America's entrance into the European war and more successfully against war with Mexico in 1916, sought to remove profiteering from arms manufacturing, and campaigned against [[conscription]], imperial adventures and [[military intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i|title=Examining the American peace movement prior to World War I|date=April 6, 2017|website=America Magazine|accessdate=October 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the United States entered World War I, Eastman organized with [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]] and [[Norman Thomas]] the [[National Civil Liberties Bureau]] to protect [[conscientious objectors]], or in her words: &quot;To maintain something over here that will be worth coming back to when the weary war is over.&quot; The NCLB grew into the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], with Baldwin at the head and Eastman functioning as attorney-in-charge. Eastman is credited as a founding member of the ACLU, but her role as founder of the NCLB may have been largely ignored by posterity due to her personal differences with Baldwin.&lt;ref name=vassar /&gt;

==Marriage and family==
In 1916 Eastman married the British editor and antiwar activist [[Walter Fuller (editor)|Walter Fuller]], who had come to the United States to direct his sisters’ singing of folksongs.&lt;ref&gt;G. Peter Winnington, ''Walter Fuller: The Man Who Had Ideas.'' Letterworth Press, 2014. pp.188–90&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two children, [[Jeffrey Fuller|Jeffrey]] and Annis.  They worked together as activists until the end of the war; then he worked as the managing editor of ''The Freeman'' until 1922, when he returned to England. He died in 1927, nine months before Crystal, ending his career editing ''[[Radio Times]]'' for the [[BBC]].

After Max Eastman's periodical ''[[The Masses]]'' was forced to close by government censorship in 1917, he and Crystal co-founded a radical journal of politics, art, and literature, ''[[The Liberator (United States magazine)|The Liberator]]'', early in 1918.&lt;ref name=nwhm /&gt; She and Max co-edited it until they put it in the hands of faithful friends in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;G. Peter Winnington, ''Walter Fuller: The Man Who Had Ideas,'' p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-War===
After the war, Eastman organized the [[First Feminist Congress]] in 1919.

At times she traveled by ship to London to be with her husband. In New York, her activities led to her being blacklisted during the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] of 1919–1920. She struggled to find paying work. Her only paid work during the 1920s was as a columnist for feminist journals, notably ''[[Equal Rights (journal)|Equal Rights]]'' and ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]''.

Eastman claimed that &quot;life was a big battle for the complete feminist,&quot; but she was convinced that the complete feminist would someday achieve total victory.

===Death===
Crystal Eastman died on July 8, 1928, of [[nephritis]].&lt;ref name=vassar /&gt; Her friends were entrusted with her two children, then orphans, to rear them until adulthood.

==Legacy==
Eastman has been called one of the United States' most neglected leaders, because, although she wrote pioneering legislation and created long-lasting political organizations, she disappeared from history for fifty years. [[Freda Kirchwey]], then editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', wrote at the time of her death: &quot;When she spoke to people—whether it was to a small committee or a swarming crowd—hearts beat faster. She was for thousands a symbol of what the free woman might be.&quot;&lt;ref name=vassar /&gt;

Her speech &quot;Now We Can Begin&quot;, given in 1920, is listed as #83 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).&lt;ref name=&quot;americanrhetoric1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E.

In 2000 Eastman was inducted into the (American) [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].

In 2018 ''The Socialist'', the official publication of the [[Socialist Party USA]], published the article &quot;Remembering Socialist Feminist Crystal Eastman&quot; by Lisa Petriello, which was written &quot;on the 90th-year anniversary of her [Eastman's] death to bring her life and legacy once again to the public eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesocialist.us/remembering-socialist-feminist-crystal-eastman/|title=Remembering Socialist Feminist Crystal Eastman|date=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
