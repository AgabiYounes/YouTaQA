'''Cetaceans''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|t|eɪ|ʃ|ə|n|s}}) (from {{lang-la|[[Cetus (mythology)|cetus]]|lit=[[whale]]}}, from {{lang-grc|κῆτος|translit=[[Cetus (mythology)|kētos]]|lit=huge fish}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://aquaticmammalsjournal.org/share/AquaticMammalsIssueArchives/2001/AquaticMammals_27-02/27-02_Ranneft.PDF |first1=D. |last1=M.

Davis |year=2001 |title=A guide to the pronunciation and meaning of cetacean taxonomic names |journal=Aquatic Mammals |volume=27 |issue=2 |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; are  [[aquatic mammal]]s constituting the [[infraorder]] '''Cetacea'''. There are around 89 living species, which are divided into two [[parvorder]]s. The first is the [[Odontoceti]], the toothed whales, which consist of around 70 species, including the [[dolphin]] (which includes [[killer whale]]s), [[porpoise]], [[beluga whale]], [[narwhal]], [[sperm whale]], and [[beaked whale]]. The second is the [[Mysticeti]], the [[baleen]] (from {{lang-la|balæna|lit=whale|label=Latin}}) whales, which have a filter-feeder system, and consist of fifteen species divided into three families, and include the [[blue whale]], [[right whale]], [[bowhead whale]], [[rorqual]], and [[gray whale]].
 
The ancient and extinct ancestors of modern whales ([[Archaeoceti]]) lived 53 to 45 million years ago. They diverged from [[even-toed ungulate]]s; their closest living relatives are [[hippopotamus]]es and others such as [[cow]]s and [[pig]]s. They were [[semiaquatic]] and evolved in the shallow waters that separated India from Asia.  Around 30 species adapted to a fully oceanic life.  Baleen whales split from toothed whales around 34 million years ago.

The smallest cetacean is [[Maui's dolphin]], at {{convert|1|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} and {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}}; the largest is the [[blue whale]],&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite web | title = Assessment and Update Status Report on the Blue Whale ''Balaenoptera musculus'' | publisher = Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada | year = 2002 | url = http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/cosewic/sr_blue_whale_e.pdf | accessdate = 19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; at  {{convert|29.9|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} and {{convert|173|t|lbs|abbr=on|adj=on}}. Baleen whales have a [[somatosensory system|tactile system]] in the short hairs ([[vibrissae]]) around their mouth; toothed whales also develop vibrissae, but lose them during fetal development or shortly after birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tinker |first1=Spencer Wilkie |title=Whales of the World |date=Jan 1, 1988 |publisher=Nature |isbn=0935848479 |page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving behind electroreceptive vibrissal crypts in some species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czech-Damal |first1=Nicole U. |last2=Liebschner |first2=Alexander |last3=Miersch |first3=Lars |last4=Klauer |first4=Gertrude |last5=Hanke |first5=Frederike D. |last6=Marshall |first6=Christopher |last7=Dehnhardt |first7=Guido |last8=Hanke |first8=Wolf |title=Electroreception in the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=20 July 2011 |volume=279 |issue=1729 |pages=663-668 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1127 |pmid=21795271 |url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2011.1127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cetaceans have well-developed senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water. They have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin to maintain body heat in cold water. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]. Two external forelimbs are modified into [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]]; two internal hindlimbs are [[vestigial]]. Cetaceans have streamlined bodies: they can swim very quickly, with the killer whale able to travel at {{convert|35|mph|kph|order=flip}} in short bursts, the [[fin whale]] able to cruise at {{convert|30|mph|kph|order=flip}}, dolphins able to make very tight turns at high speeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=E. Fish|first=Frank|year=2002|title=Balancing Requirements for Stability and Maneuverability in Cetaceans|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/1/85.full|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=42|issue=1|pages=85–93|doi=10.1093/icb/42.1.85|pmid=21708697}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species diving to great depths.

Although cetaceans are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They spend their lives in the water of seas and rivers; having to mate, give birth, [[moulting|molt]] or escape from predators, like killer whales, underwater. This has been enabled by unique evolutionary adaptations in their physiology and anatomy. They feed largely on fish and [[marine invertebrates]]; but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals and birds, such as [[penguin]]s and seals. Some baleen whales (mainly [[gray whale]]s and right whales) are specialised for feeding on [[Benthic zone|benthic]] creatures. Male cetaceans typically mate with more than one female ([[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]]), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. Cetaceans are not known to have [[pair bond]]s. Male cetacean strategies for [[reproductive success]] vary between herding females, defending potential mates from other males, or [[whale song]] which attracts mates. Calves are typically born in the fall and winter months, and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species [[fasting|fast]] and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time, which is more typical of baleen whales as their main food source (invertebrates) aren't found in their breeding and calving grounds ([[tropics]]). Cetaceans produce a number of [[animal communication|vocalizations]], notably the clicks and whistles of dolphins and the moaning songs of the [[humpback whale]].

The meat, blubber and oil of cetaceans have traditionally been used by [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples of the Arctic]]. Cetaceans have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins are commonly kept in captivity and are even sometimes trained to perform tricks and tasks, other cetaceans aren't as often kept in captivity (with usually unsuccessful attempts). Cetaceans have been extensively [[whaling|hunted]] by commercial industries for their products, although hunting the largest whales is now forbidden by international law. The [[baiji]] (Chinese river dolphin) has become &quot;Possibly Extinct&quot; in the past century, while the [[vaquita]] and [[Yangtze finless porpoise]] are ranked [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. Besides hunting, cetaceans also face threats from [[bycatch|accidental trapping]] and environmental hazards such as [[marine pollution]], [[Noise pollution#Wildlife|noise pollution]] and ongoing climate change.

== Baleen whales and toothed whales ==
{{Refimprovesection|date=November 2019}}
The two parvorders, [[baleen whale]]s (Mysticeti) and [[toothed whale]]s (Odontoceti), are thought to have diverged around thirty-four million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerchio|first=Salvatore|last2=Tucker|first2=Priscilla|date=1998-06-01|title=Influence of Alignment on the mtDNA Phylogeny of Cetacea: Questionable Support for a Mysticeti/Physeteroidea Clade|journal=Systematic Biology|volume=47|issue=2|pages=336–344|doi=10.1080/106351598260941|pmid=12064231|issn=1076-836X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baleen whales have bristles made of [[keratin]] instead of [[teeth]]. The bristles filter [[krill]] and other small [[invertebrate]]s from seawater. [[Grey whale]]s feed on bottom-dwelling mollusks. [[Rorqual]] [[Family (biology)|family]] (balaenopterids) use throat pleats to expand their mouths to take in food and sieve out the water. [[Balaenidae|Balaenids]] ([[right whales]] and [[bowhead whales]]) have massive heads that can make up 40% of their body mass. Most mysticetes prefer the food-rich colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, migrating to the Equator to give birth. During this process, they are capable of fasting for several months, relying on their fat reserves.

The parvorder of Odontocetes – the toothed whales – include sperm whales, beaked whales, killer whales, dolphins and porpoises. Generally the teeth are designed for catching fish, squid or other [[marine invertebrates]], not for chewing them, so prey is swallowed whole. Teeth are shaped like cones (dolphins and sperm whales), spades ([[porpoise]]s), pegs ([[Beluga whale|beluga]]s), tusks ([[narwhals]]) or variable (beaked whale males). Female beaked whales' teeth are hidden in the gums and are not visible, and most male beaked whales have only two short tusks. Narwhals have vestigial teeth other than their tusk, which is present on males and 15% of females and has millions of nerves to sense water temperature, pressure and salinity. A few toothed whales, such as some [[killer whale]]s, feed on mammals, such as [[pinnipeds]] and other whales.

Toothed whales have well-developed senses – their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have advanced [[Animal echolocation#Toothed whales|sonar capabilities]] using their [[melon (cetacean)|melon]].  Their hearing is so well-adapted for both air and water that some blind specimens can survive. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths. Several species of toothed whales show [[sexual dimorphism]], in which the males differ from the females, usually for purposes of sexual display or aggression.

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Dolphin Anatomy.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Dolphin anatomy]]

Cetacean bodies are generally similar to that of fish, which can be attributed to their lifestyle and the habitat conditions. Their body is well-adapted to their habitat, although they share essential characteristics with other higher mammals ([[Eutheria]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Groves |last2=Colin |first3=Peter |last3=Grubb |title=Ungulate taxonomy |newspaper=JHU Press |year=2011}} {{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have a streamlined shape, and their forelimbs are flippers. Almost all have a [[dorsal fin]] on their backs that can take on many forms depending on the species. A few species, such as the [[beluga whale]], lack them. Both the flipper and the fin are for stabilization and steering in the water.

The male genitals and mammary glands of females are sunken into the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]], J.G.M.  |title=The Emergence of Whales: Evolutionary Patterns in the Origin of Cetacea |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8QPyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=(penis+OR+genital) |date=11 November 2013 |publisher=Springer  |isbn=978-1-4899-0159-0 |pages=383–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Debra Lee |title=Reproductive Biology and Phylogeny of Cetacea: Whales, Porpoises and Dolphins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sD3NBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=mammary%20genital&amp;f=false |date=2007 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4398-4257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body is wrapped in a thick layer of fat, known as [[blubber]], used for thermal insulation and gives cetaceans their smooth, streamlined body shape. In larger species, it can reach a thickness up to half a meter (1.6&amp;nbsp;ft).

[[Sexual dimorphism]] evolved in many toothed whales. Sperm whales, [[narwhal]]s, many members of the [[beaked whale]] family, several species of the [[porpoise]] family, killer whales, [[pilot whale]]s, eastern [[spinner dolphin]]s and [[northern right whale dolphin]]s show this characteristic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dines |first1=James |last2=Mesnick |first2=Sarah |last3=Ralls |first3=Katherine |last4=May-Collado |first4=Laura |last5=Agnarsson |first5=Ingi |last6=Dean |first6=Matthew |title=A trade-off between precopulatory and postcopulatory trait investment in male cetaceans |journal=Evolution |date=2015 |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=1560–1572 |doi=10.1111/evo.12676 |pmid=25929734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males in these species developed external features absent in females that are advantageous in combat or display. For example, male sperm whales are up to 63% percent larger than females, and many beaked whales possess tusks used in competition among males.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dalebout |first1=Merel |last2=Steel |first2=Debbie |last3=Baker |first3=Scott |title=Phylogeny of the Beaked Whale Genus ''Mesoplodon'' (Ziphiidae: Cetacea) Revealed by Nuclear Introns: Implications for the Evolution of Male Tusks|journal=Systematic Biology |date=2008 |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=857–875 |doi=10.1080/10635150802559257 |pmid=19085329}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hind legs are not present in cetaceans, nor are any other external body attachments such as a [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] and [[hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-05/uof-haw052206.php|title=How ancient whales lost their legs, got sleek and conquered the oceans|date=2006-05-22|website=EurekAlert|publisher=University of Florida|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head ===
Whales have an elongated head, especially [[baleen whales]], due to the wide overhanging jaw. Bowhead whale plates can be {{convert|9|m|ft}} long. Their nostril(s) make up the [[Blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], with one in toothed whales and two in baleen whales.

The nostrils are located on top of the head above the eyes so that the rest of the body can remain submerged while surfacing for air. The back of the skull is significantly shortened and deformed. By shifting the nostrils to the top of the head, the nasal passages extend perpendicularly through the skull.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klima1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Klima |title=Development of the Cetacean Nasal Skull|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOHAz9SCL54C |date=29 January 1999 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64996-0 |page= }} {{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teeth or baleen in the upper jaw sit exclusively on the [[maxilla]]. The braincase is concentrated through the nasal passage to the front and is correspondingly higher, with individual cranial bones that overlap.

In toothed whales, connective tissue exists in the [[melon (cetacean)|melon]] as a head buckle. This is filled with air sacs and fat that aid in buoyancy and [[biosonar]]. The sperm whale has a particularly pronounced melon; this is called the [[spermaceti organ]] and contains the eponymous [[spermaceti]], hence the name &quot;sperm whale&quot;. Even the long tusk of the narwhal is a vice-formed tooth. In many toothed whales, the depression in their skull is due to the formation of a large melon and multiple, asymmetric air bags.

[[River dolphin]]s, unlike most other cetaceans, can turn their head 90°. Other cetaceans have fused neck vertebrae and are unable to turn their head at all.

The [[baleen]] of baleen whales consists of long, fibrous strands of keratin. Located in place of the teeth, it has the appearance of a huge fringe and is used to sieve the water for [[plankton]] and krill.

=== Brain ===
The [[neocortex]] of many cetaceans is home to elongated [[spindle neurons]] that, prior to 2019, were known only in [[Hominidae|hominids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watson, K.K. |title=Dendritic architecture of the Von Economo neurons |journal=Neuroscience |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=1107–1112 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.084 |last2=Jones |first2=T. K. |last3=Allman |first3=J. M. |pmid=16797136}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, these cells are thought to be involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment and theory of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allman, John M. |title=Intuition and autism: a possible role for Von Economo neurons |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=367–373 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.06.008 |last2=Watson |first2=Karli K. |last3=Tetreault |first3=Nicole A. |last4=Hakeem |first4=Atiya Y. |pmid=16002323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cetacean [[spindle neuron]]s are found in areas of the brain homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting they perform a similar function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hof, Patrick R. |title=Structure of the cerebral cortex of the humpback whale, ''Megaptera novaeangliae'' (Cetacea, Mysticeti, Balaenopteridae) |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=290 |issue=1 |pages=1–31 |year=2007 |doi=10.1002/ar.20407 |last2=Van Der Gucht |first2=Estel |pmid=17441195}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brain size]] was previously considered a major indicator of [[intelligence]]. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for cognitive tasks. [[Allometric]] analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately two-thirds or three-quarter exponent of the body mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/courses/allometry/allometry.html |title=Allometry |first=Jim |last=Moore| publisher=University of California San Diego |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such an analysis provides an [[encephalization quotient]] that can be used as an indication of animal intelligence. Sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging {{convert|8,000|cm3|in3|abbr=on}} and {{convert|7.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in mature males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/cetaceans/spermwhale.htm |title=Sperm Whales brain size| publisher=NOAA Fisheries – Office of Protected Resources |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[brain to body mass ratio]] in some odontocetes, such as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/are-whales-smarter-than-we-are/ |author=Fields, R. Douglas |title=Are whales smarter than we are? | magazine=Scientific American |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some whales, however, it is less than half that of humans: 0.9% versus 2.1%. The [[sperm whale]] (''Physeter macrocephalus'') is the largest of all toothed predatory animals and possesses the largest brain.

The cetacean skeleton is largely made up of [[cortical bone]], which stabilizes the animal in the water. For this reason, the usual terrestrial compact bones, which are finely woven [[cancellous bone]], are replaced with lighter and more elastic material. In many places, bone elements are replaced by cartilage and even fat, thereby improving their [[hydrostatic]] qualities. The ear and the muzzle contain a bone shape that is exclusive to cetaceans with a high density, resembling [[porcelain]]. This conducts sound better than other bones, thus aiding [[biosonar]].

The number of [[vertebrae]] that make up the spine varies by species, ranging from forty to ninety-three. The [[cervical spine]], found in all mammals, consists of seven vertebrae which, however, are reduced or fused. This fusion provides stability during swimming at the expense of mobility. The fins are carried by the [[thoracic vertebrae]], ranging from nine to seventeen individual vertebrae. The [[sternum]] is cartilaginous. The last two to three pairs of ribs are not connected and hang freely in the body wall. The stable lumbar and tail include the other vertebrae. Below the [[caudal vertebrae]] is the [[chevron (anatomy)|chevron bone]].

The front limbs are paddle-shaped with shortened arms and elongated finger bones, to support movement. They are connected by cartilage. The second and third fingers display a proliferation of the finger members, a so-called hyperphalangy. The shoulder joint is the only functional joint in all cetaceans except for the [[Amazon river dolphin]]. The [[collarbone]] is completely absent.

=== Fluke ===
&lt;!--[[Fluke (tail)]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
[[File:Humpback whale fluke (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Humpback whale fluke]]
They have a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fluke at the end of their tails that is used for propulsion. The fluke is set horizontally on the body, unlike fish, which have vertical tails.

== Physiology ==

=== Circulation ===
Cetaceans have powerful hearts. Blood oxygen is distributed effectively throughout the body. They are warm-blooded, i.e., they hold a nearly constant body temperature.

=== Respiration ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

Cetaceans have lungs, meaning they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes to over two hours depending on the species. Cetacea are deliberate breathers who must be awake to inhale and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic.

The structure of the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[circulatory system]]s is of particular importance for the life of [[marine mammals]]. The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. The muscle pigment, [[myoglobin]], provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.

=== Organs ===
The stomach consists of three chambers. The first region is formed by a loose gland and a muscular forestomach (missing in beaked whales), which is then followed by the main stomach and the [[pylorus]]. Both are equipped with glands to help digestion. A bowel adjoins the stomachs, whose individual sections can only be distinguished [[Histology|histologically]]. The [[liver]] is large and separate from the [[gall bladder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. Edward Stevens|author2=Ian D.

The kidneys are long and flattened. The salt concentration in cetacean blood is lower than that in seawater, requiring kidneys to excrete salt. This allows the animals to drink [[seawater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clifford A.

=== Senses ===
Cetacean [[eye]]s are set on the sides rather than the front of the head. This means only species with pointed 'beaks' (such as dolphins) have good [[binocular vision]] forward and downward. [[Lacrimal gland|Tear glands]] secrete greasy tears, which protect the eyes from the salt in the water. The lens is almost spherical, which is most efficient at focusing the minimal light that reaches deep water. Cetaceans are known to possess excellent hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mead |first1=James |title=Cetacea |url=https://school.eb.com/levels/high/article/cetacean/105982 |website=Britannica School High |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=3 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one species, the [[tucuxi]] or Guiana dolphin, is able to use [[electroreception]] to sense prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Morell |first=Virginia |title=Guiana Dolphins Can Use Electric Signals to Locate Prey |work=Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) |date=July 2011 |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/07/guiana-dolphins-can-use-electric.html?ref=hp |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040210/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/07/guiana-dolphins-can-use-electric.html?ref=hp |archivedate=2013-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ears ===
[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Biosonar]]]]
The external ear has lost the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] (visible ear), but still retains a narrow [[external auditory meatus]]. To register sounds, instead, the posterior part of the [[mandible]] has a thin lateral wall (the pan bone) fronting a concavity that houses a fat pad. The pad passes anteriorly into the greatly enlarged [[mandibular foramen]] to reach in under the teeth and posteriorly to reach the thin lateral wall of the [[ectotympanic]]. The ectotympanic offers a reduced attachment area for the [[tympanic membrane]]. The connection between this auditory complex and the rest of the skull is reduced—to a single, small cartilage in [[oceanic dolphin]]s.

In odontocetes, the complex is surrounded by spongy tissue filled with air spaces, while in mysticetes, it is integrated into the skull as with land mammals. In odontocetes, the tympanic membrane (or ligament) has the shape of a folded-in umbrella that stretches from the ectotympanic ring and narrows off to the [[malleus]] (quite unlike the flat, circular membrane found in land mammals.) In mysticetes, it also forms a large protrusion (known as the &quot;glove finger&quot;), which stretches into the external [[External acoustic meatus|meatus]] and the [[stapes]] are larger than in odontocetes. In some [[Kogia|small sperm whales]], the malleus is fused with the ectotympanic.

The ear [[ossicles]] are [[Pachyosteosclerosis|pachyosteosclerotic]] (dense and compact) and differently shaped from land mammals (other aquatic mammals, such as [[sirenia]]ns and earless seals, have also lost their pinnae). T semicircular canals are much smaller relative to body size than in other mammals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen-Hearing&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]] | first = J. G.

The [[auditory bulla]] is separated from the skull and composed of two compact and dense bones (the periotic and tympanic) referred to as the tympanoperiotic complex. This complex is located in a cavity in the middle ear, which, in the Mysticeti, is divided by a bony projection and compressed between the exoccipital and squamosal, but in the odontoceti, is large and completely surrounds the bulla (hence called &quot;peribullar&quot;), which is, therefore, not connected to the skull except in [[Physeteroidea|physeterids]]. In the Odontoceti, the cavity is filled with a dense foam in which the bulla hangs suspended in five or more sets of ligaments. The pterygoid and peribullar [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinuses]] that form the cavity tend to be more developed in shallow water and riverine species than in [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] Mysticeti. In Odontoceti, the composite auditory structure is thought to serve as an acoustic isolator, analogous to the lamellar construction found in the temporal bone in [[bat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ketten | first = Darlene R. | chapter = The Marine Mammal Ear: Specializations for Aquatic Audition and Echolocation | pages = 717–750 | title = The Evolutionary Biology of Hearing | editor1-last = Webster | editor1-first = Douglas B. | editor2-last = Fay | editor2-first = Richard R. | editor3-last = Popper | editor3-first = Arthur N. | year = 1992 | publisher = Springer | chapter-url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230691464}} Pages 725–727 used here.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cetaceans use sound to [[communication|communicate]], using groans, moans, whistles, clicks or the 'singing' of the humpback whale.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Echolocation ===
[[Odontoceti]] are generally capable of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emm&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Perrin |editor1-first=William F. |editor2-last=Wursig |editor2-first=Bernd |editor3-last=[[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]]|editor3-first=J.

They can search for, chase and catch fast-swimming prey in total darkness. Most Odontoceti can distinguish between prey and nonprey (such as humans or boats); captive Odontoceti can be trained to distinguish between, for example, balls of different sizes or shapes. Echolocation clicks also contain characteristic details unique to each animal, which may suggest that toothed whales can discern between their own click and that of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obaldia2015Estimating&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author = de Obaldia, C., Simkus, G. &amp; and Zölzer, U. | title = Estimating the number of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) individuals based on grouping of corresponding clicks

=== Chromosomes ===
The initial [[karyotype]] includes a set of [[chromosome]]s from 2n = 44. They have four pairs of telocentric chromosomes (whose [[centromeres]] sit at one of the [[telomeres]]), two to four pairs of subtelocentric and one or two large pairs of submetacentric chromosomes. The remaining chromosomes are metacentric—the centromere is approximately in the middle—and are rather small. Sperm whales, beaked whales and right whales converge to a reduction in the number of chromosomes to 2n = 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ulfur Anarson|title=Comparative chromosome studies in Cetacea|journal=Institute of Genetics|year=1974|volume=77|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1974.tb01351.x|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==

=== Range and habitat ===
Cetaceans are found in many aquatic habitats. While many marine species, such as the [[blue whale]], the [[humpback whale]] and the [[killer whale]], have a distribution area that includes nearly the entire ocean, some species occur only locally or in broken populations. These include the vaquita, which inhabits a small part of the [[Gulf of California]] and [[Hector's dolphin]], which lives in some coastal waters in New Zealand. [[River dolphin]] species live exclusively in fresh water. 

Many species inhabit specific latitudes, often in tropical or subtropical waters, such as [[Bryde's whale]] or [[Risso's dolphin]]. Others are found only in a specific body of water. The [[southern right whale dolphin]] and the [[hourglass dolphin]] live only in the [[Southern Ocean]]. The [[narwhal]] and the [[beluga whale|beluga]] live only in the Arctic Ocean. [[Sowerby's beaked whale]] and the [[Clymene dolphin]] exist only in the Atlantic and the [[Pacific white-sided dolphin]] and the [[Lissodelphis borealis|northern straight dolphin]] live only in the North Pacific.

Cosmopolitan species may be found in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. However, northern and southern populations become genetically separated over time. In some species, this separation leads eventually to a divergence of the species, such as produced the [[southern right whale]], [[North Pacific right whale]] and [[North Atlantic right whale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=AR Hoelzel|title=Genetic structure of cetacean populations in sympatry, parapatry, and mixed assemblages: implications for conservation policy|journal=Journal of Heredity|year=1998|accessdate=5 September 2015|doi=10.1093/jhered/89.5.451|url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/5/451.short|volume=89|issue=5|pages=451–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migratory species' reproductive sites often lie in the tropics and their feeding grounds in polar regions.

Thirty-two species are found in European waters, including twenty-five toothed and seven baleen species.

=== Whale migration ===

Many species of whales migrate on a latitudinal basis to move between seasonal habitats. For example, the gray whale migrates 10,000 miles round trip. The journey begins at winter birthing grounds in warm lagoons along Baja California, and traverses 5,000-7,000 miles of coastline to summer feeding grounds in the Bering, Chuckchi and Beaufort seas off the coast of Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;https://journeynorth.org/tm/gwhale/annual/map.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behaviour ==

=== Sleep ===
Conscious breathing cetaceans sleep but cannot afford to be unconscious for long, because they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, toothed cetaceans in captivity have been recorded to exhibit [[unihemispheric slow-wave sleep]] (USWS), which means they sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sekiguchi, Yuske |author2=Arai, Kazutoshi |author3=Kohshima, Shiro |title=Sleep behaviour |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7096 |date=21 June 2006 | doi=10.1038/nature04898 |bibcode = 2006Natur.441E...9S |pages=E9–E10 |pmid=16791150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study found that sperm whales sleep in vertical postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales do not respond to passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = P.

=== Diving ===
{{see also|Physiology of underwater diving#Mammals}}
While diving, the animals reduce their oxygen consumption by lowering the heart activity and blood circulation; individual organs receive no oxygen during this time. Some [[rorqual]]s can dive for up to 40 minutes, [[sperm whales]] between 60 and 90 minutes and [[bottlenose whale]]s for two hours. Diving depths average about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Species such as sperm whales can dive to {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although more commonly {{convert|1,200|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scholander|first=Per Fredrik|title=Experimental investigations on the respiratory function in diving mammals and birds|year=1940|journal=Hvalraadets Skrifter|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bruno Cozzi|author2=Paola Bagnoli|author3=Fabio Acocella|author4=Maria Laura Costantino|title=Structure and biomechanical properties of the trachea of the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba: Evidence for evolutionary adaptations to diving|journal=The Anatomical Record|volume=284|issue=1|pages=500–510|year=2005|doi=10.1002/ar.a.20182|pmid=15791584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social relations ===
Most whales are social animals, although a few species live in pairs or are solitary. A group, known as a pod, usually consists of ten to fifty animals, but on occasion, such as mass availability of food or during mating season, groups may encompass more than one thousand individuals. Inter-species socialization can occur.&lt;ref name=mann&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Janet Mann|editor2=Richard C. Connor|editor3=Peter L. Tyack|editor4=Hal Whitehead| display-editors = 3|title=Cetacean Societies: Field Study of Dolphins and Whales|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pods have a fixed hierarchy, with the priority positions determined by biting, pushing or ramming. The behavior in the group is aggressive only in situations of stress such as lack of food, but usually it is peaceful. Contact swimming, mutual fondling and nudging are common. The playful behavior of the animals, which is manifested in air jumps, somersaults, surfing, or fin hitting, occurs more often than not in smaller cetaceans, such as dolphins and porpoises.&lt;ref name=mann /&gt;

=== Whale song ===
Males in some baleen species communicate via [[Whale vocalization|whale song]], sequences of high pitched sounds. These &quot;songs&quot; can be heard for hundreds of kilometers. Each population generally shares a distinct song, which evolves over time. Sometimes, an individual can be identified by its distinctive vocals, such as the [[52-hertz whale]] that sings at a higher frequency than other whales. Some individuals are capable of generating over 600 distinct sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann&quot; /&gt; In baleen species such as humpbacks, blues and fins, male-specific song is believed to be used to attract and display fitness to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janik |first1=Vincent |title=Cetacean vocal learning and communication |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |date=2014 |volume=28 |pages=60–65 |doi= 10.1016/j.conb.2014.06.010|pmid=25057816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hunting ===
Pod groups also hunt, often with other species. Many species of dolphins accompany large tunas on hunting expeditions, following large schools of fish. The killer whale hunts in pods and targets belugas and even larger whales. Humpback whales, among others, form in collaboration [[bubble net|bubble carpets]] to herd krill or plankton into bait balls before lunging at them.&lt;ref name=mann /&gt;

=== Intelligence ===
{{Main|Cetacean intelligence}}[[File:Whales Bubble Net Feeding-edit1.jpg|thumb|Bubble net feeding]]

Cetacea are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme and grieve.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwu&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Siebert |first=Charles |title=Watching Whales Watching Us |work=New York Times Magazine |date=8 July 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12whales-t.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller cetaceans, such as dolphins and porpoises, engage in complex play behavior, including such things as producing stable underwater [[toroid]]al air-core [[vortex]] rings or &quot;[[bubble ring]]s&quot;. The two main methods of bubble ring production are rapid puffing of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the [[Helix|helical]] vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Whales produce bubble nets to aid in herding prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wiley, David|title=Underwater components of humpback whale bubble-net feeding behaviour |journal=Behaviour |volume=148 |issue=5 |pages=575–602 |year=2011 |doi=10.1163/000579511X570893 |display-authors=etal|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aa2f71f000dd10d66b779489d6883c31c065b050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orca porpoising.jpg|thumb|Killer whale [[Cetacean surfacing behaviour#porpoising|porpoising]]]]

Larger whales are also thought to engage in play. The southern right whale elevates its tail fluke above the water, remaining in the same position for a considerable time. This is known as &quot;sailing&quot;. It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carwardine |first1=M. H. |last2=Hoyt |first2=E. |year=1998 |title=Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises |journal=NSW: Reader's Digest |isbn=978-0-86449-096-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humpback whales also display this behaviour.

[[Self-awareness]] appears to be a sign of abstract thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as [[metacognition|metacognitive reasoning]] (thinking about thinking) that humans exploit. Cetaceans appear to possess self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/4272-elephant-awareness-mirrors-humans.html | title=Elephant Self-Awareness Mirrors Humans |publisher=Live Science |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the [[mirror test]], in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body and the animal is then presented with a mirror. Researchers then explore whether the animal shows signs of self-recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror test&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/01/science/brainy-dolphins-pass-the-human-mirror-test.html |title=Mirror test |author=Derr, Mark |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=3 August 2015|date=May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim that the results of these tests are susceptible to the [[Clever Hans]] effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for [[primates]]. Primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses. Advocates counter that the behaviors are different from normal responses to another individual. Cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness, because they have no pointing ability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror test&quot; /&gt;

In 1995, Marten and Psarakos used video to test dolphin self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marten|first1=Ken|last2=Psarakos|first2=Suchi|title=Using Self-View Television to Distinguish between Self-Examination and Social Behavior in the Bottlenose Dolphin (''Tursiops truncatus'')|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|volume=4|number=2|date=June 1995|doi=10.1006/ccog.1995.1026|pages=205–224|pmid=8521259}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been replicated, dolphins later &quot;passed&quot; the mirror test.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirror test&quot; /&gt;

== Life history ==

=== Reproduction and brooding ===
Most cetaceans sexually mature at seven to 10 years. An exception to this is the [[La Plata dolphin]], which is sexually mature at two years, but lives only to about 20. The sperm whale reaches sexual maturity within about 20 years and a lifespan between 50 and 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann&quot; /&gt;

For most species, reproduction is seasonal. [[Ovulation]] coincides with male [[fertility]]. This cycle is usually coupled with seasonal movements that can be observed in many species. Most toothed whales have no fixed bonds. In many species, females choose several partners during a season. Baleen whales are largely [[monogamous]] within each reproductive period.

Gestation ranges from 9 to 16 months. Duration is not necessarily a function of size. Porpoises and blue whales gestate for about 11 months. As with all mammals other than marsupials and monotremes, the embryo is fed by  the [[placenta]], an organ that draws nutrients from the mother’s bloodstream. Mammals without placentas either lay minuscule eggs (monotremes) or bear minuscule offspring (marsupials).

Cetaceans usually bear one calf. In the case of twins, one usually dies, because the mother cannot produce sufficient milk for both. The fetus is positioned for a tail-first delivery, so that the risk of drowning during delivery is minimal. After birth, the mother carries the infant to the surface for its first breath. At birth they are about one-third of their adult length and tend to be independently active, comparable to terrestrial [[mammals]].

==== Suckling ====
Like other placental mammals, cetaceans give birth to well-developed calves and nurse them with milk from their [[mammary glands]]. When suckling, the mother actively splashes milk into the mouth of the calf, using the muscles of her mammary glands, as the calf has no lips. This milk usually has a high fat content, ranging from 16 to 46%, causing the calf to increase rapidly in size and weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;mann&quot; /&gt;

In many small cetaceans, suckling lasts for about four months. In large species, it lasts for over a year and involves a strong bond between mother and offspring.

The mother is solely responsible for brooding. In some species, so-called &quot;aunts&quot; occasionally suckle the young.

This reproductive strategy provides a few offspring that have a high survival rate.

=== Lifespan ===
Among cetaceans, whales are distinguished by an unusual longevity compared to other higher mammals. Some species, such as the [[bowhead whale]] (''Balaena mysticetus''), can reach over 200 years. Based on the annual rings of the bony [[otic capsule]], the age of the oldest known specimen is a male determined to be 211 years at the time of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=John C George|author2=Jeffrey Bada|author3=Judith Zeh|author3-link= Judy Zeh |author4=Laura Scott|author5=Stephen E Brown|author6=Todd O'Hara|author7=Robert Suydam|title=Age and growth estimates of bowhead whales (''Balaena mysticetus'') via aspartic acid racemization|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|year=1999|volume=77|issue=4|doi=10.1139/z99-015|pages=571–580}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 September 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
{{Main|Whale fall}}
Upon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep-sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other [[neritic]] biodiversity hotspots, such as [[cold seep]]s and [[hydrothermal vent]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&amp;Baco2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/csmith/Files/Smith%20and%20Baco%202003.pdf |title=Ecology of Whale Falls at the Deep-Sea Floor |author1=Smith, Craig R. |author2=Baco, Amy R. |journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review |volume=41 |date=2003 |pages=311–354 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |doi=10.1201/9780203180594.ch6|series=Oceanography and Marine Biology - an Annual Review |isbn=978-0-415-25462-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deterioration of whale carcasses happens through three stages. Initially, organisms such as [[shark]]s and [[hagfish]] scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as [[crustaceans]] and [[polychaetes]], throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing [[hydrogen sulfide]] enabling the growth of [[chemoautotrophic]] organisms, which in turn, support organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 per site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&amp;Baco2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fujiwara, Yoshihiro|title=Three-year investigations into sperm whale-fall ecosystems in Japan |journal=Marine Ecology |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=219–230|date=16 February 2007|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00150.x|bibcode=2007MarEc..28..219F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
[[Brucellosis]] affects almost all mammals. It is distributed worldwide, while fishing and pollution have caused porpoise population density pockets, which risks further infection and disease spreading. ''[[Brucella ceti]]'', most prevalent in dolphins, has been shown to cause [[chronic disease]], increasing the chance of failed birth and [[miscarriage]]s, [[male infertility]], neurobrucellosis, [[cardiopathy|cardiopathies]], bone and skin [[lesion]]s, [[Cetacean stranding|strandings]] and death. Until 2008, no case had ever been reported in porpoises, but isolated populations have an increased risk and consequentially a high mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Guzmán-Verri|last1=Caterina| first2=Rocío|last2=González-Barrientos|first3=Gabriela|last3=Hernández-Mora|first4=Juan-Alberto|last4=Morales|first5=Elías|last5=Baquero-Calvo|first6=Esteban|last6=Chaves-Olarte|first7=Edgardo|last7=Moreno|title=''Brucella ceti'' and Brucellosis in Cetaceans|journal=Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology|volume=2|pages=3|year=2012|doi=10.3389/fcimb.2012.00003|pmid=22919595|pmc=3417395}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Molecular biology]] and [[immunology]] show that cetaceans are phylogenetically closely related with the [[even-toed ungulate]]s (Artiodactyla). Whales direct lineage began in the early [[Eocene]], more than 50 million years ago, with early artiodactyls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen&quot; /&gt; Fossil discoveries at the beginning of the 21st century confirmed this.

Most molecular biological evidence suggests that [[Hippopotamidae|hippos]] are the closest living relatives. Common anatomical features include similarities in the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the posterior [[molars]], and the bony ring on the temporal bone (bulla) and the involucre, a skull feature that was previously associated only with cetaceans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen&quot;&gt;

The Tethys Sea was a shallow sea between the Asian continent and northward-bound Indian plate.

Mysticetes evolved baleen around 25 million years ago and lost their teeth.

=== Development ===

==== Ancestors ====
The direct ancestors of today's cetaceans are probably found within the [[Dorudontidae]] whose most famous member, ''[[Dorudon]]'', lived at the same time as ''[[Basilosaurus]]''. Both groups had already developed the typical anatomical features of today's whales, such as hearing. Life in the water for a formerly terrestrial creature required significant adjustments such as the fixed bulla, which replaces the mammalian [[eardrum]], as well as sound-conducting elements for submerged directional hearing. Their wrists were stiffened and probably contributed to the typical build of flippers. The hind legs existed, however, but were significantly reduced in size and with a vestigial pelvis connection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen&quot; /&gt;

==== Transition from land to sea ====
[[File:Adult female and fetal Maiacetus.jpg|thumb|Fossil of a ''Maiacetus'' (red, beige skull) with fetus (blue, red teeth) shortly before the end of gestation &lt;ref name=&quot;Gingerich PD&quot; /&gt;]]
The fossil record traces the gradual transition from terrestrial to aquatic life. The regression of the hind limbs allowed greater flexibility of the spine. This made it possible for whales to move around with the vertical tail hitting the water. The front legs transformed into flippers, costing them their mobility on land.

One of the oldest members of ancient cetaceans ([[Archaeoceti]]) is ''[[Pakicetus]]'' from the Middle Eocene. This is an animal the size of a wolf, whose skeleton is known only partially. It had functioning legs and lived near the shore. This suggests the animal could still move on land. The long snout had [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] dentition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen&quot;/&gt;

The transition from land to sea dates to about 49 million years ago, with the ''[[Ambulocetus]]'' (&quot;running whale&quot;), discovered in [[Pakistan]]. It was up to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. The limbs of this archaeocete were leg-like, but it was already fully aquatic, indicating that a switch to a lifestyle independent from land happened extraordinarily quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ando |first=Konami |last2=Fujiwara |first2=Shin-ichi |date=2016-07-10 |title=Farewell to life on land - thoracic strength as a new indicator to determine paleoecology in secondary aquatic mammals |journal=Journal of Anatomy |language=en |volume=229 |issue=6 |pages=768–777 |doi=10.1111/joa.12518 |issn=0021-8782 |pmc=5108153 |pmid=27396988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snout was elongated with overhead nostrils and eyes. The tail was strong and supported movement through water. ''Ambulocetus'' probably lived in mangroves in [[brackish water]] and fed in the [[riparian zone]] as a predator of fish and other vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.G.M. [[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]]|year=1994|title=Phylogenetic aspects of Cetacean origins: A morphological perspective|journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution|pages=157–184|doi=10.1007/bf01473527|volume=2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating from about 45 million years ago are species such as ''[[Indocetus]]'', ''[[Kutchicetus]]'', ''[[Rodhocetus]]'' and ''[[Andrewsiphius]]'', all of which were adapted to life in water. The hind limbs of these species were regressed and their body shapes resemble modern whales. [[Protocetidae]] family member ''Rodhocetus'' is considered the first to be fully aquatic. The body was streamlined and delicate with extended hand and foot bones. The merged pelvic [[lumbar spine]] was present, making it possible to support the floating movement of the tail. It was likely a good swimmer, but could probably move only clumsily on land, much like a modern [[Pinniped|seal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thewissen&quot; /&gt;

==== Marine animals ====
Since the late Eocene, about 40 million years ago, cetaceans populated the subtropical oceans and no longer emerged on land. An example is the 18-m-long ''[[Basilosaurus]]'', sometimes referred to as ''Zeuglodon''. The transition from land to water was completed in about 10 million years. The [[Wadi Al-Hitan]] (&quot;Whale Valley&quot;) in Egypt contains numerous skeletons of ''Basilosaurus'', as well as other marine vertebrates.

== Taxonomy ==
{{See also|List of cetacean species}}
The two parvorders are [[baleen whales]] (Mysticeti) which owe their name to their baleen, and [[toothed whales]] (Odontoceti), which have teeth shaped like cones, spades, pegs or tusks, and can perceive their environment through [[Animal echolocation|biosonar]].

The terms whale and dolphin are informal:
*Mysticeti:
:*[[Whale]]s, with four families: [[Balaenidae]] (right and bowhead whales), [[Cetotheriidae]] (pygmy right whales), [[Balaenopteridae]] (rorquals), [[Eschrichtiidae]] (grey whales)
*Odontoceti:
:*[[Whale]]s: with four families: [[Monodontidae]] (belugas and narwhals), [[Physeteridae]] (sperm whales), [[Kogiidae]] (dwarf and pygmy sperm whales), and [[Ziphiidae]] (beaked whales)
:*[[Dolphin]]s, with four families: [[Delphinidae]] (oceanic dolphins), [[Platanistidae]] ([[South Asian river dolphin]]s), [[Iniidae]] (new world river dolphins), and [[Pontoporiidae]] ([[La Plata dolphin]]s)
:*[[Porpoise]]s, with one family: [[Phocoenidae]]

Whaling is the practice of hunting whales, mainly baleen and sperm whales. This activity has gone on since the [[Stone Age]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], reasons for whaling included their [[whale meat|meat]], [[whale oil|oil]] usable as fuel and the jawbone, which was used in house construction. At the end of the Middle Ages, early whaling fleets aimed at [[baleen whales]], such as [[bowhead whales|bowheads]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Dutch fleet had about 300 whaling ships with 18,000 crewmen.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, baleen whales especially were hunted for their [[baleen]], which was used as a replacement for wood, or in products requiring strength and flexibility such as [[corset]]s and [[crinoline]] skirts. In addition, the [[spermaceti]] found in the [[sperm whale]] was used as a machine lubricant and the [[ambergris]] as a material for pharmaceutical and perfume industries. In the second half of the 19th century, the explosive [[harpoon]] was invented, leading to a massive increase in the catch size.

Large ships were used as &quot;mother&quot; ships for the whale handlers. In the first half of the 20th century, whales were of great importance as a supplier of raw materials. Whales were intensively hunted during this time; in the 1930s, 30,000 whales were killed. This increased to over 40,000 animals per year up to the 1960s, when stocks of large baleen whales collapsed.

Most hunted whales are now threatened, with some great whale populations exploited to the brink of extinction. Atlantic and Korean [[gray whale]] populations were completely eradicated and the [[North Atlantic right whales|North Atlantic right whale]] population fell to some 300-600. The [[blue whale]] population is estimated to be around 14,000.

The first efforts to protect whales came in 1931. Some particularly endangered species, such as the [[humpback whale]] (which then numbered about 100 animals), were placed under international protection and the first protected areas were established. In 1946, the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) was established, to monitor and secure whale stocks. Whaling of 14 large species for commercial purposes was prohibited worldwide by this organization from 1985 to 2005, though some countries do not honor the prohibition.

The stocks of species such as humpback and blue whales have recovered, though they are still threatened. The United States Congress passed the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972]] sustain the marine mammal population. It prohibits the taking of marine mammals except for several hundred per year taken in Alaska. Japanese whaling ships are allowed to hunt whales of different species for ostensibly scientific purposes.

[[Aboriginal whaling]] is still permitted. About 1,200 pilot whales were taken in the [[Faroe Islands]] in 2017.,&lt;ref name=&quot;faroe&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://heimabeiti.fo/default.asp?menu=400 |title=Hagar &amp; seyðamark |website=heimabeiti.fo |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 900 [[narwhal]]s and 800 [[beluga whale|belugas]] per year are taken in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. About 150 minke are taken in Greenland per year, 120 gray whales in Siberia and 50 bowheads in Alaska, as aboriginal whaling, besides the 600 minke taken commercially by Norway, 300 minke and 100 sei taken by Japan and up to 100 fin whales taken by Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwcatch&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://iwc.int/total-catches |title=Total Catches |website=iwc.int |language=en |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland and Norway do not recognize the ban and operate commercial whaling. Norway and Japan are committed to ending the ban.

Dolphins and other smaller cetaceans are sometimes hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats, usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Peru]] and [[Japan]] (the most well-known practitioner). Dolphins are mostly hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]], though some end up in [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]]. Despite the controversy thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.

==== Fishing ====
{{See also|Cetacean bycatch}}
[[File:Domino whale-bone hg.jpg|thumb|[[Dominoes]] made of baleen]]
Dolphin pods often reside near large tuna shoals. This is known to fishermen, who look for dolphins to catch tuna. Dolphins are much easier to spot from a distance than tuna, since they regularly breathe. The fishermen pull their nets hundreds of meters wide in a circle around the dolphin groups, in the expectation that they will net a tuna shoal. When the nets are pulled together, the dolphins become entangled under water and drown. Line fisheries in larger rivers are threats to [[river dolphins]].

A greater threat than by-catch for small cetaceans is targeted hunting. In Southeast Asia, they are sold as fish-replacement to locals, since the region's edible fish promise higher revenues from exports. In the Mediterranean, small cetaceans are targeted to ease pressure on edible fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdcs&quot; /&gt;

==== Strandings ====
{{Main|Cetacean stranding}}
A stranding is when a cetacean leaves the water to lie on a beach. In some cases, groups of whales strand together. The best known are mass strandings of [[pilot whale]]s and sperm whales. [[Cetacean stranding|Stranded]] cetaceans usually die, because their as much as {{convert|90|MT|ST}} body weight compresses their lungs or breaks their ribs. Smaller whales can die of heatstroke because of their thermal insulation.

The causes are not clear. Possible reasons for mass beachings are:&lt;ref name=&quot;wdcs&quot; /&gt;
* toxic contaminants
* debilitating parasites (in the respiratory tract, brain or middle ear)
* infections (bacterial or viral)
* flight from predators (including humans)
* social bonds within a group, so that the pod follows a stranded animal
* disturbance of their magnetic senses by natural anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field
* injuries
* [[Noise pollution#Wildlife|noise pollution]] by shipping traffic, seismic surveys and military sonar experiments

Since 2000, whale strandings frequently occurred following military [[sonar]] testing. In December 2001, the US Navy admitted partial responsibility for the beaching and the deaths of several marine mammals in March 2000. The coauthor of the interim report stated that animals killed by active sonar of some Navy ships were injured. Generally, underwater noise, which is still on the increase, is increasingly tied to strandings; because it impairs communication and sense of direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schrope, Mark. |title=Whale deaths caused by US Navy's sonar |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=106 |pages=106 |year=2003  |doi=10.1038/415106a|bibcode = 2002Natur.415..106S |pmid=11805797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate change]] influences the major wind systems and ocean currents, which also lead to cetacean strandings. Researchers studying strandings on the Tasmanian coast from 1920–2002 found that greater strandings occurred at certain time intervals. Years with increased strandings were associated with severe storms, which initiated cold water flows close to the coast. In nutrient-rich, cold water, cetaceans expect large prey animals, so they follow the cold water currents into shallower waters, where the risk is higher for strandings. Whales and dolphins who live in pods may accompany sick or debilitated pod members into shallow water, stranding them at low tide. Once stranded, large whales are crushed by their own body weight, if they cannot quickly return to the water. In addition, body temperature regulation is compromised.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==== Environmental hazards ====
{{See also|Marine mammals and sonar}}
{{Quote box|quote=Worldwide, use of active sonar has been linked to about 50 marine mammal strandings between 1996 and 2006. In all of these occurrences, there were other contributing factors, such as unusual (steep and complex) underwater geography, limited egress routes, and a specific species of marine mammal — beaked whales — that are suspected to be more sensitive to sound than other marine mammals.
|source=—Rear Admiral Lawrence Rice|align=left|width=30%}}
Heavy metals, residues of many plant and insect venoms and plastic waste [[flotsam]] are not biodegradable. Sometimes, cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to disease and have fewer offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdcs&quot; /&gt;

Damage to the [[ozone layer]] reduces plankton reproduction because of its resulting radiation. This shrinks the food supply for many marine animals, but the filter-feeding baleen whales are most impacted. Even the [[Nekton]] is, in addition to intensive exploitation, damaged by the radiation.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdcs&quot; /&gt;

Food supplies are also reduced long-term by [[ocean acidification]] due to increased absorption of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. The CO&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reacts with water to form [[carbonic acid]], which reduces the construction of the [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons of food supplies for zooplankton that baleen whales depend on.&lt;ref name=&quot;wdcs&quot; /&gt;

The military and resource extraction industries operate strong [[sonar]] and blasting operations. Marine seismic surveys use loud, low-frequency sound that show what is lying underneath the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowacek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowacek|first1=Douglas|last2=Donovan|first2=Greg|last3=Gailey|first3=Glenn|last4=Racca|first4=Roberto|last5=Reeves|first5=Randall|last6=Vedenev|first6=Alexander|last7=Weller|first7=David|last8=Southall|first8=Brandon|title=Responsible Practices for Minimizing and Monitoring Environmental Impacts of Marine Seismic Surveys with an Emphasis on Marine Mammal|journal=Aquatic Mammals|date=2013|volume=39|issue=4 |pages=356–377|doi=10.1578/am.39.4.2013.356}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 2, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vessel traffic also increases noise in the oceans. Such noise can disrupt cetacean behavior such as their use of [[biosonar]] for orientation and communication. Severe instances can panic them, driving them to the surface. This leads to bubbles in blood gases and can cause [[decompression sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=M. Andre|title=Europe Oceans 2005|author2=T. Johansson|author3=E.

[[File:Trolual (Gessner).jpg|thumb|A whale as depicted by Conrad Gesner, 1587, in ''Historiae animalium'']]
In [[Aristotle]]'s time, the 4th century BCE, whales were regarded as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, observed many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural history]]''. In the art of this and subsequent periods, dolphins are portrayed with a high-arched head (typical of porpoises) and a long snout. The [[harbour porpoise]] was one of the most accessible species for early [[cetology|cetologists]]; because it could be seen close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Conrad Gesner|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AriHian.html|title=Historiae animalium |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906090248/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AriHian.html |archivedate=6 September 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray.

In the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae]] (1758), Swedish biologist and taxonomist [[Carl Linnaeus]] asserted that cetaceans were mammals and not fish. His groundbreaking binomial system formed the basis of modern whale classification.

[[Stone Age]] [[petroglyphs]], such as those in Roddoy and Reppa (Norway), and the [[Bangudae Petroglyphs]] in South Korea, depict them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcas.org/Vol36N2/11Meighan.pdf PCAS Quarterly - Rock Art on the Channel Islands of California]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3638853.stm BBC News - Rock Art Hints at Whaling Origins]&lt;/ref&gt; Whale bones were used for many purposes. In the [[Neolithic]] settlement of Skara Brae on [[Orkney]] sauce pans were made from whale vertebrae.

==== Antiquity ====

[[File:Tarentum.jpg|thumb|Silver coin with Tarus riding a dolphin]]
The whale was first mentioned in [[ancient Greece]] by [[Homer]]. There, it is called Ketos, a term that initially included all large marine animals. From this was derived the Roman word for whale, [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. Other names were phálaina ([[Aristotle]], [[Latin]] form of ballaena) for the female and, with an ironic characteristic style, musculus (Mouse) for the male. [[North Sea]] whales were called Physeter, which was meant for the sperm whale ''Physter macrocephalus''. Whales are described in particular by Aristotle, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Ambrose]]. All mention both live birth and suckling. Pliny describes the problems associated with the lungs with spray tubes and Ambrose claimed that large whales would take their young into their mouth to protect them.

In the [[Bible]] especially, the leviathan plays a role as a [[sea monster]]. The essence, which features a giant crocodile or a dragon and a whale, was created according to the Bible by God&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Psalms|104:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and should again be destroyed by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Psalms|74:14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|27:1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Job]], the leviathan is described in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Job|40:25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Job|41:26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jonah there is a more recognizable description of a whale alongside the prophet [[Jonah]], who, on his flight from the city of [[Nineveh]] is swallowed by a whale.

Dolphins are mentioned far more often than whales. Aristotle discusses the sacred animals of the Greeks in his ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' and gives details of their role as aquatic animals. The Greeks admired the dolphin as a &quot;king of the aquatic animals&quot; and referred to them erroneously as fish. Its intelligence was apparent both in its ability to escape from fishnets and in its collaboration with fishermen.

River dolphins are known from the [[Ganges]] and – erroneously – the [[Nile]]. In the latter case it was equated with sharks and catfish. Supposedly they attacked even [[crocodile]]s.

[[Dolphins in mythology|Dolphins appear in Greek mythology]]. Because of their intelligence, they rescued multiple people from drowning. They were said to love music – probably not least because of their own song – they saved, in the legends, famous musicians such as [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] from [[Mithymna|Methymna]] or [[\|Kairanos]] from Miletus. Because of their mental faculties, dolphins were considered for the god [[Dionysus]].
[[File:Cetus constellation map.png|thumb|right|Constellation Cetus]]
Dolphins belong to the domain of [[Poseidon]] and led him to his wife [[Amphitrite]]. Dolphins are associated with other gods, such as [[Apollo]], Dionysus and [[Aphrodite]]. The Greeks paid tribute to both whales and dolphins with their own constellation. The constellation of the [[Cetus|Whale]] (Ketos, lat. Cetus) is located south of the Dolphin (Delphi, lat. Delphinus) north of the [[zodiac]].

Ancient art often included dolphin representations, including the Cretan [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]]. Later they appeared on reliefs, gems, lamps, coins, mosaics and gravestones. A particularly popular representation is that of Arion or the [[Taras (mythology)]] riding on a dolphin. In early [[Christian art]], the dolphin is a popular motif, at times used as a symbol of [[Christ]].

==== Middle Ages to the 19th century ====
{{See also|History of Whaling|Cryptid whales}}
[[St. Brendan]] described in his travel story ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani'' an encounter with a whale, between the years 565–573. He described how he and his companions entered a treeless island, which turned out to be a giant whale, which he called Jasconicus. He met this whale seven years later and rested on his back.

Most descriptions of large whales from this time until the whaling era, beginning in the 17th century, were of beached whales, which resembled no other animal. This was particularly true for the sperm whale, the most frequently stranded in larger groups. [[Raymond Gilmore]] documented seventeen sperm whales in the estuary of the Elbe from 1723 to 1959 and thirty-one animals on the coast of Great Britain in 1784. In 1827, a blue whale beached itself off the coast of Ostend. Whales were used as attractions in museums and traveling exhibitions.

[[File:Im Februar 1598 an der holländischen Küste gestrandeter Walfisch.jpg|thumb|right|Stranded sperm whale engraving, 1598]]
Whalers from the 17th to 19th centuries depicted whales in drawings and recounted tales of their occupation. Although they knew that whales were harmless giants, they described battles with harpooned animals. These included descriptions of sea monsters, including huge whales, sharks, sea snakes, giant squid and octopuses.

Among the first whalers who described their experiences on whaling trips was Captain [[William Scoresby]] from Great Britain, who published the book ''Northern Whale Fishery'', describing the hunt for northern baleen whales. This was followed by [[Thomas Beale]], a British surgeon, in his book ''Some observations on the natural history of the sperm whale'' in 1835; and Frederick Debell Bennett's ''The tale of a whale hunt'' in 1840. Whales were described in narrative literature and paintings, most famously in the novels ''[[Moby-Dick|Moby Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]] and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]].

Baleen was used to make vessel components such as the bottom of a bucket in the Scottish National Museum. The [[Norsemen]] crafted ornamented plates from baleen, sometimes interpreted as [[ironing]] boards.

In the Canadian Arctic (east coast) in Punuk and [[Thule]] culture (1000–1600 C.E.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The circumpolar zone|last1=Cunliffe|first1=B.|last2=Gosden|first2=C.|last3=Joyce|first3=R.|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; I baleen was used to construct houses in place of wood as roof support for winter houses, with half of the building buried under the ground. The actual roof was probably made of animal skins that were covered with soil and moss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J.

In the 20th century perceptions of cetaceans changed. They transformed from monsters into creatures of wonder, as science revealed them to be intelligent and peaceful animals. Hunting was replaced by whale and dolphin tourism. This change is reflected in films and novels. For example, the protagonist of the series [[Flipper (1995 TV series)|Flipper]] was a bottle-nose dolphin. The TV series [[SeaQuest DSV]] (1993–1996), the movies [[Free Willy]], [[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] and the book series [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] by [[Douglas Adams]] are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90895/Whales|title=Movie Retriever: Whales|author=unknown|work=movieretriever.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015214719/http://www.movieretriever.com/videohound_lists/90895/Whales|archivedate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales and dolphins have been kept in captivity for use in education, research and entertainment since the 19th century.

[[Beluga whale]]s were the first whales to be kept in captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy or too big. The first was shown at [[Barnum's American Museum|Barnum's Museum]] in [[New York City]] in 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/190/ | title=The Whales, New York Tribune, August 9, 1861 | accessdate=5 December 2011 | date=9 August 1861 | work=New York Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 20th century, Canada was the predominant source.&lt;ref name=cmeps /&gt; They were taken from the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]] estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] estuary until capture was banned in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmeps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpages.charter.net/hrynyshyn/pdfs/Beluga_Report_web2006.pdf |title=Beluga Whales in Captivity: Hunted, Poisoned, Unprotected |accessdate=26 December 2014 |year=2006 |work=Special Report on Captivity 2006 |publisher=Canadian Marine Environment Protection Society |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226215306/http://webpages.charter.net/hrynyshyn/pdfs/Beluga_Report_web2006.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia then became the largest provider.&lt;ref name=cmeps /&gt; Belugas are caught in the [[Amu Darya|Amur Darya]] delta and their eastern coast and are transported domestically to aquaria or [[dolphinarium|dolphinaria]] in [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Sochi]], or exported to countries such as Canada.&lt;ref name=cmeps /&gt; They have not been domesticated.&lt;ref name=&quot;zoos&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.waza.org/en/zoo/visit-the-zoo/aquatic-mammals-1254385523/delphinapterus-leucas | title=Beluga (''Delphinapterus leucas'') Facts – Distribution – In the Zoo | accessdate=5 December 2011 | publisher=World Association of Zoos and Aquariums | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210101419/http://www.waza.org/en/zoo/visit-the-zoo/aquatic-mammals-1254385523/delphinapterus-leucas | archive-date=10 February 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, 30 belugas lived in Canada and 28 in the United States. 42 deaths in captivity had been reported.&lt;ref name=cmeps /&gt; A single specimen can reportedly fetch up to US$100,000 (UK£64,160). The beluga's popularity is due to its unique color and its [[facial expression]]s. The latter is possible because while most cetacean &quot;smiles&quot; are fixed, the extra movement afforded by the beluga's unfused cervical vertebrae allows a greater range of apparent expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonner, W.N. 17, 23–24&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Bonner, Nigel |title=Whales |publisher=Facts on File |isbn=978-0-7137-0887-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/whales0000bonn/page/17 17, 23–24] |year=1980 |url=https://archive.org/details/whales0000bonn/page/17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killer whale's [[animal intelligence|intelligence]], trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, fifty-five whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, nineteen from Japan and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s and by 1999, about 40% of the forty-eight animals on display in the world were captive-born.{{sfn|NMFS|2005|pp=43–44}}

Organizations such as [[World Animal Protection]] and the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation]] campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity.

In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the [[dorsal fin]] collapse seen in 60–90% of captive males. Captives have reduced life expectancy, on average only living into their 20s, although some live longer, including several over 30 years old and two, Corky II and Lolita, in their mid-40s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average and up to 70–80 years. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average and can reach 50–60 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rose, N.

Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior. Wild killer whales may travel up to {{convert|160|km|mi|-1}} in a day and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/01/national/main6255297.shtml|title=Whale Attack Renews Captive Animal Debate|newspaper=CBS News|date=March 1, 2010|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of [[stress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Jean Armstrong|title=Animal Ethics Reader| isbn=978-0-415-27589-7|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Killer whales are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of orcas kept in captivity is small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only forty-four [[List of captive orcas|captive orcas]] being held in aquaria as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orcahome.de/orcastat.htm| title=Orcas in Captivity – A look at killer whales in aquariums and parks|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country has its own tank requirements; in the US, the minimum enclosure size is set by the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], 9 CFR E §&amp;nbsp;3.104, under the ''Specifications for the Humane Handling, Care, Treatment and Transportation of Marine Mammals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c7a201bd3f7d31d5f8218167efcd49ba&amp;node=9:1.0.1.1.3.5.31.5&amp;rgn=div8|title=Chapter I: Space requirements|journal=Electronic Code of Federal Regulation|volume= 1|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggression among captive killer whales is common. They attack each other and their trainers as well. In 2013, SeaWorld's treatment of killer whales in captivity was the basis of the movie ''[[Blackfish (film)|Blackfish]]'', which documents the history of [[Tilikum (orca)|Tilikum]], a killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando, who had been involved in the deaths of three people.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting, Candace Calloway.

Retrieved October 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The film led to proposals by some lawmakers to ban captivity of cetaceans, and lead SeaWorld to announce in 2016 that it would phase out its killer whale program after various unsuccessful attempts to restore its revenues, reputation, and stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dalebuss/2016/03/24/it-was-a-losing-battle-seaworlds-ceo-on-its-abrupt-change-and-what-comes-next/#5754041a223b|title=Shamu Goes Out With the Tide: SeaWorld CEO On Its Abrupt Change -- And What Comes Next|last=Buss|first=Dale|date=2016-03-24|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolphins and porpoises are kept in captivity. [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s are the most common, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic spotted dolphin|spotted dolphins]], [[false killer whale]]s and [[common dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's dolphin]]s, as well as [[rough-toothed dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers. There are also fewer than ten [[pilot whale]]s, [[Amazon river dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[spinner dolphin]]s, or [[tucuxi]] in captivity. Two unusual and rare [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins, known as [[wolphins]], are kept at [[Sea Life Park]] in [[Hawaii]], which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a [[false killer whale]]. Also, two [[Common dolphin|common]]/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity at [[Discovery Cove]] and [[SeaWorld San Diego]].

In repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, [[narwhal]]s kept in captivity died within months. A breeding pair of [[pygmy right whale]]s were retained in a netted area. They were eventually released in South Africa. In 1971, SeaWorld captured a California gray whale calf in Mexico at [[Ojo de Liebre Lagoon|Scammon's Lagoon]]. The calf, later named Gigi, was separated from her mother using a form of lasso attached to her flukes. Gigi was displayed at [[SeaWorld San Diego]] for a year. She was then released with a radio beacon affixed to her back; however, contact was lost after three weeks. Gigi was the first captive baleen whale. JJ, another [[gray whale]] calf, was kept at [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. JJ was an orphaned calf that beached itself in April 1997 and was transported two miles to SeaWorld. The {{convert|680|kg|lbs}} calf was a popular attraction and behaved normally, despite separation from his mother. A year later, the then {{convert|8,164.7|kg|lbs}} whale though smaller than average, was too big to keep in captivity, and was released on April 1, 1998. A captive [[Amazon river dolphin]] housed at [[Acuario de Valencia]] is the only trained [[river dolphin]] in captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whales&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RD-1991-001.pdf|last1=Klinowska|first1=Margaret|last2=Cooke|first2=Justin|year=1991| title=Dolphins, Porpoises, and Whales of the World: the IUCN Red Data Book|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.aquaticmammalsjournal.org/share/AquaticMammalsIssueArchives/2001/AquaticMammals_27-03/27-03_Goff.pdf |title=Growth of two gray whale calves|author1=J.
