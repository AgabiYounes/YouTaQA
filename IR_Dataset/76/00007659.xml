A '''cerebral arteriovenous malformation''' ('''cerebral AVM''', '''CAVM''', '''cAVM''') is an abnormal connection between the [[artery|arteries]] and [[vein]]s in the [[human brain|brain]]—specifically, an [[arteriovenous malformation]] in the [[cerebrum]].

==Signs and symptoms==
The most frequently observed problems, related to an AVM, are [[headache]]s and [[seizure]]s, cranial nerve deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surgicalneurologyint.com/surgicalint-articles/oculomotor-neuropathy-from-an-unruptured-arteriovenous-malformation-in-the-frontal-operculum-a-case-report-2/|title=Oculomotor neuropathy from an unruptured arteriovenous malformation in the frontal operculum: A case report|website=Surgical Neurology International|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; backaches, neckaches and eventual nausea, as the coagulated blood makes its way down to be dissolved in the individual's spinal fluid. It is supposed that 15% of the population, at detection, have no symptoms at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt; Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive [[weakness]] and [[numbness]] and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Symptoms&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=symptoms |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Symptoms |author=Mayo Clinic staff |date=February 2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;/&gt;

In serious cases, the blood vessels rupture and there is bleeding within the brain ([[intracranial hemorrhage]]). Nevertheless, in more than half of patients with AVM, hemorrhage is the first symptom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perret|first=G.|last2=Nishioka|first2=H.|date=1966-10-01|title=Report on the cooperative study of intracranial aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AVMs in certain critical locations may stop the circulation of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], causing accumulation of the fluid within the skull and giving rise to a clinical condition called [[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000779.htm |title=Arteriovenous malformation - cerebral |author1=David C. Dugdale |author2=Daniel B. Hoch |date=October 2008|publisher=ADAM |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stiff neck can occur as the result of increased pressure within the skull and irritation of the [[meninges]].

==Pathophysiology==
AVMs are an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the human brain. Arteriovenous malformations are most commonly of [[prenatal]] origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=causes |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Causes |author=Mayo Clinic staff |date=February 2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a normal brain [[oxygen]] enriched blood from the heart travels in sequence through smaller blood vessels going from arteries, to [[arterioles]] and then [[capillary|capillaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; Oxygen is removed in the latter vessel to be used by the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; After the oxygen is removed blood reaches [[venules]] and later veins which will take it back to the heart and lungs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, when there is an AVM blood goes directly from arteries to veins through the abnormal vessels disrupting the normal circulation of blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Causes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouchtouris|first1=Nikolaos|last2=Jabbour|first2=Pascal M|last3=Starke|first3=Robert M|last4=Hasan|first4=David M|last5=Zanaty|first5=Mario|last6=Theofanis|first6=Thana|last7=Ding|first7=Dale|last8=Tjoumakaris|first8=Stavropoula I|last9=Dumont|first9=Aaron S|last10=Ghobrial|first10=George M|last11=Kung|first11=David|last12=Rosenwasser|first12=Robert H|last13=Chalouhi|first13=Nohra|title=Biology of cerebral arteriovenous malformations with a focus on inflammation|journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism|date=19 November 2014|volume=35|issue=2|pages=167–175|doi=10.1038/jcbfm.2014.179|pmid=25407267|pmc=4426734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

An AVM diagnosis is established by [[neuroimaging]] studies after a complete neurological and physical examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Tests and diagnosis |author=Mayo Clinic staff |date=February 2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main techniques are used to visualize the brain and search for AVM: [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[cerebral angiography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; A CT scan of the head is usually performed first when the subject is symptomatic. It can suggest the approximate site of the bleed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt; MRI is more sensitive than CT in the diagnosis of AVMs and provides better information about the exact location of the malformation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; More detailed pictures of the tangle of blood vessels that compose an AVM can be obtained by using radioactive agents injected into the blood stream. If a CT is used in conjunctiangiogram, this is called a computerized tomography angiogram; while, if MRI is used it is called [[magnetic resonance angiogram]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;  The best images of an AVM are obtained through [[cerebral angiography]]. This procedure involves using a [[catheter]], threaded through an artery up to the head, to deliver a contrast agent into the AVM.  As the contrast agent flows through the AVM structure, a sequence of [[X-ray]] images are obtained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;

==Grading==

=== Spetzler-Martin (SM) Grade ===
A common method of grading cerebral AVMs is the Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spetzler|first=R|author2=Martin N|journal=J Neurosurg|year=1986|volume=65|pages=476–83|pmid=3760956|doi=10.3171/jns.1986.65.4.0476|title=A proposed grading system for arteriovenous malformations|issue=4|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4ad8dd34382014e86994a13d9d10f834b7d9eab}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This system was designed to assess the patient's risk of neurological deficit after open surgical resection (surgical morbidity), based on characteristics of the AVM itself. Based on this system, AVMs may be classified as grades 1 - 5.  This system was not intended to characterize risk of hemorrhage.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! AVM size !! Adjacent eloquent cortex !! Draining veins
|-
| &lt; 3&amp;nbsp;cm = 1 || Non-eloquent = 0 || Superficial only = 0
|-
| 3 – 6&amp;nbsp;cm = 2 || Eloquent* = 1|| Deep veins = 1
|-
| &gt; 6&amp;nbsp;cm = 3 ||  ||
|}

&quot;[[Eloquent cortex|Eloquent]]&quot; is defined as areas within the brain that, if removed will result in loss of sensory processing or linguistic ability, minor paralysis, or paralysis.  These include the sensorimotor cortices, deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebral peduncles, thalamus, hypothalamus, internal capsule, brainstem, and the visual cortex.

The risk of post-surgical neurological deficit (difficulty with language, motor weakness, vision loss) increases with increasing Spetzler-Martin grade.

=== Supplemented Spetzler-Martin (SM-supp, Lawton-Young) Grade ===
A limitation of the Spetzler-Martin Grading system is that it does not include the following factors: Patient age, hemorrhage, diffuseness of nidus, and arterial supply. In 2010 a new supplemented Spetzler-Martin system (SM-supp, Lawton-Young) was devised adding these variables to the SM system. Under this new system AVMs are classified from grades 1 - 10. It has since been determined to have greater predictive accuracy that Spetzler-Martin grades alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Helen|last2=Abla|first2=Adib A.|last3=Nelson|first3=Jeffrey|last4=McCulloch|first4=Charles E.|last5=Bervini|first5=David|last6=Morgan|first6=Michael K.|last7=Stapleton|first7=Christopher|last8=Walcott|first8=Brian P.|last9=Ogilvy|first9=Christopher S.|date=2015-01-01|title=Validation of the Supplemented Spetzler-Martin Grading System for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in a Multicenter Cohort of 1009 Surgical Patients|journal=Neurosurgery|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1227/neu.0000000000000556|issn=0148-396X|pmc=4270816|pmid=25251197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Helen|last2=Abla|first2=Adib A.|last3=Nelson|first3=Jeffrey|last4=McCulloch|first4=Charles E.|last5=Bervini|first5=David|last6=Morgan|first6=Michael K.|last7=Stapleton|first7=Christopher|last8=Walcott|first8=Brian P.|last9=Ogilvy|first9=Christopher S.|date=2015-01-01|title=Validation of the Supplemented Spetzler-Martin Grading System for Brain Arteriovenous Malformations in a Multicenter Cohort of 1009 Surgical Patients|journal=Neurosurgery|language=en|volume=76|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1227/neu.0000000000000556|issn=0148-396X|pmc=4270816|pmid=25251197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the location and size of the AVM and whether there is bleeding or not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Treatments and drugs |author=Mayo Clinic staff |date=February 2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment in the case of sudden bleeding is focused on restoration of vital function.

'''Medical management'''

Anticonvulsant medications such as [[phenytoin]] are often used to control seizure; medications or procedures may be employed to relieve intracranial pressure.  Eventually, curative treatment may be required to prevent recurrent hemorrhage. However, any type of intervention may also carry a risk of creating a neurological deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Arteriovenous-Malformations|title=AANS {{!}} Arteriovenous Malformations|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aans.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventive treatment of as yet unruptured brain AVMs has been controversial, as several studies suggested favorable long-term outcome for unruptured AVM patients not undergoing intervention. The NIH-funded longitudinal ARUBA study (&quot;A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs) compares the risk of stroke and death in patients with preventive AVM eradication versus those followed without intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;aruba01&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Official ARUBA study website (english) | url = http://www.arubastudy.org/ | accessdate = 2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interim results suggest that fewer strokes occur as long as patients with unruptured AVM do not undergo intervention. Because of the higher than expected event rate in the interventional arm of the ARUBA study, NIH/NINDS stopped patient enrollment in April 2013, while continuing to follow all participants to determine whether the difference in stroke and death in the two arms changes over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;aruba02&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Official interim results of ARUBA trial (english) | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/news_and_events/news_articles/ARUBA_trial_results.htm | accessdate = 2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surgical management'''

Surgical elimination of the blood vessels involved is the preferred curative treatment for many types of AVM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot; /&gt; Surgery is performed by a [[neurosurgeon]] who temporarily removes part of the skull ([[craniotomy]]), separates the AVM from surrounding brain tissue, and resects the abnormal vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot; /&gt; While surgery can result in an immediate, complete removal of the AVM, risks exist depending on the size and the location of the malformation. The AVM must be resected en bloc, for partial resection will likely cause severe hemorrhage.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The preferred treatment of Spetzler-Martin grade 1 and 2 AVMs in young, healthy patients is surgical resection due to the relatively small risk of neurological damage compared to the high lifetime risk of hemorrhage. Grade 3 AVMs may or may not be amenable to surgery. Grade 4 and 5 AVMs are not usually surgically treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Starke|first=RM|journal=Br J Neurosurg|year=2009|volume=23|pages=376–86|pmid=19637008|doi=10.1080/02688690902977662|title=Treatment guidelines for cerebral arteriovenous malformation microsurgery|issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radiosurgical management'''

[[Radiosurgery]] has been widely used on small AVMs with considerable success.  The [[Gamma Knife]] is an apparatus used to precisely apply a controlled radiation dosage to the volume of the brain occupied by the AVM. While this treatment does not require an incision and craniotomy (with their own inherent risks), three or more years may pass before the complete effects are known, during which time patients are at risk of bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot; /&gt; Complete obliteration of the AVM may or may not occur after several years, and repeat treatment may be needed. Radiosurgery is itself not without risk. In one large study, nine percent of patients had transient neurological symptoms, including headache, after radiosurgery for AVM. However, most symptoms resolved, and the long-term rate of neurological symptoms was 3.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flickinger|first=JC|journal=Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys|year=1998|volume=40|pages=273–278|pmid=9457809|doi=10.1016/S0360-3016(97)00718-9|title=Analysis of neurological sequelae from radiosurgery of arteriovenous malformations: How location affects outcome|issue=2|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuroendovascular therapy'''

[[Embolization]] is performed by [[Interventional neuroradiology|interventional neuroradiologists]] and the occlusion of blood vessels most commonly is obtained with [[Ethylene vinyl alcohol|Ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer]] ([[Ethylene vinyl alcohol|Onyx]]) or [[Cyanoacrylate|N-butyl cyanoacrylate]] ([[N-butyl-cyanoacrylate|NBCA]]). These substances are introduced by a [[Radiology|radiographically]] guided [[catheter]], and block vessels responsible for blood flow into the AVM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Jason A.|last2=Lavine|first2=Sean D.|date=2014-01-01|title=Role of Embolization for Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations|journal=Methodist DeBakey Cardiovascular Journal|volume=10|issue=4|pages=234–239|doi=10.14797/mdcj-10-4-234|issn=1947-6094|pmc=4300062|pmid=25624978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embolization is frequently used as an adjunct to either surgery or radiation treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; Embolization reduces the size of the AVM and during surgery it reduces the risk of bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-Treatment&quot;/&gt; However, embolization alone may completely obliterate some AVMs. In high flow intranidal fistulas balloons can also be used to reduce the flow so that embolization can be done safely.&lt;ref&gt;Huded V.

==Prognosis==
The main risk is [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. This risk is difficult to quantify since many patients with asymptomatic AVMs will never come to medical attention. Small AVMs tend to bleed more often than do larger ones, the opposite of cerebral aneurysms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=PM|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=49|pages=1–10|pmid=3958721|doi=10.1136/jnnp.49.1.1|title=Arteriovenous malformations of the brain: natural history in unoperated patients|issue=1|pmc=1028639|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If a rupture or bleeding incident occurs, the blood may penetrate either into the brain tissue ([[cerebral hemorrhage]]) or into the [[subarachnoid space]], which is located between the sheaths ([[meninges]]) surrounding the brain ([[subarachnoid hemorrhage]]). Bleeding may also extend into the [[ventricular system]] ([[intraventricular hemorrhage]]). Cerebral hemorrhage appears to be most common.

One long-term study (mean follow up greater than 20 years) of over 150 symptomatic AVMs (either presenting with bleeding or seizures) found the risk of cerebral hemorrhage to be approximately 4% per year, slightly higher than the 2-3% seen in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ondra|first=SL|journal=J Neurosurg|year=1990|volume=73|pages=387–391|pmid=2384776|doi=10.3171/jns.1990.73.3.0387|title=The natural history of symptomatic arteriovenous malformations of the brain: A 24-year follow-up assessment|issue=3|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple, rough approximation of a patient's lifetime bleeding risk is 105 - (patient age in years), assuming a 3% bleed risk annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Mark|title=Handbook of Neurosurgery (7th ed)|year=2010|publisher=Thieme|pages=1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a healthy 30-year-old patient would have approximately a 75% lifetime risk of at least one bleeding event. Ruptured AVMs are a significant source or morbidity and mortality; post rupture, as many as 29% of patients will die, and only 55% will be able to live independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The annual new detection rate [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of AVMs is approximately 1 per 100,000 a year. The [[point prevalence]] in adults is approximately 18 per 100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11571210&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Al-Shahi R, Warlow C |title=A systematic review of the frequency and prognosis of arteriovenous malformations of the brain in adults |journal=Brain |volume=124 |issue=Pt 10 |pages=1900–26 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11571210 |doi= 10.1093/brain/124.10.1900|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/124/10/1900?view=long&amp;pmid=11571210 |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; AVMs are more common in males than females, although in females [[pregnancy]] may start or worsen symptoms due the increase in [[blood flow]] and [[blood volume|volume]] it usually brings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-RF&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/brain-avm/DS01126/DSECTION=risk-factors |title=Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation)-Risk factors |author=Mayo Clinic staff |date=February 2009|publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant preponderance (15-20%) of AVM in patients with [[hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]] (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

==Research directions==
No randomized, controlled clinical trial has established a survival benefit for treating patients (either with open surgery or radiosurgery) with AVMs that have not yet bled.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARUBA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arubastudy.org/|title=The ARUBA trial-A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations|accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
