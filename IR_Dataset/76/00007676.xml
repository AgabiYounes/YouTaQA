In [[linguistics]], '''creaky voice''' (sometimes called '''laryngealisation''', '''pulse phonation''', '''[[vocal fry register|vocal fry]]''', or '''glottal fry''') is a special kind of [[phonation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Titze, I. R. | year = 2008 | title = The Human Instrument | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 298 | issue = 1 | pages = 94–101 | pmid = 18225701 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0108-94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Titze, I. R. | year = 1994 | title = Principles of Voice Production | publisher = Prentice Hall | isbn = 978-0-13-717893-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[arytenoid cartilage]]s in the [[larynx]] are drawn together; as a result, the [[vocal folds]] are compressed rather tightly, becoming relatively slack and compact. They normally vibrate irregularly at 20&amp;ndash;50 pulses per second, about two octaves below the frequency of [[Modal voice|modal voicing]], and the airflow through the [[glottis]] is very slow. Although creaky voice may occur with very low [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], as at the end of a long [[intonation unit]], it can also occur with a higher pitch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Researcher [[Ikuko Patricia Yuasa]] found that &quot;college-age Americans ... perceive female creaky voice as hesitant, nonaggressive, and informal but also educated, urban-oriented, and upwardly mobile.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yuasa, I. P. | title = Creaky Voice: A New Feminine Voice Quality for Young Urban-Oriented Upwardly Mobile American Women? | journal = American Speech | year = 2010 | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 315–337 | doi = 10.1215/00031283-2010-018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a 2012 study in ''PLOS ONE'', young women using creaky voice are viewed as less competent, less educated, less trustworthy, less attractive and less employable.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rindy C., et al.

In some languages, such as [[Jalapa Mazatec language|Jalapa Mazatec]], creaky voice has a [[phoneme|phonemic status]]; that is, the presence or absence of creaky voice can change the meaning of a word.&lt;ref name=&quot;AshbyMaidment2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ashby | first1 = M. | last2 = Maidment | first2 = J.

The [[Danish language|Danish]] [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] feature ''[[stød]]'' is an example of a form of laryngealisation that has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Basbøll| first=Hans| date=2005| title=The Phonology of Danish|publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=978-0-19-824268-0|ref=harv}} P. 24: &quot;The Danish stød [...] is [...] a syllable prosody manifested by laryngealization.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A slight degree of laryngealisation, occurring in some [[Korean language|Korean]] consonants for example, is called &quot;[[stiff voice]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahn|first=Sang-cheol|last2=Iverson|first2=Gregory K.|date=October 2004|title=Dimensions in Korean Laryngeal Phonology*|journal=Journal of East Asian Linguistics|volume=13|issue=4|pages=345–379|doi=10.1007/s10831-004-4256-x|issn=0925-8558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
