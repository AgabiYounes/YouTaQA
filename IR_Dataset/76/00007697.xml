The '''Lockheed C-130 Hercules''' is an American four-engine [[turboprop]] [[military transport aircraft]] designed and built originally by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]). Capable of using unprepared [[runway]]s for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, [[Medical evacuation|medevac]], and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile [[airframe]] has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a [[gunship]] ([[AC-130]]), for [[airborne infantry|airborne assault]], [[search and rescue]], scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, [[aerial refueling]], [[maritime patrol]], and [[aerial firefighting]]. It is now the main [[tactical airlift]]er for many military forces worldwide. More than 40 variants of the Hercules, including civilian versions marketed as the [[Lockheed L-100]], operate in more than 60 nations.

The C-130 entered service with the U.S. in 1956, followed by Australia and many other nations. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in numerous military, civilian and [[humanitarian aid]] operations. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft{{refn|The C-130 was fifth aircraft after the [[English Electric Canberra]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]], and [[Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker|KC-135 Stratotanker]] to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer as of 2007.|group= N}} to mark 50 years of continuous service with its original primary customer, which for the C-130 is the [[United States Air Force]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The C-130 Hercules is the longest continuously produced military aircraft at over 60 years, with the updated [[Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules]] currently being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stokes |first=Stephannie |date=29 December 2015 |title=C-130 aircraft designed in the 1950s still delivers |url=http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]] |access-date=2 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102185645/http://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/29/business/c-130-aircraft-designed-1950s-still-delivers |archive-date=2 January 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
{{more citations needed section|date=February 2014}}

===Background and requirements===
The [[Korean War]] showed that [[World War II]]-era [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engine]] transports—[[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s, [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]]s—were no longer adequate. Thus, on 2 February 1951, the [[United States Air Force]] issued a General Operating Requirement (GOR) for a new transport to [[Boeing]], [[Douglas Aircraft|Douglas]], [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[Chase Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation|North American]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and Airlifts Inc.

The new transport would have a capacity of 92 passengers, 72 combat troops or 64 paratroopers in a cargo compartment that was approximately {{cvt|41|ft}} long, {{cvt|9|ft}} high, and {{cvt|10|ft}} wide. Unlike transports derived from passenger airliners, it was to be designed specifically as a combat transport with loading from a hinged loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage. A key feature was the introduction of the [[Allison T56]] [[turboprop]] powerplant, which was developed for the C-130. The turboprop offered greater range at propeller-driven speeds compared to pure [[turbojet]]s, which were faster but consumed more fuel. They also produced much more power for their weight than piston engines.

===Design phase===
The Hercules resembled a larger four-engine brother to the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123 Provider]] with a similar wing and cargo ramp layout that evolved from the [[Chase XCG-20|Chase XCG-20 Avitruc]], which in turn, was first designed and flown as a cargo glider in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm &quot;Chase XCG-20 Avitruc.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130003025/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/cg-20.htm |date=30 January 2011 }} ''globalsecurity.org.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter]] had rear ramps, which made it possible to drive vehicles onto the airplane (also possible with forward ramp on a [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|C-124]]). The ramp on the Hercules was also used to airdrop cargo, which included a [[Low-altitude parachute-extraction system]] for [[M551 Sheridan|Sheridan tanks]] and even dropping large improvised &quot;[[BLU-82|daisy cutter]]&quot; bombs. The new Lockheed cargo plane design possessed a range of {{convert|1100|nmi|mi km|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, takeoff capability from short and unprepared strips, and the ability to fly with one engine shut down.

Fairchild, North American, Martin, and Northrop declined to participate. The remaining five companies tendered a total of ten designs: Lockheed two, Boeing one, Chase three, Douglas three, and Airlifts Inc. one. The contest was a close affair between the lighter of the two Lockheed (preliminary project designation L-206) proposals and a four-turboprop Douglas design.

The Lockheed design team was led by [[Willis Hawkins]], starting with a 130-page proposal for the ''Lockheed L-206''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;&gt;Rhodes, Jeff. &quot;Willis Hawkins and the Genesis of the Hercules.&quot; ''Code One Magazine'', Volume 19, Issue 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hall Hibbard]], Lockheed vice president and chief engineer, saw the proposal and directed it to [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], who did not care for the low-speed, unarmed aircraft, and remarked, &quot;If you sign that letter, you will destroy the Lockheed Company.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rhodes&quot;/&gt; Both Hibbard and Johnson signed the proposal and the company won the contract for the now-designated Model 82 on 2 July 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;boyne&quot;&gt;Boyne, Walter J.

The first flight of the ''YC-130'' [[prototype]] was made on 23 August 1954 from the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] plant in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California. The aircraft, [[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''53-3397'', was the second prototype, but the first of the two to fly. The YC-130 was piloted by Stanley Beltz and Roy Wimmer on its 61-minute flight to [[Edwards Air Force Base]]; [[Jack Real]] and Dick Stanton served as flight engineers. Kelly Johnson flew chase in a [[Lockheed P2V Neptune]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dabney&quot;&gt;Dabney, Joseph E. A. &quot;Mating of the Jeep, the Truck, and the [[Airplane]].&quot; ''lockheedmartin.com,'' 2004. ''Excerpted from ''HERK: Hero of the Skies'' in ''Lockheed Martin Service News, Lockheed Martin Air Mobility Support '' Volume 29, Issue 2, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the two prototypes were completed, production began in [[Marietta, Georgia]], where over 2,300 C-130s have been built through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Olausson 2009, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial production model, the ''C-130A'', was powered by [[Allison T56]]-A-9 turboprops with three-blade [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]] and originally equipped with the blunt nose of the prototypes. Deliveries began in December 1956, continuing until the introduction of the ''C-130B'' model in 1959. Some A-models were equipped with [[ski]]s and re-designated ''C-130D''.  As the C-130A became operational with [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC), the C-130's lack of range became apparent and additional fuel capacity was added with wing pylon-mounted tanks outboard of the engines; this added 6,000&amp;nbsp;lb (2,720&amp;nbsp;kg) of fuel capacity for a total capacity of 40,000&amp;nbsp;lb (18,140&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/docs/c-130-bar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-130B model was developed to complement the A-models that had previously been delivered, and incorporated new features, particularly increased fuel capacity in the form of auxiliary tanks built into the center wing section and an AC electrical system. Four-bladed Hamilton Standard propellers replaced the Aeroproducts three-blade propellers that distinguished the earlier A-models.  The C-130B had [[aileron]]s operated by hydraulic pressure that was increased from {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}, as well as uprated engines and four-blade propellers that were standard until the J-model.

The B model was originally intended to have &quot;blown controls&quot;, a system which blows high pressure air over the control surfaces in order to improve their effectiveness during slow flight. It was tested on a NC-130B prototype aircraft with a pair of T-56 turbines providing high pressure air through a duct system to the control surfaces and flaps during landing. This greatly reduced landing speed to just 63 knots, and cut landing distance in half. The system never entered service because it did not improve takeoff performance by the same margin, making the landing performance pointless if the aircraft could not also take off from where it had landed.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.29&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic reconnaissance variant of the C-130B was designated C-130B-II. A total of 13 aircraft were converted. The C-130B-II was distinguished by its false external wing fuel tanks, which were disguised signals intelligence (SIGINT) receiver antennas. These pods were slightly larger than the standard wing tanks found on other C-130Bs. Most aircraft featured a swept blade antenna on the upper fuselage, as well as extra wire antennas between the vertical fin and upper fuselage not found on other C-130s. Radio call numbers on the tail of these aircraft were regularly changed so as to confuse observers and disguise their true mission.

The extended-range ''C-130E'' model entered service in 1962 after it was developed as an interim long-range transport for the Military Air Transport Service. Essentially a B-model, the new designation was the result of the installation of 1,360&amp;nbsp;US [[gallon|gal]] (5,150&amp;nbsp;L) ''Sargent Fletcher'' external fuel tanks under each wing's midsection and more powerful [[Allison Engine Company|Allison]] T56-A-7A turboprops. The hydraulic boost pressure to the [[aileron]]s was reduced back to {{convert|2050|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} as a consequence of the external tanks' weight in the middle of the wingspan. The E model also featured structural improvements, [[avionics]] upgrades and a higher gross weight. Australia took delivery of 12 C130E Hercules during 1966–67 to supplement the 12 C-130A models already in service with the RAAF. Sweden and Spain fly the TP-84T version of the C-130E fitted for aerial refueling capability.

The ''KC-130'' [[Tanker (aircraft)|tankers]], originally ''C-130F'' procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC) in 1958 (under the designation ''GV-1'') are equipped with a removable 3,600&amp;nbsp;US gal (13,626&amp;nbsp;L) [[stainless steel]] [[fuel tank]] carried inside the cargo compartment. The two wing-mounted hose and drogue aerial refueling pods each transfer up to 300&amp;nbsp;US gal per minute (1,136&amp;nbsp;L per minute) to two aircraft simultaneously, allowing for rapid cycle times of multiple-receiver aircraft formations, (a typical tanker formation of four aircraft in less than 30 minutes). The [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s ''C-130G'' has increased structural strength allowing higher gross weight operation.

===Further developments===
[[File:RAAF Lockheed C-130H Hercules AVV Creek.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Australian Air Force]] C-130H, 2007]]

The ''C-130H'' model has updated Allison T56-A-15 turboprops, a redesigned outer [[wing]], updated avionics and other minor improvements. Later ''H'' models had a new, fatigue-life-improved, center wing that was retrofitted to many earlier H-models. For structural reasons, some models are required to land with reduced amounts of fuel when carrying heavy cargo, reducing usable range.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, J. &quot;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA391744 C-130 Transportability of Army Vehicles]&quot; p. 3. ''[[Defense Technical Information Center]]'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The H model remains in widespread use with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and many foreign air forces. Initial deliveries began in 1964 (to the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|RNZAF]]), remaining in production until 1996. An improved C-130H was introduced in 1974, with Australia purchasing 12 of type in 1978 to replace the original 12 C-130A models, which had first entered [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) service in 1958.  The U.S. Coast Guard employs the HC-130H for long-range search and rescue, drug interdiction, illegal migrant patrols, homeland security, and logistics.

[[File:USCG_HC-130H.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Coast Guard]] HC-130H]]
C-130H models produced from 1992 to 1996 were designated as C-130H3 by the USAF. The &quot;3&quot; denoting the third variation in design for the H series. Improvements included [[ring laser gyro]]s for the INUs, GPS receivers, a partial [[glass cockpit]] (ADI and HSI instruments), a more capable APN-241 color radar, [[night vision device]] compatible instrument lighting, and an integrated radar and missile warning system. The electrical system upgrade included Generator Control Units (GCU) and Bus Switching units (BSU) to provide stable power to the more sensitive upgraded components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petrescu|first1=Relly Victoria|last2=Petrescu|first2=Florian Ion|title=Lockheed Martin|date=2013|publisher=Books on Demand GmBH, Norderstedt|location=Germany|isbn=978-3-8482-6053-9|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49QmlNcqlUAC&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:raf.hercules.c-130k.c3.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Air Force]] C-130K (C.3)]]
The equivalent model for export to the UK is the ''C-130K'', known by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) as the ''Hercules C.1''. The ''C-130H-30'' (''Hercules C.3'' in RAF service) is a stretched version of the original Hercules, achieved by inserting a 100&amp;nbsp;in (2.54&amp;nbsp;m) plug aft of the cockpit and an 80&amp;nbsp;in (2.03&amp;nbsp;m) plug at the rear of the fuselage. A single C-130K was purchased by the [[Met Office]] for use by its Meteorological Research Flight, where it was classified as the ''Hercules W.2''. This aircraft was heavily modified (with its most prominent feature being the long red and white striped atmospheric probe on the nose and the move of the weather radar into a pod above the forward fuselage). This aircraft, named ''[[Snoopy]]'', was withdrawn in 2001 and was then modified by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace]] as flight-testbed for the [[A400M]] turbine engine, the [[TP400]]. The C-130K is used by the [[RAF Falcons]] for parachute drops. Three C-130Ks (Hercules C Mk.1P) were upgraded and sold to the Austrian Air Force in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm &quot;C-130K in the Austrian Air Force.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605224813/http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/luftfahrzeuge/c130.htm |date=5 June 2008 }} ''doppeladler.com''. Retrieved: 2 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhanced models===
The ''[[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130E Combat Talon]]'' was developed for the USAF during the [[Vietnam War]] to support [[special operations]] missions in Southeast Asia, and led to both the ''[[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130H Combat Talon II]]'' as well as a family of other special missions aircraft. 37 of the earliest models currently operating with the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] (AFSOC) are scheduled to be replaced by new-production MC-130J versions. The [[EC-130 Commando Solo]] is another special missions variant within AFSOC, albeit operated solely by an AFSOC-gained wing in the [[Pennsylvania Air National Guard]], and is a psychological operations/information operations (PSYOP/IO) platform equipped as an aerial radio station and television stations able to transmit messaging over commercial frequencies. Other versions of the [[Lockheed EC-130|EC-130]], most notably the [[EC-130H Compass Call]], are also special variants, but are assigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunship]] was first developed during the [[Vietnam War]] to provide [[close air support]] and other [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] duties.

[[File:HC-130P-N refuels HH-60G.jpg|thumb|USAF HC-130P refuels a [[HH-60G Pavehawk]] helicopter]]
The ''[[Lockheed HC-130|HC-130]]'' is a family of long-range search and rescue variants used by the USAF and the U.S. Coast Guard. Equipped for deep deployment of [[Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]] (PJs), survival equipment, and (in the case of USAF versions) aerial refueling of combat rescue helicopters, HC-130s are usually the on-scene command aircraft for combat SAR missions (USAF only) and non-combat SAR (USAF and USCG). Early USAF versions were also equipped with the [[Fulton surface-to-air recovery system]], designed to pull a person off the ground using a wire strung from a helium balloon. The John Wayne movie ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' features its use. The Fulton system was later removed when aerial refueling of helicopters proved safer and more versatile. The movie ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' depicts a real life SAR mission involving aerial refueling of a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|HH-60G]] by a New York Air National Guard HC-130P.

The ''C-130R'' and ''C-130T'' are U.S. Navy and USMC models, both equipped with underwing external fuel tanks. The USN C-130T is similar, but has additional avionics improvements. In both models, aircraft are equipped with Allison T56-A-16 engines. The USMC versions are designated ''KC-130R'' or ''KC-130T'' when equipped with underwing refueling pods and pylons and are fully [[Night vision device|night vision]] system compatible.

The RC-130 is a [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] version. A single example is used by the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]], the aircraft having originally been sold to the former [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].

The ''[[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|Lockheed L-100 (L-382)]]'' is a civilian variant, equivalent to a C-130E model without military equipment. The L-100 also has two stretched versions.

===Next generation===
{{main|Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules}}

In the 1970s, Lockheed proposed a C-130 variant with [[turbofan]] engines rather than turboprops, but the U.S. Air Force preferred the takeoff performance of the existing aircraft. In the 1980s, the C-130 was intended to be replaced by the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project. The project was canceled and the C-130 has remained in production.

Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin modified a commercial variant of the C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB).

===Replacement===
In October 2010, the Air Force released a capabilities request for information (CRFI) for the development of a new airlifter to replace the C-130. The new aircraft is to carry a 190 percent greater payload and assume the mission of mounted vertical maneuver (MVM). The greater payload and mission would enable it to carry medium-weight armored vehicles and drop them off at locations without long runways.  Various options are being considered, including new or upgraded fixed-wing designs, rotorcraft, [[tiltrotor]]s, or even an [[airship]]. Development could start in 2014, and become operational by 2024. The C-130 fleet of around 450 planes would be replaced by only 250 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150717161455/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2010/10/usaf-asks-industry-to-answer-c/ USAF asks industry to answer C-130 replacement questions] - Flightglobal.com, 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force had attempted to replace the C-130 in the 1970s through the [[Advanced Medium STOL Transport]] project, which resulted in the [[C-17 Globemaster III]] that instead replaced the [[C-141 Starlifter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;speedagile&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150413115830/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/09/images-lockheeds-stealth-c-130/ Lockheed's stealth C-130 successor revealed] - Flightglobal.com, 13 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Air Force Research Laboratory]] funded Lockheed and Boeing demonstrators for the '''Speed Agile''' concept, which had the goal of making a STOL aircraft that can take off and land at speeds as low as {{convert|70|kn|abbr=on}} on airfields less than 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft (610&amp;nbsp;m) long and cruise at Mach 0.8-plus.

In 1964, C-130 crews from the 6315th Operations Group at [[Naha Air Base]], Okinawa commenced [[forward air control]] (FAC; &quot;Flare&quot;) missions over the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] in Laos supporting USAF strike aircraft. In April 1965 the mission was expanded to [[North Vietnam]] where C-130 crews led formations of [[Martin B-57 Canberra]] bombers on night reconnaissance/strike missions against communist supply routes leading to South Vietnam. In early 1966 Project Blind Bat/Lamplighter was established at [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. After the move to Ubon, the mission became a four-engine FAC mission with the C-130 crew searching for targets then calling in strike aircraft. Another little-known C-130 mission flown by Naha-based crews was Operation Commando Scarf, which involved the delivery of chemicals onto sections of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos that were designed to produce mud and landslides in hopes of making the truck routes impassable.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Although the stated purpose of COMMANDO VAULT was to clear LZs, they were also used on enemy base camps and other targets.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

During the late 1960s, the U.S. was eager to get information on Chinese nuclear capabilities. After the failure of the [[Black Cat Squadron]] to plant operating sensor pods near the [[Lop Nur]] Nuclear Weapons Test Base using a [[Lockheed U-2]], the [[CIA]] developed a plan, named ''Heavy Tea'', to deploy two battery-powered sensor pallets near the base. To deploy the pallets, a Black Bat Squadron crew was trained in the U.S. to fly the C-130 Hercules. The crew of 12, led by Col Sun Pei Zhen, took off from [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]] in an unmarked U.S. Air Force C-130E on 17 May 1969. Flying for six and a half hours at low altitude in the dark, they arrived over the target and the sensor pallets were dropped by parachute near Anxi in Gansu province. After another six and a half hours of low altitude flight, they arrived back at Takhli. The sensors worked and uploaded data to a U.S. intelligence satellite for six months before their batteries failed. The Chinese conducted two nuclear tests, on 22 September 1969 and 29 September 1969, during the operating life of the sensor pallets. Another mission to the area was planned as Operation Golden Whip, but was called off in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, Chris. ''The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights over China from Taiwan 1951–1969''. Atglen, Ennsylvania: Schiffer Military History, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-7643-3513-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most likely that the aircraft used on this mission was either C-130E serial number 64-0506 or 64-0507 (cn 382-3990 and 382-3991).

The A-model continued in service through the [[Vietnam War]], where the aircraft assigned to the four squadrons at [[Naha AB]], Okinawa and one at [[Tachikawa Airfield|Tachikawa Air Base]], Japan performed yeoman's service, including operating highly classified special operations missions such as the BLIND BAT FAC/Flare mission and FACT SHEET leaflet mission over Laos and North Vietnam. The A-model was also provided to the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] as part of the [[Vietnamization]] program at the end of the war, and equipped three squadrons based at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]]. The last operator in the world is the [[Honduran Air Force]], which is still flying one of five A model Hercules (FAH ''558'', c/n 3042) as of October 2009.{{sfn|Olausson|2010| p= 5}} As the Vietnam War wound down, the 463rd Troop Carrier/Tactical Airlift Wing B-models and A-models of the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing were transferred back to the United States where most were assigned to [[Air Force Reserve]] and [[Air National Guard]] units.

[[File:DaNangairbase1965.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines disembark from C-130 transports at [[Da Nang Air Base]] on 8 March 1965]]
Another prominent role for the B model was with the [[United States Marine Corps]], where Hercules initially designated as GV-1s replaced C-119s. After Air Force C-130Ds proved the type's usefulness in [[Antarctica]], the U.S. Navy purchased a number of B-models equipped with skis that were designated as LC-130s. C-130B-II electronic reconnaissance aircraft were operated under the SUN VALLEY program name primarily from Yokota Air Base, Japan. All reverted to standard C-130B cargo aircraft after their replacement in the reconnaissance role by other aircraft.

The C-130 was also used in the 1976 [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe raid]] in which [[Israel]]i [[commando]] forces carried a surprise assault to rescue 103 passengers of an airliner hijacked by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and German terrorists at [[Entebbe Airport]], Uganda. The rescue force—200 soldiers, jeeps, and a black [[Mercedes-Benz]] (intended to resemble Ugandan [[Dictator]] [[Idi Amin]]'s vehicle of state)—was flown over {{convert|2200|nmi|0|abbr=on}} almost entirely at an altitude of less than {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on}} from Israel to Entebbe by four [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) Hercules aircraft without mid-air refueling (on the way back, the aircraft refueled in [[Nairobi]], Kenya).

During the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Malvinas}}) of 1982, [[Argentine Air Force]] C-130s undertook dangerous re-supply night flights as blockade runners to the Argentine garrison on the [[Falkland Islands]]. They also performed daylight maritime survey flights. One was shot down by a [[801 Naval Air Squadron#Falklands War|Royal Navy]] [[Sea Harrier]] using [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]]s and cannon. The crew of seven were killed. Argentina also operated two KC-130 [[Aerial refuelling|tankers]] during the war, and these refuelled both the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]s and Navy [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard]]s; some C-130s were modified to operate as bombers with bomb-racks under their wings. The British also used RAF C-130s to support their logistical operations.

During the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 ([[Operation Desert Storm]]), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, along with the air forces of Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the UK. The [[MC-130 Combat Talon]] variant also made the first attacks using the largest conventional [[bomb]]s in the world, the [[BLU-82]] &quot;Daisy Cutter&quot; and [[GBU-43/B]] &quot;Massive Ordnance Air Blast&quot; (MOAB) bomb. Daisy Cutters were used to primaily clear landing zones and to eliminate [[mine field]]s. The weight and size of the weapons make it impossible or impractical to load them on conventional [[bomber aircraft|bombers]]. The GBU-43/B MOAB is a successor to the BLU-82 and can perform the same function, as well as perform strike functions against hardened targets in a low air threat environment.

Since 1992, two successive C-130 aircraft named ''Fat Albert'' have served as the support aircraft for the U.S. Navy [[Blue Angels]] flight demonstration team. ''Fat Albert I'' was a TC-130G (''151891''),&lt;ref&gt;Olausson, Lars, &quot;Lockheed Hercules Production List 1954–2012&quot;, 28th edition, self-published, Såtenäs, Sweden, March 2010, page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Fat Albert II'' is a C-130T (''164763'').&lt;ref&gt;Olausson, Lars, &quot;Lockheed Hercules Production List 1954–2012&quot;, 28th edition, self-published, Såtenäs, Sweden, March 2010, page 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Fat Albert'' supports a Navy squadron, it is operated by the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) and its crew consists solely of USMC personnel. At some [[air show]]s featuring the team, ''Fat Albert'' takes part, performing flyovers. Until 2009, it also demonstrated its [[JATO|rocket-assisted takeoff]] (RATO) capabilities; these ended due to dwindling supplies of rockets.&lt;ref name=&quot;FA JATO&quot;&gt;McCullough, Amy. &quot;Abort Launch: Air shows to do without Fat Albert's famed JATO.&quot; ''[[Marine Corps Times]],'' 9 November 2009.

The AC-130 also holds the record for the longest sustained flight by a C-130. From 22 to 24 October 1997, two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from Hurlburt Field, Florida to Taegu (Daegu), [[South Korea]], being refuelled seven times by KC-135 tanker aircraft. This record flight beat the previous record longest flight by over 10 hours and the two gunships took on {{convert|410000|lb|abbr=on}} of fuel. The gunship has been used in every major U.S. combat operation since Vietnam, except for [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]], the 1986 attack on Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsoc.af.mil/library/afsocheritage/index.asp &quot;AFSOC Heritage.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319013250/http://www2.afsoc.af.mil/library/afsocheritage/index.asp |date=19 March 2014 }} ''US Air Force Special Operations Command.''

During the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan in 2001]] and the ongoing support of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]), the C-130 Hercules has been used operationally by Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, Spain, the UK and the United States.

During the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] ([[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]), the C-130 Hercules was used operationally by Australia, the UK and the United States. After the initial invasion, C-130 operators as part of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]] used their C-130s to support their forces in Iraq.

Since 2004, the Pakistan Air Force has employed C-130s in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]].

C-130s temporarily based at [[Kelly Field Annex|Kelly Field]] conducted [[mosquito control]] aerial spray applications over areas of eastern Texas devastated by [[Hurricane Harvey]]. This special mission treated more than 2.3 million acres at the direction of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] and the [[Texas Department of State Health Services]] (DSHS) to assist in recovery efforts by helping contain the significant increase in pest insects caused by large amounts of standing, stagnant water. The [[910th Airlift Wing]] operates the Department of Defense's only aerial spray capability to control pest insect populations, eliminate undesired and [[invasive vegetation]] and disperse oil spills in large bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youngstown.afrc.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/865/Article/178927/aerial-spray-mission.aspx|title=Aerial Spray Mission|website=Youngstown Air Reserve Station|language=en-US|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108230359/http://www.youngstown.afrc.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/865/Article/178927/aerial-spray-mission.aspx|archive-date=8 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aerial spray flight also is now able to operate during the night with [[Night-vision device|NVG's]], which increases the flight's best case spray capacity from approximately 60 thousand acres per day to approximately 190 thousand acres per day.

In the early 1970s Congress created the [[Modular Airborne FireFighting System]] (MAFFS) which is a joint operation between The [[U.S. Forest Service]] who supply the systems and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] who supply the C-130 aircraft.  The roll-on/roll-off systems allow existing aircraft to be temporarily converted into a 3,000-gallon [[airtanker]] for fighting [[wildfire]]s when demand exceeds the supply of privately contracted and publicly available [[airtankers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land/fire/planes/maffs |title=Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems (MAFFS) |website=U.S. Forest Service |publisher=U.S. Forest Service |access-date=1 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, 22 retired USAF C-130As were removed from storage and transferred to the U.S. Forest Service, which then [[U.S. Forest Service airtanker scandal|transferred them to six private companies]] to be converted into air tankers. [[2002 airtanker crashes|One of these C-130s crashed]] in June 2002 while operating the Retardant Aerial Delivery System (RADS) near Walker, CA. The crash was attributed to wing separation caused by fatigue stress cracking and contributed to the grounding of the entire large aircraft fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/about/employment/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20020621X00954&amp;ntsbno=LAX02GA201&amp;akey=1|title=NTSB Identification: LAX02GA201|last=Anonymous|first=Anonymous|website=National Transportation Safety Board|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|access-date=1 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After and extensive review, [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]] and [[Bureau of Land Management|The Bureau of Land Management]] declined to renew the leases on nine C-130A over concerns about the age of the aircraft, which had been in service since the 1950s, and their ability to handle the forces generated by aerial firefighting.

More recently, an updated Retardant Aerial Delivery System known as RADS XL was developed by Coulson Aviation USA. That system consists of a C-130H/Q retrofitted with an in-floor discharge system, combined with a removable 3,500- or 4,000-gallon water tank. The combined system is FAA certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C-130H/Q Fire Fighting Air Tanker|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/2013-hoc-presentations/2013-HOC-Tuesday/Tues%201145%20Coulson%20Aviation.pdf|access-date=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415073023/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/aero/documents/global-sustainment/product-support/2013-hoc-presentations/2013-HOC-Tuesday/Tues%201145%20Coulson%20Aviation.pdf|archive-date=15 April 2015 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2020, Coulson's Tanker 134, an EC-130Q registered N134CG, crashed during aerial firefighting operations in [[New South Wales]], Australia, killing all three crew members.

==Accidents==
{{main|List of accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed C-130 Hercules}}

The C-130 Hercules has had a low accident rate in general. The Royal Air Force recorded an accident rate of about one aircraft loss per 250,000 flying hours over the last 40 years, placing it behind [[Vickers VC10]]s and [[Lockheed TriStar (RAF)|Lockheed TriStars]] with no flying losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dasa&quot;&gt;[http://www.dasa.mod.uk/natstats/accidents/accdam/acctab2.html &quot;Aircraft Air Accidents and Damage Rates.&quot;] ''Defence Analytical Services Agency.'' Retrieved: 2 October 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709094759/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/natstats/accidents/accdam/acctab2.html |date=9 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; USAF C-130A/B/E-models had an overall attrition rate of 5% as of 1989 as compared to 1–2% for commercial airliners in the U.S., according to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]], 10% for [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers, and 20% for fighters ([[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]], [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]]), trainers ([[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]], [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]]), and helicopters ([[Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King|H-3]]).&lt;ref&gt;Diehl 2002, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 70 aircraft were lost by the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Marine Corps during combat operations in the Vietnam War in Southeast Asia. By the nature of the Hercules' worldwide service, the pattern of losses provides an interesting barometer of the global hot spots over the past 50 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;avs1&quot;&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type.php?type=335-C &quot;Lockheed C-130 Hercules.&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804015151/http://aviation-safety.net/database/type/type.php?type=335-C |date=4 August 2011 }} ''Aviation Safety Network, Flight Safety Foundation,'' 13 November 2004.
