'''Clarence Leon Brown''' (May 10, 1890 &amp;ndash; August 17, 1987) was an American film director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Little |first1=Lexie |title=A Roustabout Career: The Forgotten Celebrity of Clarence Brown |url=https://torchbearer.utk.edu/2019/07/roustabout-career-forgotten-celebrity-clarence-brown/ |website=Torchbearer |accessdate=17 July 2019 |date=10 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], to Larkin Harry Brown, a cotton manufacturer, and Katherine Ann Brown (n√©e Gaw), Brown moved to [[Tennessee]] when he was 11 years old. He attended [[Knoxville High School (Tennessee)|Knoxville High School]]&lt;ref&gt;John Shearer, [http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/may/28/052810knoxhighbox2/ Famous alumni from Knoxville High School], ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'', May 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Tennessee]], both in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], graduating from the university at the age of 19 with two degrees in [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clarence Brown Collection - Special Collections - Libraries - The University of Tennessee, Knoxville|url = http://www.lib.utk.edu/special/featured-collections/clarence-brown/|website = www.lib.utk.edu|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early fascination in [[Car|automobiles]] led Brown to a job with the [[Stevens-Duryea|Stevens-Duryea Company]], then to his own Brown Motor Car Company in [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clarence Brown Collection - Special Collections - Libraries - The University of Tennessee, Knoxville|url = http://www.lib.utk.edu/special/featured-collections/clarence-brown/|website = www.lib.utk.edu|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned the car dealership after developing an interest in motion pictures around 1913. He was hired by the Peerless Studio at [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], and became an assistant to the French-born director [[Maurice Tourneur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clarence Brown - About This Person - Movies &amp; TV - NYTimes.com|url = https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/83202/Clarence-Brown|website = www.nytimes.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After serving in [[World War I]], Brown was given his first co-directing credit (with Tourneur) for ''[[The Great Redeemer]]'' (1920). Later that year, he directed a major portion of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1920 American film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' after Tourneur was injured in a fall.

Brown moved to [[Universal Studios|Universal]] in 1924, and then to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], where he stayed until the mid-1950s. At MGM he was one of the main directors of their female stars; he directed [[Joan Crawford]] six times and [[Greta Garbo]] seven.

He was nominated five times (see below) for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as a director and once as a producer, but he never received an Oscar. However, he won Best Foreign Film for ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'', starring Garbo at the 1935 [[Venice International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clarence Brown|url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113284/awards|website = IMDb|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown's films gained a total of 38 Academy Award nominations and earned nine Oscars. Brown himself received six Academy Award nominations and in 1949, he won the British Academy Award for the film version of [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Intruder in the Dust (1949 film)|Intruder in the Dust]].

In 1957, Brown was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by [[George Eastman House]] for distinguished contribution to the art of film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = George Eastman Award|url = https://www.eastman.org/george-eastman-award|website = George Eastman Museum|access-date = 2016-02-16|first = Molly|last = Tarbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown retired a wealthy man due to his real estate investments, but refused to watch new movies, as he feared they might cause him to restart his career.
 
The Clarence Brown Theater, on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History {{!}} Clarence Brown Theatre|url = http://clarencebrowntheatre.com/about-us/history/|website = clarencebrowntheatre.com|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the record for most nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] without a win, with six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clarence Brown|url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113284/bio|website = IMDb|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
