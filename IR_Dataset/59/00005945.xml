The '''Chicago White Sox''' are an American professional [[baseball]] team based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League Central|Central]] division. The White Sox are owned by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], and play their home games at [[Guaranteed Rate Field]], located on the city's [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]]. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League Central|Central]] division.

One of the American League's eight charter [[Major North American professional sports teams|franchises]], the franchise was established as a major league baseball club in {{baseball year|1901}}. The club was originally called the '''Chicago White Stockings''', but this was soon shortened to '''Chicago White Sox'''. The team originally played home games at [[South Side Park]] before moving to [[Comiskey Park]] in {{baseball year|1910}}, where they played until Guaranteed Rate Field (originally known as '''Comiskey Park''' and then known as '''[[U.S. Cellular]] Field''') opened in 1991.

The White Sox won the [[1906 World Series]] with a defense-oriented team dubbed &quot;the Hitless Wonders&quot;, and the [[1917 World Series]] led by [[Eddie Cicotte]], [[Eddie Collins]], and [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. The [[1919 World Series]] was marred by the [[Black Sox Scandal]], in which several members of the White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to [[Match fixing|fix games]]. In response, Major League Baseball's new [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned the players from Major League Baseball for life. In [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959]], led by [[Early Wynn]], [[Nellie Fox]], [[Luis Aparicio]] and manager [[Al López]], the White Sox won the [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennant]]. They won the [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|AL pennant in 2005]], and went on to win the [[2005 World Series|World Series]], led by World Series MVP [[Jermaine Dye]], [[Paul Konerko]], [[Mark Buehrle]], catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]], and the first [[Latino]] manager to win the World Series, [[Ozzie Guillén]].

From 1901 to 2019, the White Sox have an overall record of 9283–9215 (a {{winpct|9283|9215}} winning percentage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicago White Sox Team History &amp; Encyclopedia |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/ |website=Baseball Reference |publisher=Baseball Info Solutions |accessdate=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Chicago White Sox}}
[[File:1906 Chicago White Sox.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|1906 White Sox, with club founder Charles Comiskey]]
The White Sox originated as the Sioux City Cornhuskers of the [[Western League (original)|Western League]], a [[minor league]] under the parameters of the National Agreement with the [[National League]]. In 1894, [[Charles Comiskey]] bought the Cornhuskers and moved them to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], where they became the [[St. Paul Saints]]. In 1900, with the approval of Western League president [[Ban Johnson]], Charles Comiskey moved the Saints into his hometown neighborhood of [[Bridgeport, Chicago]], where they became known as the '''White Stockings,''' the former name of Chicago's National League team, the Orphans (now the [[Chicago Cubs]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bova|first=George|title=Sox Fans' Guide to Sox Uniforms|url=http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/rwas/index.php?category=3&amp;id=2104|website=FlyingSock.Com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901]], the Western League broke the National Agreement and became the new major league [[American League]]. The first season in the American League ended with a White Stockings championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1901.shtml|title=1901, after having won in the minor league American League in 1900.   American League Team Statistics and Standings|website=[[Baseball Reference]]|publisher=[[Sports Reference]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that would be the end of the season, as the [[World Series]] did not begin until [[1903 World Series|1903]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stezano|first=Martin|title=6 Things You May Not Know About the World Series|url=http://www.history.com/news/6-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-world-series|date=October 24, 2012|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise, now known as the '''Chicago White Sox''', made its first World Series appearance in [[1906 World Series|1906]], beating the crosstown Cubs in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1906_WS.shtml|title=1906 World Series|publisher=Sports Reference|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The White Sox won a third pennant and second World Series in [[1917 Chicago White Sox season|1917]], beating the [[1917 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in six games with help from stars [[Eddie Cicotte]] and [[Shoeless Joe|&quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1917_WS.shtml|title=1917 World Series|publisher=Sports Reference|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sox were heavily favored in the [[1919 World Series]], but lost to the [[1919 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in eight games. Huge bets on the Reds fueled speculation that the series had been [[Match fixing|fixed]]. A criminal investigation went on in the 1920 season, and though all players were acquitted, commissioner [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] banned eight of the White Sox players for life, in what was known as the [[Black Sox Scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Sox|url=http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html|website=[[Chicago Historical Society]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815042229/http://www.chicagohs.org/history/blacksox.html|archivedate=August 15, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the franchise back, as they did not win another pennant for 40 years.

The White Sox did not finish in the upper half of the American League again until after club founder Charles Comiskey died and passed ownership of the club to his son, [[J. Louis Comiskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=J. Louis Comiskey|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=J_Louis_Comiskey|website=Baseball Library|publisher=Idea Logical|accessdate=May 25, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922175128/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=J_Louis_Comiskey|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They finished in the upper half most years between 1936 and 1946 under the leadership of manager [[Jimmy Dykes]], with star shortstop [[Luke Appling]], known as Ol' Aches and Pains, and pitcher [[Ted Lyons]]. Appling and Lyons have their numbers 4 and 16 retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retired Numbers|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/retired_numbers.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After J. Louis Comiskey died in 1939, ownership of the club was passed down to his widow, [[Grace Comiskey]]. The club was later passed down to Grace's children [[Dorothy Comiskey Rigney|Dorothy]] and [[Chuck Comiskey|Chuck]] in 1956, with Dorothy selling a majority share to a group led by [[Bill Veeck]] after the [[1958 Chicago White Sox season|1958 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Owners|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/owners.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veeck was notorious for his promotional stunts, attracting fans to [[Comiskey Park]] with the new &quot;exploding scoreboard&quot; and outfield shower. In 1961, [[Arthur Allyn, Jr.]] briefly owned the club before selling to his brother [[John Allyn]].

From 1951 to 1967, the White Sox had their longest period of sustained success, scoring a winning record for 17 straight seasons. Known as the &quot;Go-Go White Sox&quot; for their tendency to focus on speed and getting on base versus power hitting, they featured stars such as [[Minnie Miñoso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minnie Miñoso|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/minosmi01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nellie Fox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nellie Fox|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/foxne01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luis Aparicio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis Aparicio|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/aparilu01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billy Pierce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billy Pierce|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/piercbi02.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sherm Lollar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sherm Lollar|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lollash01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1957 to 1965, the Sox were managed by [[Al López]]. The Sox finished in the upper half of the American League in eight of his nine seasons, including six years in the top two of the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al López|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/lopezal01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959]], the White Sox ended the [[New York Yankees]]' dominance over the American League, and won their first pennant since the ill-fated 1919 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1959 Chicago White Sox season|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1959.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite winning game one of the [[1959 World Series]] 11-0, they fell to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1959 World Series|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=1959|website=MLB.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 1960s and 70s were a tumultuous time for the Sox, as they struggled to win games and attract fans. Allyn and [[Bud Selig]] agreed to a handshake deal that would give Selig control of the club and move them to [[Milwaukee]]; however, this was blocked by the American League.&lt;ref name=&quot;BovaSOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Bova|first=George|title=Save Our Sox!|url=http://whitesoxinteractive.com/History&amp;Glory/SaveOurSox.htm|website=FlyingSock.com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selig instead bought the [[Seattle Pilots]] and moved them to Milwaukee, putting enormous pressure on the American League to place a team in [[Seattle]]. A plan was in place for the Sox to move to Seattle and for [[Charlie Finley]] to move his [[Oakland A's]] to Chicago. However, Chicago had a renewed interest in the Sox after the 1972 season, and the American League instead added the expansion [[Seattle Mariners]]. The [[1972 Chicago White Sox season|1972 White Sox]]  had the lone successful season of this era, as [[Dick Allen]] wound up winning the American League MVP award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Allen|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/allendi01.shtml?redir|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have said that Dick Allen is responsible for saving the White Sox in Chicago. Bill Veeck returned as owner of the Sox in 1975, and despite not having much money, they managed to win 90 games in [[1977 Chicago White Sox season|1977]], a team known as the South Side Hitmen.

However, the team's fortunes plummeted after the 1977 season, plagued by 90-loss teams and scarred by the notorious [[Disco Demolition Night]] promotion in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vettel|first=Phil|title=Steve Dahl's Disco Demolition at Comiskey Park|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-disco-story-story.html|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Veeck was forced to sell the team. He rejected offers from ownership groups intent on moving the club to [[Denver]], eventually agreeing to sell the club to [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.|Ed DeBartolo]], who was the only prospective owner who promised to keep the Sox in Chicago. However, DeBartolo was rejected by the owners, and the club was then sold to a group headed by [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and [[Eddie Einhorn]]. The Reinsdorf era started off well, as the Sox won their first division title in [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|1983]], led by manager [[Tony La Russa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony La Russa|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/larusto01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stars [[Carlton Fisk]], [[Tom Paciorek]], [[Ron Kittle]], [[Harold Baines]], and [[LaMarr Hoyt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1983 Chicago White Sox Season|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1983.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sport Reference|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1986 season, La Russa was fired by announcer-turned-GM [[Ken Harrelson]]. La Russa went on to manage in six World Series (winning three) with the [[Oakland A's]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals]], ending up in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] as the third-winningest manager of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garfein|first=Chuck|title=Hawk Opens Up on Firing La Russa|url=http://www.csnchicago.com/blog/sox-drawer/hawk-opens-firing-la-russa|date=February 4, 2013|website=[[CSN Chicago]]|accessdate=May 26, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212917/http://www.csnchicago.com/blog/sox-drawer/hawk-opens-firing-la-russa|archivedate=September 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frank Thomas 1997.jpg|thumb|Frank Thomas in 1997]]
The White Sox struggled for the rest of the 1980s, as Chicago fought to keep the Sox in town. Reinsdorf wanted to replace the aging [[Comiskey Park]], and sought public funds to do so. When talks stalled, a strong offer was made to move the team to the [[Tampa, Florida]], area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Paul Francis|title=The Franchise moves that never happened|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/the-franchise-moves-that-almost-happened/|date=June 21, 2011|website=[[The Hardball Times]]|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for a new ballpark was approved in an 11th-hour deal by the [[Illinois State Legislature]] on June 30, 1988, with the stipulation that new park had to be built on the corner of 35th and Shields, across the street from the old ballpark, as opposed to the suburban ballpark the owners had designed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BovaSOS&quot; /&gt; Architects offered to redesign the ballpark to a more &quot;retro&quot; feel that would fit in the city blocks around Comiskey Park; however, the ownership group was set on a 1991 open date, so they kept the old design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bova|first=George|title=A Conversation with Phillip Bess|url=http://whitesoxinteractive.com/FixComiskey/Bess/Conversation1.htm|website=FlyingSock.com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[new Comiskey Park]] opened. However, it was rendered obsolete a year later with the opening of the retro-inspired [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]]. The park, now known as [[Guaranteed Rate Field]], underwent many renovations in the early 2000s to give it a more retro feel.

The White Sox were fairly successful in the 1990s and early 2000s, with 12 winning seasons from 1990–2005. First baseman [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]] became the face of the franchise, ending his career as the White Sox's all-time leader in runs, doubles, home runs, total bases, and walks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Thomas|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/thomas-frank|publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major players included [[Robin Ventura]], [[Ozzie Guillén]], [[Jack McDowell]], and [[Bobby Thigpen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1993 Chicago White Sox |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1993.shtml |website=Baseball Reference |publisher=Sport Reference |accessdate=October 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210033706/http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1993.shtml |archivedate=February 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sox won the West division in [[1993 Chicago White Sox season|1993]], and were in first place in [[1994 Chicago White Sox season|1994]] when the season was cancelled due to the [[1994 MLB Strike]].

In [[2004 Chicago White Sox season|2004]], Ozzie Guillén was hired as manager of his former team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guillen Back with White Sox as Manager|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1652981|date=November 5, 2003|website=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing second in 2004, the Sox won 99 games and the Central Division title in [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|2005]] behind the work of stars [[Paul Konerko]], [[Mark Buehrle]], [[A.

Guillén had marginal success during the rest of his tenure, with the Sox winning the Central Division title in [[2008 Chicago White Sox season|2008]] after a [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] with the [[2008 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merkin|first=Scott|title=White Sox claim AL Central Crown|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/3576317/|date=October 1, 2008|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=May 25, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124075416/http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/3576317/|archivedate=November 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Guillén left the White Sox after the [[2011 Chicago White Sox season|2011 season]], and was replaced by former teammate Robin Ventura.

[[Rick Renteria]], the 2016 White Sox [[bench coach]], was promoted to the role of manager.

Prior to the start of the 2017 season, the White Sox traded  Sale to the Boston Red Sox and Eaton to the [[Washington Nationals]] for prospects including [[Yoan Moncada]], [[Lucas Giolito]], and [[Michael Kopech]], signaling the beginning of a rebuilding period. During the 2017 season, the White Sox continued their rebuild when they made a blockbuster trade with their cross-town rival, the Chicago Cubs, in a swap that featured the White Sox sending pitcher José Quintana to the Cubs in exchange for four prospects headlined by outfielder [[Eloy Jiménez|Eloy Jimenez]] and pitcher [[Dylan Cease]]. This was the first trade between the White Sox and Cubs since the 2006 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/07/13/white-sox-cubs-cold-war-jose-quintana-trade/476409001/|title=White Sox, Cubs cold war is over with Jose Quintana trade|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballparks==
{{Main|Guaranteed Rate Field}}

In the late 1980s, the franchise threatened to relocate to [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] (as did the [[San Francisco Giants]]), but frantic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-05-12/news/8803160481_1_sox-owners-comiskey-park-james-thompson |work=Chicago Tribune | first=John | last=Kass | title=Thompson: Sox Vow To Stay If Bill Passes | date=May 12, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; lobbying on the part of the Illinois governor [[James R. Thompson]] and state legislature resulted in approval (by one vote) of public funding for a new stadium.  Designed primarily as a baseball stadium (as opposed to a &quot;multipurpose&quot; stadium) New Comiskey Park (redubbed [[U.S. Cellular]] in 2003 and [[Guaranteed Rate Field]] in 2016) was built in a 1960s style similar to [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Kauffman Stadium]]. It opened in {{baseball year|1991}} to positive reviews; many praised its wide open concourses, excellent sight lines, and natural grass (unlike other stadiums of the era such as [[Rogers Centre]] in Toronto). The park's inaugural season drew 2,934,154 fans&amp;nbsp;— at the time, an all-time attendance record for any Chicago baseball team.

[[File:Uscellular.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the upper deck of U.S. Cellular Field in 2006]]

In recent years, money accrued from the sale of naming rights to the field has been allocated for renovations to make the park more aesthetically appealing and fan friendly. Notable renovations of early phases included: reorientation of the bullpens parallel to the field of play (thus decreasing slightly the formerly symmetrical dimensions of the outfield); filling seats in up to and shortening the outfield wall; ballooning foul-line seat sections out toward the field of play; creating a new multitiered [[batter's eye]], allowing fans to see out through one-way screens from the center-field vantage point, and complete with concession stand and bar-style seating on its &quot;fan deck&quot;; and renovating all concourse areas with brick, historic murals, and new concession stand ornaments to establish a more friendly feel. The stadium's steel and concrete were repainted dark gray and black. The scoreboard Jumbotron was also replaced with a new [[Mitsubishi]] Diamondvision [[High-definition television|HDTV]] giant screen.

More recently, the top quarter of the upper deck was removed in {{baseball year|2004}} and a black wrought-metal roof was placed over it, covering all but the first eight rows of seats. This decreased [[seating capacity]] from 47,098 to 40,615; 2005 also had the introduction of the Scout Seats, redesignating (and reupholstering) 200 lower-deck seats behind home plate as an exclusive area, with seat-side waitstaff and a complete restaurant located underneath the concourse. The most significant structural addition besides the new roof was 2005's FUNdamentals Deck, a multitiered structure on the left-field concourse containing batting cages, a small [[Tee Ball]] field, speed pitch, and several other child-themed activities intended to entertain and educate young fans with the help of coaching staff from the Chicago Bulls/Sox Training Academy. This structure was used during the 2005 playoffs by [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] as a broadcasting platform.

Designed as a seven-phase plan, the renovations were completed before the 2007 season with the seventh and final phase. The most visible renovation in this final phase was replacing the original blue seats with green seats. The upper deck already had new green seats, put in before the beginning of the 2006 season. Beginning with the 2007 season, a new luxury-seating section was added in the former press box. This section has amenities similar to those of the Scout Seats section. After the 2007 season, the ballpark continued renovation projects despite the phases bring complete.

In July 2019, the White Sox extended the netting to the foul pole. This construction lasted over the 2019 All-Star Game.

After the 1909 season, the Sox moved five blocks to the north to play in the new Comiskey Park, while the 39th Street grounds became the home of the [[Chicago American Giants]] of the Negro Leagues. Billed as the Baseball Palace of the World, it originally held 28,000 seats and eventually grew to hold over 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=David J.|title=Never on a Friday|url=http://www.chicagobaseballmuseum.org/chicago-baseball-museum-Comisky-Park.php|website=Chicago Baseball Museum|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became known for its many odd features, such as the outdoor shower and the exploding scoreboard. When it closed after the [[1990 Chicago White Sox season|1990 season]], it was the oldest ballpark still in [[Major League Baseball]].

==Logos and uniforms==
{{See also|Major League Baseball uniforms}}
Over the years, the White Sox have become noted for many of their [[baseball uniform|uniform]] innovations and changes. In 1960, they became the first team in the major sports to put players' last names on [[jersey (clothing)#In sports|jerseys]] for identification purposes.

[[File:Im cws logo 1912.png|frame|The 1912–1917, 1919–1929, 1931, and 1936–1938 Chicago White Sox logo]]

In 1912 the White Sox debuted a large &quot;S&quot; in a Roman-style [[font]], with a small &quot;O&quot; inside the top loop of the &quot;S&quot; and a small &quot;X&quot; inside the bottom loop. This is the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team and the 1919 Black Sox. With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark-blue logo with the large &quot;S&quot; lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block style into the 1940s). Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were primarily navy blue trimmed with red.

The White Sox logo in the 1950s and 1960s (actually beginning in the 1949 season) was the word &quot;SOX&quot; in an Old English font, diagonally arranged, with the &quot;S&quot; larger than the other two letters. From 1949 through 1963, the primary color was black (trimmed with red after 1951). The Old English &quot;SOX&quot; in black lettering is the logo associated with the Go-Go Sox era.

In 1964, the primary color went back to navy blue, and the road uniforms changed from gray to pale blue. In 1971, the team's primary color changed from royal blue to red, with the color of their [[pin stripes|pinstripes]] and [[baseball cap|caps]] changing to red. The 1971–1975 uniform included red [[baseball uniform#Stockings and pants|socks]].


In 1976, the team's uniforms changed again. The team's primary color changed back from red to navy. The team based their uniforms on a style worn in the early days of the franchise, with white jerseys worn at home, and blue on the [[road (sports)|road]]. The team brought back white socks for the last time in team history. The socks featured a different stripe pattern every year. The team also had the option to wear blue or white pants with either jersey. Additionally, the team's &quot;SOX&quot; logo was changed to a modern-looking &quot;SOX&quot; in a bold font, with 'CHICAGO' written across the jersey. Finally, the team's logo featured a [[silhouette]] of a batter over the words &quot;SOX&quot;.

The new uniforms also featured [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and were designed to be worn untucked&amp;nbsp;— both unprecedented. Yet by far, the most unusual wrinkle was the option to wear shorts, which the White Sox did for the first game of a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Kansas City Royals]] in 1976. The [[Hollywood Stars]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] had previously tried the same concept, but it was also poorly received. Apart from aesthetic issues, as a practical matter, shorts are not conducive to sliding, due to the likelihood of significant abrasions.

Upon taking over the team in 1980, new owners Eddie Einhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf announced a contest where fans were invited to create new uniforms for the White Sox. The winning entries submitted by a fan, had the word &quot;SOX&quot; was written across the front of the jersey, in the same font as a cap, inside of a large blue stripe trimmed with red. The red and blue stripes were also on the sleeves, and the road jerseys were gray to the home whites.  In those jerseys, the White Sox won 99 games and the AL West championship in 1983, the best record in the majors.

[[File:White Sox Alt Logo.svg|thumb|150px|Alternate logo, on road uniforms (1991–2010)]]

After five years, those uniforms were retired and replaced with a more basic uniform that had &quot;White Sox&quot; written across the front in script, with &quot;Chicago&quot; on the front of the road jersey. The cap logo was also changed to a cursive &quot;C&quot;, although the batter logo was retained for several years.

For a midseason 1990 game at Comiskey Park, the White Sox appeared once in a uniform based on that of the 1917 White Sox. They then switched their regular uniform style once more.  In September, for the final series at Old Comiskey Park, the White Sox rolled out a new logo, a simplified version of the 1949-63 old English &quot;SOX&quot; logo. They also introduced a uniform with black pinstripes, also similar to the Go-Go Sox era uniform. The team's primary color changed back to black, this time with silver trim. The team also introduced a new sock logo—a white silhouette of a sock centered inside a white outline of a baseball diamond—which appeared as a sleeve patch on the away and alternate uniforms until 2011, when the patch was switched with the primary logo on the away uniform. With minor modifications (i.e., occasionally wearing vests, black game jerseys), the White Sox have used this style ever since.

During the 2012 and 2013 seasons, the White Sox wore their throwback uniforms at home every Sunday, starting with the 1972 red-pinstriped throwback jerseys worn during the 2012 season, followed by the 1981–86 uniforms the next season. In the 2014 season, the &quot;Winning Ugly&quot; throwbacks were promoted to fulltime alternate status, and is now worn at home on Sundays. In one game during the 2014 season, they paired their throwbacks with a cap featuring the batter logo instead of the wordmark &quot;SOX&quot;; this is currently their batting-practice cap prior to games in the throwback uniforms.

===Nicknames===
The White Sox were originally known as the White Stockings, a reference to the original name of the [[Chicago Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicago Cubs Team History &amp; Encyclopedia|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fit the name in headlines, local newspapers such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' abbreviated the name alternatively to Stox and Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=X Marks The Baseball team|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2005/10/x_marks_the_baseball_team.html|date=October 25, 2015|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|department=Explainer|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Comiskey would officially adopt the White Sox nickname in the club's first years, making them the first team to officially use the &quot;Sox&quot; name.

Most fans and Chicago media refer to the team as simply &quot;the Sox&quot;. The [[Spanish language]] media sometimes refer to the team as ''Medias Blancas'' for &quot;White Socks.&quot;

Several individual White Sox teams have received nicknames over the years:

*The [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|1906 team]] was known as the '''Hitless Wonders''' due to their .230 batting average, worst in the American League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1906: The Hitless Wonders|url=http://www.thisgreatgame.com/1906-baseball-history.html|website=This Great Game|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their hitting woes, the Sox would beat the crosstown Cubs for their first world title.
*The [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|1919 White Sox]] are known as the '''[[Black Sox Scandal|Black Sox]]''' after eight players were banned from baseball for fixing the [[1919 World Series]].
*The [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|1959 White Sox]] were referred to as the '''Go-Go White Sox''' due to their speed-based offense. The period from 1950 to 1964, in which the White Sox had 15 consecutive winning seasons, is sometimes referred to as the Go-Go era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Secter|first=Bob|title=The 1959 'Go-Go' White Sox and the air-raid sirens|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-whitesox1959-story-story.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[1977 Chicago White Sox season|1977 team]] was known as the '''South Side Hitmen''' as they contended for the division title after finishing last [[1976 Chicago White Sox season|the year before]].
*The [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|1983 White Sox]] became known as the '''Winning Ugly White Sox''' in response to [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] manager [[Doug Rader]]'s derisive comments that the White Sox &quot;...weren't playing well.

{{See also|List of Major League Baseball mascots}}
From 1961 until 1991, lifelong Chicago resident Andrew Rozdilsky performed as the unofficial yet popular [[mascot]] &quot;[[Andy the Clown]]&quot; for the White Sox at the original Comiskey Park. Known for his elongated &quot;Come on you White Sox&quot; battle cry, Andy got his start after a group of friends invited him to a Sox game in 1960, where he decided to wear his clown costume and entertain fans in his section. That response was so positive that when he won free [[1961 Chicago White Sox season|1961]] season tickets, he decided to wear his costume to all games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Stacey|title=Andrew Rozdilsky, 77, Clown for Sox|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-09-24/news/9509240307_1_clown-international-harvester-home-opener|date=September 24, 1995|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comiskey Park ushers eventually offered free admission to Rozdilsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ley|first=Tom|title=A Brief History of Terrible Chicago Mascots|url=http://deadspin.com/a-brief-history-of-terrible-chicago-mascots-1501106550|date=January 14, 2014|website=[[Deadspin]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in [[1981 Chicago White Sox season|1981]], the new ownership group led by Jerry Reinsdorf introduced a twosome, called [[Ribbie and Roobarb]], as the official team mascots, and banned Rozdilsky from performing in the lower seating level. Ribbie and Roobarb were very unpopular, as they were seen as an attempt to get rid of the beloved Andy the Clown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Sox History: The sad story of Ribbie and Roobarb|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2013/3/16/4106198/white-sox-history-the-sad-story-of-ribbie-and-roobarb|date=March 16, 2013|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SBNation|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the Sox got rid of Ribbie and Roobarb, and Andy The Clown was not permitted to perform in new Comiskey Park when it opened in [[1991 Chicago White Sox season|1991]]. In the early 1990s, the White Sox had a cartoon mascot named Waldo the White Sox Wolf that advertised the &quot;Silver and Black Pack&quot;, the team's kids' club at the time.

[[Nancy Faust]] became the White Sox organist in 1970, a position she held for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crouse|first=Karen|title=Ballpark Farewell, Played Adagio|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/sports/baseball/18organist.html|date=September 17, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the first ballpark organists to play pop music, and became known for her songs playing on the names of opposing players (such as [[Iron Butterfly]]'s &quot;[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]&quot; for [[Pete Incaviglia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Vickery|first=Hal|title=Flashing Back with Nancy Faust|url=http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/rwas/index.php?category=11&amp;id=2893|website=FlyingSock.com|publisher=White Sox Interactive|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her many years with the White Sox established her as one of the last great stadium [[organist]]s.

Similar to the Boston Red Sox with &quot;[[Sweet Caroline]]&quot; (and two songs named &quot;[[Tessie]]&quot;), and the [[New York Yankees]] with &quot;[[Theme from New York, New York]]&quot;, several songs have become associated with the White Sox over the years. They include:
*[[Let's Go, Go-Go White Sox|&quot;Let's Go Go Go White Sox&quot;]] by [[Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers]] – A tribute to the &quot;Go-Go White Sox&quot; of the late 1950s, this song serves as the unofficial fight song of the White Sox. In 2005, scoreboard operator Jeff Szynal found a record of the song and played it for a &quot;Turn Back the Clock&quot; game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, whom the Sox played in the [[1959 World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Theiser|first=Kelly|title=Go-Go song revival a hit with fans|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/1254100/|date=October 18, 2005|website=White Sox official website|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=May 25, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413225142/http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/1254100/|archivedate=April 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After catcher [[A.

*&quot;[[Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye]]&quot; by [[Steam (band)|Steam]] – Organist Nancy Faust played this song during the 1977 pennant race when a [[Kansas City Royals]] pitcher was pulled, and it became an immediate hit with White Sox fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vickery&quot; /&gt; Faust is credited with making the song a stadium anthem and saving it from obscurity. To this day, the song remains closely associated with the White Sox, who play it when the team forces a pitching change, and occasionally on Sox home runs and victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=David|title=Goodbye, Paul Leka: Writer of sports anthem 'Na Na Hey Hey' dies|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/good-bye-paul-leka-writer-of-sports-anthem-na-na-hey-hey-dies?urn=mlb,wp25229|date=October 24, 2011|website=[[Yahoo!

===Rivalries===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2008}}

====Crosstown Classic====
[[File:West Side Grounds 1905.jpg|thumb|right|Fielder Jones of the White Sox hits the ball against Cubs at West Side Grounds, 1905]]
{{Main|Cubs–White Sox rivalry}}
The Chicago Cubs are the [[Cubs–White Sox rivalry|crosstown rivals]] of the White Sox, a rivalry that some made fun of prior to the White Sox's 2005 title because both of them had extremely long championship droughts. The nature of the rivalry is unique; with the exception of the [[1906 World Series]], in which the White Sox upset the favored Cubs, the teams never met in an official game until {{baseball year|1997}}, when interleague play was introduced. In the intervening time, the two teams sometimes met for exhibition games. The White Sox currently lead the regular-season series 48–39, winning the last four seasons in a row. The BP Crosstown Cup was introduced in 2010 and the White Sox won the first three seasons (2010-2012) until the Cubs first won the Cup in 2013 by sweeping the season series.  The White Sox won the Cup the next season and retained the Cup the following two years (series was a tie - Cup remains with defending team in the event of a tie).  The Cubs took back the Cup in 2017.  Two series sweeps have occurred since interleague play began, both by the Cubs in 1998 and 2013.

An example of this volatile rivalry is the game played between the White Sox and the  Cubs at U.S. Cellular Field on May 20, 2006. White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski was running home on a sacrifice fly by center fielder [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]] and smashed into Cubs catcher [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]], who was blocking home plate. Pierzynski lost his helmet in the collision, and slapped the plate as he rose. Barrett stopped him, and after exchanging a few words, punched Pierzynski in the face, causing a melee to ensue. Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman [[John Mabry]] got involved in a separate confrontation, although  Mabry was later determined to be attempting to be a peacemaker. After 10 minutes of conferring following the fight, the umpires ejected Pierzynski, Barrett, Anderson, and Mabry. As Pierzynski entered his dugout, he pumped his arms, causing the soldout crowd at U.S. Cellular Field to erupt in cheers. When play resumed, White Sox second baseman [[Tadahito Iguchi]] blasted a grand slam to put the White Sox up 5–0 on their way to a 7–0 win over their crosstown rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=2452050|title=Cubs' Barrett slugs Pierzynski, leads to melee|date=2006-05-20|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While  other major league cities and metropolitan areas have two teams co-exist, all of the others feature at least one team that began playing there in 1961 or later, whereas the White Sox and Cubs have been competing for their city's fans since 1901.

====Historical====
A historical regional rival was the St. Louis Browns. Through the 1953 season, the two teams were located fairly close to each other (including the 1901 season when the Browns were the Milwaukee Brewers), and could have been seen as the American League equivalent of the [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry]], being that Chicago and St. Louis have for years been connected by the same highway ([[U.S. Route 66]] and now [[Interstate 55]]). The rivalry has been somewhat revived at times in the past, involving the Browns' current identity, the [[Baltimore Orioles]], most notably in 1983.

The current Milwaukee Brewers franchise were arguably the White Sox's main and biggest rival, due to the proximity of the two cities (resulting in large numbers of White Sox fans who would regularly be in attendance at the Brewers' former home, [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]), and with the teams competing in the same American League division for the 1970 and 1971 seasons and then again from 1994 to 1997. The rivalry has since cooled off, however, when the Brewers moved to the [[National League]] in 1998.

===Radio===
[[File:Bob Elson circa 1940s.JPG|thumb|150px|Elson in the 1940s]]
The White Sox did not sell exclusive rights for radio broadcasts from radio's inception until 1944, instead having local stations share rights for games, and after [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720) was forced to abdicate their rights to the team in the 1943 after 16 seasons due to children's programming commitments from their network, [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbmradio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagobaseballmuseum.org/chicago-baseball-history-news/chicago-baseball-history-feature/wgn-radio-720-signal-best-possible-2018-home-white-sox/|title=WGN-Radio and 720 signal best possible 2018 home for White Sox|last=Castle|first=George|date=14 February 2018|publisher=Chicago Baseball Museum|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Broadcasters|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/broadcasters.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Sox first granted exclusive rights in 1944, and bounced between stations until 1952, when they started having all games broadcast on [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] (1000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right on Q: A brief history of the White Sox on the radio|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2014/5/17/5725462/white-sox-radio-history|date=May 17, 2014|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period of instability, one thing remained constant, the White Sox play-by-play announcer, [[Bob Elson]]. Known as the &quot;Commander&quot;, Elson was the voice of the Sox from 1929 until his departure from the club in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1979 Ford Frick Award Winner Bob Elson|url=http://baseballhall.org/discover/awards/ford-c-frick/bob-elson|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he was the recipient of the [[Ford Frick Award]], and his profile is permanently on display in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].

After the 1966 season, radio rights shifted from WCFL to [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] (670). An [[NBC]]-owned and -operated station until 1988 when [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] purchased it after NBC's withdrawal from radio, it was the home of the Sox until the 1996 season, outside of a team nadir in the early '70s, where it was forced to [[brokered programming|broker time]] on suburban [[La Grange, Illinois|La Grange]]'s [[WRDZ (AM)|WTAQ]] (1300) and [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]]'s [[WOJO|WEAW-FM]] (105.1) to have their play-by-play air in some form (though WEAW transmitted from the [[875 North Michigan Avenue|John Hancock Center]], FM radio was not established as a band for sports play-by-play at the time),&lt;ref name=&quot;cbmradio&quot; /&gt; and a one-season contract on [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] (780) in 1981. After Elson's retirement in 1970, [[Harry Caray]] began his tenure as the voice of the White Sox, on radio and on television. Although best remembered as a broadcaster for the rival Cubs, Caray was very popular with White Sox fans, pining for a &quot;cold one&quot; during broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989 Ford Frick Award Winner Harry Caray|url=http://baseballhall.org/discover/awards/ford-c-frick/harry-caray|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caray often broadcast from the stands, sitting at a table set up amid the bleachers. It became a badge of honor among Sox fans to &quot;Buy Harry a beer...&quot; By game's end, one would see a large stack of empty beer cups beside his microphone. This only endeared him to fans that much more. In fact, he started his tradition of leading the fans in the singing of &quot;[[Take Me Out To The Ballgame]]&quot; with the Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bohn|first=Matt|title=Harry Caray|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/d6a6a34e|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caray, alongside color analyst [[Jimmy Piersall]], was never afraid to criticize the Sox, which angered numerous Sox managers and players, notably [[Bill Melton]] and [[Chuck Tanner]]. He left to succeed [[Jack Brickhouse]] as the voice of the Cubs in 1981, where he became a national icon.

The White Sox shifted through several announcers in the 1980s, before hiring [[John Rooney (sportscaster)|John Rooney]] as play-by-play announcer in 1989. In 1992, he was paired with color announcer [[Ed Farmer]]. In 14 seasons together, the duo became a highly celebrated announcing team, even being ranked by ''[[USA Today]]'' as the top broadcasting team in the American League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Steve|title=Rooney, Farmer give White Sox AL's top radio team|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-07-26-announcers-al_x.htm|date=July 26, 2005|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with Rooney and Farmer's fifth season together, Sox games returned to the 1000 AM frequency for the first time in 30 years (now the [[ESPN Radio|ESPN owned and operated]] station [[WMVP (AM)|WMVP]]). The last game on WMVP was game 4 of the 2005 World Series, with the White Sox clinching their first World Series title in 88 years. That also was Rooney's last game with the Sox, as he left to join the radio broadcast team of the St. Louis Cardinals.

In 2006, radio broadcasts returned to 670 AM, this time on the [[sports radio]] station [[WSCR]] owned by [[CBS Radio]] (WSCR took over the 670 frequency in August 2000 as part of a number of shifts among CBS Radio properties to meet market ownership caps). Ed Farmer became the play-by-play man after Rooney left, joined in the booth by [[Chris Singleton (baseball)|Chris Singleton]] from 2006 to 2007 and then [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] in 2008. In 2009, [[Darrin Jackson]] became the color announcer for White Sox radio, where he remains today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasters|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/team/broadcasters.jsp?c_id=cws|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer and Jackson were joined by pregame/postgame host Chris Rogney.

The [[Chicago White Sox Radio Network]] currently has 18 affiliates in three states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Affiliates|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/schedule/radio_affiliates.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of recently, White Sox games are also broadcast in Spanish with play-by-play announcer [[Hector Molina]] joined in the booth by Billy Russo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Sox Announce new Spanish radio broadcasters|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/27702400/white-sox-announce-new-spanish-radio-broadcasters|date=March 28, 2012|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly broadcasting on [[ESPN Deportes Radio]] via [[WEBG|WNUA]], games are now broadcast in Spanish on [[WRTO (AM)|WRTO]] (1200).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2015 Broadcast Schedule|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/schedule/broadcast/index.jsp?c_id=cws|website=Official Site of the Chicago White Sox|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.southsidesox.com/2014/5/17/5725462/white-sox-radio-history|title=Right on Q: A brief history of the White Sox on the radio|last=Hart|first=Rob|date=17 May 2014|work=South Side Sox|publisher=[[SBNation]]|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 season, the play-by-play rights shifted to [[Cumulus Media]]'s [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] (890) under a five-year deal, when WSCR acquired the rights to Cubs games after a one-year period on WBBM. However, by all counts, the deal was a disaster for the White Sox, as WLS's declining [[conservative talk]] format, associated ratings, and management/personnel issues (including said hosts barely promoting the team and its games), and a signal that is weak in the northern suburbs and into [[Wisconsin]], was not a good fit for the team. Cumulus also had voluminous financial issues, and by the start of 2018, looked to both file [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and get out of the play-by-play business entirely, both with local teams and nationally through their [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|Westwood One/NFL]] deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-spt-white-sox-bulls-radio-contracts-20180119-story.html|title=WLS-AM parent company asks court to end 'unprofitable' White Sox, Bulls deals|last=Rosenthal|first=Phil|date=18 January 2018|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbmradio&quot; /&gt;

The White Sox and [[Tribune Broadcasting]] then announced a three-year deal for [[WGN (AM)|WGN Radio]] to become the White Sox flagship as of February 14, 2018, just in time for [[spring training]]. Ed Farmer and Darrin Jackson will continue to be on play-by-play, with Andy Masur taking over pregame/postgame duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2018/02/14/play-ball-wgn-radio-picks-white-sox/|title=Play ball!

===Television===
White Sox games appeared sporadically on television throughout the first half of the 20th century, most commonly announced by Jack Brickhouse on [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9). Starting in 1968, [[Jack Drees]] took play-by-play duties as the Sox were broadcast on [[WFLD]] (channel 32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Broadcasters- Television|url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/broadcasters.jsp|website=WhiteSox.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1972, Harry Caray (joined by Jimmy Piersall in 1977) began double duty as a TV and radio announcer for the Sox, as broadcasts were moved to channel 44, [[WSNS-TV]], from 1972 to 1980, followed by one year on WGN-TV.

[[Don Drysdale]] became the play-by-play announcer in 1982, as the White Sox began splitting their broadcasts between WFLD and the new regional [[cable television]] network, [[FSN Chicago|Sportsvision]]. Ahead of its time, Sportsvision had a chance to gain huge profits for the Sox. However, few people would subscribe to the channel after being used to free-to-air broadcasts for many years, along with Sportsvision being stunted by the city of Chicago's wiring for [[cable television]] taking much longer than many markets because of it being an area where over-the-air subscription services were still more popular, resulting in the franchise losing around $300,000 a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Sox History: The story of SportsVision|url=http://www.southsidesox.com/2012/11/30/3707810/white-sox-history-the-story-of-sportsvision|date=November 30, 2012|website=South Side Sox|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was going on, every Cubs game was on WGN, with Harry Caray becoming the national icon he never was with the White Sox. The relatively easy near-national access to Cubs games versus Sox games in this era, combined with the popularity of Caray and the Cubs being owned by the [[Tribune Company]], is said by some to be the main cause of the Cubs' advantage in popularity over the Sox.

[[File:Hawk Harrelson 2007 CROP.jpg|thumb|235px|Harrelson in the broadcast booth in 2007]]
Three major changes to White Sox broadcasting happened each year from 1989 to 1991: in 1989 with the city finally fully wired for cable service, Sportsvision was replaced by SportsChannel Chicago (itself eventually turning into [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] Chicago), which varied over its early years as a premium sports service and basic cable channel. In 1990, over-the-air broadcasts shifted back to WGN. And in 1991, [[Ken Harrelson]] became the play-by-play announcer of the White Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edelman|first=Alexander|title=Ken Harrelson|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/442dbc70|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most polarizing figures in baseball, &quot;Hawk&quot; has been both adored and scorned for his emotive announcing style. His history of calling out umpires has earned him reprimands from the MLB commissioner's office, and he has been said to be the most biased announcer in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selig reprimands Harrelson for rant against umpire|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-06-01/sports/chi-selig-reprimands-harrelson-for-rant-against-umpire-20120601_1_umpire-friday-s-white-sox-selig|date=June 1, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harrelson has said that he is proud of being &quot;the biggest homer in baseball&quot;, saying that he is a White Sox fan like his viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diamond|first=Jared|title=How Biased Is Your Announcer?|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444180004578016652376246198|date=September 26, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team moved from FSN Chicago to the newly launched [[NBC Sports Chicago]] in March 2005, as Jerry Reinsdorf looked to control the rights for his team rather than sell rights to another party; Reinsdorf holds a 40% interest in the network, with 20% of that interest directly owned by the White Sox corporation.

Previously, White Sox local television broadcasts were split between two channels: the majority of games were broadcast on cable by NBC Sports Chicago, and remaining games were produced by [[WGN Sports]] and were broadcast locally on [[WGN-TV]]. WGN games were also occasionally picked up by local stations in Illinois, Iowa, and Indiana. In the past, WGN games were broadcast nationally on the [[WGN America]] superstation, but those broadcasts ended after the 2014 season as WGN America began its transition to a standard cable network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feder|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Feder|title=WGN America comes home to Chicago|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/12/15/wgn-america-comes-home-to-chicago/|date=December 15, 2014|website=Robert Feder|url-access=subscription |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WGN Sports-produced White Sox games not carried by WGN-TV were carried by [[WCIU-TV]] (channel 26) until the 2015 season, when they moved to [[MyNetworkTV]] station [[WPWR]] (channel 50).&lt;ref name=trib-whitesoxwpwr&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Ed|title=White Sox add WPWR-Ch. 50 to station rotation|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/chi-white-sox-channel-50-20150219-story.html|date=February 19, 2015|accessdate=May 25, 2015|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; That arrangement ended on September 1, 2016 when WGN became an independent station.

Prior to 2016, the announcers were the same no matter where the games were broadcast: Harrelson provided play-by-play, and [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] provided color analysis since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Ralph|title=Steve Stone|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/a906928e|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=October 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games that are broadcast on NBC Sports Chicago feature pregame and postgame shows, hosted by Chuck Garfein with analysis from Bill Melton and occasionally Frank Thomas.

He will call 20 games over the course of the season, after which Benetti will take over full-time play-by-play duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Colleen|title=Ken 'Hawk' Harrelson to retire in 2018 after 'greatest ride of my life'|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/ct-hawk-harrelson-final-year-20170531-story.html|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=June 17, 2017|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;
