'''Corundum''' is a [[crystal]]line form of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}) typically containing traces of [[iron]], [[titanium]], [[vanadium]] and [[chromium]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; It is a [[rock (geology)|rock]]-forming [[mineral]]. It is also a naturally [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] material, but can have different colors depending on the presence of [[transition metal]] impurities in its crystalline structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gem Corundum|last=Giuliani|first=Gaston|last2=Ohnenstetter|first2=Daniel|last3=Fallick|first3=Anthony E.|last4=Groat|first4=Lee|last5=Fagan|last6=Andrew J|publisher=Mineralogical Association of Canada|year=2014|isbn=978-0-921294-54-2|location=Research Gate|pages=37-38|chapter=The Geology and Genesis of Gem Corundum Deposits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corundum has two primary gem varieties: [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]]. Rubies are red due to the presence of [[chromium]], and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt; A rare type of sapphire, [[Sapphire#Padparadscha|padparadscha]] sapphire, is pink-orange.

The name &quot;corundum&quot; is derived from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] word ''kurundam'' (ruby-sapphire) (appearing in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] as ''kuruvinda'').&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|corundum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of corundum's hardness (pure corundum is defined to have 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]] scale), it can scratch almost every other mineral. It is commonly used as an [[abrasive]] on everything from [[sandpaper]] to large tools used in machining metals, plastics, and wood. Some [[emery (mineral)|emery]] is a mix of corundum and other substances, and the mix is less abrasive, with an average Mohs hardness of 8.0.

In addition to its hardness, corundum has a density of {{cvt|4.02|g/cm3|lb/cuft}}, which is unusually high for a transparent mineral composed of the low-[[atomic mass]] elements [[aluminium]] and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.com/Corundum The Mineral Corundum]. galleries.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and occurrence==
[[File:Corindon azulEZ.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Corundum from [[Brazil]], size about {{convert|2|×|3|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.]]
Corundum occurs as a mineral in mica [[schist]], [[gneiss]], and some [[marble]]s in [[metamorphic]] [[terrane]]s. It also occurs in low-silica [[igneous]] [[syenite]] and [[nepheline syenite]] [[intrusive rock|intrusive]]s. Other occurrences are as masses adjacent to [[ultramafic]] intrusives, associated with [[lamprophyre]] [[dike (geology)|dikes]] and as large crystals in [[pegmatite]]s.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; It commonly occurs as a [[detrital]] mineral in stream and beach sands because of its hardness and resistance to weathering.&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; The largest documented single crystal of corundum measured about {{convert|65|x|40|x|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and weighed {{convert|152|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf |journal= American Mineralogist |volume= 66 |pages= 885–907 |year= 1981 |title= The largest crystals |author= Rickwood, P. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record has since been surpassed by certain synthetic [[boule (crystal)|boules]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledinside.com/news/2009/4/Rubicon_Technology_Grows_Super_boule_of_200kg_Weight_20090421 Rubicon Technology Grows 200kg &quot;Super Boule&quot;], ''LED Inside'', April 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Corundum for abrasives is mined in Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia, Sri Lanka, and India. Historically it was mined from deposits associated with [[dunite]]s in [[North Carolina]], US and from a [[nepheline syenite]] in [[Craigmont, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]]-grade corundum is found on the [[list of islands of Greece|Greek island]] of [[Naxos]] and near [[Peekskill, New York]], US. Abrasive corundum is synthetically manufactured from [[bauxite]].&lt;ref name=Hurlbut/&gt; Four corundum axes dating back to 2500&amp;nbsp;BCE from the Liangzhou culture have been discovered in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4555235.stm|title=Chinese made first use of diamond|publisher=BBC|date=May 2005|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthetic corundum==
In 1837, [[Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin|Marc Antoine Gaudin]] made the first synthetic rubies by reacting [[alumina]] at a high temperature with a small amount of [[chromium]] as a pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.gem-a.com/media/94808/duroc%20danner%20website.pdf |journal= Journal of Gemmology |volume= 32 |pages= 175–178 |year= 2011 |title= Untreated yellowish orange sapphire exhibiting its natural colour |author= Duroc-Danner, J. M. |doi= 10.15506/jog.2011.32.5.174 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130516231326/http://www.gem-a.com/media/94808/duroc%20danner%20website.pdf |archive-date= 2013-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white [[sapphire#Synthetic sapphire|synthetic sapphires]] by reacting [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] in [[boric acid]]. In 1877 Frenic and Freil made crystal corundum from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing [[barium fluoride|{{chem|BaF|2}}]] and [[aluminium oxide|{{chem|Al|2|O|3}}]] with a little chromium at temperatures above {{convert|2000|C|abbr=on}}. In 1903, Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://farlang.com/books/bahadur-a-handbook-of-precious-stones|title= Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year= 1943|access-date= 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Verneuil process]] allows the production of flawless single-crystal [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] gems of much larger size than normally found in nature. It is also possible to grow gem-quality synthetic corundum by flux-growth and [[hydrothermal synthesis]]. Because of the simplicity of the methods involved in corundum synthesis, large quantities of these crystals have become available on the market causing a significant reduction of price in recent years. Apart from ornamental uses, synthetic corundum is also used to produce mechanical parts (tubes, rods, bearings, and other machined parts), scratch-resistant optics, scratch-resistant [[watch#Overview|watch]] crystals, instrument windows for satellites and spacecraft (because of its transparency in the ultraviolet to infrared range), and [[laser]] components. For example, the [[KAGRA]] gravitational wave detector's main mirrors are {{cvt|50|lb|adj=on|order=flip}} sapphires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Structure and physical properties==
[[File:Corundum.png|thumb|250 px|left|Crystal structure of corundum]]
[[File:Corundum-pV.svg|thumb|250 px|right|Molar volume vs. pressure at room temperature.]]
Corundum crystallizes with trigonal symmetry in the space group [[hexagonal crystal family#Crystal classes|''R''{{overline|3}}''c'']] and has the lattice parameters ''a''= 4.75&amp;nbsp;Å and ''c''= 12.982&amp;nbsp;Å at standard conditions. The unit cell contains six formula units.

The toughness of corundum is sensitive to surface roughness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00638054?no-access=true|title=Effect of machining on fracture toughness of corundum|first1=Farrokh|last1=Farzin-Nia|first2=Terry|last2=Sterrett|first3=Ron|last3=Sirney|publisher=|journal=Journal of Materials Science|volume=25|issue=5|pages=2527–2531|doi=10.1007/bf00638054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1976.tb09390.x |volume=59 |title=Fracture-Strength Anisotropy of Sapphire |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crystallographic orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fracture of Sapphire&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1969.tb09199.x |volume=52 |title=Fracture of Sapphire |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |pages=485–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be 6–7&amp;nbsp;MPa·m&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt; for synthetic crystals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fracture of Sapphire&quot;/&gt; and around 4&amp;nbsp;MPa·m&lt;sup&gt;{{1/2}}&lt;/sup&gt; for natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet_print.aspx?matguid=c8c56ad547ae4cfabad15977bfb537f1|title=Corundum, Aluminum Oxide, Alumina, 99.9%, Al 2 O 3|website=www.matweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lattice of corundum, the oxygen atoms form a slightly distorted [[hexagonal close packing]], in which two-thirds of the gaps between the octahedra are occupied by aluminium ions.
