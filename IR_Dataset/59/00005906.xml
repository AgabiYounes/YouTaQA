'''Carbon dioxide''' ([[chemical formula]] '''{{CO2}}''') is a colorless [[gas]] with a density about 60% higher than that of dry air.  Carbon dioxide consists of a [[carbon]] [[atom]] [[covalent bond|covalently]] [[double bond]]ed to two [[oxygen]] atoms. It occurs naturally in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] as a [[trace gas]]. The current concentration is about 0.04% (410&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]]) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eggleton|first1=Tony|title=A Short Introduction to Climate Change|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeSwRly2M_cC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=280|isbn=9781107618763}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural sources include [[volcano]]es, [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s, and it is freed from [[carbonate rock]]s by [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in [[groundwater]], [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[glacier]]s and [[seawater]]. It is present in deposits of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. Carbon dioxide is odorless at normally encountered concentrations, but at high concentrations, it has a sharp and acidic odor.&lt;ref name=AirProductsMSDS/&gt; At such concentrations it generates the taste of [[Carbonated water|soda water]] in the mouth.

As the source of available carbon in the [[carbon cycle]], [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] is the primary carbon source for [[life|life on Earth]] and its concentration in Earth's pre-industrial atmosphere since late in the [[Precambrian]] has been regulated by [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms and geological phenomena. [[Plant]]s, [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] use [[light]] [[energy]] to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] [[carbohydrate]] from carbon dioxide and water, with oxygen produced as a waste product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald G. |last1=Kaufman |first2=Cecilia M. |last2=Franz |title=Biosphere 2000: protecting our global environment |year=1996 |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Pub.

{{CO2}} is produced by all [[aerobic organisms]] when they metabolize carbohydrates and lipids to produce energy by [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyproject.org/activities/foodfactories.html |title=Food Factories |website=www.legacyproject.org |access-date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is returned to water via the [[Fish gill|gills of fish]] and to the air via the lungs of air-breathing land animals, including humans. Carbon dioxide is produced during the processes of [[decomposition|decay]] of organic materials and the [[fermentation]] of sugars in [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]] making. It is produced by combustion of [[wood]] and other organic materials and [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[peat]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. It is an unwanted byproduct in many large scale [[oxidation]] processes, for example, in the production of [[acrylic acid]] (over 5 million tons/year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Lénárd-István Csepei |title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts |date=2011 |publisher=Technical University of Berlin |url=https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/3269/1/Dokument_8.pdf |degree=PHD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid |journal=Journal of Catalysis |date=2012 |volume=285 |pages=48–60 |first1=M. |last1=Hävecker |first2=S. |last2=Wrabetz |first3=J. |last3=Kröhnert |first4=L.-I. |last4=Csepei |first5=R. |last5=Naumann d’Alnoncourt |first6=Y.V. |last6=Kolen’ko |first7=F. |last7=Girgsdies |first8=R. |last8=Schlögl |first9=A. |last9=Trunschke |url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012 |hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F |access-date=9 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf |archive-date=30 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol |journal=ACS Catalysis |date=2013 |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=1103–1113 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177 |last1=Amakawa |first1=Kazuhiko |last2=Kolen'ko |first2=Yury V. |last3=Villa |first3=Alberto |last4=Schuster |first4=Manfred Erwin |last5=Csepei |first5=Lenard-Istvan |last6=Weinberg |first6=Gisela |last7=Wrabetz |first7=Sabine |last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt |first8=Raoul |last9=Girgsdies |first9=Frank |last10=Prati |first10=Laura |last11=Schloegl |first11=Robert |last12=Trunschke |first12=Annette |doi=10.1021/cs400010q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts |journal=Journal of Catalysis |volume=311 |pages=369–385 |url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf |first1=Raoul |last1=Naumann d’Alnoncourt |first2=Lénárd-István |last2=Csepei |first3=Michael |last3=Hävecker |first4=Frank |last4=Girgsdies |first5=Manfred E. |last5=Schuster |first6=Robert |last6=Schlögl |first7=Annette |last7=Trunschke |doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008 |year=2014 |hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5 |access-date=9 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf |archive-date=15 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived [[greenhouse gas]] in [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|Earth's atmosphere]]. Since the [[Industrial Revolution]] anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and [[deforestation]] – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to [[global warming]].  Carbon dioxide also causes [[ocean acidification]] because it dissolves in water to form [[carbonic acid]].&lt;ref name=NRC2010&gt;{{cite book|title=Ocean Acidification: A National Strategy to Meet the Challenges of a Changing Ocean |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12904/ocean-acidification-a-national-strategy-to-meet-the-challenges-of |isbn=978-0-309-15359-1 |doi=10.17226/12904 |publisher=National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC|date=2010-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Carbon-dioxide-crystal-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|upright|Crystal structure of [[dry ice]]]]
Carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance. In about 1640,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Pioneer in the Hygiene of Ventilation | author=DavidFraser Harris | journal=The Lancet |date=September 1910  | volume=176 | issue=4542 | pages=906–908 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)52420-9| url=https://zenodo.org/record/2088803 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] observed that when he burned [[charcoal]] in a closed vessel, the mass of the resulting [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] was much less than that of the original charcoal. His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a &quot;gas&quot; or &quot;wild spirit&quot; (''spiritus sylvestris'').&lt;ref&gt;Almqvist, Ebbe  (2003). ''History of [[industrial gas]]es''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-47277-0}}. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of carbon dioxide were further studied in the 1750s by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] physician [[Joseph Black]]. He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with [[acid]]s to yield a gas he called &quot;fixed air.&quot; He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through [[limewater]] (a saturated aqueous solution of [[calcium hydroxide]]), it would [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] published a paper entitled ''Impregnating Water with Fixed Air'' in which he described a process of dripping [[sulfuric acid]] (or ''oil of vitriol'' as Priestley knew it) on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide, and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Priestley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first = Joseph|last = Priestley|authorlink = Joseph Priestley|title = Observations on Different Kinds of Air|journal = Philosophical Transactions|volume = 62|year = 1772|pages = 147–264|url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/priestley.html|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1772.0021|last2 =Hey|first2 = Wm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by [[Humphry Davy]] and [[Michael Faraday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first = Humphry|last = Davy|authorlink = Humphry Davy|title = On the Application of Liquids Formed by the Condensation of Gases as Mechanical Agents|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-107649|jstor=107649|journal = Philosophical Transactions|volume = 113|year = 1823|pages = 199–205|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1823.0020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide ([[dry ice]]) was given by the French inventor [[Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier]], who in 1835 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a &quot;snow&quot; of solid {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thilorier | first1 = Adrien-Jean-Pierre | year = 1835 | title = Solidification de l'Acide carbonique | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29606/f194.item | journal = Comptes Rendus | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 194–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 1836 | title = Solidification of carbonic acid | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4GwqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA446 | journal = The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine | volume = 8 | issue = 48| pages = 446–447 | doi=10.1080/14786443608648911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structure and bonding ===
{{See also|Molecular orbital diagram#Carbon dioxide}}
The carbon dioxide molecule is linear and [[centrosymmetric]]. The [[carbon–oxygen bond]] length is 116.3&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]], noticeably shorter than the [[bond length]] of a C–O single bond and even shorter than most other C–O multiply-bonded functional groups.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; Since it is centrosymmetric, the molecule has no electrical [[dipole]]. Consequently, only two vibrational bands are observed in the [[IR spectrum]] – an antisymmetric stretching mode at [[wavenumber]] 2349&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[Degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] pair of bending modes at 667&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (wavelength 15 μm). There is also a symmetric stretching mode at 1388&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; which is only observed in the [[Raman spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Atkins P. and de Paula J.

The [[Henry's law|hydration equilibrium constant]] of carbonic acid is &lt;math&gt;K_{\mathrm h}=\frac{\rm{[H_2CO_3]}}{\rm{[CO_2(aq)]}}=1.70\times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; (at 25&amp;nbsp;°C). Hence, the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid, but remains as {{CO2}} molecules, not affecting the pH.

The relative concentrations of {{chem|CO|2|, H|2|CO|3}}, and the [[deprotonation|deprotonated]] forms {{chem|HCO|3|−}} ([[bicarbonate]]) and {{chem|CO|3|2−}}([[carbonate]]) depend on the [[pH]]. As shown in a [[Bjerrum plot]], in neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH &gt; 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (&gt;50%) becoming the most prevalent (&gt;95%) at the pH of seawater. In very alkaline water (pH &gt; 10.4), the predominant (&gt;50%) form is carbonate. The oceans, being mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2–8.5, contain about 120&amp;nbsp;mg of bicarbonate per liter.

Being [[diprotic acid|diprotic]], carbonic acid has two [[acid dissociation constant]]s, the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate (also called hydrogen carbonate) ion (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;):

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|2.5|e=-4|u=mol/litre}}; p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.6 at 25 °C.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the ''true'' first acid dissociation constant, defined as &lt;math&gt;K_{a1}=\frac{\rm{[HCO_3^-] [H^+]}}{\rm{[H_2CO_3]}}&lt;/math&gt;, where the denominator includes only covalently bound H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and does not include hydrated {{CO2}}(aq). The much smaller and often-quoted value near {{val|4.16|e=-7}} is an ''apparent'' value calculated on the (incorrect) assumption that all dissolved {{CO2}} is present as carbonic acid, so that &lt;math&gt;K_{\mathrm{a1}}{\rm{(apparent)}}=\frac{\rm{[HCO_3^-] [H^+]}}{\rm{[H_2CO_3] + [CO_2(aq)]}}&lt;/math&gt;. Since most of the dissolved {{CO2}} remains as {{CO2}} molecules, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;(apparent) has a much larger denominator and a much smaller value than the true ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Jolly, William L., ''Modern Inorganic Chemistry'' (McGraw-Hill 1984), p. 196 {{ISBN|0-07-032760-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bicarbonate]] ion is an [[amphoteric]] species that can act as an acid or as a base, depending on pH of the solution. At high [[pH]], it dissociates significantly into the [[carbonate]] ion (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;):
:HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
:''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|4.69|e=-11|u=mol/litre}}; p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.329

In organisms carbonic acid production is catalysed by the [[enzyme]], [[carbonic anhydrase]].

=== Chemical reactions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ===
{{CO2}} is a weak [[electrophile]]. Its reaction with basic water illustrates this property, in which case [[hydroxide]] is the [[nucleophile]]. Other nucleophiles react as well. For example, [[carbanion]]s as provided by  [[Grignard reagent]]s and [[organolithium compound]]s react with {{CO2}} to give [[carboxylate]]s:
:MR  +  {{CO2}}   →   R{{CO2}}M
:where M = [[Lithium|Li]] or [[Magnesium|Mg]] [[Bromine|Br]] and R = [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]].

In [[metal carbon dioxide complex]]es, {{CO2}} serves as a [[ligand]], which can facilitate the conversion of {{CO2}} to other chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;M. Aresta (Ed.) &quot;Carbon Dioxide as a Chemical Feedstock&quot; 2010, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{ISBN|978-3-527-32475-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction of {{CO2}} to [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] is ordinarily a difficult and slow reaction:
:{{CO2}} +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;   →   CO  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

[[Photoautotrophs]] (i.e. plants and [[cyanobacteria]]) use the energy contained in sunlight to [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] simple sugars from {{CO2}} absorbed from the air and water:
: ''n'' {{CO2}} + ''n'' {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|(CH|2|O)|''n''}} + ''n'' {{chem|O|2}}

The [[redox potential]] for this reaction near pH 7 is about −0.53 V ''versus'' the [[standard hydrogen electrode]]. The nickel-containing enzyme [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]] catalyses this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Finn | first1 = Colin | last2 = Schnittger | first2 = Sorcha | last3 = Yellowlees | first3 = Lesley J. | last4 = Love | first4 = Jason B. | title = Molecular approaches to the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide | journal = Chemical Communications | volume =  48| issue = 10| pages = 1392–1399 | doi = 10.1039/c1cc15393e | year = 2012 | pmid=22116300| url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/10852481/Molecular_approaches_to_the_electrochemical_reduction_of_carbon_dioxide.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical properties ===
{{details|Carbon dioxide data}}
[[File:Dry Ice Pellets Subliming.jpg|right|thumb|Pellets of &quot;dry ice&quot;, a common form of solid carbon dioxide]]
Carbon dioxide is colorless. At low concentrations the gas is odorless; however, at sufficiently-high concentrations, it has a sharp, acidic odor.&lt;ref name=AirProductsMSDS&gt;{{cite web |title=Carbon Dioxide |website=Air Products |url=http://www.airproducts.com/~/media/Files/PDF/company/product-summary-carbon-dioxide.pdf?la=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], the density of carbon dioxide is around 1.98&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 1.67 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]].

Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below {{convert|5.1|atm|lk=in}}. At 1 atmosphere (near mean sea level pressure), the gas [[deposition (physics)|deposits]] directly to a solid at temperatures below {{convert|-78.5|C|F K}} and the solid [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimes]] directly to a gas above −78.5&amp;nbsp;°C. In its solid state, carbon dioxide is commonly called [[dry ice]].

[[File:Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram.svg|right|thumb|Pressure–temperature [[phase diagram]] of carbon dioxide]]

Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at [[pressure]]s above 5.1 atm; the [[triple point]] of carbon dioxide is about 5.1 [[bar (unit)|bar]] (517 [[kPa]]) at 217&amp;nbsp;K (see phase diagram). The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is 7.38 MPa at 31.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C124389&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=4#Thermo-Phase|title=Phase change data for Carbon dioxide|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kudryavtseva I.V., Kamotskii V.I., Rykov S.V., Rykov V.A., [http://processes.ihbt.ifmo.ru/en/article/10734/Calculation_carbon_dioxide_line_of_phase_equilibrium.htm &quot;Calculation Carbon Dioxide Line of Phase Equilibrium&quot;], Processes and equipment for food production, Number 4(18), 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an [[amorphous]] glass-like solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santoro|first=M.|year=2006|title=Amorphous silica-like carbon dioxide|journal=Nature|volume=441|pages=857–860|doi=10.1038/nature04879|pmid=16778885| last2=Gorelli|first2=FA|last3=Bini|first3=R|last4= Ruocco|first4=G|last5=Scandolo|first5=S|last6=Crichton|first6=WA|issue=7095|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..857S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of glass, called ''[[amorphous carbonia|carbonia]]'', is produced by [[supercooling]] heated {{CO2}} at extreme pressure (40–48 [[GPa]] or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a [[diamond anvil]]. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like [[silicon]] ([[silica|silica glass]]) and [[germanium dioxide]]. Unlike silica and germania glasses, however, carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts to gas when pressure is released.

At temperatures and pressures above the critical point, carbon dioxide behaves as a [[supercritical fluid]] known as [[supercritical carbon dioxide]].  In this state it is starting (as of 2018) to be used for [[Supercritical carbon dioxide#Power generation|power generation]] {{citation needed|date=September 2019}}.

== Isolation and production ==

Carbon dioxide can be obtained by [[distillation]] from air, but the method is inefficient. Industrially, carbon dioxide is predominantly an unrecovered waste product, produced by several methods which may be practiced at various scales.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirk&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|first = Ronald|last = Pierantozzi|encyclopedia = Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher = Wiley|year = 2001|doi = 10.1002/0471238961.0301180216090518.a01.pub2|chapter = Carbon Dioxide|isbn =978-0-471-23896-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[combustion]] of all [[carbon-based fuel]]s, such as [[methane]] ([[natural gas]]), petroleum distillates ([[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[kerosene]], [[propane]]), coal, wood and generic organic matter produces carbon dioxide and, except in the case of pure carbon, water. As an example, the chemical reaction between methane and oxygen:
: {{chem|C|H|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}} → {{chem|CO|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}

It is produced by thermal decomposition of limestone, {{chem|CaCO|3}} by heating ([[calcining]]) at about {{convert|850|C}}, in the manufacture of [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] ([[calcium oxide]], {{chem|CaO}}), a compound that has many industrial uses:

Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the industrial production of hydrogen by [[steam reforming]] and the [[water gas shift reaction]] in [[ammonia production]]. These processes begin with the reaction of water and natural gas (mainly methane).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Topham  &quot;Carbon Dioxide&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major source of food-grade carbon dioxide for use in carbonation of [[beer]] and [[soft drink]]s, and is also used for stunning animals such as [[poultry]]. In the summer of 2018 a shortage of carbon dioxide for these purposes arose in Europe due to the temporary shut-down of several ammonia plants for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CO2 shortage: Food industry calls for government action |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44559669 |agency=BBC |date=Jun 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acids liberate {{CO2}} from most metal carbonates. Consequently, it may be obtained directly from natural carbon dioxide [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], where it is produced by the action of acidified water on [[limestone]] or [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]. The reaction between [[hydrochloric acid]] and calcium carbonate (limestone or chalk) is shown below:
:{{chem|Ca|C|O|3}} + 2 {{chem|H|Cl}} → {{chem|Ca|Cl|2}} + {{chem|H|2|C|O|3}}

The [[carbonic acid]] ({{chem|H|2|CO|3}}) then decomposes to water and {{CO2}}:
:{{chem|H|2|C|O|3}} → {{chem|C|O|2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}}

Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling, or both, as the gas is released. They have widespread uses in industry because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams.

Carbon dioxide is a by-product of the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] in the [[brewing]] of [[beer]], [[whisky]] and other [[alcoholic beverage]]s and in the production of [[bioethanol]]. [[Yeast]] metabolizes [[sugar]] to produce {{CO2}} and [[ethanol]], also known as alcohol, as follows:
: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} → 2 {{chem|C|O|2}} + 2 {{chem|C|2|H|5|O|H}}

All [[cellular respiration|aerobic]] organisms produce {{CO2}} when they oxidize [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and proteins. The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily. Refer to ([[cellular respiration]], [[anaerobic respiration]] and [[photosynthesis]]). The equation for the respiration of glucose and other [[monosaccharide]]s is:
: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} + 6 {{chem|O|2}} → 6 {{chem|CO|2}} + 6 {{chem|H|2|O}}

[[Anaerobic organisms]] decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Collecting and using biogas from landfills |publisher= U.S. Energy Information Administration |url= http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=biomass_biogas |date=January 11, 2017 |access-date= 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the type of organic material, the production of gases follows well defined [[chemical kinetics|kinetic pattern]]. Carbon dioxide comprises about 40–45% of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills (termed &quot;[[landfill gas]]&quot;). Most of the remaining 50–55% is methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About Landfill Gas |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/benviron/waste/central/lfgfact.pdf |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry, the oil industry, and the chemical industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;kirk&quot; /&gt;
The compound has varied commercial uses but one of its greatest uses as a chemical is in the production of carbonated beverages; it provides the sparkle in carbonated beverages such as soda water, beer and sparkling wine.

=== Precursor to chemicals ===
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
In the chemical industry, carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of [[urea]], with a smaller fraction being used to produce [[methanol]] and a range of other products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter7.pdf|title=IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage|publisher=|access-date=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115331/http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter7.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as metal [[carbonate]]s and [[bicarbonate]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Some carboxylic acid derivatives such as [[sodium salicylate]] are prepared using {{CO2}} by the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R.T.

In addition to conventional processes using {{CO2}} for chemical production, electrochemical methods are also being explored at a research level. In particular, the use of renewable energy for production of fuels from {{CO2}} (such as methanol) is attractive as this could result in fuels that could be easily transported and used within conventional combustion technologies but have no net {{CO2}} emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.

=== Foods ===
[[File:Soda bubbles macro.jpg|thumb|Carbon dioxide bubbles in a soft drink.]]
Carbon dioxide is a [[food additive]] used as a propellant and acidity regulator in the food industry. It is approved for usage in the EU&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed as [[E number]] E290), US&lt;ref&gt;US Food and Drug Administration: {{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm091048.htm |title=Food Additive Status List |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 – Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed by its [[INS number]] 290).

==== Beverages ====
Carbon dioxide is used to produce [[carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]]s and [[soda water]]. Traditionally, the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide. With the exception of British [[cask ale#Real ale|real ale]], draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide, sometimes mixed with nitrogen.

==== Winemaking ====
[[File:Dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest.jpg|thumb|Dry ice used to preserve grapes after harvest.]]
Carbon dioxide in the form of [[dry ice]] is often used during the [[cold soak]] phase in [[winemaking]] to cool clusters of [[grape]]s quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] by wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. The main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the [[sugar]] concentration in the [[grape must]], and thus the [[ethanol|alcohol]] concentration in the finished wine. Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for [[carbonic maceration]], the process used to produce [[Beaujolais]] wine.

Carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other [[storage (wine)|storage]] vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation, though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine, making a previously still wine slightly fizzy. For this reason, other gases such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] are preferred for this process by professional wine makers.

====Stunning animals====
Carbon dioxide is often used to &quot;stun&quot; animals before slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andy Coghlan |title=A more humane way of slaughtering chickens might get EU approval |journal=New Scientist |date=Feb 3, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2159895-a-more-humane-way-of-slaughtering-chickens-might-get-eu-approval}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Stunning&quot; may be a misnomer, as the animals are not knocked out immediately and may suffer distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-CO2-stunning_118.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409003755/http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-CO2-stunning_118.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-04-09|title=What is CO2 stunning?|publisher=RSPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archie Campbell |title=Humane execution and the fear of the tumbril |journal=New Scientist |date=Mar 10, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23731680-900-humane-execution-and-the-fear-of-the-tumbril-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inert gas ===
It is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for [[welding]], although in the welding arc, it reacts to [[oxidation|oxidize]] most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more [[brittle]] than those made in more inert atmospheres.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as [[argon]] or [[helium]].{{citation needed|reason=why not use nitrogen?|date=July 2015}}  When used for [[MIG welding]], {{CO2}} use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as {{CO2}} can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.

It is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in [[supercritical drying]] of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]&lt;ref name=Nordestgaard&gt;{{cite journal |first1=B.G. |last1=Nordestgaard |first2=J. |last2=Rostgaard |date=1985 |journal=Journal of Microscopy |title=Critical‐point drying versus freeze drying for scanning electron microscopy: a quantitative and qualitative study on isolated hepatocytes |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=189–207 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1985.tb02577.x |pmid=3989858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[decaffeination]] of [[coffee]] beans.

=== Fire extinguisher ===
[[File:US Army 53023 Fire Prevention Week.jpg|thumb|Use of a {{CO2}} fire extinguisher.]]
Carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.&lt;ref&gt;National Fire Protection Association Code 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as solvent ===
{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}

Liquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].&lt;ref name=Tsotsas/&gt; Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s. It is also used by some [[dry cleaning|dry cleaners]] for this reason (see [[green chemistry]]). It is used in the preparation of some [[Aerogel#Production|aerogels]] because of the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide.

=== Agricultural and biological applications ===
Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct [[photosynthesis]]. The atmospheres of greenhouses may (if of large size, must) be enriched with additional {{CO2}} to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/141.html |title=Plant Growth Factors: Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Transpiration |website=CMG GardenNotes |first1=David |last1=Whiting |first2=Michael |last2=Roll |first3=Larry |last3=Vickerman |publisher=Colorado Master Gardener Program |date=August 2010 |access-date=2011-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902192633/http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/141.html |archive-date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/nature/node21.html |chapter=Carbon dioxide |url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/nature/nature.html |title=How Much Land Can Ten Billion People Spare for Nature? |first=Paul E. |last=Waggoner |date=February 1994 |access-date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At very high concentrations (100 times atmospheric concentration, or greater), carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life, so raising the concentration to 10,000 ppm (1%) or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as [[whitefly|whiteflies]] and [[spider mite]]s in a greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stafford, Ned |title=Future crops: The other greenhouse effect |journal=Nature |volume=448 |date=7 February 2007 |doi=10.1038/448526a |pmid=17671477 |issue=7153 |bibcode = 2007Natur.448..526S |pages=526–528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that {{CO2}} from power generation be bubbled into ponds to stimulate growth of algae that could then be converted into [[biodiesel]] fuel.&lt;ref name=&quot;csmon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Clayton|title=Algae – like a breath mint for smokestacks|date=2006-01-11| url =http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0111/p01s03-sten.html|work =[[The Christian Science Monitor]]| accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical and pharmacological uses ===
In medicine, up to 5% carbon dioxide (130 times atmospheric concentration) is added to [[oxygen]] for stimulation of breathing after [[apnea]] and to stabilize the {{chem|O|2|/CO|2}} balance in blood.

Carbon dioxide can be mixed with up to 50% oxygen, forming an inhalable gas; this is known as [[Carbogen]] and has a variety of medical and research uses.

=== Oil recovery ===
Carbon dioxide is used in [[enhanced oil recovery]] where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells, usually under [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] conditions, when it becomes [[miscibility|miscible]] with the oil. This approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by between 7% to 23% additional to [[Extraction of petroleum#Primary recovery|primary extraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=20 Dec 2011 |url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide |chapter-url=http://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide/appendix-co2-use |title=Accelerating the uptake of CCS: industrial use of captured carbon dioxide |chapter=Appendix A: {{CO2}} for use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) |website=Global CCS Institute |access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It acts as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground [[crude oil]], significantly reduces its viscosity, and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austell |first=J Michael |year=2005 |title={{CO2}} for Enhanced Oil Recovery Needs – Enhanced Fiscal Incentives |journal=Exploration &amp; Production: The Oil &amp; Gas Review |url=http://www.touchoilandgas.com/enhanced-recovery-needs-enhanced-a423-1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207071349/http://www.touchoilandgas.com/enhanced-recovery-needs-enhanced-a423-1.html |archivedate=2012-02-07 |accessdate= 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mature oil fields, extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points.

=== Bio transformation into fuel ===
{{main|Carbon capture and utilization}}
A strain of the [[cyanobacterium]] ''[[Synechococcus|Synechococcus elongatus]]'' has been genetically engineered to produce the fuels [[isobutyraldehyde]] and [[isobutanol]] from {{CO2}} using photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=27|pages=1177–1180|date=November 2009|author1=Atsum, Shota |author2=Higashide, Wendy |author3=Liauo, James C.|doi=10.1038/nbt.1586|pmid=19915552|title=Direct photosynthetic recycling of carbon dioxide to isobutyraldehyde|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigerant ===
[[File:Comparison carbon dioxide water phase diagrams.svg|thumb|upright=2|Comparison of phase diagrams of carbon dioxide (red) and water (blue) as a log-lin chart with phase transitions points at 1 atmosphere]]
Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important [[refrigerant]]s, especially in the food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called &quot;dry ice&quot; and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below {{convert|-78.5|C|F}} at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.

{{anchor|R744}} Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that [[R134a]] contributes to [[climate change]] more than {{CO2}} does. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), {{CO2}} systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50°, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a. Its environmental advantages ([[Global warming potential|GWP]] of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, and heat pump water heaters, among others. [[Coca-Cola]] has fielded {{CO2}}-based beverage coolers and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is interested in {{CO2}} refrigeration and heating technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccref1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/cooling-equipment-pushing-forward-with-hfc-free |title=The Coca-Cola Company Announces Adoption of HFC-Free Insulation in Refrigeration Units to Combat Global Warming |accessdate=2007-10-11 |date=2006-06-05 |publisher=The Coca-Cola Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usforces&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Modine reinforces its {{CO2}} research efforts|url = http://www.r744.com/news/news_ida145.php|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080210194203/http://www.r744.com/news/news_ida145.php|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2008-02-10|date = 2007-06-28|publisher = R744.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global automobile industry is expected to decide on the next-generation refrigerant in car air conditioning. {{CO2}} is one discussed option.(see [[Sustainable automotive air conditioning]])

=== Coal bed methane recovery ===
In [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]], carbon dioxide would be pumped into the coal seam to displace methane, as opposed to current methods which primarily rely on the removal of water (to reduce pressure) to make the coal seam release its trapped methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03 |title=Enhanced coal bed methane recovery |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2006-08-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706232006/http://www.ipe.ethz.ch/laboratories/spl/research/adsorption/project03 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minor uses ===
[[File:Carbon Dioxide Laser At The Laser Effects Test Facility.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|A [[carbon dioxide laser]].]]
Carbon dioxide is the [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in a [[carbon dioxide laser]], which is one of the earliest type of lasers.

Carbon dioxide can be used as a means of controlling the [[pH]] of swimming pools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IWpWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%C2%A0%C2%A0Carbon+dioxide+can+be+used+as+a+means+of+controlling+the+pH+of+swimming+pool&amp;dq=%C2%A0%C2%A0Carbon+dioxide+can+be+used+as+a+means+of+controlling+the+pH+of+swimming+pool|title=TCE, the Chemical Engineer|date=1990|publisher=Institution of Chemical Engineers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by continuously adding gas to the water, thus keeping the pH from rising. Among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling (more hazardous) acids. Similarly, it is also used in the maintaining [[Reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], where it is commonly used in [[calcium reactor]]s to temporarily lower the pH of water being passed over [[calcium carbonate]] in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely where it is used by some [[coral]]s to build their skeleton.

Used as the primary coolant in the British [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] for nuclear power generation.

Carbon dioxide induction is commonly used for the euthanasia of laboratory research animals. Methods to administer {{CO2}} include placing animals directly into a closed, prefilled chamber containing {{CO2}}, or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of {{CO2}}. In 2013, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] issued new guidelines for carbon dioxide induction, stating that a displacement rate of 10% to 30% of the [[gas chamber]] volume per minute is optimal for the humane euthanization of small rodents.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/kb/policies/documents/euthanasia.pdf |title=2013 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is opposition to the practice of using carbon dioxide for this, on the grounds that it is cruel.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt;

Carbon dioxide is also used in several related [[carbon dioxide cleaning|cleaning and surface preparation]] techniques.

While transparent to [[visible light]], carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing and emitting infrared radiation at its two infrared-active vibrational frequencies (see the section &quot;Structure and bonding&quot; above).

Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric carbon dioxide traps energy near the surface, warming the surface and the lower atmosphere. Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucar_co2_absorb_IR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://scied.ucar.edu/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation | title=Carbon Dioxide Absorbs and Re-emits Infrared Radiation | publisher=UCAR Center for Science Education | date= 2012 | accessdate=2017-09-09| author=UCAR }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;know_co2_climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=35 | title=How do we know more CO2 is causing warming? | publisher=Skeptical Science | date=July 2015 | accessdate=2017-09-09 | author=dana1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in atmospheric concentrations of {{CO2}} and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.

Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean to form [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[bicarbonate]] (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[carbonate]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).

As the concentration of carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere, the increased uptake of carbon dioxide into the oceans is causing a measurable decrease in the pH of the oceans, which is referred to as [[ocean acidification]]. This reduction in pH affects biological systems in the oceans, primarily oceanic [[calcification|calcifying]] organisms. These effects span the [[food chain]] from [[autotroph]]s to [[heterotroph]]s and include organisms such as [[coccolithophore]]s, [[coral]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[echinoderm]]s, [[crustacea]]ns and [[mollusca|mollusks]]. Under normal conditions, calcium carbonate is stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at [[supersaturation|supersaturating]] concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, so does the concentration of this ion, and when carbonate becomes undersaturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Nienhuis |first1 = S. |last2 = Palmer |first2 = A. |last3 = Harley |first3 = C. |year = 2010 |title = Elevated {{CO2}} affects shell dissolution rate but not calcification rate in a marine snail |journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume = 277 |issue = 1693 |pages = 2553–2558 |pmc = 2894921 |doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0206 |pmid = 20392726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corals,&lt;ref name=gatt98&gt;

NOAA states in their May 2008 &quot;State of the science fact sheet for [[ocean acidification]]&quot; that:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The oceans have absorbed about 50% of the carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) released from the burning of fossil fuels, resulting in chemical reactions that lower ocean pH. This has caused an increase in hydrogen ion (acidity) of about 30% since the start of the industrial age through a process known as &quot;ocean acidification.&quot; A growing number of studies have demonstrated adverse impacts on marine organisms, including:
* The rate at which reef-building corals produce their skeletons decreases, while production of numerous varieties of jellyfish increases.
* The ability of marine algae and free-swimming zooplankton to maintain protective shells is reduced.
* The survival of larval marine species, including commercial fish and shellfish, is reduced.&quot;

Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) writes in their Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_ipcc_fourth_assessment_report_synthesis_report.htm Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report], IPCC&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic with an average decrease in pH of 0.1 units. Increasing atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations lead to further acidification&amp;nbsp;... While the effects of observed ocean acidification on the marine biosphere are as yet undocumented, the progressive acidification of oceans is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell-forming organisms (e.g. corals) and their dependent species.&quot;

Some marine calcifying organisms (including coral reefs) have been singled out by major research agencies, including NOAA, OSPAR commission, NANOOS and the IPCC, because their most current research shows that ocean acidification should be expected to impact them negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification |title=PMEL Ocean Acidification Home Page |publisher=Pmel.noaa.gov |accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological role ==
Carbon dioxide is an end product of [[cellular respiration]] in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars, fats and [[amino acid]]s with [[oxygen]] as part of their [[metabolism]]. This includes all plants, algae and animals and [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] fungi and bacteria. In [[vertebrate]]s, the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body's tissues to the skin (e.g., [[amphibian]]s) or the gills (e.g., [[fish]]), from where it dissolves in the water, or to the lungs from where it is exhaled. During active photosynthesis, [[compensation point|plants can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release]] in respiration.

=== Photosynthesis and carbon fixation ===
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.png|thumb|Overview of photosynthesis and respiration. Carbon dioxide (at right), together with water, form oxygen and organic compounds (at left) by [[photosynthesis|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/span&gt;]], which can be [[cellular respiration|&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;respired&lt;/span&gt;]] to water and ({{CO2}}).]]

[[File:Calvin-cycle4.svg|thumb|left|upright=1|Overview of the [[Calvin cycle]] and carbon fixation]]
[[Carbon fixation]] is a biochemical process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated by [[plant]]s, [[algae]] and ([[cyanobacteria]]) into [[fuel|energy-rich]] organic [[molecule]]s such as [[glucose]], thus creating their own food by [[photosynthesis]]. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and [[water]] to produce [[sugar]]s from which other [[organic compound]]s can be constructed, and [[oxygen]] is produced as a by-product.

[[RuBisCO|Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase]], commonly abbreviated to RuBisCO, is the [[enzyme]] involved in the first major step of carbon fixation, the production of two molecules of [[3-phosphoglycerate]] from {{CO2}} and [[ribulose bisphosphate]], as shown in the diagram at left.

RuBisCO is thought to be the single most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dhingra A, Portis AR, Daniell H | title = Enhanced translation of a chloroplast-expressed RbcS gene restores small subunit levels and photosynthesis in nuclear RbcS antisense plants | journal = Proc.

[[Phototroph]]s use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the [[biosynthesis]] of more complex organic molecules, such as [[polysaccharides]], [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s. These are used for their own growth, and also as the basis of the [[food chain]]s and webs that feed other organisms, including animals such as ourselves. Some important phototrophs, the [[coccolithophore]]s synthesise hard [[calcium carbonate]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution of primary producers in the sea|last=G.|first=Falkowski, Paul|last2=H.|first2=Knoll, Andrew|last3=(2006.01.)|first3=Symposium|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Elsevier, Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-370518-1|oclc=845654016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A globally significant species of coccolithophore is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'' whose [[calcite]] scales have formed the basis of many [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[limestone]], where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales.

Plants also emit {{CO2}} during respiration, and so the majority of plants and algae, which use [[C3 photosynthesis]], are only net absorbers during the day. Though a growing forest will absorb many tons of {{CO2}} each year, a mature forest will produce as much {{CO2}} from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens (e.g., fallen branches) as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/07/000094946_02081604154234/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603011630/http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/07/000094946_02081604154234/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-06-03 |title=Global Environment Division Greenhouse Gas Assessment Handbook – A Practical Guidance Document for the Assessment of Project-level Greenhouse Gas Emissions |accessdate=2007-11-10 |publisher=[[World Bank]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral, mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature07276 |title=Old-growth forests as global carbon sinks |year=2008 |last1=Luyssaert |first1=Sebastiaan |last2=Schulze |first2=E.-Detlef |last3=Börner |first3=Annett |last4=Knohl |first4=Alexander |last5=Hessenmöller |first5=Dominik |last6=Law |first6=Beverly E. |last7=Ciais |first7=Philippe |last8=Grace |first8=John |journal=Nature |volume=455 |pmid=18784722 |issue=7210 |bibcode= 2008Natur.455..213L |pages=213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remain valuable [[carbon sink]]s, helping to maintain the carbon balance of Earth's atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide content in fresh air (averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level, i.e., about {{cvt|30|km}} altitude) varies between 0.036% (360 ppm) and 0.041% (410 ppm), depending on the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/carbontracker/ |title=CarbonTracker CT2011_oi (Graphical map of {{CO2}}) |work=esrl.noaa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=what date/year are these figures for?|date=June 2014}}

{{CO2}} is an [[asphyxiant gas]] and not classified as toxic or harmful in accordance with [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals standards]] of [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] by using the [[OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals]]. In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy and give the lungs a stuffy feeling.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/fire/co2/co2report.html |title=Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002093443/http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/fire/co2/co2report.html |archivedate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological effects of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term [[hypercapnia]], a subset of [[Asphyxiant gas|asphyxiation]].

Because it is heavier than air, in locations where the gas seeps from the ground (due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity) in relatively high concentrations, without the dispersing effects of wind, it can collect in sheltered/pocketed locations below average ground level, causing animals located therein to be suffocated. Carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed. Children have been killed in the same way near the city of [[Goma]] by {{CO2}} emissions from the nearby volcano [[Mt. Nyiragongo]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3215_volcanoc.html Volcano Under the City]. PBS.org (1 November 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term for this phenomenon is '[[mazuku]]'.

[[File:Apollo13 apparatus.jpg|thumb|Rising levels of {{CO2}} threatened the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts who had to adapt cartridges from the command module to supply the [[carbon dioxide scrubber]] in the lunar module, which they used as a lifeboat.]]
Adaptation to increased concentrations of {{CO2}} occurs in humans, including [[Respiratory adaptation|modified breathing]] and kidney bicarbonate production, in order to balance the effects of blood acidification ([[acidosis]]). Several studies suggested that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces (e.g. a [[submarine]]) since the adaptation is physiological and reversible, as deterioration in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glatte Jr H.A., Motsay G.J., Welch B.E. 1967&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Studies |author1=Glatte Jr H.A. |author2=Motsay G.J. |author3=Welch B.E. |year=1967 |volume=SAM-TR-67-77 |journal=Brooks AFB, TX School of Aerospace Medicine Technical Report|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6045 |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Carbon Dioxide Tolerance and Toxicity |author=Lambertsen, C.J. |year=1971 |journal=Environmental Biomedical Stress Data Center, Institute for Environmental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center |volume=Report No. 2-71 |series=IFEM |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3861 |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other studies show a decrease in cognitive function even at much lower levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollutant2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scores2016&quot; /&gt; Also, with ongoing respiratory acidosis, adaptation or [[acidosis|compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse such condition]].

==== Below 1% ====
There are few studies of the health effects of long-term continuous {{CO2}} exposure on humans and animals at levels below 1%. Occupational {{CO2}} exposure limits have been set in the United States at 0.5% (5000 ppm) for an eight-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inspectapedia.com/hazmat/CO2_Exposure_Limits.htm |title=Exposure Limits for Carbon Dioxide Gas – {{CO2}} Limits |publisher=InspectAPedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this {{CO2}} concentration, [[International Space Station]] crew experienced headaches, lethargy, mental slowness, emotional irritation, and sleep disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In-Flight Carbon Dioxide Exposures and Related Symptoms: Associations, Susceptibility and Operational Implications |author1=Law J. |author2=Watkins S. |author3=Alexander, D. |year=2010 |volume=TP–2010–216126 |journal=NASA Technical Report |url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/trs/_techrep/TP-2010-216126.pdf |accessdate=2014-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627061502/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2010-216126.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in animals at 0.5% {{CO2}} have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effect of Prolonged Exposure to 0.5% {{CO2}} on Kidney Calcification and Ultrastructure of Lungs |author=Schaefer, K.E. |year=1979 |journal=Undersea Biomed Res | volume=S6 |pages=155–161 |pmid=505623 |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA075625 |accessdate=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant negative effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1% (1000{{nbsp}}ppm) {{CO2}} likely due to {{CO2}} induced increases in cerebral blood flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollutant2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is {{CO2}} an Indoor Pollutant?

==== Ventilation ====
[[File:CO2Mini monitor.jpg|thumb|{{CO2}} concentration meter using a [[nondispersive infrared sensor]]]]
Poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive {{CO2}} concentrations in closed spaces. Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions (when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that {{CO2}} concentration has stabilized) are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Higher {{CO2}} concentrations are associated with occupant health, comfort and performance degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen Joseph G.|last2=MacNaughton Piers|last3=Satish Usha|last4=Santanam Suresh|last5=Vallarino Jose|last6=Spengler John D.|date=2016-06-01|title=Associations of Cognitive Function Scores with Carbon Dioxide, Ventilation, and Volatile Organic Compound Exposures in Office Workers: A Controlled Exposure Study of Green and Conventional Office Environments|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=124|issue=6|pages=805–812|doi=10.1289/ehp.1510037|pmc=4892924|pmid=26502459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-elevated-co2-levels-directly-affect-human-cognition-new-harvard-study-shows-2748e7378941/|title=Exclusive: Elevated CO2 Levels Directly Affect Human Cognition, New Harvard Study Shows|last=Romm|first=Joe|date=2015-10-26|website=ThinkProgress|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.1–2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor concentrations up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions. Thus if the outdoor concentration is 400 ppm, indoor concentrations may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard. Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000).

Miners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as &quot;[[blackdamp]],&quot; &quot;choke damp&quot; or &quot;stythe.&quot; Before more effective technologies were developed, [[miners]] would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged [[Domestic Canary|canary]] with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.

In February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen CO2) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51680049&lt;/ref&gt;

The body produces approximately {{convert|2.3|lb|kg}} of carbon dioxide per day per person,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/emissions.html |title=How much carbon dioxide do humans contribute through breathing? |accessdate=2009-04-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202140715/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/fq/emissions.html |archivedate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing {{convert|0.63|lb|g}} of carbon. {{anchor|partial pressure}} In humans, this carbon dioxide is carried through the [[venous system]] and is breathed out through the lungs, resulting in lower concentrations in the [[arteries]]. The carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the [[partial pressure]], which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Henrickson |title=Chemistry |publisher=Cliffs Notes |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7645-7419-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/chemistry00henr }}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the blood carbon dioxide contents is shown in the adjacent table:

==== Transport in the blood ====
{{CO2}} is carried in blood in three different ways. (The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood).
* Most of it (about 70% to 80%) is converted to [[bicarbonate]] ions {{chem|HCO|3|−}} by the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]] in the red blood cells,&lt;ref name=&quot;solarnav&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/solar_cola/carbon_dioxide.htm |title=Carbon dioxide |accessdate=2007-10-12 |publisher=solarnavigator.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the reaction {{CO2}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|H|2|CO|3}} → {{chem|H|+}} + {{chem|HCO|3|−}}.
* 5–10% is dissolved in the [[Blood plasma|plasma]]&lt;ref name=&quot;solarnav&quot;/&gt;
* 5–10% is bound to [[hemoglobin]] as [[carbamino]] compounds&lt;ref name=&quot;solarnav&quot;/&gt;

[[Hemoglobin]], the main oxygen-carrying molecule in [[red blood cell]]s, carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].

==== Regulation of respiration ====
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}
Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.

Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].

Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;solarnav&quot;/&gt;

The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.
