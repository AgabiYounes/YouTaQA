In the 18th century, European traders flocked to the area, attracted by the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=6&amp;chapter=1 &quot;Chapter One: The Anglo-French Contest for the Ohio Country&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312110824/http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?chapter=1&amp;storyid=6 |date=March 12, 2016 }}, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.

The area was often caught between warring factions, including American Indian and European interests. In the 1740s, Pennsylvania traders overran the territory until the French forcibly evicted them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the early 1750s, the [[Ohio Company]] sent [[George Washington]] to the Ohio Country to survey. Fighting for control of the territory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754-1763) became part of the international [[Seven Years' War]] (1756-1763). During this period, the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres, and battles. The 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the Ohio Country to the [[British Empire]].

===Virginia Military District===
After the [[American Revolution]], the [[Virginia Military District]] became part of Ohio Country as a territory of Virginia. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]], which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young [[surveying|surveyor]] from [[Virginia]] named [[Lucas Sullivant]] had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River and Olentangy River. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his [[frontier]] village &quot;[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The location was desirable for its proximity to [[Navigability|navigable]] rivers—but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large [[flood]] wiped out the new settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He persevered, and the village was rebuilt.

After the Revolution land comprising parts of Franklin and adjacent counties was set aside by the [[United States Congress]] for settlement by [[Canadians]] and [[Nova Scotia]]ns who were sympathetic to the colonial cause and had their land and possessions seized by the British government.  The [[Refugee Tract]], consisting of over 103,000 acres, was 42 miles long and 3 to 4 1/2 miles wide, was claimed in part by 62 eligible men.  The Statehouse sits on land once contained in the Refugee Tract.

===19th century===
[[File:Columbus City Hall (16095449327).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old City Hall, completed in 1872, demolished in 1921]]
After Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. Desiring to settle on a location, the state legislature considered [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]], [[Worthington, Ohio|Worthington]], and [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]] before compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the &quot;High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[Columbus City Council|Burough of Columbus]]&quot; {{sic}} was officially established on February 10, 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Nine people were elected to fill the various positions of Mayor, Treasurer, and several others. In 1816-1817, [[Jarvis W. Pike]] would serve as the 1st Mayor. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and facilitated a population boom.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; A wave of European [[immigrants]] led to the creation of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the city's outskirts. A large [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as the ''[[German Village|Das Alte Südende]]'' (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]], and [[Capital University]].&lt;ref name = &quot;zuahxa&quot;&gt;Lentz, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

With a population of 3,500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. On that day the legislature carried out a [[Private bill|special act]], which granted legislative authority to the [[city council]] and judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosing one [[John Brooks (mayor)|John Brooks]] as the first mayor.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus annexed the then-separate city of [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] in 1837.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HQ-DgBzxfx4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=columbus+annexed+franklinton#v=onepage&amp;q=columbus%20annexed%20franklinton&amp;f=false |title=Columbus 1860-1910 |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2013|isbn=9780738539621 |last1=Barrett |first1=Richard E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, the [[Columbus and Xenia Railroad]] became the first railroad into the city, followed by the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] in 1851. The two railroads built a joint [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]] on the east side of High Street just north of Naghten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased—by 1875, eight railroads served Columbus, and the rail companies built a new, more elaborate station.&lt;ref&gt;

On January 7, 1857, the [[Ohio Statehouse]] finally opened after 18 years of construction.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the abolition of slavery in the South in 1863, the [[Underground Railroad]] was active in Columbus; led, in part, by [[James Preston Poindexter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cole |first1=Charles Chester |title=A Fragile Capital: Identity and the Early Years of Columbus, Ohio |date=2001 |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=9780814208533 |pages=193–204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwfDYWIRiPMC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poindexter arrived in Columbus in the 1830s and became a Baptist Preacher and leader in the city's African-American community until the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;A Notable Colored Man has just Passed Away, Xenia Daily Gazette (Xenia, Ohio) February 8, 1907, page 7, accessed October 5, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6906223//&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Columbus was a major base for the volunteer [[Union Army]]. It housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000 [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[prisoners of war]] at [[Camp Chase]], at what is now the [[Hilltop, Columbus, Ohio|Hilltop neighborhood]] of west Columbus. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the North's largest Confederate cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; North of Columbus, along the Delaware Road, the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] established [[Camp Thomas (Ohio)|Camp Thomas]], where the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th U.S. Infantry]] organized and trained.

By the end of the 19th century, Columbus was home to several major manufacturing businesses. The city became known as the &quot;Buggy Capital of the World,&quot; thanks to the two dozen [[Carriage|buggy]] factories—notably the Columbus Buggy Company, founded in 1875 by C.D. Firestone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://touringohio.com/central/franklin/columbus/columbus-buggy.html|title=Columbus Buggy Company|website=touringohio.com|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082210/http://touringohio.com/central/franklin/columbus/columbus-buggy.html|archive-date=April 8, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time and might have achieved even greater success were it not for the [[Anti-Saloon League]] in neighboring [[Westerville, Ohio|Westerville]].&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 85–87&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[steel|steel industry]], a forward-thinking man named [[Samuel P. Bush]] presided over the [[Buckeye Steel Castings]] Company. Columbus was also a popular location for labor organizations. In 1886, [[Samuel Gompers]] founded the [[American Federation of Labor]] in Druid's Hall on S. Fourth Street, and in 1890 the [[United Mine Workers of America]] was founded at old City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, [[James Thurber]], who would go on to an illustrious literary career in Paris and New York City, was born in the city. Today Ohio State's theater department has a performance center named in his honor, and his youthful home near the Discovery District is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

&quot;The Columbus Experiment&quot; was an environmental project in 1908, which involved construction of the first water plant in the world to apply filtration and softening, designed and invented by two brothers, Clarence and Charles Hoover. Those working to construct the project included [[Flytown#O'Shaughnessy family|Jeremiah O'Shaughnessy]], name-bearer of the Columbus metropolitan area's [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (Ohio)|O'Shaughnessy Dam]]. This invention helped drastically reduce [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] deaths. The essential design is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070430015442/http://utilities.columbus.gov/About_Us/WaterTreatmentProcess.htm &quot;General Water Treatment Process&quot;, Department of Public Utilities, City of Columbus (2007).] Retrieved July 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus earned one of its nicknames, ''The Arch City,'' because of the dozens of wooden arches that spanned High Street at the turn of the 20th century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the new [[Tram|streetcars]]. The city tore down the arches and replaced them with cluster lights in 1914 but reconstructed them from metal in the [[Short North]] district in 2002 for their unique historical interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 1913, the [[Great Flood of 1913]] devastated the neighborhood of Franklinton, leaving over ninety people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent flooding, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] recommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges, and building a [[retaining wall]] along its banks. With the strength of the post-[[World War I]] economy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a new [[Civic center]], the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus)|Ohio Theatre]], the [[LeVeque Tower|American Insurance Union Citadel]], and, to the north, a massive new [[Ohio Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[National Football League|American Professional Football Association]] was founded in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] in 1920, its head offices moved to Columbus in 1921 to the [[16 East Broad Street|New Hayden Building]] and remained in the city until 1941. In 1922, the association's name was changed to the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL History |publisher=CBS Sportsline.com |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930 |accessdate=December 24, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410134638/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1921-1930 |archivedate=April 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, in 1931, at a convention in the city, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] took that name by which they are known today.

The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were less severe in Columbus, as the city's diversified economy helped it fare better than its [[Rust Belt]] neighbors. [[World War II]] brought many new jobs and another population surge. This time, most new arrivals were migrants from the &quot;extraordinarily depressed rural areas&quot; of [[Appalachia]], who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus's growing population.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, pp.116–118&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Center opened in suburban [[Whitehall, Ohio|Whitehall]], and it is now regarded as one of the first modern shopping centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] signaled the arrival of rapid suburb development in central Ohio. To protect the city's tax base from this suburbanization, Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups to [[annexation]] to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio's largest city in land area and in population.

Efforts to revitalize [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown Columbus]] have had some success in recent decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/realestate/commercial/downtown-columbus-comes-to-life-with-millennial-tower.html|title=Open Spaces Bring Light to Downtown Columbus|last=Schneider|first=Keith|date=2016-05-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211014655/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/realestate/commercial/downtown-columbus-comes-to-life-with-millennial-tower.html|archive-date=February 11, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; though like most major American cities, some architectural heritage was lost in the process. In the 1970s, landmarks such as [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]] and the Neil House Hotel were razed to construct high-rise offices and big retail space. The [[National City Bank Building (Columbus)|National City Bank building]] was constructed in 1977, as well as the [[One Nationwide Plaza|Nationwide Plazas]] and other towers that sprouted during this period. The construction of the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] has brought major conventions and trade shows to the city. The Scioto Mile is a showcase park being developed along the riverfront, an area that already had the [[Miranova Place|Miranova Corporate Center]] and [[The Condominiums at North Bank Park]]. Corporate interests have developed [[Capitol Square]], including the [[WCMH-TV|local NBC affiliate]] at the corner of Broad and High.

The [[2010 United States foreclosure crisis]] forced the city to purchase numerous foreclosed, vacant properties to renovate or demolish them{{ndash}}at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. As of February 2011, Columbus had 6,117 vacant properties, according to city officials.&lt;ref name=foreclosures&gt;{{cite news |title=City spends millions renovating, demolishing eyesore properties |first=Mark |last=Ferenchik |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/02/26/vacant_homes.html?sid=101 |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228054014/http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/02/26/vacant_homes.html?sid=101 |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several smaller tributaries course through the [[Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area|Columbus metropolitan area]], including [[Alum Creek (Ohio)|Alum Creek]], [[Big Walnut Creek]], and [[Big Darby Creek|Darby Creek]]. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat [[topography]] thanks to a large [[glacier]] that covered most of Ohio during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin Ice Age]]. However, there are sizable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being {{convert|1132|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], and the low point being {{convert|670|ft|m|abbr=on}} where the Scioto River leaves the county near [[Lockbourne, Ohio|Lockbourne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fracomap&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Ringle | first =Dean C.| title =Franklin County Ohio Road Map &amp; Street Locator| publisher =Franklin County Engineer| year =2007| location =Franklin County, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous ravines near the rivers and creeks also add variety to the landscape. Tributaries to Alum Creek and the Olentangy River cut through shale, while tributaries to the Scioto River cut through limestone.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|223.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|217.17|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|5.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 6, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') transitional with the [[humid subtropical climate]] to the south characterized by warm, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. Columbus is within USDA [[hardiness zone]] 6a.&lt;ref name=USDA_PlantHardiness&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |date=2012 |accessdate=2019-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227032333/http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter snowfall is relatively light, since the city is not in the typical path of strong winter lows, such as the [[Nor'easters]] that strike cities farther east. It is also too far south and west for [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Erie]] to have much effect, although the lakes to the North contribute to long stretches of cloudy spells in winter.

The highest temperature recorded in Columbus was {{convert|106|F|0}}, which occurred twice during the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s—once on July 21, 1934, and again on July 14, 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Weather Service&quot;&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/cmhrec.htm Records for Columbus.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221145049/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/iln/cmhrec.htm |date=December 21, 2014 }} [[National Weather Service]].

Columbus is subject to [[severe weather]] typical to the [[Midwestern United States]]. Severe thunderstorms can bring [[lightning]], large [[hail]] and on rare occasion [[tornado]]es, especially during the spring and sometimes through fall. A tornado that occurred on October 11, 2006 caused [[Fujita Scale|F2]] damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Tullis | first =Matt | author2=Mark Ferenchik| title =Ruin, relief and rebuilding Tornado aftermath| pages =NEWS 01A| newspaper =The Columbus Dispatch| date = October 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman]] continued this work, although the city faced financial turmoil and had to increase taxes, allegedly due in part to fiscal mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisweeknews.com/live/content/politics/LIVE_results/2009races/11/columbus_council.html?sid=104 &quot;Recount Still Possible&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717051114/http://thisweeknews.com/live/content/politics/LIVE_results/2009races/11/columbus_council.html?sid=104 |date=July 17, 2011 }}, This Week Community Papers, Retrieved November 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120905171030/http://www.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/local/local_govtpolitics/article/the_final_push_for_issue_one/19305/ NBC 4, Columbus Budget Shortfall, Tax Increase] Retrieved July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Columbus is the state capital, there is a large government presence in the city.

[[File:LeVeque Tower, Columbus, OH, US crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[LeVeque Tower]], [[Downtown Columbus, Ohio|Downtown]]]]
Columbus has many notable buildings, including the Greek Revival [[Ohio Statehouse|State Capitol]], the [[Art Deco|art-deco]] Ohio Judicial Center, and the [[Peter Eisenman]]-designed [[Wexner Center]] and [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]]. Other buildings of interest include the [[Rhodes State Office Tower]], [[LeVeque Tower]], and [[One Nationwide Plaza]].

Construction of the [[Ohio Statehouse]] began in 1839 on a {{convert|10|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} plot of land donated by four prominent Columbus landowners. This plot formed Capitol Square, which was not part of the city's original layout. Built of Columbus [[limestone]] from the [[Marble Cliff Quarry Co.]], the Statehouse stands on foundations {{convert|18|ft|m}} deep, laid by [[prison labor]] gangs rumored to have been composed largely of [[masonry|masons]] jailed for minor infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/pages/capitol_square/statehouse.cfm?submenu=statehouse|title=Ohio Statehouse Facts|date=December 13, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705125013/http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/pages/capitol_square/statehouse.cfm?submenu=statehouse |archivedate=July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a central recessed [[porch]] with a [[colonnade]] of a forthright and primitive [[Doric order|Greek Doric mode]]. A broad and low central pediment supports the windowed [[astylar]] drum under an invisibly low [[dome|saucer dome]] that lights the interior [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]]. There are several artworks within and outside the building, including the ''[[William McKinley Monument]]'' dedicated in 1907.

Unlike many U.S. state capitol buildings, the Ohio State Capitol owes little to the architecture of the [[United States Capitol|national Capitol]]. During the Statehouse's 22&amp;nbsp;year construction, seven architects were employed. Relations between the legislature and the architects were not always cordial: Nathan B. Kelly, who introduced heating and an ingenious system of natural forced ventilation, was dismissed because the commissioners found his designs too lavish for the committee's original intentions. The Statehouse was opened to the legislature and the public in 1857 and completed in 1861. It is at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus.

Founded in 1975, the Jefferson Center for Learning and the Arts is a campus of nonprofit organizations and a center for research, publications, and seminars on nonprofit leadership and governance.

===Grid and address system===
[[File:Columbus Numbered Streets and Avenues.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Locations of numbered streets and avenues]]
The city's street plan originates downtown and extends into the old-growth neighborhoods, following a [[grid plan|grid pattern]] with the intersection of [[High Street]] (running north–south) and Broad Street (running east–west) at its center. North–south streets run 12 degrees west of due north, parallel to High Street; the avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on) run east–west.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered avenues begin with First Avenue, about {{convert|1+1/4|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} (along the same street).&lt;ref name=&quot;fracomap&quot; /&gt; For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north–south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes 'N' and 'S' indicate whether that distance is to be measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.

This street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered streets and avenues. Furthermore, named streets and avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east–west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north–south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north–south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east–west, perpendicular to High Street.

The addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.

Other major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue, and Livingston Avenue.

===Highways===
Columbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]], [[Interstate 70 (Ohio)|Interstate 70]] running east–west, and [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. They combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as &quot;The Split&quot;, which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]], originally known as the [[National Road]], runs east–west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. [[U.S. Route 23 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 23]] runs roughly north–south, while [[U.S. Route 33 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Beltway|Outerbelt]] encircles most of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Highway 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2 or 3 hour drive of Columbus.

===Bridges===
[[File:Broad Street Bridge Columbus 2018a.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Discovery Bridge (Columbus, Ohio)|Discovery Bridge]]]]
The Columbus riverfront hosts several bridges. The {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Main Street Bridge (Columbus, Ohio)|Main Street Bridge]] opened on July 30, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge |title=Main Street Bridge: Steel Structure Makes Dramatic Visual Impact on Downtown Columbus Skyline |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |work=Downtown Columbus | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106135608/http://www.downtowncolumbus.com/progress/main-street-bridge | archivedate = January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge has three lanes for vehicular traffic (one westbound and two eastbound) and another separated lane for pedestrians and bikes.

===Airports===
[[File:PCI CIMG9956.jpg|thumb|[[John Glenn Columbus International Airport|John Glenn International Airport]]]]
The city's primary airport, [[John Glenn Columbus International Airport|John Glenn International Airport (CMH)]], is on the city's east side. Formerly known as Port Columbus, John Glenn provides service to [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, and [[Cancun, Mexico]] (on a seasonal basis), as well as to most domestic destinations, including all the major hubs along with [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]], and [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]] by June 2019. The airport was a hub for [[Low-cost carrier|discount carrier]] [[Skybus Airlines]] and continues to be a home to [[NetJets]], the world's largest [[fractional ownership]] air carrier. According to a 2005 market survey, John Glenn Columbus International Airport attracts about 50% of its passengers from outside of its {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} radius primary service region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://columbusairports.com/files/about-us/craa-eia-full-brochure1.pdf|title=Regional Airports economic impact study, Wilbur Smith Associates, Inc., January 2005, Chap 1 pp2-4|accessdate=July 5, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120134939/http://columbusairports.com/files/about-us/craa-eia-full-brochure1.pdf|archivedate=January 20, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 52nd-busiest airport in the United States by total passenger boardings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Columbus Dispatch]], February 26, 2012: &quot;Can't get there from here (At least, not without a layover&quot;), pp. D1-2 (By Steve Wartenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rickenbacker International Airport]], in southern Franklin County, is a major cargo facility that is used by the Ohio [[Air National Guard]]. [[Allegiant Air]] offers nonstop service from Rickenbacker to [[Florida]] destinations. [[Ohio State University Airport|Ohio State University Don Scott Airport]] and [[Bolton Field]] are other large general-aviation facilities in the Columbus area.

===Mass transit===
Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the [[Central Ohio Transit Authority]] (COTA). Intercity bus service is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]], [[Barons Bus Lines]], Miller Transportation, [[GoBus (Ohio)|GoBus]], and other carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kfhgroup.com/aibra/Tables/tables.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426091154/http://www.kfhgroup.com/aibra/Tables/tables.htm |archive-date=April 26, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus does not have passenger rail service. The city's major train station, [[Union Station (Columbus)|Union Station]], that was a stop along [[Amtrak]]'s [[National Limited]] train service until 1977 was razed in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028014238/http://home.columbus.rr.com/unionstation|archivedate=October 28, 2006|title=Columbus Union Station|date=October 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Greater Columbus Convention Center]] now stands in its place. Until Amtrak's founding in 1971, the [[Penn Central]] ran the ''[[Cincinnati Limited]]'' to Cincinnati to the southwest (in prior years the train continued to New York City to the east); the ''[[Ohio State Limited]]'' between [[Cincinnati]] and [[Cleveland]], with Union Station serving as a major intermediate stop (the train going unnamed between 1967 and 1971) and the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis (train)|Spirit of St. Louis]],'' which ran between St. Louis and New York City until 1971. The station was also a stop along the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]], the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], the [[Norfolk and Western Railroad]], the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] and the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]]. Columbus is now the [[List of primary statistical areas of the United States|largest metropolitan area]] in the U.S. without a local rail or intercity rail connection (Phoenix opened a [[light rail|light-rail]] system in 2008, but still lacks an [[Amtrak]] connection.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak|date=November 23, 2006|accessdate=May 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624205811/http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm|archive-date=June 24, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix |title=Phoenix debuts light-rail system |date=December 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231085009/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081227/ts_nm/us_transportation_phoenix |archivedate=December 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2009, plans for the [[Ohio Hub|Ohio Hub project]] proposed a high-speed rail service connecting Columbus with Cincinnati and to a proposed hub in Cleveland and onward to the east.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20161207162141/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2009/07/18/RAILPLAN.ART_ART_07-18-09_B1_01EGPQ5.html Columbus Dispatch, High Speed Rail] Retrieved July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the project remained unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.toledoblade.com/Nation/2018/04/16/Could-Ohio-replicate-Florida-s-high-speed-rail-system.html | title = Could Ohio replicate Florida's high-speed rail system? | website = toledoblade.com | date = April 16, 2018 | accessdate = April 7, 2019 | quote = ''Ohio's Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati corridor was part of a broader “Ohio Hub plan” the Ohio Rail Development Commission [..] is soliciting public comments for a 2020 update to that plan, but the state has no funds budgeted'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190406235557/https://www.toledoblade.com/Nation/2018/04/16/Could-Ohio-replicate-Florida-s-high-speed-rail-system.html | archive-date = April 6, 2019 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bicycle===
[[Cycling]] as transportation is steadily increasing in Columbus with its relatively flat terrain, intact urban neighborhoods, large student population, and off-road bike paths.
