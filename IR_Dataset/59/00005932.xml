[[Image:Lactose.svg|thumb|right|310px|[[Lactose]] is a [[disaccharide]] found in animal milk. It consists of a molecule of [[galactose|D-galactose]] and a molecule of [[glucose|D-glucose]] bonded by beta-1-4 [[glycosidic linkage]]. ]]

A '''carbohydrate''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|b|oʊ|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|eɪ|t}}) is a [[biomolecule]] consisting of [[carbon]] (C), [[hydrogen]] (H) and [[oxygen]] (O) atoms, usually with a hydrogen–oxygen [[atom]] ratio of 2:1 (as in water) and thus with the [[empirical formula]] {{nowrap|C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (where ''m'' may be different from ''n''). This [[Chemical formula|formula]] holds true for [[monosaccharide]]s. Some exceptions exist; for example, [[deoxyribose]], a sugar component of [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=itHVNZicPgwC&amp;pg=PT86&amp;lpg=PT86&amp;dq=C5H10O4+Deoxyribose | title =Biology | first1 = Eldra Pearl | last1 = Solomon | first2 = Linda R. | last2 = Berg | first3 = Diana W. | last3 = Martin | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | page = 52 | isbn = 978-0534278281 | via =google.books.com | year =2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the empirical formula C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/inchi/InChI%3D1S/C5H10O4/c6-2-1-4(8)5(9)3-7/h2,4-5,7-9H,1,3H2 | title =Material Measurement Library D-erythro-Pentose, 2-deoxy- | author =National Institute of Standards and Technology | publisher =nist.gov | year =2011| author-link =National Institute of Standards and Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are technically [[hydrate]]s of carbon; structurally it is more accurate to view them as [[aldose]]s and [[ketose]]s.

The term is most common in [[biochemistry]], where it is a synonym of '''saccharide''', a group that includes [[sugar]]s, [[starch]], and [[cellulose]]. The saccharides are divided into four chemical groups: monosaccharides, [[disaccharide]]s, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s. Monosaccharides and disaccharides, the smallest (lower [[molecular weight]]) carbohydrates, are  commonly referred to as sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flitsch SL, Ulijn RV | title = Sugars tied to the spot | journal = Nature | volume = 421 | issue = 6920 | pages = 219–20 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12529622 | doi = 10.1038/421219a | bibcode = 2003Natur.421..219F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''saccharide'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''σάκχαρον'' (''sákkharon''), meaning &quot;sugar&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;avenas&quot;&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Avenas P | year = 2012 | chapter = Etymology of main polysaccharide names | veditors = Navard P | title = The European Polysaccharide Network of Excellence (EPNOE) | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Wien | chapter-url = https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9783709104200-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-1364512-p174060193 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the scientific nomenclature of carbohydrates is complex, the names of the monosaccharides and disaccharides very often end in the suffix [[-ose]], as in the monosaccharides [[fructose]] (fruit sugar) and [[glucose]] (starch sugar) and the disaccharides [[sucrose]] ([[Sugar cane|cane]] or [[Sugar beet|beet]] sugar) and [[lactose]] (milk sugar).

Carbohydrates perform numerous roles in living organisms. Polysaccharides serve for the storage of [[energy]] (e.g. [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]) and as structural components (e.g. [[cellulose]] in plants and [[chitin]] in arthropods). The 5-carbon monosaccharide [[ribose]] is an important component of [[coenzyme]]s (e.g. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]) and the backbone of the genetic molecule known as [[RNA]]. The related [[deoxyribose]] is a component of DNA. Saccharides and their derivatives include many other important [[biomolecules]] that play key roles in the [[immune system]], [[fertilization]], preventing [[pathogenesis]], [[blood clotting]], and [[developmental biology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Maton | first1 = Anthea | first2 = Jean | last2 = Hopkins | first3 = Charles William | last3 = McLaughlin | first4 = Susan | last4 = Johnson | first5 = Maryanna Quon | last5 = Warner | first6 = David | last6 = LaHart | first7 = Jill D. | last7 = Wright | name-list-format = vanc | title = Human Biology and Health | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1993 | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | pages = [https://archive.org/details/humanbiologyheal00scho/page/52 52–59] | isbn = 978-0-13-981176-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/humanbiologyheal00scho/page/52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide. It is abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal [[flour]], such as bread, pizza or pasta. Sugars appear in human diet mainly as table sugar (sucrose, extracted from [[sugarcane]] or [[sugar beet]]s), lactose (abundant in milk), glucose and fructose, both of which occur naturally in [[honey]], many fruits, and some vegetables. Table sugar, milk, or honey are often added to drinks and many prepared foods such as jam, biscuits and cakes.

Cellulose, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of all plants, is one of the main components of insoluble [[dietary fiber]]. Although it is not digestible, insoluble dietary fiber helps to maintain a healthy digestive system&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; by easing [[defecation]]. Other polysaccharides contained in dietary fiber include [[resistant starch]] and [[inulin]], which feed some bacteria in the [[microbiota]] of the [[large intestine]], and are [[metabolism|metabolized]] by these bacteria to yield [[short-chain fatty acids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC Handbook of Dietary Fiber in Human Nutrition&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cummings|first1=John H.|title=The Effect of Dietary Fiber on Fecal Weight and Composition|date=2001| publisher=CRC Press| location=Boca Raton, Florida| isbn=978-0-8493-2387-4| pages=184| edition=3rd| url=https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Handbook-of-Dietary-Fiber-in-Human-Nutrition-Third-Edition/Spiller/p/book/9780849323874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Byrne CS, Chambers ES, Morrison DJ, Frost G | title = The role of short chain fatty acids in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 1331–8 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25971927 | pmc = 4564526 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In scientific literature, the term &quot;carbohydrate&quot; has many synonyms, like &quot;sugar&quot; (in the broad sense), &quot;saccharide&quot;, &quot;ose&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;avenas&quot;/&gt; &quot;glucide&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fearon WF | year = 1949 | title = Introduction to Biochemistry | edition = 2nd | location = London | publisher = Heinemann | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YkOaBQAAQBAJ | isbn = 9781483225395 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;hydrate of carbon&quot; or &quot;[[Hydroxy group|polyhydroxy]] compounds with [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]]&quot;. Some of these terms, specially &quot;carbohydrate&quot; and &quot;sugar&quot;, are also used with other meanings.

In [[food science]] and in many informal contexts, the term &quot;carbohydrate&quot; often means any food that is particularly rich in the complex carbohydrate [[starch]] (such as cereals, bread and pasta) or simple carbohydrates, such as sugar (found in candy, [[jam]]s, and desserts).

Often in lists of [[nutritional information]], such as the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]], the term &quot;carbohydrate&quot; (or &quot;carbohydrate by difference&quot;) is used for everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;USDA National Nutrient Database, 2015, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; This includes chemical compounds such as [[acetic acid|acetic]] or [[lactic acid]], which are not normally considered carbohydrates. It also includes [[dietary fiber]] which is a carbohydrate but which does not contribute much in the way of [[food energy]] ([[Calorie|kilocalories]]), even though it is often included in the calculation of total food energy just as though it were a sugar.

In the strict sense, &quot;[[sugar]]&quot; is applied for sweet, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food.

== Structure ==
Formerly the name &quot;carbohydrate&quot; was used in [[chemistry]] for any compound with the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Following this definition, some chemists considered [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to be the simplest carbohydrate,&lt;ref name=&quot;coulter&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = John Merle | last1 = Coulter | first2 = Charler Reid | last2 = Barnes | first3 = Henry Chandler | last3 = Cowles | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1930 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WyZnVpCiTHIC&amp;pg=PA375&amp;dq=simplest+carbohydrate | title = A Textbook of Botany for Colleges and Universities | isbn = 9781113909954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed that title for [[glycolaldehyde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tietz&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Carl A. | last1 = Burtis | first2 = Edward R. | last2 = Ashwood | first3 = Norbert W. | last3 = Tietz | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l5hqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=simplest+carbohydrate | title = Tietz fundamentals of clinical chemistry | isbn = 9780721686349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula. For example, while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates, ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this. For example, carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as: ''N''-acetyl (e.g. chitin), sulphate (e.g. glycosaminoglycans), carboxylic acid (e.g. sialic acid) and deoxy modifications (e.g. fucose and sialic acid).

Natural saccharides are generally built of simple carbohydrates called [[monosaccharide]]s with general formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n'' is three or more. A typical monosaccharide has the structure H–(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(C=O)–(CHOH)&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;–H, that is, an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] with many [[hydroxyl]] groups added, usually one on each [[carbon]] [[atom]] that is not part of the aldehyde or ketone [[functional group]]. Examples of monosaccharides are [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[glyceraldehyde]]s. However, some biological substances commonly called &quot;monosaccharides&quot; do not conform to this formula (e.g. [[uronic acid]]s and deoxy-sugars such as [[fucose]]) and there are many chemicals that do conform to this formula but are not considered to be monosaccharides (e.g. formaldehyde CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and [[inositol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Matthews CE, Van Holde KE, Ahern KG | year = 1999 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 3rd | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | isbn = 978-0-8053-3066-3 }}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[open-chain]] form of a monosaccharide often coexists with a [[heterocyclic compound|closed ring form]] where the [[aldehyde]]/[[ketone]] [[carbonyl]] group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (–OH) react forming a [[hemiacetal]] with a new C–O–C bridge.

Monosaccharides can be linked together into what are called [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s) in a large variety of ways. Many carbohydrates contain one or more modified monosaccharide units that have had one or more groups replaced or removed. For example, [[deoxyribose]], a component of [[DNA]], is a modified version of [[ribose]]; [[chitin]] is composed of repeating units of [[N-acetyl glucosamine]], a [[nitrogen]]-containing form of glucose.

==Division==
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, their simple derivatives and their polymers having linkages of the acetal type. They may be classified according to their degree of polymerization, and may be divided initially into three principal groups, namely sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Carbohydrates in human nutrition | series = FAO Food and Nutrition Paper – 66 | chapter = Chapter 1 – The role of carbohydrates in nutrition | chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w8079e/w8079e07.htm | publisher =Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:D-glucose color coded.png|130px|right|thumb|[[Glucose|D-glucose]] is an aldohexose with the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The red atoms highlight the [[aldehyde]] group and the blue atoms highlight the [[chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric center]] furthest from the aldehyde; because this -OH is on the right of the [[Fischer projection]], this is a D sugar.]]
Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates in that they cannot be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to smaller carbohydrates. They are aldehydes or ketones with two or more hydroxyl groups. The general [[chemical formula]] of an unmodified monosaccharide is (C•H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, literally a &quot;carbon hydrate&quot;. Monosaccharides are important fuel molecules as well as building blocks for nucleic acids. The smallest monosaccharides, for which n=3, are dihydroxyacetone and D- and L-glyceraldehydes.

===Classification of monosaccharides===
&lt;div class=&quot;thumb tleft&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbinner&quot; style=&quot;width:187px;&quot;&gt;

The [[α]] and [[Beta (letter)|β]] [[anomer]]s of glucose. Note the position of the hydroxyl group (red or green) on the anomeric carbon relative to the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH group bound to carbon 5: they either have identical absolute configurations (R,R or S,S) (α), or opposite absolute configurations (R,S or S,R) (β).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1955/#_ch2_s4_ | chapter = Structural Basis of Glycan Diversity | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | edition = 3rd | publisher =  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location = Cold Spring Harbor (NY) | first1 = Carolyn R | last1 = Bertozzi | first2 = David | last2 = Rabuka | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-1-621821-32-8 | year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Monosaccharides are classified according to three different characteristics: the placement of its [[carbonyl]] group, the number of [[carbon]] atoms it contains, and its [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] handedness. If the carbonyl group is an [[aldehyde]], the monosaccharide is an [[aldose]]; if the carbonyl group is a [[ketone]], the monosaccharide is a [[ketose]]. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called [[triose]]s, those with four are called [[tetrose]]s, five are called [[pentose]]s, six are [[hexose]]s, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Campbell | first1 = Neil A.| first2 = Brad | last2 = Williamson | first3 = Robin J. | last3 = Heyden | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biology: Exploring Life|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=|url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html|isbn=978-0-13-250882-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, [[glucose]] is an [[aldohexose]] (a six-carbon aldehyde), [[ribose]] is an [[aldopentose]] (a five-carbon aldehyde), and [[fructose]] is a [[ketohexose]] (a six-carbon ketone).

Each carbon atom bearing a [[hydroxyl group]] (-OH), with the exception of the first and last carbons, are [[Chirality (chemistry)|asymmetric]], making them [[Stereogenic|stereo center]]s with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of [[isomer]]s may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using [[Le Bel-van't Hoff rule]], the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;=16 possible [[stereoisomer]]s. In the case of [[glyceraldehyde]]s, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are [[enantiomers]] and [[epimer]]s. [[Dihydroxyacetone|1, 3-dihydroxyacetone]], the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The &quot;D-&quot; and &quot;L-&quot; prefixes should not be confused with &quot;d-&quot; or &quot;l-&quot;, which indicate the direction that the sugar  [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] plane [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]]. This usage of &quot;d-&quot; and &quot;l-&quot; is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pigman | first1 = Ward | last2 = Horton | first2 = D. | name-list-format = vanc | title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=1–67|chapter=Chapter 1: Stereochemistry of the Monosaccharides|isbn=9780323138338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ring-straight chain isomerism===
[[Image:Glucose Fisher to Haworth.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[Glucose]] can exist in both a straight-chain and ring form.]]
The aldehyde or ketone group of a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group on a different carbon atom to form a [[hemiacetal]] or [[hemiketal]], forming a [[heterocyclic]] ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called [[furanose]] and [[pyranose]] forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.&lt;ref name=pigman&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pigman | first1 = Ward | last2 = Anet | first2 = E.F.L.J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A|editor=Pigman and Horton|edition=2nd|year=1972|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=165–94|chapter=Chapter 4: Mutarotations and Actions of Acids and Bases|isbn=9780323138338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conversion from straight-chain form to the cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the [[anomeric carbon]], becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below the plane of the ring. The resulting possible pair of stereoisomers is called [[anomer]]s. In the ''α anomer'', the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side ([[Cis-trans isomerism|trans]]) of the ring from the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the ''β anomer''.

===Use in living organisms===
Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for [[metabolism]], being used both as an energy source ([[glucose]] being the most important in nature) and in [[biosynthesis]]. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells, they are often converted to more space-efficient forms, often [[polysaccharide]]s. In many animals, including humans, this storage form is [[glycogen]], especially in liver and muscle cells. In plants, [[starch]] is used for the same purpose. The most abundant carbohydrate, [[cellulose]], is a structural component of the [[cell wall#plant cell walls|cell wall]] of plants and many forms of algae. [[Ribose]] is a component of [[RNA]]. [[Deoxyribose]] is a component of [[DNA]]. [[Lyxose]] is a component of lyxoflavin found in the human heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=lyxoflavin |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/lyxoflavin |dictionary=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ribulose]] and [[xylulose]] occur in the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. [[Galactose]], a component of milk sugar [[lactose]], is found in [[galactolipid]]s in [[cell membrane#lipids|plant cell membranes]] and in [[glycoprotein]]s in many [[biological tissue|tissues]]. [[Mannose]] occurs in human metabolism, especially in the [[glycosylation]] of certain proteins. [[Fructose]], or fruit sugar, is found in many plants and in humans, it is metabolized in the liver, absorbed directly into the intestines during [[digestion]], and found in [[semen]]. [[Trehalose]], a major sugar of insects, is rapidly hydrolyzed into two glucose molecules to support continuous flight.

==Disaccharides==
[[Image:sucrose 3Dprojection.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Sucrose]], also known as table sugar, is a common disaccharide. It is composed of two monosaccharides: [[glucose|D-glucose]] (left) and [[fructose|D-fructose]] (right).]]
{{Main|Disaccharide}}
Two joined monosaccharides are called a [[disaccharide]] and these are the simplest polysaccharides. Examples include [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]. They are composed of two monosaccharide units bound together by a [[covalent]] bond known as a [[glycosidic linkage]] formed via a [[dehydration reaction]], resulting in the loss of a [[hydrogen]] atom from one monosaccharide and a [[hydroxyl group]] from the other. The [[chemical formula|formula]] of unmodified disaccharides is C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. Although there are numerous kinds of disaccharides, a handful of disaccharides are particularly notable.

[[Sucrose]], pictured to the right, is the most abundant disaccharide, and the main form in which carbohydrates are transported in plants. It is composed of one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule and one [[fructose|D-fructose]] molecule. The [[systematic name]] for sucrose, ''O''-α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-D-fructofuranoside, indicates four things:
* Its monosaccharides: glucose and fructose
* Their ring types: glucose is a [[pyranose]] and fructose is a [[furanose]]
* How they are linked together: the oxygen on carbon number 1 (C1) of α-D-glucose is linked to the C2 of D-fructose.
* The ''-oside'' suffix indicates that the [[anomeric carbon]] of both monosaccharides participates in the glycosidic bond.

[[Lactose]], a disaccharide composed of one [[galactose|D-galactose]] molecule and one [[glucose|D-glucose]] molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk. The [[systematic name]] for lactose is ''O''-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose. Other notable disaccharides include [[maltose]] (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides can be classified into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.

==Nutrition==

Carbohydrate consumed in food yields 3.87 kilocalories of energy per [[gram]] for simple sugars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/6202|title=Show Foods|work=usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.57 to 4.12 kilocalories per gram for complex carbohydrate in most other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5022e/y5022e04.htm|title=Calculation of the Energy Content of Foods – Energy Conversion Factors|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatively high levels of carbohydrate are associated with processed foods or refined foods made from plants, including sweets, cookies and candy, table sugar, honey, soft drinks, breads and crackers, jams and fruit products, pastas and breakfast cereals. Lower amounts of carbohydrate are usually associated with unrefined foods, including beans, tubers, rice, and unrefined fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.diabetes.org.uk/upload/How%20we%20help/catalogue/carb-reference-list-0511.pdf |title=Carbohydrate reference list |website=www.diabetes.org.uk |date=  |access-date=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal-based foods generally have the lowest carbohydrate levels, although milk does contain a high proportion of [[lactose]].

Organisms typically cannot metabolize all types of carbohydrate to yield energy. Glucose is a nearly universal and accessible source of energy. Many organisms also have the ability to metabolize other [[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s but glucose is often metabolized first. In ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', for example, the [[lac operon]] will express enzymes for the digestion of lactose when it is present, but if both lactose and glucose are present the ''lac'' operon is repressed, resulting in the glucose being used first (see: [[Diauxie]]). [[Polysaccharide]]s are also common sources of energy. Many organisms can easily break down starches into glucose; most organisms, however, cannot metabolize [[cellulose]] or other polysaccharides like [[chitin]] and [[arabinoxylans]]. These carbohydrate types can be metabolized by some bacteria and protists. [[Ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, for example, use microorganisms to process cellulose. Even though these complex carbohydrates are not very digestible, they represent an important dietary element for humans, called [[dietary fiber]]. Fiber enhances digestion, among other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichon L, Huneau JF, Fromentin G, Tomé D | title = A high-protein, high-fat, carbohydrate-free diet reduces energy intake, hepatic lipogenesis, and adiposity in rats | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 1256–60 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16614413 | doi = 10.1093/jn/136.5.1256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geneva: [[World Health Organization]]. pp. 55–56. {{ISBN|92-4-120916-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 [[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|Cochrane Systematic Review]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that whole grain diets can affect cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid28836672&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Kelly SA, Hartley L, Loveman E, Colquitt JL, Jones HM, Al-Khudairy L, Clar C, Germanò R, Lunn HR, Frost G, Rees K | title=Whole grain cereals for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease | journal= [[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]] | volume=8 | pages=CD005051 | year=2017 |url=https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/bitstream/10044/1/54579/2/Kelly_et_al-2017-.pdf | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub3  | pmid = 28836672 | pmc=6484378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===&lt;!-- This title is used as a redirect target --&gt;
[[Nutrition]]ists often refer to carbohydrates as either simple or complex. However, the exact distinction between these groups can be ambiguous. The term ''complex carbohydrate'' was first used in the [[U.S. Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs]] publication ''Dietary Goals for the United States'' (1977) where it was intended to distinguish sugars from other carbohydrates (which were perceived to be nutritionally superior).&lt;ref&gt;Joint WHO/FAO expert consultation (1998), ''Carbohydrates in human nutrition'', [http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e07.htm chapter 1]. {{ISBN|92-5-104114-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report put &quot;fruit, vegetables and whole-grains&quot; in the complex carbohydrate column, despite the fact that these may contain sugars as well as polysaccharides. This confusion persists as today some nutritionists use the term complex carbohydrate to refer to any sort of digestible saccharide present in a whole food, where fiber, vitamins and minerals are also found (as opposed to processed carbohydrates, which provide energy but few other nutrients). The standard usage, however, is to classify carbohydrates chemically: simple if they are sugars ([[monosaccharide]]s and [[disaccharide]]s) and complex if they are [[polysaccharide]]s (or [[oligosaccharide]]s).&lt;ref name=NutSource&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbohydrates|url=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/|work=The Nutrition Source|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|access-date=April 3, 2013|date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the simple vs. complex chemical distinction has little value for determining the nutritional quality of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=NutSource /&gt; Some simple carbohydrates (e.g. [[fructose]]) raise blood glucose slowly, while some complex carbohydrates (starches), especially if processed, raise blood sugar rapidly. The speed of digestion is determined by a variety of factors including which other nutrients are consumed with the carbohydrate, how the food is prepared, individual differences in metabolism, and the chemistry of the carbohydrate.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jenkins DJ, Jenkins AL, Wolever TM, Thompson LH, Rao AV | title = Simple and complex carbohydrates | journal = Nutrition Reviews | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 44–9 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 3703387 | doi = 10.1111/j.1753-4887.1986.tb07585.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA's]] ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010'' call for moderate- to high-carbohydrate consumption from a balanced diet that includes six one-ounce servings of grain foods each day, at least half from [[whole grain]] sources and the rest from [[Enriched grain|enriched]].&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines.htm ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820230816/http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/DietaryGuidelines.htm |date=August 20, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic index|glycemic index (GI)]] and [[glycemic load]] concepts have been developed to characterize food behavior during human digestion. They rank carbohydrate-rich foods based on the rapidity and magnitude of their effect on [[blood glucose]] levels. Glycemic index is a measure of how quickly food [[glucose]] is absorbed, while glycemic load is a measure of the total absorbable glucose in foods. The [[insulin index]] is a similar, more recent classification method that ranks foods based on their effects on [[insulin|blood insulin]] levels, which are caused by glucose (or starch) and some amino acids in food.

==Metabolism==
{{Main|Carbohydrate metabolism}}
Carbohydrate metabolism denotes the various [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes responsible for the [[anabolism|formation]], [[catabolism|breakdown]] and interconversion of carbohydrates in [[life|living]] [[organism]]s.

The most important carbohydrate is [[glucose]], a simple sugar ([[monosaccharide]]) that is metabolized by nearly all known organisms. Glucose and other carbohydrates are part of a wide variety of metabolic pathways across species: [[plants]] synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water by [[photosynthesis]] storing the absorbed energy internally, often in the form of [[starch]] or [[lipid]]s. Plant components are consumed by animals and [[fungi]], and used as fuel for [[cellular respiration]]. Oxidation of one gram of carbohydrate yields approximately 16&amp;nbsp;kJ (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of [[Chemical energy|energy]], while the oxidation of one gram of lipids yields about 38&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal). The human body stores between 300 and 500&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrates depending on body weight, with the skeletal muscle contributing to a large portion of the storage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maughan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onesearch.cuny.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_sciversesciencedirect_elsevierS0263-9319(13)00087-2&amp;context=PC&amp;vid=hc&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US|title=Surgery Oxford|last=Maughan|first=Ron|date=June 2013|website=www.onesearch.cuny.edu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy obtained from metabolism (e.g., oxidation of glucose) is usually stored temporarily within cells in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;energetics&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Energetics of Cellular Respiration (Glucose Metabolism) | first = Sweety | last = Mehta | name-list-format = vanc | work = Biochemistry Notes, Notes | date = 9 October 2013 | url = http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/10/energetics-of-cellular-respiration-glucose-metabolism/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms capable of anaerobic and [[aerobic respiration]] metabolize glucose and [[oxygen]] (aerobic) to release energy, with [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] as byproducts.

===Catabolism===
Catabolism is the metabolic reaction which cells undergo to break down larger molecules, extracting energy. There are two major [[metabolic pathway]]s of monosaccharide [[catabolism]]: [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].

In glycolysis, oligo- and polysaccharides are cleaved first to smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called [[glycoside hydrolase]]s. The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide catabolism. A 2&amp;nbsp;ATP investment is required in the early steps of glycolysis to phosphorylate Glucose to [[Glucose 6-phosphate|Glucose 6-Phosphate]] ([[Glucose 6-phosphate|G6P]]) and [[Fructose 6-phosphate|Fructose 6-Phosphate]] ([[Fructose 6-phosphate|F6P]]) to [[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate|Fructose 1,6-biphosphate]] ([[Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate|FBP]]), thereby pushing the reaction forward irreversibly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maughan&quot;/&gt; In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.

==Carbohydrate chemistry==
[[Carbohydrate chemistry]] is a large and economically important branch of organic chemistry. Some of the main [[organic reaction]]s that involve carbohydrates are:
* [[Carbohydrate acetalisation]]
* [[Cyanohydrin reaction]]
* [[Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation]]
* [[Amadori rearrangement]]
* [[Nef reaction]]
* [[Wohl degradation]]
* [[Koenigs–Knorr reaction]]
* [[Carbohydrate digestion]]
