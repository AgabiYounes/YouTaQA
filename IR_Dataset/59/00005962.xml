A '''comet''' is an icy, [[small Solar System body]] that, when passing close to the [[Sun]], warms and begins to release gases, a process called [[outgassing]]. This produces a visible atmosphere or [[Coma (cometary)|coma]], and sometimes also a [[Comet tail|tail]]. These phenomena are due to the effects of [[solar radiation]] and the [[solar wind]] acting upon the nucleus of the comet. [[Comet nuclei]] range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one [[astronomical unit]]. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may [[Subtended angle|subtend]] an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.

Comets usually have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of [[orbital period]]s, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. [[#Short period|Short-period comet]]s originate in the [[Kuiper belt]] or its associated [[scattered disc]], which lie beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]]. [[#Long period|Long-period comet]]s are thought to originate in the [[Oort cloud]], a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway to the nearest star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe |publisher=Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |first=Lisa |last=Randall |pages=104–105 |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-06-232847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by [[gravitational perturbation]]s caused by [[List of nearest stars#Future and past|passing stars]] and the [[galactic tide]]. [[Hyperbolic comet]]s may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.

Comets are distinguished from [[asteroid]]s by the presence of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, [[extinct comets]] that have passed close to the Sun many times have lost nearly all of their [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and comets |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions |work=Rosetta's Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Are Asteroids And Comets |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |work=Near Earth Object Program FAQ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Comparison of Comet 81P/Wild 2 Dust with Interplanetary Dust from Comets |last1=Ishii |first1=H.

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - cometa (British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A VI, folio 10v).jpg|thumb|A comet was mentioned in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' that allegedly made an appearance in 729 AD.]]
The word ''comet'' derives from the [[Old English]] ''cometa'' from the [[Latin]] ''comēta'' or ''comētēs''. That, in turn, is a [[Latinisation of names|latinization]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κομήτης (&quot;wearing long hair&quot;), and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes that the term (ἀστὴρ) κομήτης already meant &quot;long-haired star, comet&quot; in Greek. Κομήτης was derived from κομᾶν (&quot;to wear the hair long&quot;), which was itself derived from κόμη (&quot;the hair of the head&quot;) and was used to mean &quot;the tail of a comet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|comet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://etymonline.com/?term=comet |title=Comet (n.) |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Comet nucleus}}
The solid, core structure of a comet is known as the nucleus. Cometary nuclei are composed of an amalgamation of [[rock (geology)|rock]], dust, [[ice|water ice]], and frozen [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1998A&amp;A...330..375G |title=Making a comet nucleus |last1=Greenberg |first1=J.

Research conducted in 2014 suggests that comets are like &quot;[[Fried ice cream|deep fried ice cream]]&quot;, in that their surfaces are formed of dense crystalline ice mixed with [[organic compound]]s, while the interior ice is colder and less dense.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20150210&quot; /&gt;

The surface of the nucleus is generally dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of [[organic compound]]s, which may include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], [[ethane]], and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meech |first=M. |title=1997 Apparition of Comet Hale–Bopp: What We Can Learn from Bright Comets |url=http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Feb97/Bright.html |publisher=Planetary Science Research Discoveries |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stardust Findings Suggest Comets More Complex Than Thought |url=http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news110.html |publisher=NASA |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was confirmed that the amino acid [[glycine]] had been found in the comet [[dust]] recovered by NASA's [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust mission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.tb01224.x |title=Cometary glycine detected in samples returned by Stardust |date=2009 |last1=Elsila |first1=Jamie E. |last2=Glavin |first2=Daniel P. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |display-authors=1 |journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=1323 |bibcode=2009M&amp;PS...44.1323E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, a report, based on [[NASA]] studies of [[meteorite]]s found on Earth, was published suggesting [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] components ([[adenine]], [[guanine]], and related [[organic molecule]]s) may have been formed on [[asteroid]]s and comets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callahan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1106493108 |title=Carbonaceous meteorites contain a wide range of extraterrestrial nucleobases |date=2011 |last1=Callahan |first1=M.

The outer surfaces of cometary nuclei have a very low [[albedo]], making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The [[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]] [[space probe]] found that the nucleus of [[Halley's Comet]] reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it,&lt;ref name=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Activity and Size of the Nucleus of Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) |journal=Science |last1=Weaver |first1=H.

Solar heating drives off lighter [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]], leaving behind larger organic compounds that tend to be very dark, like [[tar]] or [[petroleum|crude oil]].

The streams of [[Comet dust|dust]] and gas thus released form a huge and extremely thin atmosphere around the comet called the &quot;coma&quot;. The force exerted on the coma by the Sun's [[radiation pressure]] and [[solar wind]] cause an enormous &quot;tail&quot; to form pointing away from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zjv84hHNPcC&amp;pg=PA66 |title=A Complete Manual of Amateur Astronomy: Tools and Techniques for Astronomical Observations |last1=Clay Sherrod |first1=P.

Although the solid nucleus of comets is generally less than {{convert|60|km|mi|sp=us}} across, the coma may be thousands or millions of kilometers across, sometimes becoming larger than the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1021512317744 |date=2002 |first1=Rosine |last1=Lallement |last2=Bertaux |first2=Jean-Loup |last3=Szegö |first3=Karöly |last4=Nemeth |first4=Szilvia |display-authors=1 |journal=Earth, Moon, and Planets |volume=90 |pages=67–76 |title=The Shadow of Comet Hale–Bopp in Lyman-Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, about a month after an outburst in October 2007, comet [[17P/Holmes]] briefly had a tenuous dust atmosphere larger than the Sun.&lt;ref name=atmosphere2&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=David C.

In 1996, comets were found to emit [[X-ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.274.5285.205 |title=Discovery of X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Emission from Comet C/Hyakutake 1996 B2 |date=1996 |last1=Lisse |first1=C.

G. |bibcode=1996Sci...274..205L |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly surprised astronomers because X-ray emission is usually associated with very [[black-body radiation|high-temperature bodies]]. The X-rays are generated by the interaction between comets and the solar wind: when highly charged solar wind ions fly through a cometary atmosphere, they collide with cometary atoms and molecules, &quot;stealing&quot; one or more electrons from the atom in a process called &quot;charge exchange&quot;. This exchange or transfer of an electron to the solar wind ion is followed by its de-excitation into the ground state of the ion by the emission of X-rays and [[far ultraviolet]] [[photon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Charge Exchange-Induced X-Ray Emission from Comet C/1999 S4 (LINEAR) |journal=Science |last1=Lisse |first1=C.

===Bow shock===
[[Bow shock]]s form as a result of the interaction between the [[solar wind]] and the cometary ionosphere, which is created by ionization of gases in the coma. As the comet approaches the Sun, increasing outgassing rates cause the coma to expand, and the sunlight ionizes gases in the coma. When the solar wind passes through this ion coma, the bow shock appears.

The first observations were made in the 1980s and 90s as several spacecraft flew by comets [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Bow wave of Comet Giacobini-Zinner – ICE magnetic field observations |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |last1=Jones |first1=D.

These observations were all made near [[perihelion]] when the bow shocks already were fully developed.

The [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'']] spacecraft observed the bow shock at comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] at an early stage of bow shock development when the outgassing increased during the comet's journey toward the Sun.

Once the particles have been ionized, they attain a net positive electrical charge, which in turn gives rise to an &quot;induced [[magnetosphere]]&quot; around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. Because the relative orbital speed of the comet and the solar wind is supersonic, a [[bow shock]] is formed upstream of the comet in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called &quot;pick-up ions&quot;) congregate and act to &quot;load&quot; the solar magnetic field with plasma, such that the field lines &quot;drape&quot; around the comet forming the ion tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp 864&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics |publisher=Addison-Wesley |last1=Carroll |first1=B.

== Orbital characteristics ==

Most comets are [[small Solar System bodies]] with elongated [[elliptical orbit]]s that take them close to the Sun for a part of their orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bds2/ltsn/ljm/JAVA/COMETORB/COMET.HTM |title=The Orbit of a Comet |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comets are often classified according to the length of their [[orbital period]]s: The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.

Because their elliptical orbits frequently take them close to the giant planets, comets are subject to further [[Perturbation (astronomy)|gravitational perturbations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l11_p9.html |title=Comets |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-period comets have a tendency for their [[Apsis|aphelia]] to coincide with a [[giant planet]]'s semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group.&lt;ref name=&quot;britastro&quot;/&gt; It is clear that comets coming in from the Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets as a result of a close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7E_uwj0Lc8C&amp;pg=PA246 |page=246 |title=In Quest of the Solar System |isbn=978-0-7637-9477-4 |last=Koupelis |first=Theo |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward the [[Sun]] to form a visible comet.

Long-period comets have highly [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbits and periods ranging from 200 years to thousands of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBP&quot;/&gt; An eccentricity greater than 1 when near [[perihelion]] does not necessarily mean that a comet will leave the Solar System.&lt;ref name=Elenin2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceobs.org/en/2011/03/07/vliyanie-planet-gigantov-na-orbitu-komety-c2010-x1-elenin/ |title=Influence of giant planets on the orbit of comet C/2010 X1 |first=Leonid |last=Elenin |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[C/2006 P1|Comet McNaught]] had a heliocentric osculating eccentricity of 1.000019 near its perihelion passage [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] in January 2007 but is bound to the Sun with roughly a 92,600-year orbit because the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] drops below 1 as it moves farther from the Sun. The future orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the [[osculating orbit]] is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|center of mass of the Solar System]]. By definition long-period comets remain gravitationally bound to the Sun; those comets that are ejected from the Solar System due to close passes by major planets are no longer properly considered as having &quot;periods&quot;. The orbits of long-period comets take them far beyond the outer planets at aphelia, and the plane of their orbits need not lie near the ecliptic. Long-period comets such as [[Comet West]] and [[C/1999 F1]] can have [[aphelion]] distances of nearly 70,000 AU with orbital periods estimated around 6 million years.

Single-apparition or non-periodic comets are similar to long-period comets because they also have [[parabolic trajectory|parabolic]] or slightly [[hyperbolic trajectory|hyperbolic]] trajectories&lt;ref name=&quot;SBP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Small Bodies: Profile |url=http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/special/smbod.htm |publisher=NASA/JPL |date=29 October 2008 |accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when near perihelion in the inner Solar System. However, gravitational perturbations from giant planets cause their orbits to change. Single-apparition comets have a hyperbolic or parabolic [[osculating orbit]] which allows them to permanently exit the Solar System after a single pass of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3K9Fhu2q-8gC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Astronomy and Astrophysics |last1=Joardar |first1=S. |last2=Bhattacharya |first2=A.

While ʻOumuamua, with an eccentricity of about 1.2, showed no optical signs of cometary activity during its passage through the inner Solar System in October 2017, changes to its trajectory—which suggests [[outgassing]]—indicate that it is probably a comet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oumuamua&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/41015-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua-comet-after-all.html |title=Interstellar Visitor 'Oumuamua Is a Comet After All |work=Space.com |first=Chelsea |last=Gohd |date=27 June 2018 |access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, 2I/Borisov, with an estimated eccentricity of about 3.36, has been observed to have the coma feature of comets, and is considered the first detected [[interstellar object|interstellar comet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/astronomy-interstellar-comet-space |title=Astronomers have spotted a second interstellar object |work=Science News |last=Grossman |first=Lisa |date=12 September 2019 |access-date=16 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/24/world/second-interstellar-visitor-confirmed-scn-trnd/ |title=2nd interstellar visitor to our solar system confirmed and named |publisher=CNN |last1=Strickland |first1=Ashley |date=27 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comet [[C/1980 E1]] had an orbital period of roughly 7.1&amp;nbsp;million years before the 1982 perihelion passage, but a 1980 encounter with Jupiter accelerated the comet giving it the largest eccentricity (1.057) of any known hyperbolic comet.&lt;ref name=&quot;C/1980E1-jpl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=1980E1 |title=C/1980 E1 (Bowell) |work=[[JPL Small-Body Database]] |type=1986-12-02 last obs |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comets not expected to return to the inner Solar System include [[C/1980 E1]], [[C/2000 U5]], [[C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)]], [[C/2009 R1]], [[C/1956 R1]], and [[C/2007 F1]] (LONEOS).

Some authorities use the term &quot;periodic comet&quot; to refer to any comet with a periodic orbit (that is, all short-period comets plus all long-period comets),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comet |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-54344/comet |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others use it to mean exclusively short-period comets.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBP&quot;/&gt; Similarly, although the literal meaning of &quot;non-periodic comet&quot; is the same as &quot;single-apparition comet&quot;, some use it to mean all comets that are not &quot;periodic&quot; in the second sense (that is, to also include all comets with a period greater than 200 years).

Early observations have revealed a few genuinely hyperbolic (i.e. non-periodic) trajectories, but no more than could be accounted for by perturbations from Jupiter. If comets pervaded [[interstellar space]], they would be moving with velocities of the same order as the relative velocities of stars near the Sun (a few tens of km per second). If such objects entered the Solar System, they would have positive [[specific orbital energy]] and would be observed to have genuinely hyperbolic trajectories. A rough calculation shows that there might be four hyperbolic comets per century within Jupiter's orbit, give or take one and perhaps two orders of [[Order of magnitude|magnitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the nondetection of extrasolar comets |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |last1=McGlynn |first1=Thomas A. |last2=Chapman |first2=Robert D. |last-author-amp=yes |volume=346 |at=L105 |date=1989 |doi=10.1086/185590 |bibcode=1989ApJ...346L.105M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSM V18 D201 Shower of perseids sept 6 and 7.jpg|thumb|Diagram of [[Perseids|Perseids meteors]]]]

=== Connection to meteor showers ===
As a comet is heated during close passes to the Sun, [[outgassing]] of its icy components also releases solid debris too large to be swept away by [[radiation pressure]] and the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Earth's orbit sends it through that trail of debris, which is composed mostly of fine grains of rocky material, there is likely to be a [[meteor shower]] as Earth passes through. Denser trails of debris produce quick but intense meteor showers and less dense trails create longer but less intense showers. Typically, the density of the debris trail is related to how long ago the parent comet released the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciam19990920&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-causes-a-meteor-show/ |title=What causes a meteor shower? |work=[[Scientific American]] |first=Gregory A. |last=Lyzenga |date=20 September 1999 |accessdate=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo20190207&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/reference/meteor-showers/ |title=Meteor showers, explained |work=[[National Geographic]] |first=Victoria |last=Jaggard |date=7 February 2019 |accessdate=21 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Perseids|Perseid meteor shower]], for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of [[Comet Swift–Tuttle]].

=== Comets and impact on life ===

Many comets and asteroids collided with Earth in its early stages. Many scientists think that comets bombarding the young Earth about 4&amp;nbsp;billion years ago brought the [[Origin of water on Earth|vast quantities of water]] that now fill Earth's oceans, or at least a significant portion of it. Others have cast doubt on this idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Muir |first=Hazel |title=Earth's water brewed at home, not in space |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12693 |work=New Scientist |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of organic molecules, including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20150210&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=Why Comets Are Like Deep Fried Ice Cream |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4480 |date=10 February 2015 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or [[meteorite]]s may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dfn0VoICrBYC&amp;pg=PA315 |page=315 |title=Comets |isbn=978-1-4020-3495-4 |last=Fernández |first=Julio A. |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the [[amino acid]]s that make up [[protein]]s through [[shock synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ngeo1930 |title=Shock synthesis of amino acids from impacting cometary and icy planet surface analogues |date=2013 |last1=Martins |first1=Zita |last2=Price |first2=Mark C. |last3=Goldman |first3=Nir |last4=Sephton |first4=Mark A. |last5=Burchell |first5=Mark J. |display-authors=1 |journal=Nature Geoscience |bibcode=2013NatGe...6.1045M |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=1045–1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed at which the comets entered the atmosphere, combined with the magnitude of energy created after initial contact, allowed smaller molecules to condense into the larger macro-molecules that served as the foundation for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/did-comet-impacts-jump-start-life-on-earth/|title=Did comet impacts jump-start life on Earth?|date=2019-10-18|website=Astrobiology Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, scientists found significant amounts of molecular oxygen in the outgassings of comet 67P, suggesting that the molecule may occur more often than had been thought, and thus less an indicator of life as has been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;Oregonian (29 Oct 2015), &quot;Comet's oxygen shakes theories on solar system&quot;, p. A5&lt;/ref&gt;

It is suspected that comet impacts have, over long timescales, also delivered significant quantities of water to Earth's [[Moon]], some of which may have survived as [[lunar ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/water-discovered-in-apollo-moon-rocks-likely-came-from-comets/ |title=Water Discovered in Apollo Moon Rocks Likely Came from Comets |accessdate=7 September 2013 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comet and [[meteoroid]] impacts are also thought to be responsible for the existence of [[tektite]]s and [[australite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/discoverycentre/infosheets/australites/ |title=Australites |publisher=Museum Victoria |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fear of comets===
Fear of comets as [[act of God|acts of God]] and signs of impending doom was highest in Europe from AD 1200 to 1650.{{r|ley196710}} The year after the [[Great Comet of 1618]], for example, [[Gotthard Arthusius]] published a pamphlet stating that it was a sign that the [[Day of Judgment]] was near.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2600275q |title=Cometa orientalis: Kurtze vnd eygentliche Beschreibung deß newen Cometen, so im November deß abgelauffenen 1618 |via=Gallica.fr |publisher=Sigismund Latomus |location=[[Frankfurt on Main|Franckfurt-am-Mayn]] |first=Gothard |last=Arthusius |author-link=Gotthard Arthusius |date=1619}}&lt;/ref&gt; He listed ten pages of comet-related disasters, including &quot;earthquakes, floods, changes in river courses, hail storms, hot and dry weather, poor harvests, epidemics, war and treason and high prices&quot;. By 1700 most scholars concluded that such events occurred whether a comet was seen or not. Using Edmund Halley's records of comet sightings, however, [[William Whiston]] in 1711 wrote that the [[Great Comet of 1680]] had a periodicity of 574 years and was responsible for the [[Genesis flood narrative|worldwide flood in the Book of Genesis]], by pouring water on Earth. His announcement revived for another century fear of comets, now as direct threats to the world instead of signs of disasters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley196710&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v26n01_1967-10_modified#page/n83/mode/2up |title=The Worst of All the Comets |department=For Your Information |magazine=[[Galaxy Science Fiction]] |last=Ley |first=Willy |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=96–105 |date=October 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectroscopic analysis in 1910 found the toxic gas [[cyanogen]] in the tail of [[Halley's Comet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/02/08/archives/comets-poisonous-tail-yerkes-observatory-finds-cyanogen-in-spectrum.html |title=Yerkes Observatory Finds Cyanogen in Spectrum of Halley's Comet |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 February 1910 |accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing panicked buying of gas masks and quack &quot;anti-comet pills&quot; and &quot;anti-comet umbrellas&quot; by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.universetoday.com/40778/interesting-facts-about-comets/ |title=Interesting Facts About Comets |work=Universe Today |first=Jerry |last=Coffey |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fate of comets ==

=== Departure (ejection) from Solar System ===

If a comet is traveling fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open path of a hyperbola, and as such they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|interacting]] with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1991JBAA..101..119H |title=On hyperbolic comets |last1=Hughes |first1=D. W. |volume=101 |date=1991 |pages=119 |journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is thought to be Comet [[C/1980 E1]], which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1&amp;nbsp;million years around the Sun, to a [[hyperbolic trajectory]], after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.&lt;ref name=barycenter&gt;{{cite web |author=[[JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System|Horizons]] output |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&amp;body_group=sb&amp;sstr=C/1980+E1 |title=Barycentric Osculating Orbital Elements for Comet C/1980 E1 |accessdate=9 March 2011}} (Solution using the Solar System [[Center of mass#Barycenter in astrophysics and astronomy|Barycenter]] and [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycentric coordinates]]. Select Ephemeris Type:Elements and Center:@0)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Volatiles exhausted ===
{{Main|Extinct comet}}

Jupiter-family comets and long-period comets appear to follow very different fading laws. The JFCs are active over a lifetime of about 10,000 years or ~1,000 orbits whereas long-period comets fade much faster. Only 10% of the long-period comets survive more than 50 passages to small perihelion and only 1% of them survive more than 2,000 passages.&lt;ref name=dormant/&gt; Eventually most of the volatile material contained in a comet nucleus evaporates, and the comet becomes a small, dark, inert lump of rock or rubble that can resemble an [[asteroid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lyzenga |first=Greg |title=If comets melt, why do they seem to last for long periods of time |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=if-comets-melt-why-do-the |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=16 November 1998 |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some asteroids in elliptical orbits are now identified as extinct comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/PDF/asteroids3.pdf |title=Evolution of Comets into Asteroids |journal=Asteroids III |last1=Bottke Jr |first1=William F. |last2=Levison |first2=Harold F. |last-author-amp=yes |page=669 |date=2002 |bibcode=2002aste.book..669W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Are the IRAS-detected Apollo asteroids extinct comets? |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |first=J.

=== Breakup and collisions ===

Comets [[42P/Neujmin]] and [[53P/Van Biesbroeck]] appear to be fragments of a parent comet.

Some comets have been observed to break up during their perihelion passage, including great comets [[Comet West|West]] and [[Comet Ikeya–Seki|Ikeya–Seki]]. [[3D/Biela|Biela]]'s Comet was one significant example, when it broke into two pieces during its passage through the perihelion in 1846. These two comets were seen separately in 1852, but never again afterward. Instead, spectacular [[meteor showers]] were seen in 1872 and 1885 when the comet should have been visible. A minor meteor shower, the [[Andromedids]], occurs annually in November, and it is caused when Earth crosses the orbit of Biela's Comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/andromedids.html |title=The Andromedids |publisher=Meteor Showers Online |accessdate=27 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122144223/http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/andromedids.html |archive-date=22 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
{{main|Naming of comets}}
[[File:Halley's Comet, 1910.JPG|thumb|[[Halley's Comet]] in 1910]]

The names given to comets have followed several different conventions over the past two centuries. Prior to the early 20th century, most comets were simply referred to by the year when they appeared, sometimes with additional adjectives for particularly bright comets; thus, the &quot;[[Great Comet of 1680]]&quot;, the &quot;[[Great Comet of 1882]]&quot;, and the &quot;[[Great January Comet of 1910]]&quot;.

After [[Edmund Halley]] demonstrated that the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682 were the same body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as [[Halley's Comet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Halley and his Comet |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/halley/halley4.htm |work=A brief history of Halley's Comet |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the second and third known periodic comets, [[Encke's Comet]]&lt;ref name=&quot;KronkEncke&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=2P/Encke |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/002p.html |work=Gary W. Kronk's Cometography |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Biela's Comet]],&lt;ref name=&quot;KronkBiela&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=3D/Biela |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/003d.html |work=Gary W. Kronk's Cometography |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvcom&quot;/&gt;

In the early 20th century, the convention of naming comets after their discoverers became common, and this remains so today. A comet can be named after its discoverers, or an instrument or program that helped to find it.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/cometnames.html |title=Comet Names and Designations; Comet Naming and Nomenclature; Names of Comets |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2019, astronomer [[Gennadiy Borisov|Gennady Borisov]] observed a comet that appeared to have originated outside of the solar system, the comet was named C/2019 Q4 (Borisov) after him.

According to Norse Mythology, comets were actually a part of the Giant Ymir's skull. According to the tale, Odin and his brothers slew Ymir and set about constructing the world (Earth) from his corpse. They fashioned the oceans from his blood, the soil from his skin and muscles, vegetation from his hair, clouds from his brains, and the sky from his skull. Four dwarves, corresponding to the four cardinal points, held Ymir's skull aloft above the earth. Following this tale, comets in the sky, as believed by the Norse, were flakes of Ymir's skull falling from the sky and then disintegrating.&lt;ref&gt;Simek, Rudolf. 1993. Dictionary of Northern Mythology. Translated by Angela Hall. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indian astronomy|India]], by the 6th century astronomers believed that comets were celestial bodies that re-appeared periodically. This was the view expressed in the 6th century by the astronomers [[Varāhamihira]] and [[Bhadrabahu]], and the 10th-century astronomer [[Bhaṭṭotpala]] listed the names and estimated periods of certain comets, but it is not known how these figures were calculated or how accurate they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&amp;pg=PA293|title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|last1=Kelley|first1=David H.|last2=Milone|first2=Eugene F.|date=2011|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=978-1-4419-7624-6|edition=2nd|page=293|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-7624-6|oclc=710113366|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1301, the Italian painter [[Giotto]] was the first person to accurately and anatomically portray a comet. In his work ''Adoration of the Magi,'' Giotto's depiction of Halley's Comet in the place of the [[Star of Bethlehem]] would go unmatched in accuracy until the 19th century and be bested only with the invention of photography.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

[[Aristotle]] was the first known scientist to utilize various theories and observational facts to employ a consistent, structured cosmological theory of comets. He believed that comets were atmospheric phenomena, due to the fact that they could appear outside of the [[Zodiac]] and vary in brightness over the course of a few days. Aristotle's cometary theory arose from his observations and cosmological theory that everything in the cosmos is arranged in a distinct configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fo-GY4J1h4cC&amp;pg=PA1 |title=A History of Physical Theories of Comets, From Aristotle to Whipple |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |first=Tofigh |last=Heidarzadeh |page=1 |date=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-8323-5 |lccn=2008924856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this configuration was a clear separation between the celestial and terrestrial, believing comets to be strictly associated with the latter. According to Aristotle comets must be within the sphere of the moon and clearly separated from the heavens. His theory on comets was widely accepted throughout the [[Middle Ages]], despite several discoveries from various individuals challenging aspects of his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; One notable challenger was [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], who questioned the logic of his predecessors sparking much debate among Aristotle's critics in the 16th and 17th centuries. Seneca thought comets to be more permanent than suggested by their brief flashes across the sky and provided thought provoking evidence of the celestial nature of comets .&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of comets in the Copernican revolution |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A |first1=Peter |last1=Barker |first2=Bernard R. |last2=Goldstein |last-author-amp=yes |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=299–319 |date=September 1988 |doi=10.1016/0039-3681(88)90002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posed many questions regarding the validity of contemporary theories on comets, however, he did not author a substantial theory of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fo-GY4J1h4cC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=a+history+of+physical+theories+on+comets#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20history%20of%20physical%20theories%20on%20comets&amp;f=false|title=A History of Physical Theories of Comets, From Aristotle to Whipple|last=Heidarzadeh|first=Tofigh|date=2008-05-23|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-8323-5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] believed that comets were connected with political unrest and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny observed comets as &quot;human like&quot;, often describing their tails with &quot;long hair&quot; or &quot;long beard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_MVAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36 |title=The Comet of 1577: Its Place in the History of Astronomy |series=Columbia University Studies in the Social Sciences No. 510 |publisher=AMS Press |first=C.

Astrological interpretations of comets proceeded to take precedence clear into the 15th century, despite the presence of modern scientific astronomy beginning to take root. In the 1400s, comets continue to forewarn disaster as seen in the [[Luzerner Schilling]] chronicles and in the warnings of [[Pope Callixtus III]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;  [[Regiomontanus]] was the first to attempt to calculate [[Diurnal parallax]] by observing the great comet of 1472. His predictions were not very accurate, but they were conducted in the hopes of estimating the distance of a comet from the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CcSUeymd-14C&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=regiomontanus+on+comets#v=onepage&amp;q=regiomontanus%20on%20comets&amp;f=false|title=Introduction to Comets|last=Brandt|first=John C.|last2=Chapman|first2=Robert D.|date=2004-03-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00466-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Michael Maestlin]] demonstrated that comets must exist outside Earth's atmosphere by measuring the [[parallax]] of the [[Great Comet of 1577]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Peter|date=2002-06-01|title=Constructing Copernicus|journal=Perspectives on Science|volume=10|issue=2|pages=208–227|doi=10.1162/106361402321147531|issn=1063-6145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the precision of the measurements, this implied the comet must be at least four times more distant than from Earth to the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESO part I&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief History of Comets I (until 1950) |url=http://www.eso.org/public/events/astro-evt/hale-bopp/comet-history-1.html |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on observations in 1664, [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli|Giovanni Borelli]] recorded the longitudes and latitudes of comets that he observed, and suggested that cometary orbits may be parabolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Giovanni Borelli and the Comets of 1664–65 |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |first=Luciano |last=Boschiero |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=11–30 |date=February 2009 |doi=10.1177/002182860904000103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]] one of the most renowned astronomers to date, even attempted writings on comets in [[The Assayer]]. He rejected Tycho Brahe's theories on the parallax of comets and claimed that they may be a mere optical illusion. Intrigued as early scientists were about the nature of comets, Galileo could not help but throw about his own theories despite little personal observation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Kepler responded to these unjust criticisms in his work ''Hyperaspistes.''

Also occurring in the [[Early modern period]] was the study of comets and their astrological significance in medical disciplines. Many healers of this time considered medicine and astronomy to be inter-disciplinary, and employed their knowledge of comets and other astrological signs for diagnosing and treating patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lanuza Navarro|first=Tayra M.

=== Orbital studies ===
{{further|Observational history of comets#Orbital studies}}
[[Isaac Newton]], in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' of 1687, proved that an object moving under the influence of [[gravity]] must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the [[conic section]]s, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a parabolic orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Newton |chapter=Lib. 3, Prop. 41 |title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica |publisher=[[Royal Society of London]] |date=1687 |isbn=0-521-07647-1 |title-link=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was one of the first to contribute to the physical understanding of the nature of comets. 
[[File:Newton Comet1680.jpg|thumb|290px|The orbit of the comet of 1680, fitted to a [[parabola]], as shown in [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'']]

In 1705, [[Edmond Halley]] (1656–1742) applied Newton's method to twenty-three cometary apparitions that had occurred between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar [[orbital element]]s, and he was further able to account for the slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation caused by Jupiter and [[Saturn]]. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstl.1704.0064 |title=Astronomiae Cometicae Synopsis, Autore Edmundo Halleio apud Oxonienses.

*  Clairaut (January 1759) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324346563;view=1up;seq=44 &quot;Mémoire sur la cométe de 1682,&quot;] ''Le Journal des Sçavans'', pp. 38–45.  On p. 44, Clairaut predicted that Halley's comet would return in mid April 1759.  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324346563;view=1up;seq=50 From p. 44:]  ''&quot; … il me paroît que la Cométe attendue doit passer à son périhélie vers le milieu du mois d'Avril prochain.&quot;'' ( … it seems to me that the expected comet must pass its perihelion towards the middle of next April.) On p. 40, Clairaut stated that his prediction might be slightly incorrect due to the presence of unknown planets beyond Saturn:  ''&quot;Un corps qui passe dans des régions aussi éloignées, &amp; qui échappe à nos yeux pendant des intervalles aussi longs, pourroit être soumis à des forces totalement inconnues; telles que l'action d'autres Cométes, ou même de quelque planéte toujours trop distante du Soleil pour être jamais apperçue.&quot;''  (A body [i.e., Halley's comet] which passes into regions so remote, and which escapes our eyes during such long intervals, might be subjected to totally unknown forces; such as the action of other comets, or even of some planet always too far from the sun to ever be perceived.)
On 1759 April 7, the French astronomer [[Joseph-Nicolas Delisle]] announced to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris that he and his assistant [[Charles Messier]] had observed the return of Halley's comet, as predicted:
*  de l'Isle (June 1759) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324346563;view=1up;seq=360 &quot;Lettre de M. de l'Isle … contenant la découverte du retour de la Comète de 1682, … &quot;] (Letter from Mr. de l'Isle … containing the discovery of the return of the comet of 1682), ''Le Journal des Sçavans'', pp. 356–364.
De l'Isle subsequently admitted that the comet's return had first been seen by a German amateur astronomer and farmer, [[Johann Georg Palitzsch|Georg Palitzsch]]:
*  de l'Isle (August 1759) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.5324346563;view=1up;seq=527  &quot;Seconde lettre de M. de l'Isle,&quot;] ''Le Journal des Sçavans'', pp. 523–529.  From p. 526:  ''&quot; … j'ai reçu une Lettre d'Heidelberg le premier Avril au soir, dans laquelle l'on m'écrit que l'on a publié à Leipsick le 24 Janvier de cette année un Mémoire Allemand dans lequel il est dit que cette Comète a été vue en Saxe par un Paysan, nommé Palisch, le 25 &amp; 26 Décembre de l'année dernière; j'ai bien de la peine à concevoir comment ce Paysan aura pû la découvrir, cette Comète, … &quot;''  ( … I received a letter from Heidelberg on the first of April in the evening, in which it is written to me that there had been published at Leipzig on the 24th of January of this year a German memoir in which it is said that this comet had been seen in Saxony by a peasant, named Palisch, on the 25th and 26th of December of last year; I can hardly conceive how this peasant could have discovered it, this comet, … )
The story behind the rediscovery of Halley's comet was given by Joseph Lalande in: 
*  Delalande, ''Tables astronomiques de M. Halley, … Et l'Histoire de la Comete de 1759.''  [Astronomical tables of Mr. Halley, …  and the history of the comet of 1759.] (Paris, France:  Durand, 1759), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006990892;view=1up;seq=105 pp. 91 ff.] Lalande acknowledged the contributions of Madame Lepaute to predicting the return of Halley's comet on p. 110.  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006990892;view=1up;seq=124 From p. 110:]  ''&quot; … mais il faut convenir que cette suite immense de détails m'eût semblé effrayante, si ''Madame LEPAUTE'', appliquée depuis long-temps &amp; avec succès aux calculs Astronomiques, n'en eût partagé le travail.&quot;'' ( … but it must be admitted that this immense series of details would have seemed frightening to me if ''Madame LEPAUTE'', [who has] long applied [herself] successfully to astronomical calculations, had not shared in the work.)

In the 19th century, the Astronomical Observatory of Padova, was an epicenter in the observational study of comets. Led by Giovanni Santini (1787-1877) and followed by Giuseppe Lorenzoni (1843-1914), this observatory was devoted to classical astronomy, mainly to the new comets and planets orbit calculation, with the goal of compiling of a catalog of almost ten thousand stars. Situated in the Northern portion of Italy, observations from this observatory were key in establishing important geodetic, geographic, and astronomical calculations, such as the difference of longitude between Milan and Padua as well as Padua to Fiume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pigatto|first=Luisa|date=December 2009|title=The correspondence of Giovanni Santini and Guiseppe Lorenzoni, directors of the Astronomical Observatory of Padua in the 19th Century|url=|journal=Annals of Geophysics|volume=52|pages=595–604|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to these geographic observations, correspondence within the observatory, particularly between Santini and another astronomer Giuseppe Toaldo, about the importance of comet and planetary orbital observations.&lt;ref&gt;PIGATTO, L.

Isaac Newton described comets as compact and durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were the origin of the life-supporting component of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|pp=306–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 18th century, some scientists had made correct hypotheses as to comets' physical composition. In 1755, [[Immanuel Kant]] hypothesized that comets are composed of some volatile substance, whose vaporization gives rise to their brilliant displays near perihelion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, the German mathematician [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], after observing streams of vapor during the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1835, proposed that the [[jet force]]s of evaporating material could be great enough to significantly alter a comet's orbit, and he argued that the non-gravitational movements of Encke's Comet resulted from this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sagan|Druyan|1997|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Fred Lawrence Whipple]] proposed that rather than being rocky objects containing some ice, comets were icy objects containing some dust and rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whipple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/145272 |title=A comet model.

*The [[Halley Armada]] describes the collection of spacecraft missions that visited and/or made observations of [[Halley's Comet]] 1980s perihelion.
*'''Deep Impact'''. Debate continues about how much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of [[19P/Borrelly|Comet Borrelly]]. It was found that the surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between {{convert|26|to|71|C|F}}, and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Spacecraft Finds Comet Has Hot, Dry Surface |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2002/release_2002_80.html |publisher=JPL |date=5 April 2002 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2005, the ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'' probe blasted a crater on Comet [[Tempel 1]] to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of vaporized water that form the coma of Tempel 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA's 'Deep Impact' Team Reports First Evidence of Cometary Ice |url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2005-06/05-072.html |publisher=Brown University |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renamed [[EPOXI]], it made a flyby of [[103P/Hartley|Comet Hartley 2]] on 4 November 2010.

Ulysses was launched in 1990 and the intended mission was for Ulysses to orbit around the sun for further study at all latitudes. 
*'''Stardust'''.

Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes bright enough to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be designated as [[great comet]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;great&quot;/&gt; Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vQwwAAAAMAAJ |page=274 |title=The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1996 |isbn=978-0-88687-780-4 |last=Famighetti |first=Robert |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, will pass close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun as seen from Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, [[Comet Kohoutek]] in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/97561/new-sun-skirting-comet-could-provide-dazzling-display-in-2013/ |title=New 'Sun-Skirting' Comet Could Provide Dazzling Display in 2013 |work=Universe Today |accessdate=7 September 2013 |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comet West]], which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=C/1975 V1 (West) |url=http://cometography.com/lcomets/1975v1.html |work=Gary W.

The [[Great Comet of 1577]] is a well known example of a great comet. The Great Comet of 1577 passed near Earth as a [[List of near-parabolic comets|non-periodic comet]] and was seen by many, including well-known astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi ad-Din]]. Observations of this comet led to several significant findings regarding cometary science, especially for Brahe.

The late 20th century saw a lengthy gap without the appearance of any great comets, followed by the arrival of two in quick succession—[[Comet Hyakutake]] in 1996, followed by [[Hale–Bopp]], which reached maximum brightness in 1997 having been discovered two years earlier. The first great comet of the 21st century was [[C/2006 P1]] (McNaught), which became visible to naked eye observers in January 2007. It was the brightest in over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/comet_ison/blogs/great-moments-in-comet-history-comet-mcnaught |title=Great Moments in Comet History: Comet McNaught |publisher=Hubblesite |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sungrazing comets ===
{{Main|Sungrazing comet}}

A sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at perihelion, generally within a few million kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qU95h4yKia4C&amp;pg=PA34 |page=34 |title=Hunting and Imaging Comets |isbn=978-1-4419-6905-7 |last=Mobberley |first=Martin |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although small sungrazers can be completely evaporated during such a close approach to the [[Sun]], larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong [[tidal force]]s they experience often lead to their fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1966IrAJ....7..141O |title=Sun-Grazing Comets and Tidal Disruption |last=Opik |first=E. J. |volume=7 |date=1966 |pages=141 |journal=Irish Astronomical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90% of the sungrazers observed with [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] are members of the [[Kreutz sungrazer|Kreutz group]], which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the inner Solar System.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hahn |first=M.

The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to [[96P/Machholz|Comet 96P/Machholz]], which is also the parent of two [[meteor shower|meteor streams]], the [[Quadrantids]] and the [[Arietids]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohtsuka&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoshikawa |first=K. |last2=Nakano |first2=S. |last3=Yoshikawa |first3=M. |display-authors=1 |title=On the Association among Periodic Comet 96P/Machholz, Arietids, the Marsden Comet Group, and the Kracht Comet Group |url=http://pasj.asj.or.jp/v55/n1/550127/55012319.pdf |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=321–324 |date=2003 |doi=10.1093/pasj/55.1.321 |bibcode=2003PASJ...55..321O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observation ==

A comet may be discovered photographically using a wide-field [[telescope]] or visually with [[binoculars]]. However, even without access to optical equipment, it is still possible for the [[amateur astronomer]] to discover a sungrazing comet online by downloading images accumulated by some satellite observatories such as [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]].&lt;ref name=soho2&gt;{{cite web |last=Farmer |first=Steve E.

=== Lost ===
{{main|Lost comet}}

A number of periodic comets discovered in earlier decades or previous centuries are now [[lost comet]]s. Their orbits were never known well enough to predict future appearances or the comets have disintegrated. However, occasionally a &quot;new&quot; comet is discovered, and calculation of its orbit shows it to be an old &quot;lost&quot; comet. An example is Comet [[11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR]], discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter. It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by [[LINEAR]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;kronk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kronk |first=Gary W. |title=11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/011p.html |work=Gary W. Kronk's Cometography |accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 18 comets that fit this category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comethunter.de/lost.html |title=Lost periodic comets |work=The Catalogue of Comet Discoveries |last=Meyer |first=M. |date=2013 |accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of comets in [[popular culture]] is firmly rooted in the long Western tradition of seeing comets as harbingers of doom and as omens of world-altering change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JADiKdzkJqsC&amp;pg=PA27 |pages=27–29 |title=Science in Popular Culture: A Reference Guide |isbn=978-0-313-31822-1 |last1=Bowdoin Van Riper |first1=A |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halley's Comet alone has caused a slew of sensationalist publications of all sorts at each of its reappearances. It was especially noted that the birth and death of some notable persons coincided with separate appearances of the comet, such as with writers [[Mark Twain]] (who correctly speculated that he'd &quot;go out with the comet&quot; in 1910)&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot; /&gt; and [[Eudora Welty]], to whose life [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] dedicated the song &quot;[[Halley Came to Jackson]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot; /&gt;

In times past, bright comets often inspired panic and hysteria in the general population, being thought of as bad omens. More recently, during the passage of Halley's Comet in 1910, Earth passed through the comet's tail, and erroneous newspaper reports inspired a fear that [[cyanogen]] in the tail might poison millions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |title=Awaiting the Comet |work=A brief history of Halley's Comet |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/halley/halley11.htm |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the appearance of [[Comet Hale–Bopp]] in 1997 triggered the mass suicide of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=B. Drummond |last=Ayres Jr |title=Families Learning of 39 Cultists Who Died Willingly |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/29/us/families-learning-of-39-cultists-who-died-willingly.html |quote=According to material the group posted on its Internet site, the timing of the suicides were probably related to the arrival of the Hale–Bopp comet, which members seemed to regard as a cosmic emissary beckoning them to another world |work=New York Times |date=29 March 1997 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[science fiction]], the [[impact event|impact of comets]] has been depicted as a threat overcome by technology and heroism (as in the 1998 films ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' and ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''), or as a trigger of global apocalypse (''[[Lucifer's Hammer]]'', 1979) or zombies (''[[Night of the Comet]]'', 1984).&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Riper 29&quot; /&gt; In [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Off on a Comet]]'' a group of people are stranded on a comet orbiting the Sun, while a large manned space expedition visits Halley's Comet in Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-06-bk-26609-story.html |title=The View From Halley's Comet – 2061: Odyssey Three by Arthur C. Clarke |work=Los Angeles Times |last=Brin |first=David |date=6 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
