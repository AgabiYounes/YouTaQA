A '''cyanide''' is a [[chemical compound]] that contains the group C≡N. This group, known as the '''cyano group''', consists of a [[carbon]] atom [[triple-bond]]ed to a [[nitrogen]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01486.html ''cyanides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the anion CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  [[Salt (chemistry)|Salts]] such as [[sodium cyanide]] and [[potassium cyanide]] are highly toxic.&lt;ref name=&quot;CMC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php| title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide| publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute|year=2006| accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrocyanic acid]], also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially.  It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts.

[[Organic compound|Organic]] cyanides are usually called [[nitrile]]s. In nitriles, the CN group is linked by a [[covalent bond]] to carbon.  For example, in [[acetonitrile]], the cyanide group is bonded to [[methyl]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Because they do not release cyanide ions, nitriles are generally far less toxic than cyanide salts.  Some nitriles, which occur naturally as [[cyanohydrin]]s, release hydrogen cyanide.

{{see also|Isocyanide}}
In [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]], [[organic compound]]s that have a&amp;nbsp;–C≡N [[functional group]] are called [[nitrile]]s. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/N04151.html ''nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NCBI-MeSH [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009570 ''Nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a nitrile is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, [[acetonitrile]], also known as [[methyl]] cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called [[cyanohydrin]]. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release [[hydrogen cyanide]]. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion are referred to as '''cyanides'''. Although the cyanide ion contains a carbon atom, it is not usually considered organic.

The word is derived from the Greek ''kyanos'', meaning dark blue, as a result of its being first obtained by the heating of the pigment known as [[Prussian blue]].

==Bonding==
The cyanide ion is [[isoelectronic]] with [[carbon monoxide]] and with molecular [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, N. N.; &amp; Earnshaw, A. (1997).

==Occurrence and reactions==

===In nature===
[[File:Removal of cyanide poison from cassava.jpg|thumb|left|Removal of cyanide from [[cassava]] in [[Nigeria]].]]
Cyanides are produced by certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]] and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of [[bitter almond]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[peach]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=71&amp;tid=19 |title=ToxFAQs for Cyanide |accessdate=2008-06-28 |date = July 2006|publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical compounds that can release cyanide are known as cyanogenic compounds.  In plants, cyanides are usually bound to [[sugar]] molecules in the form of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s and defend the plant against [[herbivore]]s. [[Cassava]] roots (also called manioc), an important [[potato]]-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which [[tapioca]] is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J. |last=Vetter |title=Plant cyanogenic glycosides |journal=Toxicon |year=2000 |volume=38 |pages=11–36 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 |pmid=10669009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.

The [[Madagascar]] bamboo ''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]'' produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. In response, the [[golden bamboo lemur]], which eats the bamboo, has developed a high tolerance to cyanide.

===Interstellar medium===
The [[cyanide radical]] ·CN has been identified in [[interstellar space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pieniazek |first=Piotr A. |author2=Bradforth, Stephen E. |author3=Krylov, Anna I. |title=Spectroscopy of the Cyano Radical in an Aqueous Environment |date=2005-12-07 |pages=4854–65 |issue=14 |volume=110 |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~krylov/pubs/pdf/jpca-110-4854.pdf |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A |pmid=16599455 |format=PDF |doi=10.1021/jp0545952 |bibcode=2006JPCA..110.4854P |access-date=2008-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911131555/http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~krylov/pubs/pdf/jpca-110-4854.pdf |archive-date=2008-09-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyanide radical (called [[cyanogen]]) is used to measure the temperature of [[Molecular cloud|interstellar gas clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Interstellar Cyanogen and the Temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |author1=Roth, K.

===Pyrolysis and combustion product===
Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or [[pyrolysis]] of certain materials under [[oxygen deficient environment|oxygen-deficient condition]]s. For example, it can be detected in the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[tobacco]] smoke. Certain [[plastic]]s, especially those derived from [[acrylonitrile]], release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt;

===Coordination chemistry===
{{main|Cyanometalate}}
The cyanide anion is a [[ligand]] for many [[transition metals]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, A. G. The Chemistry of Cyano Complexes of the Transition Metals; Academic Press: London, 1976{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high affinities of metals for this [[anion]] can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include:
*hexacyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape.  
*tetracyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;
*dicyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.

Among the most important cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds [[potassium ferrocyanide]] and the pigment [[Prussian blue]], which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.&lt;ref name=Holl&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-12-352651-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prussian blue was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to [[blueprints]], [[bluing (fabric)|bluing]], and [[cyanotype]]s.

The [[enzymes]] called [[hydrogenase]]s contain cyanide [[ligand]]s attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases proceeds from [[carbamoyl phosphate]], which converts to [[cystein]]yl [[thiocyanate]], the CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reissmann |first1=Stefanie |last2=Hochleitner |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Wang |first3=Haofan |last4=Paschos |first4=Athanasios |last5=Lottspeich |first5=Friedrich |last6=Glass |first6=Richard S. |last7=Böck |first7=August |title=Taming of a Poison: Biosynthesis of the NiFe-Hydrogenase Cyanide Ligands |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5609 |pages=1067–70 |year=2003 |pmid=12586941 |doi=10.1126/science.1080972 |bibcode=2003Sci...299.1067R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Nitriles}}
Because of the cyanide anion's high [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]], cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a [[halide]] group (e.g., the [[chloride]] on [[methyl chloride]]). In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN can be called methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as [[acetonitrile]]. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 [[synthon]]; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be [[wiktionary:functionalize|functionalized]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
:RX + CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → RCN + X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nucleophilic substitution]]) followed by
# RCN + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrolysis]] under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or
# 2 RCN + [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + (second step) 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[amine|2 RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + LiAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (under [[reflux]] in dry [[diethyl ether|ether]], followed by addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)

==Manufacture==
{{main|Hydrogen cyanide#Production and synthesis}}
The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the [[Andrussow process]] in which gaseous [[hydrogen cyanide]] is produced from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Sodium cyanide is produced by treating [[hydrogen cyanide]] with [[sodium hydroxide]]&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;
:HCN  +  NaOH   →   NaCN  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Cyanide poisoning}}
Many cyanides are highly toxic. The cyanide anion is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (also known as aa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the fourth complex of the [[electron transport chain]] (found in the membrane of the [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from [[cytochrome c]] to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=David L.|last2=Cox|first2=Michael M.|title=Lehniger Principles of Biochemistry|publisher=[[Worth Publishers]]|year=2000|location=New York|edition=3rd|isbn=978-1-57259-153-0|pages=668,670–71,676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissues that depend highly on [[aerobic respiration]], such as the [[central nervous system]] and the [[heart]], are particularly affected. This is an example of [[histotoxic hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=Biller&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most hazardous compound is [[hydrogen cyanide]], which is a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts about cyanide:Where cyanide is found and how it is used|last=Anon|date=June 27, 2013|work=CDC Emergency preparedness and response|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen cyanide is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a cyanide salt. Alkaline solutions of cyanide are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of [[polyurethane]]s; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution as little as 200&amp;nbsp;mg, or exposure to airborne cyanide of 270 [[parts per million|ppm]], is sufficient to cause death within minutes.&lt;ref name=Biller/&gt;

Organic [[nitrile]]s do not readily release cyanide ions, and so have low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyanide |url=https://www.chemeurope.com/en/encyclopedia/Cyanide.html |website=Chemeurope.com |accessdate=11 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antidote===
[[Hydroxocobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be safely eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|814287|Cyanide Toxicity|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: [[amyl nitrite]] pearls (administered by inhalation), [[sodium nitrite]], and [[sodium thiosulfate]]. The goal of the antidote was to generate a large pool of [[ferric]] iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The [[nitrite]]s [[oxidize]] [[hemoglobin]] to [[methemoglobin]], which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the [[cytochrome oxidase]] enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to [[thiocyanate]] by the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]]. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for [[rhodanese]], needed in order to produce thiocyanate.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhary, M.; Gupta, R. &quot;Cyanide Detoxifying Enzyme: Rhodanese&quot; Current Biotechnology, 2012, vol. 1, pp. 327-335. {{DOI|10.2174/2211550111201040327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, [[asthma]], or [[bronchitis]]. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates.&lt;ref&gt;Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Mining===
{{Main|Gold cyanidation}}
Cyanide is mainly produced for the [[mining]] of [[gold]] and [[silver]]: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores. In the ''[[cyanide process]]'', finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Rubo |first2=Raf |last2=Kellens |first3=Jay |last3=Reddy |first4=Norbert |last4=Steier |first5=Wolfgang |last5=Hasenpusch |chapter=Alkali metal cyanides |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/14356007.i01_i01|isbn=978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::4 Au + 8 NaCN + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 Na[Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + 4 NaOH

Silver is less [[Noble metal|&quot;noble&quot;]] than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
::Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 NaCN + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + NaSH + NaOH
The &quot;pregnant liquor&quot; containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a [[tailing pond]] or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed. The metal is recovered from the &quot;pregnant solution&quot; by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems. A number of [[List of gold mining disasters|environmental disasters]] have followed the overflow of tailing ponds at gold mines. Cyanide contamination of waterways has resulting in numerous cases of human and aquatic species mortality.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Cyanide is also used in [[electroplating]], where it stabilizes metal ions in the electrolyte solution prior to their deposition.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Industrial organic chemistry===
Some nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., [[adiponitrile]] is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:
RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCN → RCH(CN)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |date=August 1916 |title=THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY WITH CYANOCUPROL |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207–211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal fishing and poaching===
{{Main|Cyanide fishing}}
Cyanides are illegally used to capture live fish near [[coral reef]]s for the [[aquarium]] and seafood markets. The practice is controversial, dangerous, and damaging but is driven by the lucrative exotic fish market.&lt;ref name=&quot;crc&quot;&gt;Dzombak, David A; Ghosh, Rajat S; Wong-Chong, George M. ''Cyanide in Water and Soil''. [[CRC Press]], 2006, Chapter 11.2: &quot;Use of Cyanide for Capturing Live Reef Fish&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poachers in Africa have been known to use cyanide to poison waterholes, to kill elephants for their ivory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-25/zimbabwe-poachers-kill-80-elephants-with-cyanide/4981372 Poachers kill 80 elephants with cyanide in Zimbabwe] ''ABC News'', 25 September 2013.

===Niche uses===
[[Potassium ferrocyanide]] is used to achieve a blue color on cast [[bronze sculpture]]s during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

Cyanide is also used in [[jewelry]]-making and certain kinds of [[photography]] such as [[sepia toning]].

Cyanides are used as [[insecticide]]s for fumigating ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SODIUM CYANIDE|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium_cyanide|website=PubChem|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=2 September 2016|date=2016|quote=Cyanide and hydrogen cyanide are used in electroplating, metallurgy, organic chemicals production, photographic developing, manufacture of plastics, fumigation of ships, and some mining processes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanide salts are used for killing ants,&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAReg1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Sodium Cyanide|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/3086.pdf|website=EPA.gov|accessdate=2 September 2016|page=7|date=1 September 1994|quote=Sodium cyanide was initially registered as a pesticide on December 23, 1947, to control ants on uncultivated agricultural and non-agricultural areas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have in some places been used as rat poison&lt;ref name=&quot;TariffInfo1921&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Tariff Information, 1921: Hearings on General Tariff Revision Before the Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives|url=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?tn=Tariff+Information,+1921|website=AbeBooks.com|publisher=US Congress, House Committee on Ways and Means, US Government Printing Office|accessdate=2 September 2016|page=3987|date=1921|quote=Another field in which cyanide is used in growing quantity is the eradication of rats and other vermin--especially in the fight against typhus.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the less toxic poison [[arsenic]] is more common).&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetDeadly2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadliest Poisons Used by Man|url=http://www.planetdeadly.com/human/deadliest-poisons-man|website=PlanetDeadly.com|accessdate=2 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511033535/http://www.planetdeadly.com/human/deadliest-poisons-man|archivedate=11 May 2016|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most significantly, hydrogen cyanide released from pellets of [[Zyklon-B]] was used extensively in the systematic mass murders of [[the Holocaust]], especially in [[extermination camp]]s. Poisoning by hydrogen cyanide gas within a [[gas chamber]] (as a salt of hydrocyanic acid is dropped into a strong acid, usually sulfuric acid) is one method of [[capital punishment|executing a condemned prisoner]] as the condemned prisoner eventually breathes the lethal fumes.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==

===Prussian blue===
[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the [[sodium fusion test]]. The resulting mixture is acidified with [[mineral acid]]. The formation of [[Prussian blue]] is a positive result for cyanide.

===''para''-Benzoquinone in DMSO===
A solution of [[1,4-Benzoquinone|''para''-benzoquinone]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] reacts with inorganic cyanide to form a cyano[[phenol]], which is [[fluorescent]]. Illumination with a [[UV light]] gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(80)90225-2 |pmid = 7423496 |title = Fluorometric determination of cyanide in biological fluids with p-benzoquinone*1 |first4 = JL |last4 = Way |first3 = RL |last3 = Morgan |first2 = GE |year = 1980 |last2 = Isom |last1 = Ganjeloo |first1 = A |journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] |volume = 55 |issue = 1 |pages = 103–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper and an aromatic amine===
As used by [[fumigation|fumigators]] to detect [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[copper]](II) salt and an aromatic amine such as [[benzidine]] is added to the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-''bis''-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.

===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===
A sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis—Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Corrinoids colorimetry===

A solution of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as [[cobalamin]] or [[cobinamide]], reacts with free cyanide in an aqueous sample. The binding of cyanide to the corrinoid cobalt center leads to a color change from orange to violet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inorganic Chemistry of Vitamin B12|last=Pratt|first=J.M.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|page=44|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for semi-quantification by naked-eye. Precise quantification of the cyanide content is feasible by [[UV-vis spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelder|first=F.H.|year=2008|title=Specific Colorimetric Detection of Cyanide Triggered by a Conformational Switch in Vitamin B12 |url= |journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=47|issue=4|pages=1264–1266|via=|doi=10.1021/ic702368b|pmid=18205304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|year=2009|title=Side chains of cobalt corrinoids control the sensitivity and selectivity in the colorimetric detection of cyanide|url=|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=48|issue=4|pages=1272–1274|via=|doi=10.1021/ic900053h|pmid=19161297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption of the corrinoid on a solid phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|year=2012|title=Complex samples cyanide detection with immobilized corrinoids |url= |journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=4|issue=2|pages=725–729|via=|doi=10.1021/am201357u|pmid=22211318}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows detection of cyanide even in colored samples, rendering this method appropriate for the analysis of cyanide in water, wastewater, blood, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tivana, Da Cruz Francisco, Zelder, Bergenståhl, Dejmek |year=2014 |title=Straightforward rapid spectrophotometric quantification of total cyanogenic glycosides in fresh and processed cassava products|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/106811/1/1-s2.0-S0308814614002519-main.pdf|journal=Food Chemistry |volume=158 |pages=20–27|via= |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.066|pmid= 24731309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|year=2012|title=Rapid visual detection of blood cyanide |url= http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/75059/1/c2ay25595b.pdf|journal=Analytical Methods |volume=4|issue=9|pages=2632–2634|via= |doi=10.1039/c2ay25595b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this technology is non-toxic and considerably less prone to interference than the pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry method.

===Gas diffusion flow injection analysis—amperometry===
Instead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost-effective since time-consuming distillations are not required.
