In chemistry, a '''carbonate''' is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carbonates}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by the presence of the '''carbonate ion''', a [[polyatomic ion]] with the formula of {{chem|CO|3|2-}}. The name may also refer to a [[carbonate ester]], an organic compound containing the '''carbonate [[functional group|group]]''' C(=O)(O–)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The term is also used as a verb, to describe [[carbonation]]: the process of raising the concentrations of carbonate and [[bicarbonate]] ions in water to produce [[carbonated water]] and other carbonated beverages{{snd}}either by the addition of [[carbon dioxide]] gas under pressure, or by dissolving carbonate or bicarbonate salts into the water.

In [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]], the term &quot;carbonate&quot; can refer both to [[carbonate minerals]] and [[carbonate rock]] (which is made of chiefly carbonate minerals), and both are dominated by the carbonate ion, {{chem|CO|3|2-}}. Carbonate minerals are extremely varied and ubiquitous in chemically precipitated [[sedimentary rock]]. The most common are [[calcite]] or [[calcium carbonate]], CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the chief constituent of [[limestone]] (as well as the main component of [[mollusc]] shells and [[coral]] skeletons); [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], a calcium-magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and [[siderite]], or [[iron]](II) carbonate, FeCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, an important [[iron ore]]. [[Sodium carbonate]] (&quot;soda&quot; or &quot;natron&quot;) and [[potassium carbonate]] (&quot;potash&quot;) have been used since antiquity for cleaning and preservation, as well as for the manufacture of [[glass]]. Carbonates are widely used in industry, e.g. in iron smelting, as a raw material for [[Portland cement]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] manufacture, in the composition of [[ceramic glaze]]s, and more.

==Structure and bonding==

The carbonate ion is the simplest [[oxocarbon anion]]. It consists of one [[carbon]] atom surrounded by three [[oxygen]] atoms, in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with ''D''&lt;sub&gt;3h&lt;/sub&gt; [[Molecular symmetry#Point Group|molecular symmetry]]. It has a molecular mass of 60.01&amp;nbsp;[[Molar mass|g/mol]] and carries a total [[formal charge]] of −2. It is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of the [[bicarbonate|hydrogen carbonate (bicarbonate)]] ion, {{chem|HCO|3|−}}, which is the conjugate base of {{chem|H|2|CO|3}}, [[carbonic acid]].

The [[Lewis structure]] of the carbonate ion has two (long) single bonds to negative oxygen atoms, and one short double bond to a neutral oxygen.

[[File:Carbonate-ion-localised-2D.png|100px|Simple, localised Lewis structure of the carbonate ion]]

This structure is incompatible with the observed symmetry of the ion, which implies that the three bonds are equally long and that the three oxygen atoms are equivalent. As in the case of the [[isoelectronic]] [[nitrate]] ion, the symmetry can be achieved by a [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] among three structures:

[[File:Carbonate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px|Resonance structures of the carbonate ion]]

This resonance can be summarized by a model with fractional bonds and [[delocalization|delocalized]] charges:

[[File:Carbonate-ion-delocalised-partial-charges-2D.png|120px|Delocalisation and partial charges on the carbonate ion]] [[File:Carbonate-3D-vdW.png|80px|Space-filling model of the carbonate ion]]

==Chemical properties==
Metal carbonates generally decompose on heating, liberating carbon dioxide from the long term [[carbon cycle]] to the short term carbon cycle and leaving behind an oxide of the metal.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This process is called [[calcination]], after ''calx'', the Latin name of quicklime or [[calcium oxide]], CaO, which is obtained by roasting limestone in a [[lime kiln]].

A carbonate salt forms when a positively charged ion, {{chem|M|+}}, {{chem|M|2+}}, or {{chem|M|3+}}, associates with the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion by forming [[Electrostatics|electrostatic attractions]] with them, forming an ionic [[chemical compound|compound]]:

:2 {{chem|M|+}} + {{chem|CO|3|2-}} → {{chem|M|2|CO|3}}

:{{chem|M|2+}} + {{chem|CO|3|2−}} → {{chem|MCO|3}}

:2 {{chem|M|3+}} + 3 {{chem|CO|3|2-}} → {{chem|M|2|(CO|3|)|3}}

Most carbonate salts are [[solubility|insoluble]] in [[water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]], with [[solubility constant]]s of less than 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. Exceptions include [[lithium carbonate|lithium]], [[sodium carbonate|sodium]], [[potassium carbonate|potassium]] and [[ammonium carbonate|ammonium]] carbonates, as well as many [[uranium carbonate]]s.

In [[aqueous solution]], carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid exist together in a [[chemical equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]]. In strongly basic conditions, the carbonate ion predominates, while in weakly basic conditions, the [[bicarbonate]] ion is prevalent. In more acid conditions, aqueous [[carbon dioxide]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq), is the main form, which, with water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is in equilibrium with carbonic acid{{snd}}the equilibrium lies strongly towards carbon dioxide. Thus [[sodium carbonate]] is basic, [[sodium bicarbonate]] is weakly basic, while carbon dioxide itself is a weak acid.

[[Carbonated water]] is formed by dissolving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water under pressure. When the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced, for example when a can of soda is opened, the equilibrium for each of the forms of carbonate (carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and carbonic acid) shifts until the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the solution is equal to the solubility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at that temperature and pressure. In living systems an enzyme, [[carbonic anhydrase]], speeds the interconversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and carbonic acid.

Although the carbonate salts of most metals are insoluble in water, the same is not true of the bicarbonate salts. In solution this equilibrium between carbonate, bicarbonate, carbon dioxide and carbonic acid changes constantly to the changing temperature and pressure conditions. In the case of metal ions with insoluble carbonates, e.g. CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, formation of insoluble compounds results. This is an explanation for the buildup of scale inside pipes caused by [[hard water]].

==Carbonate in the Inorganic nomenclature==
Systematic additive IUPAC name for carbonate anion is trioxidocarbonate(2−).&lt;ref name=&quot;redbook&quot; /&gt;{{rp|127}} Similarly, [[cyanide]] anion CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is named nitridocarbonate(1−).&lt;ref name=&quot;redbook&quot; /&gt;{{rp|291}} Following this logic, e.g. carbonate(4−) in the systematic additive nomenclature would mean [[carbide]] anion, but it is not the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;redbook&quot; /&gt;{{rp|287}}

==Organic carbonates==
{{main|Carbonate ester}}
In [[organic chemistry]] a carbonate can also refer to a [[functional group]] within a larger molecule that contains a carbon atom bound to three oxygen atoms, one of which is double bonded. These compounds are also known as organocarbonates or carbonate esters, and have the general formula ROCOOR′, or RR′CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Important organocarbonates include [[dimethyl carbonate]], the cyclic compounds [[ethylene carbonate]] and [[propylene carbonate]], and the phosgene replacement, [[triphosgene]].

==Buffer==
It works as a [[buffer solution|buffer]] in the blood as follows: when pH is low, the concentration of hydrogen ions is too high, so one exhales CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This will cause the equation to shift left,{{explain|date=January 2018}} essentially decreasing the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, causing a more basic pH.

When pH is too high, the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood is too low, so the kidneys excrete bicarbonate ({{chem|HCO|3|−}}). This causes the equation to shift right, essentially increasing the concentration of hydrogen ions, causing a more acidic pH.

Three important reversible reactions control the above pH balance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/BioBuff/BioBuffers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721174437/http://www.scifun.org/chemweek/BioBuff/BioBuffers.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +  {{chem|HCO|3|−}}

# H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

# CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) {{eqm}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

Exhaled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) depletes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq), which in turn consumes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, causing the aforementioned shift left in the first reaction by [[Le Châtelier's principle]]. By the same principle, when the pH is too high, the kidneys excrete bicarbonate ({{chem|HCO|3|−}}) into urine as urea via the [[urea cycle]] (or Krebs–Henseleit ornithine cycle). By removing the bicarbonate, more H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is generated from carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which comes from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) produced by [[cellular respiration]].

Crucially, this same buffer operates in the oceans. It is a major factor in climate change and the long-term carbon cycle, due to the large number of marine organisms (especially coral) which are formed of calcium carbonate. Increased solubility of carbonate through increased temperatures results in lower production of marine [[calcite]] and increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This, in turn, increases Earth temperature. The tonnage of {{chem|CO|3|2−}} is on a geological scale and may all be redissolved into the sea and released to the atmosphere, increasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels even more.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Presence outside Earth==
It is generally thought that the presence of carbonates in [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is strong evidence for the presence of liquid water. Recent observations of the [[planetary nebula]] [[NGC 6302]] show evidence for carbonates in space,&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, F., Molster, F.J., Jager, C. and Waters, L.B.F.M. (2001) The mineral composition and spatial distribution of the dust ejecta of NGC 6302. ''Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics'' '''394''', 679–690.&lt;/ref&gt; where aqueous alteration similar to that on Earth is unlikely. Other minerals have been proposed which would fit the observations.

Until recently [[Carbonates on Mars|carbonate deposits]] have not been found on Mars via remote sensing or in situ missions, even though Martian meteorites contain small amounts.
