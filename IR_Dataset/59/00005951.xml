===Establishment===
Cleveland was established on July 22, 1796 by surveyors of the [[Connecticut Land Company]] when they laid out [[Connecticut]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] into townships and a capital city. They named the new settlement &quot;Cleaveland&quot; after their leader, General [[Moses Cleaveland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;moses&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/cleaveland-moses | title=Cleaveland, Moses |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate=August 21, 2019| date=January 20, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaveland oversaw the [[New England]]-style design of the plan for what would become the modern downtown area, centered on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]], before returning home, never again to visit Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;moses&quot; /&gt; The first permanent settler in Cleaveland was [[Lorenzo Carter]], who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabin&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Lorenzo Carter Cabin | work =Cleveland Historical | url =https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/286 | accessdate =August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23, 1814.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ech.case.edu/timeline.html | title=Cleveland: A Bicentennial Timeline |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]]|accessdate=August 5, 2019| date=May 31, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters, the town's waterfront location proved to be an advantage, giving it access to Great Lakes trade. It grew rapidly after the 1832 completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. This key link between the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] connected it to the Atlantic Ocean via the [[Erie Canal]] and Hudson River, and later via the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]. Its products could reach markets on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]. The town's growth continued with added railroad links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/o/ohio-and-erie-canal | title=Ohio and Erie Canal |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate=August 5, 2019| date=February 7, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, the spelling of the town's name was altered by ''The Cleveland Advertiser'' newspaper. In order to fit the name on the newspaper's [[Nameplate (publishing)|masthead]], the editors dropped the first &quot;a&quot;, reducing the city's name to ''Cleveland'', which eventually became the official spelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourne|first1=Henry E.|title=The Story of Cleveland|journal=New England Magazine|date=1896|volume=14|issue=6|page=744|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Og7AQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Cleveland%20Advertiser%22%201831%20spelling&amp;pg=PA744#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=It was agreeable to the wishes of many of our oldest and most intelligent citizens, who are of the opinion that the 'a' is superfluous.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, Cleveland was officially incorporated as a city.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;  That same year, Cleveland, then only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring [[Ohio City (Cuyahoga County), Ohio|Ohio City]] over a bridge connecting the two communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/columbus-street-bridge | title=Columbus Street Bridge | encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] | accessdate=July 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexation]] by Cleveland in 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

===Growth and expansion===
[[File:Cleveland 1877.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Bird's-eye view]] of Cleveland in 1877.]]
Cleveland witnessed rapid growth after the [[Cleveland in the American Civil War|American Civil War]].  The city's prime geographic location as a transportation hub between the East Coast and the Midwest played an important role in its development as a commercial center. Cleveland served as a destination for iron ore shipped from [[Minnesota]], along with coal transported by rail. In 1870, [[John D. Rockefeller]] founded [[Standard Oil]] in Cleveland. In 1885, he moved its headquarters to [[New York City]], which had become a center of finance and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html | title=Rockefellers Timeline | accessdate=July 7, 2010 | date=1999–2000 | publisher=PBS | quote=1870 Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1&amp;nbsp;million in capital, the largest corporation in the country. The new company controls 10% of U.S. petroleum refining. 1885 Standard Oil Standard Oil moves into new headquarters at 26 Broadway in New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, Cleveland had emerged as a major American manufacturing center. Its businesses included automotive companies such as [[Peerless]], People's, [[Jordan Motor Car Company|Jordan]], [[Chandler Motor Car|Chandler]], and [[Winton Motor Carriage Company|Winton]], maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers in Cleveland produced [[steam car|steam-powered]] cars, which included [[White Motor Company|White]] and [[Gaeth]], as well as the [[electric car]] company [[Baker Motor Vehicle|Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, Floyd.

Known as the &quot;Sixth City&quot; due to its position as the sixth largest U.S. city at the time, Cleveland counted major [[Progressive Era]] politicians among its leaders, most prominently the [[Populism|populist]] Mayor [[Tom L.

Cleveland's downtown architecture is diverse. Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the [[Cuyahoga County Courthouse]], the [[Cleveland Public Library]], and [[Public Auditorium]], are clustered around the open [[The Mall (Cleveland)|Cleveland Mall]] and share a common [[neoclassical architecture]]. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan. They constitute one of the most complete examples of [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] design in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Michael |title=Make No Little Plans |year=1980 |pages=20–25 |publisher=[[Western Reserve Historical Society]] |location=Cleveland |isbn=0-911704-24-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mall|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/m/mall|encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 21, 2019|date= May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Terminal Tower]], dedicated in 1930, was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;terminal-tower&quot; /&gt; It is a prototypical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[skyscraper]]. The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square, [[Key Tower]] (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the [[200 Public Square]], combine elements of [[Art Deco]] architecture with [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] designs. Cleveland's architectural treasures also include the [[Cleveland Trust Company Building]], completed in 1907 and renovated in 2015 as a downtown [[Heinen's Fine Foods|Heinen's]] [[supermarket]], and the [[Cleveland Arcade]] (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a [[Hyatt]] Regency Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toledo|first=Charlotte Nicole|last2=Roy|first2=Chris|title =Cleveland Trust Company Building| work =Cleveland Historical | url =https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/761 | accessdate =August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Our Cleveland Landmark|url=https://www.theclevelandarcade.com/history-of-the-arcade.htm|publisher=The Arcade|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raponi|first=Richard|last2=Rotman|first2=Michael|title =The Arcade| work =Cleveland Historical | url =https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/24 | accessdate =August 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running east from Public Square through University Circle is [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)|Euclid Avenue]], which was known for its prestige and elegance as a residential street. In the late 1880s, writer [[Bayard Taylor]] described it as &quot;the most beautiful street in the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Upton |first=Harriet Taylor |title=History of the Western Reserve |url=https://archive.org/details/historywesternr01cutlgoog |publisher= The Lewis Publishing Company |year=1910 |page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as &quot;Millionaires' Row&quot;, Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such major figures as [[John D.

[[File:Cleveland Skyline (34826840941).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Downtown Cleveland from Edgewater Park.]]
Known locally as the &quot;Emerald Necklace&quot;, the [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted]]-inspired Cleveland Metroparks encircle Cleveland and Cuyahoga County. The city proper is home to the Metroparks' Brookside and Lakefront Reservations, as well as significant parts of the Rocky River, Washington, and Euclid Creek Reservations. The Lakefront Reservation, which provides public access to Lake Erie, consists of four parks: Edgewater Park, [[Whiskey Island (Cleveland)|Whiskey Island–Wendy Park]], East 55th Street Marina, and [[Gordon Park, Cleveland|Gordon Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Lakefront Reservation| publisher=Cleveland Metroparks | url =https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/visit/parks/lakefront-reservation| accessdate =August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three more parks fall under the jurisdiction of the Euclid Creek Reservation: Euclid Beach, Villa Angela, and Wildwood Marina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Euclid Creek Reservation| publisher=Cleveland Metroparks | url =https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/visit/parks/euclid-creek-reservation| accessdate =August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bike and hiking trails in the [[Brecksville Reservation|Brecksville]] and Bedford Reservations, along with Garfield Park further north, provide access to trails in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The extensive system of trails within [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]] extends south into [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]], offering access to [[Summit Metro Parks]] as well. Also included in the system is the renowned [[Cleveland Metroparks Zoo]], established in 1882. Located in Big Creek valley, the zoo has one of the largest collection of [[primate]]s in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Cleveland Metroparks Zoo| publisher=Destination Cleveland | url =https://www.thisiscleveland.com/things-to-do/major-attractions/cleveland-metroparks-zoo| accessdate =August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cleveland Metroparks provides ample opportunity for outdoor recreational activities. Hiking and biking trails, including single track mountain bike trails, wind extensively throughout the parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/visit/activities/event-activity-types/mountain-biking|title=Cleveland Metroparks - Mountain Biking|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock climbing is available at Whipp’s Ledges at the Hinckley Reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks/recreation/contact-our-recreation-staff/rock-climbing-permit|title=Cleveland Metroparks - Rock Climbing|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer months, kayakers, paddle boarders, and rowing and sailing crews can be seen on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. In the winter months, downhill skiing, snowboarding, and tubing are available not far from downtown at the [[Boston Mills/Brandywine Ski Resort|Boston Mills, Brandywine]] and [[Alpine Valley Ski Area|Alpine Valley]] Ski resorts.

In addition to the Metroparks, Cleveland Public Parks District oversees the city's neighborhood parks, the largest of which is the historic [[Rockefeller Park]], notable for its late 19th century landmark bridges, Rockefeller Park Greenhouse, and [[Cleveland Cultural Gardens]], which celebrate the city's ethnic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rockefeller Park|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/r/rockefeller-park|encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;culturalgardens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleveland Cultural Gardens|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/cleveland-cultural-gardens|encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just outside of Rockefeller Park, the [[Cleveland Botanical Garden]] in University Circle, established in 1930, is the oldest civic garden center in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cleveland Botanical Garden|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/c/cleveland-botanical-garden|encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the historic FirstEnergy Powerhouse in the [[The Flats|Flats]], the [[Greater Cleveland Aquarium]] is the only independent, free-standing aquarium in the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Ondrey |url=http://www.cleveland.com/travel/index.ssf/2012/05/underwater_wonders_among_the_n.html |title=Underwater wonders among the newcomers in Northeast Ohio |publisher=The Plain Dealer |date=May 19, 2012 |accessdate=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighborhoods===
[[Downtown Cleveland]] is centered on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] and includes a wide range of districts. It contains the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the [[Cleveland Theater District]], which is home to [[Playhouse Square Center]]. Downtown also historically included the lively Short Vincent entertainment district, which emerged in the 1920s and reached its height in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;short-vincent-enc&quot; /&gt; Today the former Short Vincent forms part of the Financial District.&lt;ref name=&quot;short-vincent-hst&quot; /&gt; Mixed-use neighborhoods, such as the [[The Flats|Flats]] and the [[Warehouse District, Cleveland|Warehouse District]], are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units, in the form of [[condominium]]s, [[loft apartment|lofts]], and apartments, has been on the increase since 2000 and especially 2010. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the [[HealthLine|Euclid Corridor Project]], and the developments along East 4th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Litt |title=RTA's Euclid Avenue HealthLine is faring well in ridership, innovation |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/architecture/2009/11/rtas_euclid_avenue_healthline.html |publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=November 29, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/Clevelands-Signs-of-Renewal.html|title=Cleveland's Signs of Renewal|last=Michener|first=Charles|date=April 2011|magazine=Smithsonian|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clevelanders geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the [[Cuyahoga River]]. The East Side includes the neighborhoods of [[Buckeye–Shaker]], [[Central, Cleveland|Central]], [[Collinwood]], Corlett, Euclid–Green, [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]], Forest Hills, [[Glenville, Cleveland|Glenville]], [[Goodrich–Kirtland Park]] (with [[Asiatown, Cleveland|Asiatown]]), [[Hough, Cleveland|Hough]], [[Kinsman, Cleveland|Kinsman]], [[Lee–Miles]], Mount Pleasant, [[Nottingham, Ohio|Nottingham]], [[St. Clair–Superior|St. Clair-Superior]], [[Union–Miles Park]], [[University Circle]] (with [[University Circle#Little Italy|Little Italy]]), and [[Woodland Hills, Cleveland|Woodland Hills]]. The West Side includes the neighborhoods of [[Brooklyn Centre]], [[Clark–Fulton]], [[Detroit–Shoreway]], Cudell, [[Edgewater, Cleveland|Edgewater]], [[Ohio City, Cleveland|Ohio City]], [[Tremont, Cleveland|Tremont]], [[Old Brooklyn]], [[Stockyards, Cleveland|Stockyards]], West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as [[West Park, Cleveland|West Park]]: [[Kamm's Corners]], Jefferson, [[Bellaire–Puritas, Cleveland|Puritas–Longmead]], and Riverside. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the South Side: [[Industrial Valley]], [[Broadway–Slavic Village]], and Tremont.

Several neighborhoods have begun to attract the return of the middle class that left the city for the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods are on both the West Side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the East Side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy). Much of the growth has been spurred on by attracting [[creative class]] members, which in turn is spurring new residential development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Maureen |last2=Leonard |first2=Paul |url=http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/gentrification/gentrificationexsum.htm |title=Dealing with Neighborhood Change: A Primer on Gentrification and Policy Choices |accessdate=2006-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009155119/http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/gentrification/gentrificationexsum.htm |archivedate=October 9, 2007 |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A live-work [[zoning]] overlay for the city's near East Side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Michael |url=http://www.freetimes.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=471 |title=Can the Creative Class Save Cleveland? |accessdate=2006-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040918065510/http://www.freetimes.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=471 |archivedate=September 18, 2004 |work=[[Free Times]] |date=October 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Downtown Cleveland - Cleveland Sunrise (47288342872).jpg|thumb|Cleveland and [[Lake Erie]] in winter.]]
Typical of the Great Lakes region, Cleveland exhibits a [[continental climate]] with four distinct seasons, which lies in the [[humid continental]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kottek |first=Marcus |last2=Greiser |first2=Jürgen |last3=Beck |first3=Christoph |last4=Rudolf |first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel |first5=Franz |display-authors=2 |title=World Map of Köppen&amp;nbsp;– Geiger Climate Classification |date=June 2006 |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=15 |issue=3 |page=261 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; zone. Summers are warm and humid while winters are cold and snowy. The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east–west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]], but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the [[lake effect snow]] that is typical in Cleveland (especially on the city's East Side) from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city: while Hopkins Airport, on the city's far West Side, has only reached {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} of snowfall in a season three times since record-keeping for snow began in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/cle/climate/cle/records/cletop10snow.html Cleveland Snowfalle (sic) Statistics.] [[National Weather Service]]. Retrieved on October 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; seasonal totals approaching or exceeding {{convert|100|in|cm|0}} are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east, where the region known as the '[[Snowbelt|Snow Belt]]' begins. Extending from the city's East Side and its suburbs, the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Mark |url = http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio's-snow-belt |title=Where is Northern Ohio's Snow Belt? |website=NewsNet5.com |accessdate=January 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130922040750/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/weather/weather_news/where-is-northern-ohio%27s-snow-belt |archive-date=September 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feast of the Assumption in Little Italy Cleveland (36388057482).jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Cleveland Feast of the Assumption Festival|Feast of the Assumption]] in Little Italy.]]
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Cleveland saw a massive influx of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] from [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Ireland]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[German Empire|German]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], and [[Ottoman Empire]]s, most of whom were attracted by manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;immigration&quot; /&gt; As a result, Cleveland and Cuyahoga County today have substantial communities of [[Irish Americans|Irish]] (especially in [[West Park, Cleveland|West Park]]), [[Italian Americans|Italians]] (especially in [[University Circle#Little Italy|Little Italy]] and around Mayfield Road), [[German Americans|Germans]], and several [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[Eastern Europe]]an ethnicities, including [[Czech American|Czechs]], [[Hungarian Ohioans|Hungarians]], [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanians]], [[Polish Americans|Poles]], [[Romanian American|Romanians]], [[Russian Americans|Russians]], [[Rusyn Americans|Rusyns]], [[Slovak American|Slovaks]], [[Ukrainian American|Ukrainians]], and ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] groups, such as [[Slovene Americans|Slovenes]], [[Croatian American|Croats]], and [[Serbian American|Serbs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;immigration&quot; /&gt; The presence of Hungarians within Cleveland proper was, at one time, so great that the city boasted the highest concentration of Hungarians in the world outside of [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hungarians|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/h/hungarians |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= July 8, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland has a long-established [[Jews and Judaism in Greater Cleveland|Jewish community]], historically centered on the East Side neighborhoods of [[Glenville, Cleveland|Glenville]] and [[Kinsman, Cleveland|Kinsman]], but now mostly concentrated in East Side suburbs such as [[Beachwood, Ohio|Beachwood]], home to the [[Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jews &amp; Judaism |url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/j/jews-judaism |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= July 2, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of jobs also attracted African Americans from the South. Between 1920 and 1970, the black population of Cleveland, largely concentrated on the city's East Side, increased significantly as a result of the [[Great Migration (African American)|First]] and [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migrations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;african-americans&quot; /&gt; Cleveland's Latino community consists primarily of [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]], while the city's Asian community, centered on historical [[Asiatown, Cleveland|Asiatown]], consists of [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]], [[Korean Americans|Koreans]], [[Vietnamese Americans|Vietnamese]], and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hispanic Community |url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/h/hispanic-community |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= July 2, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asiatown |url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/a/asiatown |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= July 2, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the city and the county have significant communities of [[Arab American|Arabs]], [[Armenian Americans|Armenians]], [[French American|French]], [[Greek American|Greeks]], [[Scottish Americans|Scots]], [[Turkish Americans|Turks]], and [[West Indian American|West Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arab-Americans|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/a/arab-americans |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 9, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Armenians|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/a/armenians |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=French|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/f/french |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 9, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greeks|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/g/greeks |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 9, 2019|date= May 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turks in Cleveland|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/t/turks-cleveland |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= August 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;immigration&quot; /&gt;

===Religion===
The influx of immigrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries drastically transformed Cleveland's religious landscape.  From a homogeneous settlement of New England [[Protestantism|Protestants]], it evolved into a city with a diverse religious composition. The predominant faith among Clevelanders today is [[Christianity]] ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]], Protestant, and [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]]), with [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Islam|Muslim]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Religion|url= https://case.edu/ech/articles/r/religion |encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate= July 31, 2019|date= May 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its extensive cleanup of the Cuyahoga River and its portion of Lake Erie, Cleveland has been recognized by national media as an environmental success story and a national leader in environmental protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-cuyahoga&quot; /&gt; Since the city's industrialization, the Cuyahoga had become so affected by [[Pollution#Urban pollution|industrial pollution]] that it &quot;caught fire&quot; a total of 13 times beginning in 1868.

Cleveland operates on a [[Strong-mayor|mayor–council (strong mayor)]] form of government, in which the mayor is the [[executive (government)|chief executive]]. From 1924 to 1931, the city briefly experimented with a [[council–manager government]] under [[William R. Hopkins]] and [[Daniel E.

===Urban transit systems===
{{See also|Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority|Streetcars in Cleveland}}
Cleveland has a bus and [[urban rail transit|rail]] [[public transport|mass transit]] system operated by the [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the [[RTA Rapid Transit]], but local residents refer to it as ''The Rapid''. It consists of three [[rapid transit|light rail]] lines, known as the [[Blue Line (Cleveland)|Blue]], [[Green Line (Cleveland)|Green]], and  [[Blue Line (Cleveland)|Waterfront]] Lines, and a [[heavy rail]] line, the [[Red Line (Cleveland)|Red Line]]. In 2008, RTA completed the [[HealthLine]], a [[bus rapid transit]] line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland)|Euclid Avenue]] from downtown through University Circle, ending at the [[Louis Stokes Station at Windermere]] in [[East Cleveland, Ohio|East Cleveland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtahealthline.com/healthline-where-goes.asp |title=RTA HealthLine: Where It Goes |publisher=[[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] | accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Cleveland became the first city in the nation to have a direct rail transit connection linking the city's downtown to its major airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTA-history&quot; /&gt; In 2007, the [[American Public Transportation Association]] named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.riderta.com/nu_newsroom_releases.asp?listingid=1096 | title=Greater Cleveland: Best Location for Public Transportation in the Nation |publisher=Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority |date=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland is the only metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere with its rail rapid transit system having only one center-city area rapid transit station (Tower City-Public Square).

===Private automobiles===
The city of Cleveland has a higher than average percentage of households without a car. In 2016, 23.7 percent of Cleveland households lacked a car, while the national average was 8.7 percent. Cleveland averaged 1.19 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
Cleveland's road system consists of numbered streets running roughly north–south, and named avenues, which run roughly east–west. The numbered streets are designated &quot;east&quot; or &quot;west&quot;, depending where they lie in relation to Ontario Street, which bisects [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/s/street-names |title=Street Names|encyclopedia= The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher= [[Case Western Reserve University]] |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbered street system extends beyond the city limits into some suburbs on both the West and East Sides. The named avenues that lie both on the east side of the Cuyahoga River and west of Ontario Street receive a &quot;west&quot; designation on street signage. The two downtown avenues which span the Cuyahoga change names on the west side of the river. Superior Avenue becomes Detroit Avenue on the West Side, and Carnegie Avenue becomes Lorain Avenue. The bridges that make these connections are often called the [[Detroit–Superior Bridge]] and the [[Lorain–Carnegie Bridge]].

===Freeways===
Three two-digit [[Interstate highway]]s serve Cleveland directly. [[Interstate 71]] begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Cincinnati]]. [[Interstate 77]] begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]]. [[Interstate 90]] connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east–west through the West Side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as [[Dead Man's Curve]], then continues northeast, entering [[Lake County, Ohio|Lake County]] near the eastern split with [[Ohio State Route 2]]. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, [[Interstate 480 (Ohio)|Interstate 480]], which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and [[Interstate 490 (Ohio)|Interstate 490]], which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-490_oh.html Interstate 490 Cleveland.] Interstate-Guide.com. Retrieved on July 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Please do not add I-271 here, since it does not run through the City of Cleveland. Instead, please include any relevant information in the Greater Cleveland article. --&gt;

Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] carries State Route 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries [[U.S. Route 6|US 6]], [[U.S. Route 20|US 20]] and I-90. The Jennings Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 176|State Route 176]]) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]] and [[Brooklyn Heights, Ohio|Brooklyn Heights]]. A third highway, the Berea Freeway ([[Ohio State Route 237|State Route 237]] in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030426102052/http://www.nhlink.net/neighborhoodtour/riverside/ntour.htm Riverside Neighborhood Tour.] Neighborhood Link, [[Cleveland State University]]. Retrieved on July 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
[[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] is the city's major airport and an [[international airport]] that once served as a main [[airline hub|hub]] for [[United Airlines]] and [[Continental Airlines]]. It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection in North America, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic [[control tower]]. Originally known as Cleveland Municipal Airport, it was the first municipally owned airport in the country. Cleveland Hopkins is a significant regional air freight hub hosting [[FedEx Express]], [[UPS Airlines]], [[United States Postal Service]], and major commercial freight carriers.
In addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by [[Burke Lakefront Airport]], on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway|Shoreway]]. Burke is primarily a commuter and business airport.&lt;ref&gt;Tinsley, Jesse. &quot;Burke to host air service again; Startup offers no-hassle hop to Detroit, more&quot;, ''The Plain Dealer''.
