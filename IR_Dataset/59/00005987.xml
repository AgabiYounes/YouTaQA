The largest consumer and importer of coal is [[Coal in China|China]]. [[Coal mining in China|China mines]] almost half the world's coal, followed by [[Coal mining in India|India]] with about a tenth. [[Coal in Australia|Australia]] accounts for about a third of world coal exports followed by [[Energy in Indonesia#Coal|Indonesia]] and [[Coal in Russia|Russia]].&lt;ref name=IEAstats&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.iea.org/statistics | title=Global energy data | publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word originally took the form ''col'' in [[Old English]], from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''kula''(''n''), which in turn is hypothesized to come from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root *''g''(''e'')''u-lo-'' &quot;live coal&quot;.&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{OEtymD|coal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] cognates include the [[Old Frisian]] ''kole'', [[Middle Dutch]] ''cole'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''kool'', [[Old High German]] ''chol'', [[German language|German]] ''Kohle'' and [[Old Norse]] ''kol'', and the [[Irish language|Irish]] word ''gual'' is also a cognate via the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root.&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;

==Geology==

Coal is composed of [[macerals]], [[minerals]] and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=1404 | title=Coal  | publisher=[[British Geological Survey]] | date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fossils]] and [[amber]] may be found in coal.

===Formation===
[[File:Struktura chemiczna węgla kamiennego.svg|thumb|Example chemical structure of coal]]

One theory states that about 360 million years ago, some plants evolved the ability to produce [[lignin]], a complex polymer that made their [[cellulose]] stems much harder and more woody. Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGS&quot;/&gt; Thus first [[lignite]] (also called &quot;brown coal&quot;), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called &quot;hard coal&quot; or &quot;black coal&quot;) may be formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIACoalExplained&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&amp;pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&amp;pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods. The exception is the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event#Coal Gap|coal gap]] in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], where coal is rare. Coal is known from [[Precambrian]] strata, which predate land plants—this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyler1957&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0016-7606(1957)68[1293:ACFPUH]2.0.CO;2 | bibcode = 1957GSAB...68.1293T | last1 = Tyler | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Barghoorn | first2 = E.S. | last3 = Barrett | first3 = L.P. | title = Anthracitic Coal from Precambrian Upper Huronian Black Shale of the Iron River District, Northern Michigan | journal = Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume = 68 | issue = 10 | page = 1293 | year = 1957 | issn = 0016-7606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mancuso1981&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2113/gsecongeo.76.4.951 | last1 = Mancuso | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Seavoy | first2 = R.E. | title = Precambrian coal or anthraxolite; a source for graphite in high-grade schists and gneisses | journal = Economic Geology | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 951–54 | year = 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes coal seams (also known as coal beds) are interbedded with other sediments in a [[cyclothem]].

[[File:Coal Rank USGS.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Coal ranking system used by the [[United States Geological Survey]]]]

As geological processes apply [[pressure]] to dead [[biotic material]] over time, under suitable conditions, its [[metamorphic grade]] or rank increases successively into:
* [[Peat]], a precursor of coal
* [[Lignite]], or brown coal, the lowest rank of coal, most harmful to health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lignite coal - health effects and recommendations from the health sector |url=https://www.env-health.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HEAL-Lignite-Briefing-en_web.pdf |publisher=Health and Environment Alliance (HEAL)}}&lt;/ref&gt; used almost exclusively as fuel for electric power generation
** [[jet (lignite)|Jet]], a compact form of lignite, sometimes polished; used as an ornamental stone since the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]
* [[Sub-bituminous coal]], whose properties range between those of lignite and those of bituminous coal, is used primarily as fuel for steam-electric power generation.
* [[Bituminous coal]], a dense sedimentary rock, usually black, but sometimes dark brown, often with well-defined bands of bright and dull material. It is used primarily as fuel in steam-electric power generation and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]].
* [[Anthracite]], the highest rank of coal is a harder, glossy black coal used primarily for residential and commercial [[space heating]].
* [[Graphite]] is difficult to ignite and not commonly used as fuel; it is most used in pencils, or powdered for [[lubrication]].

[[Cannel coal]] (sometimes called &quot;candle coal&quot;) is a variety of fine-grained, high-rank coal with significant hydrogen content, which consists primarily of [[liptinite]].

There are several international standards for coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standards catalogue 73.040 – Coals |url=https://www.iso.org/ics/73.040/x/ |publisher=[[ISO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of coal is generally based on the content of [[coal volatiles|volatiles]]. However the most important distinction is between thermal coal (also known as steam coal), which is burnt to generate electricity via steam; and [[metallurgical coal]] (also known as coking coal), which is burnt at high temperature to make [[steel]].

====Hilt's law====

{{main|Hilt's law}}

[[Hilt's law]] is a geological observation that (within a small area) the deeper the coal is found, the higher its rank (or grade). It applies if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical; however, [[metamorphism]] may cause lateral changes of rank, irrespective of depth.

A grade between bituminous coal and anthracite was once known as &quot;steam coal&quot; as it was widely used as a fuel for [[steam locomotive]]s. In this specialized use, it is sometimes known as &quot;sea coal&quot; in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Funk and Wagnalls]], quoted in {{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=sea-coal|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small &quot;steam coal&quot;, also called ''dry small steam nuts'' (or DSSN), was used as a fuel for domestic [[water heating]].

==Emission intensity==
[[Emission intensity]] is the [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|greenhouse gas emitted over the life of a generator]] per unit of electricity generated. Of the currently widely used methods of generating electricity the emission intensity of coal and oil is high, as they emit around 1000g of CO2eq for each kWh generated; natural gas is medium emission intensity at around 500g CO2eq per kWh; and all other methods are typically low emission intensity  of under 100g per kWh. The emission intensity of coal varies with type and generator technology and exceeds 1200g per kWh in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Real-Time Carbon Accounting Method for the European Electricity Markets |journal=Energy Strategy Reviews|volume=26|pages=100367|arxiv=1812.06679 |last1=Tranberg |first1=Bo |last2=Corradi|first2=Olivier|last3=Lajoie|first3=Bruno|last4=Gibon|first4=Thomas|last5=Staffell|first5=Iain|author6=Gorm Bruun Andresen|doi=10.1016/j.esr.2019.100367|year=2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy density===
{{Main|Energy value of coal}}
The [[energy density]] of coal, that is its [[heating value]], is roughly 24 [[megajoule]]s per kilogram&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Fisher | first = Juliya | title = Energy Density of Coal | work = The Physics Factbook | url = http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml | year = 2003 | accessdate = 25 August 2006 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061107152122/http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JuliyaFisher.shtml | archivedate = 7 November 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 6.7 [[kilowatt-hours]] per kg). For a coal power plant with a 40% efficiency, it takes an estimated {{convert|325|kg|abbr=on}} of coal to power a 100&amp;nbsp;W lightbulb for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = How much coal is required to run a 100-watt light bulb 24 hours a day for a year?| work = Howstuffworks| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/question481.htm| accessdate = 25 August 2006| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060807235142/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question481.htm| archivedate = 7 August 2006| df = dmy-all| date = 2000-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

27.6% of world energy was supplied by coal in 2017 and Asia used almost three quarters of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primary energy |url=https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/primary-energy.html |publisher=[[BP]] |accessdate=5 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composition===
The composition of coal is reported either as a [[proximate analysis]] (moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon, and ash) or an [[ultimate analysis]] (ash, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur). The &quot;volatile matter&quot; does not exist by itself (except for some adsorbed methane) but designates the volatile compounds that are produced and driven off by heating the coal. A typical bituminous coal may have an ultimate analysis on a dry, ash-free basis of 84.4% carbon, 5.4% hydrogen, 6.7% oxygen, 1.7% nitrogen, and 1.8% sulfur, on a weight basis.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Robert Perry |editor2-last=Cecil Chilton |chapter=Chapter 9: Heat Generation, Transport, and Storage|author=William Reid|title=Chemical Engineers' Handbook |date=1973 |edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coking coal and use of coke to smelt iron===
{{Main|Coke (fuel)}}
[[File:Coke Ovens Abercwmboi.jpg|right|thumb|Coke oven at a [[smokeless fuel]] plant in [[Wales]], United Kingdom]]

Coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from [[coking coal]] (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as ''metallurgical coal''), which is used in manufacturing [[steel]] and other iron products.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Coal Steel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How is Steel Produced?|url=https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/how-steel-produced|publisher=[[World Coal Association]]|accessdate=April 8, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412114829/https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-coal/how-steel-produced|archivedate=12 April 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C, driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the fixed carbon and residual ash. Metallurgical coke is used as a [[fuel]] and as a [[reducing agent]] in [[smelting]] [[iron ore]] in a [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html Blast furnace steelmaking cost model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114013811/http://www.steelonthenet.com/cost-bof.html |date=14 January 2016 }}. Steelonthenet.com. Retrieved on 24 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The carbon monoxide produced by its combustion reduces [[hematite]] (an [[iron oxide]]) to [[iron]].

Waste carbon dioxide is also produced {{nowrap|(&lt;chem id=&quot;2Fe2O3 + 3C &quot;&gt;2Fe2O3 + 3C -&gt; 4Fe + 3CO2 &lt;/chem&gt;)}} together with [[pig iron]], which is too rich in dissolved carbon so must be treated further to make steel.

Coking coal should be low in ash, [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]], so that these do not migrate to the metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Coal Steel&quot;/&gt;
The coke must be [[Coke strength after reaction|strong enough]] to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 29.6 MJ/kg. Some cokemaking processes produce byproducts, including [[coal tar]], [[ammonia]], light oils, and [[coal gas]].

[[Petroleum coke]] (petcoke) is the solid residue obtained in [[oil refining]], which resembles coke but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications.

====Use in foundry components {{anchor|Industrial processes|Sea coal}}====
Finely ground bituminous coal, known in this application as sea coal, is a constituent of [[foundry sand]]. While the molten metal is in the [[Molding (process)|mould]], the coal burns slowly, releasing [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rao|first=P. N.|title=Manufacturing technology: foundry, forming and welding|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|location=New Delhi|year=2007|edition=2|page=107|chapter=Moulding materials|isbn=978-0-07-463180-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the &quot;bod&quot;) used for the bottom of a [[cupola furnace]]. When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=Edward|title=Cupola Furnace – A Practical Treatise on the Construction and Management of Foundry Cupolas|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/cupolafurnacepra00kirkiala|publisher=Baird|location=Philadelphia|year=1899|page=[https://archive.org/details/cupolafurnacepra00kirkiala/page/95 95]|chapter=Cupola management|oclc=2884198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternatives to coke====
Scrap steel can be recycled in an [[electric arc furnace]]; and an alternative to making iron by smelting is [[direct reduced iron]], where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron. To lessen carbon dioxide emissions [[hydrogen]] can be used as the reducing agent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-29/how-hydrogen-could-solve-steel-s-climate-test-and-hobble-coal|title=How Hydrogen Could Solve Steel's Climate Test and Hobble Coal|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2019-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[biomass]] or waste as the source of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coking Coal for steel production and alternatives |url=https://leard.frontlineaction.org/coking-coal-steel-production-alternatives/ |publisher=Front Line Action on Coal |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gasification===
{{Main|Coal gasification|Underground coal gasification}}
Coal gasification, as part of an [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal-fired power station, is used to produce [[syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and the hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas to fire gas turbines to produce electricity. Syngas can also be converted into transportation fuels, such as [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]; alternatively, syngas can be converted into [[methanol]], which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |title=Conversion of Methanol to Gasoline |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory |accessdate=16 July 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717225057/http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/methanol-to-gasoline |archivedate=17 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gasification combined with Fischer-Tropsch technology is used by the [[Sasol]] chemical company of [[South Africa]] to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas.

During gasification, the coal is mixed with [[oxygen]] and [[steam]] while also being heated and pressurized. During the reaction, oxygen and water molecules [[Redox|oxidize]] the coal into carbon monoxide (CO), while also releasing [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This used to be done in underground coal mines, and also to make [[town gas]] which was piped to customers to burn for illumination, heating, and cooking.

: 3C (''as Coal'') + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3CO

If the refiner wants to produce gasoline, the syngas is routed into a Fischer-Tropsch reaction. This is known as indirect coal liquefaction. If hydrogen is the desired end-product, however, the syngas is fed into the [[water gas shift reaction]], where more hydrogen is liberated:

: CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Liquefaction===
{{Main|Coal liquefaction}}

Coal can be converted directly into [[synthetic fuel]]s equivalent to gasoline or diesel by [[hydrogenation]] or [[carbonization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|title=Direct Liquefaction Processes|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory|accessdate=16 July 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725082303/http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/direct-liquefaction|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal liquefaction emits more carbon dioxide than liquid fuel production from [[crude oil]]. Mixing in biomass and using CCS would emit slightly less than the oil process but at a high cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Economic and environmental analyses of coal and biomass to liquid fuels |journal=Energy|volume=141|pages=76–86|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.047|year=2017|last1=Liu|first1=Weiguo|last2=Wang|first2=Jingxin|last3=Bhattacharyya|first3=Debangsu|last4=Jiang|first4=Yuan|last5=Devallance|first5=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; State owned [[China Energy Investment]] runs a coal liquefaction plant and plans to build 2 more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHN Energy to build new coal-to-liquid production lines |url=http://en.silkroad.news.cn/2018/0813/106231.shtml |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production of chemicals===
[[File:Coal to chemicals routes diagram.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Production of chemicals from coal]]

Chemicals have been produced from coal since the 1950s. Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities.

Because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa, China and India{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is a strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry there. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.

==Coal as fuel to generate electricity==

===Precombustion treatment===
{{Main|Refined coal}}
Refined coal is the product of a coal-upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower-rank coals such as sub-bituminous and lignite (brown) coals. It is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal's characteristics before it is burned. Thermal efficiency improvements are achievable by improved pre-drying (especially relevant with high-moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Niederraussem Coal Innovation Centre | publisher = RWE | url = http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/mediablob/en/234504/data/2378/5/rwe-power-ag/innovations/coal-innovation-centre/Brochure-The-Niederaussem-Coal-Innovation-Centre.pdf | accessdate = 21 July 2014 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130722025133/http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/mediablob/en/234504/data/2378/5/rwe-power-ag/innovations/coal-innovation-centre/Brochure-The-Niederaussem-Coal-Innovation-Centre.pdf | archivedate = 22 July 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned. Precombustion technology can sometimes be used as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal-fueled boilers.

Coal burnt as a [[solid fuel]] in [[list of coal power stations|coal power stations]] to [[electricity generation|generate electricity]] is called thermal coal. Coal is also used to produce very high temperatures through combustion. Early deaths due to air pollution have been estimated at 200 per GW-year, however they may be higher around power plants where scrubbers are not used or lower if they are far from cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://berkeleyearth.org/deaths-per-gigawatt-year/|title=Coal in China: Estimating Deaths per GW-year|date=2016-11-18|website=Berkeley Earth|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts around the world to reduce the use of coal have led some regions to switch to natural gas and electricity from lower carbon sources.

When coal is used for [[electricity generation]], it is usually pulverized and then burned in a [[furnace]] with a [[boiler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Coal&quot;&gt;[http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-of-coal/coal-electricity/ Total World Electricity Generation by Fuel (2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022093430/http://www.worldcoal.org/coal/uses-of-coal/coal-electricity/ |date=22 October 2015 }}.

A few [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) power plants have been built, which burn coal more efficiently. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the [[coal gasification|coal is gasified]] to create [[syngas]], which is burned in a [[gas turbine]] to produce electricity (just like natural gas is burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a [[heat recovery steam generator]] which powers a supplemental [[steam turbine]]. The overall plant efficiency when used to provide [[combined heat and power]] can reach as much as 94%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/DONGENERGY/Internet/UK/ThermalPower/AVVbrochure2012UK/ Avedøreværket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129110317/http://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/DONGENERGY/Internet/UK/ThermalPower/AVVbrochure2012UK/ |date=29 January 2016 }}.

==Coal industry==
{{main|:Category:Coal companies|Coal mining|Coal by country|Coal industry in China|Coal industry in Pakistan|Coal industry in India|Coal companies of Australia}}

===Coal mining===
{{main|Coal mining}}
About 8000 Mt of coal are produced annually, about 90% of which is hard coal and 10% lignite. {{As of|2018}} just over half is from underground mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coal mining |url=https://www.worldcoal.org/coal/coal-mining |publisher=[[World Coal Association]] |accessdate=5 December 2018|date=2015-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More accidents occur during underground mining than surface mining. Not all countries publish [[mining accident]] statistics so worldwide figures are uncertain, but it is thought that most deaths occur in [[List of coal mining accidents in China|coal mining accidents in China]]: in 2017 there were 375 coal mining related deaths in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China: seven miners killed after skip plummets down mine shaft |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/16/miners-killed-in-south-west-china-mining-accident |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 December 2018|last1=France-Presse |first1=Agence }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most coal mined is thermal coal (also called steam coal as it is used to make steam to generate electricity) but metallurgical coal (also called &quot;metcoal&quot; or &quot;coking coal&quot; as it is used to make coke to make iron) accounts for 10% to 15% of global coal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The One Market That's Sure To Help Coal |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2018/08/12/the-one-market-thats-sure-to-help-coal/#570c071f6f6e |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal as a traded commodity===
[[Coal mining in China|China mines]] almost half the world's coal, followed by [[Coal mining in India|India]] with about a tenth.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPReview2016&quot;/&gt; [[Coal in Australia|Australia]] accounts for about a third of world coal exports, followed by [[Energy in Indonesia#Coal|Indonesia]] and [[Coal in Russia|Russia]]; while the largest importers are [[Energy in Japan|Japan]] and India.

The price of metallurgical coal is volatile&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coal 2017 |url=https://eneken.ieej.or.jp/data/7732.pdf |publisher=[[International Energy Agency|IEA]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much higher than the price of thermal coal because metallurgical coal must be lower in sulfur and requires more cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coal Prices and Outlook |url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=coal_prices |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal futures contracts provide coal producers and the [[electric power industry]] an important tool for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[risk management]].

In some countries new onshore [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar]] generation already costs less than coal power from existing plants (see [[Cost of electricity by source]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = New wind and solar generation costs fall below existing coal plants |work=Financial Times| accessdate = 2018-11-08| url = https://www.ft.com/content/af6915c8-e2eb-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lazard's Levelized Cost of Energy ('LCOE') analysis – Version 12.0 |url=https://www.lazard.com/media/450773/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-120-vfinal.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, for China this is forecast for the early 2020s&lt;ref name=&quot;CarbTrk2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=40% of China's coal power stations are losing money |url=https://www.carbontracker.org/40-of-chinas-coal-power-stations-are-losing-money/ |publisher=Carbon Tracker |accessdate=11 November 2018|date=2018-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for south-east Asia not until the late 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Economic and financial risks of coal power in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines |url=https://www.carbontracker.org/reports/economic-and-financial-risks-of-coal-power-in-indonesia-vietnam-and-the-philippines/ |publisher=Carbon Tracker |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India building new plants is uneconomic and, despite being subsidized, existing plants are losing market share to renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=India's Coal Paradox |url=https://oilprice.com/Energy/Coal/Indias-Coal-Paradox.html |date=5 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market trends===
Of the [[List of countries by coal production|countries which produce coal]] China mines by far the most, almost half the world's coal, followed by less than 10% by India. China is also by far the largest consumer. Therefore, market trends depend on [[Energy policy of China|Chinese energy policy]].&lt;ref name=IEA2018&gt;{{cite web |title=Coal 2018:Executive Summary |url=https://webstore.iea.org/download/summary/2415 |publisher=[[International Energy Agency]] |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the effort to reduce pollution means that the global long term trend is to burn less coal, the short and medium term trends may differ, in part due to Chinese financing of new coal-fired power plants in other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornot-Gandolfe 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cornot-Gandolfe |first1=Sylvie |title=A Review of Coal Market Trends and Policies in 2017|date=May 2018 |publisher=Ifri |url=https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/cornot_gandolphe_coal_exit_2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, improvements to air quality and human health would increase with more stringent climate policies, mainly because the country's energy is so heavily reliant on coal.

Huge amounts of coal ash and other waste is produced annually. Use of coal generates hundreds of millions of tons of ash and other waste products every year. These include [[fly ash]], [[bottom ash]], and [[flue-gas desulfurization]] sludge, that contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[arsenic]], and other [[heavy metals]], along with non-metals such as [[selenium]].&lt;ref&gt;World Coal Association [http://www.worldcoal.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=127 &quot;Environmental impact of Coal Use&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223203113/http://www.worldcoal.org/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=127 |date=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coal mining]] and coal fueling of [[power stations]] and industrial processes can cause major environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html Environmental impacts of coal power: air pollution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115204952/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html |date=15 January 2008 }}. Union of Concerned Scientists&lt;/ref&gt;

Water systems are affected by coal mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Environmental Impact of Coal Mining on Water Regime and Its Management|author=Tiwary, R. K. |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution|year=2001|volume=132|pages=185–99|doi=10.1023/a:1012083519667|bibcode=2001WASP..132..185T }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, mining affects [[groundwater]] and [[water table]] levels and acidity. Spills of fly ash, such as the [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill]], can also contaminate land and waterways, and destroy homes. Power stations that burn coal also consume large quantities of water. This can affect the flows of rivers, and has consequential impacts on other land uses. In areas of [[water scarcity]], such as the [[Thar Desert]] in [[Pakistan]], coal mining and coal power plants would use significant quantities of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pakistan's Coal Trap |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1387151 |work=Dawn |date=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known impacts of coal on the [[water cycle]] was [[acid rain]]. Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711–22|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Release of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also contributes to the widespread acidification of ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Human Impacts on Atmospheric Chemistry, by PJ Crutzen and J Lelieveld, Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Vol. 29: 17–45 (Volume publication date May 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Disused coal mines can also cause issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to infrastructure or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, and it has been estimated that thousands of [[coal seam fire]]s are burning at any given time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep underground&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=Time Magazine |date=23 July 2010 |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2006195,00.html |author=Cray, Dan |title=Deep Underground, Miles of Hidden Wildfires Rage |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728003147/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2006195,00.html |archivedate=28 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Brennender Berg]] has been burning since 1668 and is still burning in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;mineralienatlas&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Das Naturdenkmal Brennender Berg bei Dudweiler | trans-title = The natural monument Burning Mountain in Dudweiler | language = German | work = Mineralienatlas | accessdate = 3 October 2016 | url = https://www.mineralienatlas.de/?l=3741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface [[wildfire]]s. Coal seams can be set on fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] or contact with a [[mine fire]] or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Committee on Resources-Index |url=http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825231038/http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/archives/108/testimony/johnmasterson.htm |archivedate=25 August 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Snapshots 2003 |work=fire.blm.gov |url=http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218013724/http://www.fire.blm.gov/textdocuments/6-27-03.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EHP 110-5, 2002: Forum |url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731081620/http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2002/110-5/forum.html |archivedate=31 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview about ITC's activities in China |url=http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html |accessdate=9 September 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616004903/http://www.itc.nl/personal/coalfire/activities/overview.html |archivedate=16 June 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] located in the [[Coal Region]] of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned [[anthracite coal|anthracite]] [[Surface mining|strip mine]] pit.

===Global warming===

The largest and most long term effect of coal use is the release of carbon dioxide, a [[greenhouse gas]] that causes [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. Coal-fired power plants were the single largest contributor to the growth in global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2018,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gençsü 2019, p. 8&quot;&gt;Gençsü (2019), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions.&lt;ref name =phys2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-12-china-unbridled-export-coal-power_1.html|title=China's unbridled export of coal power imperils climate goals|accessdate=7 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining can emit methane, another greenhouse gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China's Coal Plants Haven't Cut Methane Emissions as Required, Study Finds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/climate/china-coal-climate-change.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal pollution mitigation==
{{Main|Coal pollution mitigation}}
{{See also|Clean coal technology}}

&quot;Clean&quot; coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal. Historically, the primary focus was on SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the most important gases which caused [[acid rain]]; and [[particulates]] which cause visible air pollution, illness and premature deaths. SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be removed by [[flue-gas desulfurization]] and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR). Particulates can be removed with [[electrostatic precipitator]]s. Although perhaps less efficient [[wet scrubber]]s can remove both gases and particulates. And [[mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions can be reduced up to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mercury control from coal combustion |url=http://web.unep.org/globalmercurypartnership/our-work/mercury-control-coal-combustion |publisher=[[UNEP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However capturing carbon dioxide emissions is generally not economically viable.

===Standards===
Local pollution standards include GB13223-2011 (China), India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How can Indian power plants cost-effectively meet the new sulfur emission standards?

===Satellite monitoring===

Satellite monitoring is now used to crosscheck national data, for example [[Sentinel-5 Precursor]] has shown that Chinese control of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has only been partially successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Quantifying coal power plant responses to tighter SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions standards in China|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=115|issue=27|pages=7004–09|doi=10.1073/pnas.1800605115|pmid=29915085|pmc=6142229|year=2018 |last1=Karplus |first1=Valerie J. |last2=Zhang|first2=Shuang|last3=Almond|first3=Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also revealed that low use of technology such as SCR has resulted in high NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in South Africa and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New satellite data analysis reveals world's biggest NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions hotspots |url=https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/19072/greenpeace-analysis-of-new-satellite-data-reveals-worlds-biggest-no2-emissions-hotspots/ |publisher=Greenpeace International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined cycle power plants===
A few [[Integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) coal-fired power plants have been built with [[coal gasification]]. Although they burn coal more efficiently and therefore emit less pollution, the technology has not generally proved economically viable for coal, except possibly in Japan although this is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Universal failure: How IGCC coal plants waste money and emissions Nove |url=http://www.kikonet.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IGCC-and-emissions_eg_final.pdf |publisher=Kiko Network |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan says no to high-emission coal power plants |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-says-no-to-high-emission-coal-power-plants |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon capture and storage===

Although still being intensively researched and considered economically viable for some uses other than with coal; [[carbon capture and storage]] has been tested at the [[Petra Nova]] and [[Boundary Dam Power Station|Boundary Dam]] coal-fired power plants and has been found to be technically feasible but not economically viable for use with coal, due to reductions in the cost of solar PV technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coal with Carbon Capture and Sequestration is not as Land Use Efficient as Solar Photovoltaic Technology for Climate Neutral Electricity Production |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=13476 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-31505-3 |pmid=30194324 |pmc=6128891 |bibcode=2018NatSR...813476G |year=2018 |last1=Groesbeck |first1=James Gunnar |last2=Pearce |first2=Joshua M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidies===
Broadly defined total subsidies for coal in 2015 have been estimated at around US$2.5 trillion, about 3% of global [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How Large Are Global Fossil Fuel Subsidies? |journal=World Development|volume=91|pages=11–27|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.10.004|year=2017|last1=Coady|first1=David|last2=Parry|first2=Ian|last3=Sears|first3=Louis|last4=Shang|first4=Baoping}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2019}} [[G20]] countries provide at least  US$63.9 billion&lt;ref name=&quot;Gençsü 2019, p. 8&quot;/&gt; of government support per year for the production of coal, including coal-fired power: many subsidies are impossible to quantify&lt;ref name=ClimateTransparency2019&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climate-transparency.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Managing-the-phase-out-of-coal-DIGITAL.pdf|title=MANAGING THE PHASE-OUT OF COAL A COMPARISON OF ACTIONS IN G20 COUNTRIES|last=|first=|date=May 2019|website=Climate Transparency}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they include US$27.6 billion in domestic and international public finance, US$15.4 billion in fiscal support, and US$20.9 billion in state-owned enterprise (SOE) investments per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gençsü 2019, p. 8&quot;/&gt; In the EU state aid to new coal-fired plants is banned from 2020, and to existing coal-fired plants from 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal reached on EU energy market design, incl end of coal subsidies License: CC0 Creative Commons |url=https://renewablesnow.com/news/deal-reached-on-eu-energy-market-design-incl-end-of-coal-subsidies-637143/ |publisher=Renewables Now |date=19 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However government funding for new coal power plants is being supplied via [[Exim Bank of China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Urgewald 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Briefings for the 2018 Coal Plant Developers List |url=https://coalexit.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/Regional%20Briefings%20CPDL_10-04-2018_final.pdf |publisher=Urgewald |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation]] and Indian public sector banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The World Needs to Quit Coal.

===Stranded assets===
Some coal-fired power stations could become [[stranded assets]], for example [[China Energy Investment]], the world's largest power company, risks losing half its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;CarbTrk2018&quot; /&gt; However state owned electricity utilities such as [[Eskom]] in South Africa, [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] in Indonesia, [[Sarawak Energy]] in Malaysia, [[Taipower]] in Taiwan, [[EGAT]] in Thailand, [[Vietnam Electricity]] and [[EÜAŞ]] in Turkey are building or planning new plants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urgewald 2018&quot; /&gt; {{As of|2019}} this may be helping to cause a [[carbon bubble]] which could cause financial instability if it bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/climate/stranded-fossil-fuel-assets-may-prompt-4-trillion-crisis|title=&quot;Stranded&quot; fossil fuel assets may prompt $4 trillion crisis|website=Cosmos Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Politics==
Countries building or financing new coal-fired power stations, such as China, India, and Japan, face mounting international criticism for obstructing the aims of the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornot-Gandolfe 2018&quot; /&gt; In 2019, the Pacific Island nations (in particular Vanuatu and Fiji) criticized Australia for failing to cut their emissions at a faster rate than they were, citing concerns about coastal inundation and erosion.&lt;ref name=Guardian2018/&gt;

===Corruption===
Allegations of corruption are being investigated in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coal scam: Naveen Jindal, others summoned |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coal-scam-naveen-jindal-others-summoned-as-accused-in-money-laundering-case/articleshow/65405188.cms |work=Times of India |date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=China Tackling Corruption, Safety Concerns in Coal Production |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/china-tackling-corruption-safety-concerns-coal-production |publisher=Worldwatch |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition away from coal==
{{See also|Fossil fuel phase-out#Coal}}
In order to meet global climate goals and provide power to those that don't currently have it coal power must be reduced from nearly 10,000 TWh to less than 2,000 TWh by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coal dumped as IEA turns to wind and solar to solve climate challenge |url=https://reneweconomy.com.au/coal-dumped-as-iea-turns-to-wind-and-solar-to-solve-climate-challenge-66916/ |work=Renew Economy |date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, such as the [[Powering Past Coal Alliance]], have already or are transitioned away from coal;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sartor |first1=O. |title=Implementing coal transitions Insights from case studies of major coal-consuming economies |date=2018 |publisher=IDDRI and Climate Strategies. |url=https://coaltransitions.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/coal_synthesis_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest transition announced so far being Germany, which is due to shut down its last coal-fired power station between 2035 and 2038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany agrees to end reliance on coal stations by 2038 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/germany-agrees-to-end-reliance-on-coal-stations-by-2038 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries use the ideas of a &quot;just transition&quot;, for example to use some of the benefits of transition to provide early pensions for coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spain to close most coalmines in €250m transition deal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/spain-to-close-most-coal-mines-after-striking-250m-deal |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However low-lying [[Pacific Islands]] are concerned the transition is not fast enough and that they will be inundated by [[sea level rise]]; so they have called for [[OECD]] countries to completely phase out coal by 2030 and other countries by 2040.&lt;ref name=Guardian2018&gt;{{cite news |title=Pacific nations under climate threat urge Australia to abandon coal within 12 years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/14/pacific-nations-under-climate-threat-urge-australia-to-abandon-coal-within-12-years |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak coal===
[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|A coal mine in [[Wyoming]], United States. The United States has the world's largest coal reserves.]]

{{main|Peak coal}}

Although [[Coal by country|many countries have coal]] underground not all will be consumed.

Of the three fossil fuels, coal has the most widely distributed resources. Coal is mined on all continents except Antarctica. However many such resources have no economic value (much value has been destroyed by shale gas fracking).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IEEFA update: The investment rationale for fossil fuels falls apart |url=http://ieefa.org/ieefa-update-the-investment-rationale-for-fossil-fuels-falls-apart/ |publisher=IEEFA |accessdate=5 December 2018|date=2018-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest resources are found in the United States, Russia, China, Australia and India.

Nowadays &quot;peak coal&quot; means the point in time when consumption of coal reaches a maximum. Although coal use peaked in 2018 the drop in 2019 was only about 1%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50648495|title=Carbon emissions edge up as coal use falls|last=McGrath|first=Matt|date=2019-12-04|access-date=2019-12-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is likely to continue to fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDDRI&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=What does &quot;peak coal&quot; mean for international coal exporters? |date=2018 |url=https://www.iddri.org/sites/default/files/PDF/Publications/Catalogue%20Iddri/Rapport/201809-GlobalModelingReport-Iddri-Coal_FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switch to cleaner fuels and lower carbon electricity generation===
{{See also|Natural gas#Power generation}}

Coal-fired generation puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide—around a tonne for every megawatt hour generated—than electricity generated by burning natural gas at 500&amp;nbsp;kg of [[greenhouse gas]] per megawatt hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Electricity emissions around the world |url=http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/electricity-emissions-around-the-world |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to generating electricity, natural gas is also popular in some countries for heating and as an [[Natural gas vehicle|automotive fuel]].

The use of [[Energy in the United Kingdom|coal in the United Kingdom]] declined as a result of the development of [[North Sea oil]] and the subsequent [[dash for gas]] during the 1990s. In Canada some [[Thermal power station|coal power plants]], such as the [[Hearn Generating Station]], switched from coal to natural gas. In 2017, [[coal power in the United States]] provided 30% of the electricity, down from approximately 49% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3 |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |title=Frequently Asked Questions |date=April 18, 2017 |access-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522065928/https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3 |archivedate=22 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTKentucky&gt;{{cite news|title=Even in Coal Country, the Fight for an Industry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/business/energy-environment/even-in-kentucky-coal-industry-is-under-siege.html|accessdate=30 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 May 2012|author=Lipton, Eric|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530100528/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/business/energy-environment/even-in-kentucky-coal-industry-is-under-siege.html|archivedate=30 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/figes1.html|title=Figure ES 1.

===Coal regions in transition===
Some [[coal-mining region]]s are highly dependent on coal.

===Employment===
Some coal miners are concerned their jobs may be lost in the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thousands protest German coal phaseout |url=https://www.dw.com/en/thousands-protest-german-coal-phaseout/a-46019342 |date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioremediation===

The white rot fungus ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'' can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/33_4_LOS%20ANGELES_09-88_0514.pdf |title=Biodegradation of coal-related model compounds |author1=Campbell, J.A. |author2=Stewart, D.L. |author3=McCulloch, M. |author4=Lucke, R.B. |author5=Bean, R.M. |pages=514–21 |publisher=Pacific Northwest Laboratory |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102164058/http://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/33_4_LOS%20ANGELES_09-88_0514.pdf |archivedate=2 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria [[Diplococcus]] has been found to degrade coal, raising its temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Potter, M.C. |title=Bateria as agents in the oxidation of amorphous carbon|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B|volume=80|issue=539|pages=239–59|date=May 1908|doi=10.1098/rspb.1908.0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural usage==
Coal is the [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|official state mineral]] of [[Kentucky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sos.ky.gov/kids/all/symbols/mineral.htm |title=Kentucky: Secretary of State – State Mineral |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527221124/http://www.sos.ky.gov/kids/all/symbols/mineral.htm |archivedate=27 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official state rock of [[Utah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/rock.html|title=Utah State Rock – Coal|work=Pioneer: Utah's Online Library|publisher=Utah State Library Division|accessdate=7 August 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002183417/http://pioneer.utah.gov/research/utah_symbols/rock.html|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; both [[U.S. state]]s have a historic link to coal mining.

Some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from [[Santa Claus]] for Christmas in their [[christmas stocking]]s instead of presents.

It is also customary and considered lucky in [[Scotland]] and the [[North of England]] to give coal as a gift on [[New Year's Day]]. This occurs as part of [[First-Foot]]ing and represents warmth for the year to come.
