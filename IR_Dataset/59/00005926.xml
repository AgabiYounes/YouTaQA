'''Computation''' is any type of calculation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computation Computation] from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computation: Definition and Synonyms from Answers.com|url=http://www.answers.com:80/topic/computation|website=Answers.com|accessdate=26 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222005439/http://www.answers.com/topic/computation|archivedate=22 February 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined model, for example an [[algorithm]].

The study of computation is paramount ([[hypernym]]ous) to the discipline of [[computer science]].

== Physical phenomenon ==
A computation can be seen as a purely physical phenomenon occurring inside a closed [[physical system]] called a [[computer]].
Examples of such physical systems include [[digital computer]]s, [[mechanical computer]]s, [[quantum computer]]s, [[DNA computer]]s, [[molecular computer]]s, microfluidics-based computers, [[analog computer]]s, or [[wetware computer]]s.
This point of view has been adopted by the [[physics of computation]], a branch of theoretical physics, as well as the field of [[natural computing]].

An even more radical point of view, [[pancomputationalism]], is the postulate of [[digital physics]] that argues that the evolution of the universe is itself a computation.

=== The mapping account ===
The classic account of computation is found throughout the works of [[Hilary Putnam]] and others. [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] has dubbed this the &quot;simple mapping account.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Godfrey-Smith|first=P.|year=2009|title=Triviality Arguments against Functionalism|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=145|issue=2|pages=273–95|doi=10.1007/s11098-008-9231-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gualtiero Piccinini|Gualtiero Piccinini's]] summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system to the computation such that the “microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piccinini|first=Gualtiero|title=Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account|place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|page=18|isbn=9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The semantic account ===
Philosophers such as [[Jerry Fodor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fodor | first = J. A. | year = 1981 | title = The Mind-Body Problem | journal = Scientific American | volume = 244 | issue = January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that [[semantics |semantic]] content be a necessary condition for computation (that is, what differentiates an arbitrary physical system from a computing system is that the operands of the computation represent something).  This notion attempts to prevent the logical abstraction of the mapping account of [[digital physics#Pancomputationalism_or_the_computational_universe_theory|pancomputationalism]], the idea that everything can be said to be computing everything.

=== The mechanistic account ===
[[Gualtiero Piccinini]] proposes an account of computation based in [[mechanical philosophy]].  It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or “the manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a medium-independent vehicle according to a rule.”  Medium-independence requires that the property is able to be instantiated by multiple realizers and multiple mechanisms and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be [[Multiple realizability| multiply realizable]].  In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with traits other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that occurs in the [[brain]] or in a [[quantum computer]].  A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Piccinini | first = Gualtiero | title = Physical Computation: A Mechanistic Account | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2015 | page = 10 | isbn = 9780199658855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical models ==
In the [[theory of computation]], a diversity of mathematical models of computers has been developed.
Typical mathematical [[Model of computation|models of computers]] are the following:
* State models including [[Turing machine]], [[pushdown automaton]], [[finite state automaton]], and [[Parallel random access machine|PRAM]]
* Functional models including [[lambda calculus]]
* Logical models including [[logic programming]]
* Concurrent models including [[actor model]] and [[process calculi]]
Giunti calls the models studied by computation theory ''computational systems,'' and he argues that all of them are mathematical [[dynamical system]]s with discrete time and discrete state space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giunti|first=Marco|title=Computation, Dynamics, and Cognition|place=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-19-509009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ch.1}} He maintains that a computational system is a complex object which consists of three parts. First, a mathematical dynamical system &lt;math&gt;DS&lt;/math&gt; with discrete time and discrete state space; second, a computational setup &lt;math&gt;H=\left(F, B_F\right)&lt;/math&gt;, which is made up of a theoretical part &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, and a real part &lt;math&gt;B_F&lt;/math&gt;; third, an  interpretation &lt;math&gt;I_{DS,H}&lt;/math&gt;, which links the dynamical system &lt;math&gt;DS&lt;/math&gt; with the setup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Giunti|first=Marco|year=2017|title=What is a Physical Realization of a Computational System?|journal=Isonomia -- Epistemologica|volume=9|pages=177-92|ISSN=2037-4348|URL=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319631506_What_is_a_Physical_Realization_of_a_Computational_System}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.179–80}}
