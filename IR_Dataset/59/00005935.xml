'''The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''', often informally known as the '''LDS Church''' or '''Mormon Church''', is a [[Nontrinitarianism|nontrinitarian]], [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Restorationism|restorationist]] church that considers itself to be the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the [[One true church#Latter Day Saint movement|original church]] founded by [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]]. The church is headquartered in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], in the United States, and has established congregations and built [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] worldwide. According to the church, it has over 16 million [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics|members]] and 65,000 [[Missionary (LDS Church)|full-time volunteer missionaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2018&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=2017 Statistical Report for 2018 April Conference|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/2017-statistical-report-april-2018-general-conference|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=March 31, 2018|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[National Council of Churches]] ranked the church as the fourth-largest [[Christian denomination]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ncccusa.org/news/120209yearbook2012.html |title= National Council of Churches News: Church giving drops $1.2 billion reports 2012 Yearbook of Churches |date= March 20, 2012 |work= ncccusa.org |publisher= [[National Council of Churches]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 6.5 million members there as of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LDS Statistics and Church Facts {{!}} Total Church Membership|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/united-states|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|accessdate=September 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|largest denomination]] in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by [[Joseph Smith]] during the early 19th century period of religious revival known as the [[Second Great Awakening]].

Adherents, often referred to as &quot;Latter-day Saints&quot; or, less formally, &quot;[[Mormons]]&quot;, view faith in Jesus Christ and his [[Substitutionary atonement|atonement]] as fundamental principles of their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1976|p= 121}} &quot;The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Thomas S.

The church has an [[biblical canon|open canon]] which includes four [[religious text|scriptural texts]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bible (both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s), the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Other than the Bible, the majority of the LDS canon constitutes revelation received by Joseph Smith and recorded by his scribes which includes commentary and [[exegesis]] about the Bible, texts described as [[apocryphal|lost parts of the Bible]], and other works believed to be written by ancient [[prophet]]s. Because of some of the doctrinal differences, [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and several [[Protestant]] churches consider the church to be distinct and [[Mormonism and Christianity|separate from mainstream Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedy2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/february/14.18.html |title=Winning them softly|first=John W.|last=Kennedy|date=February 2004|volume=48|issue=2|work=Christianity Today|accessdate=October 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the doctrine of [[continuous revelation|continuing]] [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]], Latter-day Saints believe that the church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] is a modern-day &quot;[[prophet, seer, and revelator]]&quot; and that Jesus Christ, under the direction of [[God the Father]], leads the church by revealing his will to its president. &lt;!--replace when new president is chosen--&gt; Individual members of the church believe that they can also receive personal revelation from God in conducting their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |quote= Perhaps the puzzle some feel can be explained by the reality that each of us has two different channels to God.

==History==
{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The history of the LDS Church is typically divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith]], which is in common with all Latter Day Saint movement churches; (2) a pioneer era under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his 19th-century successors; and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century as [[Utah]] achieved statehood.

===Beginnings===
[[File:Joseph Smith first vision stained glass.jpg|upright|thumb|Adherents believe that [[Joseph Smith]] was called to be a modern-day prophet through, among other events, a [[First Vision|visitation]] from [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].]]
{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)}}
The LDS Church, originally called the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], was formally organized by [[Joseph Smith]] on April 6, 1830, in [[burned-over district|western New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholars and eyewitnesses disagree whether the church was organized in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester, New York]] at the Smith log home, or in [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]] at the home of [[Peter Whitmer]]. {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=109}}; {{Harvnb|Marquardt|2005|pp=223–23}} (arguing that organization in Manchester is most consistent with eye-witness statements). The LDS Church officially favors organization in Fayette.{{Citation |last= Lloyd |first= R.

Smith intended to establish the [[New Jerusalem]] in North America, called ''[[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=122}}; LDS {{lds|D&amp;C|dc|57|1|3}}: &quot;the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at [Jackson County, Missouri], even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, the church moved to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] (the eastern boundary of Zion),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=97}} (citing letter by Smith to Kirtland converts, quoted in {{Harvnb|Howe|1833|p=111}}). In 1834, Smith designated Kirtland as one of the &quot;[[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]]&quot; of Zion, referring to the tent–stakes metaphor of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{lds||isa|54|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and began establishing an outpost in [[Jackson County, Missouri]] (Zion's &quot;center place&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=154}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=162}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where he planned to eventually move the church headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Smith said in 1831 that God intended the Mormons to &quot;retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years&quot;. ([[Doctrine and Covenants]] {{lds||dc|64|21}}).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1833, Missouri settlers brutally expelled the Latter Day Saints from Jackson County,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=222–27}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=137}} (noting that the brutality of the Jackson Countians aroused sympathy for the Mormons and was almost universally deplored by the media).&lt;/ref&gt; and the church was unable via a [[Zion's Camp|paramilitary expedition]] to recover the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=141, 146–59}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the church flourished in Kirtland as Smith published new revelations and the church built the [[Kirtland Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=101}}; {{Harvnb|Arrington|1992|p=21}} (by summer of 1835, there were 1500 to 2000 Saints in Kirtland); ''Desert Morning News 2008 Church Almanac'' p. 655 (from 1831 to 1838, church membership grew from 680 to 17,881).&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in a dedication of the building similar to the day of [[Pentecost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=310–19}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|p=178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after a [[Kirtland Safety Society|financial scandal]] rocked the church and caused widespread defections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=328–38}}; {{Harvnb|Brooke|1994|p=221}} (&quot;Ultimately, the rituals and visions dedicating the Kirtland temple were not sufficient to hold the church together in the face of a mounting series of internal disputes.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; Smith regrouped with the remaining church in [[Far West, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1905|p=24}} (referring to the Far West church as the &quot;church in Zion&quot;); {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=345}} (The revelation calling Far West &quot;Zion&quot; had the effect of &quot;implying that Far West was to take the place of Independence&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; but tensions soon escalated into [[Mormon War (1838)|violent conflicts]] with the old Missouri settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=357–364}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=227–30}}; {{Harvnb|Remini|2002|p=134}}; {{Harvnb|Quinn|1994|pp=97–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Believing the Saints to be in insurrection, the [[Lilburn Boggs|Missouri governor]] ordered that the Saints be [[Missouri Executive Order 44|&quot;exterminated or driven from the State]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=367}} (Boggs' executive order stated that the Mormon community had &quot;made war upon the people of this State&quot; and that &quot;the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace&quot;). In 1976, [[Missouri]] issued a formal apology for this unconstitutional order {{Harv|Bushman|2005|p=398}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1839, the Saints converted a swampland on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], which became the church's new headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=383–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nauvoo grew rapidly as [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] sent to Europe and elsewhere gained new converts who then flooded into Nauvoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|p=409}}; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=258, 264–65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Smith introduced [[polygamy]] to his closest associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=334–36}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=437, 644}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also established [[Sealing (Mormonism)|ceremonies]], which he stated the Lord had revealed to him, to allow righteous people to [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|become gods]] (joint heirs with Christ, see [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]])&lt;ref&gt;LDS {{lds|D&amp;C|dc|132|18|20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1975/10/the-lords-plan-for-men-and-women |title= The Lord's Plan for Men and Women |date= October 1975 |first= Spencer W. |last= Kimball |authorlink= Spencer W.

On June 27, 1844, Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were [[Death of Joseph Smith|murdered by a mob]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Latter-Day Saint History'' p. 824; {{Harvnb|Brodie|1971|pp=393–94}}; {{Harvnb|Bushman|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while being held on charges of treason.&lt;ref&gt;Many local Illinoisans were uneasy with Mormon power, and their unease was fanned by the local media after Smith suppressed a newspaper containing an exposé regarding plural marriage, theocracy, and other sensitive and oft-misinterpreted issues. The suppression resulted in Smith being arrested, tried, and acquitted for &quot;inciting a riot&quot;. On June 25, Joseph let himself be arrested and tried for the riot charges again, this time in Carthage, the county seat, where he was incarcerated without bail on a new charge of treason. {{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4208 |contribution= Smith, Joseph: Legal Trials of Joseph Smith |first= Joseph I. |last= Bentley |pages= 1346–1348 |editor1-last= Ludlow |editor1-first= Daniel H |editor1-link= Daniel H.

As a result, Young, and any other senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]], would be ordained [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] as a matter of course upon the death of the former President, subject to unanimous agreement of the Quorum of the Twelve.&lt;/ref&gt; Other splinter groups followed other leaders in their own interpretation of the Latter Day Saint movement.

===Pioneer era===

For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. Smith had predicted that the church would go to the West and be established in the tops of the Rocky Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_prophecies.shtml#rockies |title= LDS FAQ: The Saints to Flourish in the Rocky Mountains |last= Lindsay |first= Jeff |authorlink= Jeff Lindsay (engineer) |accessdate= September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brigham Young]] took Smith's advice and led his followers, known in modern times as the [[Mormon pioneers]], to [[Nebraska]] and then in 1847 to what became the [[Utah Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emigration-religious-freedom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nps.gov/mopi/historyculture/index.htm |title= Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail: History &amp; Culture |website= nps.gov |publisher= [[U.S. National Park Service]] |quote= The great Mormon migration of 1846–1847 was but one step in the LDS' quest for religious freedom and growth. |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208215457/http://www.nps.gov/mopi/historyculture/index.htm |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As groups (over 60,000) arrived over a period of years, LDS settlers branched out and colonized a large region now known as the [[Mormon Corridor]].

Young incorporated the LDS Church as a legal entity, and initially governed both the church and the state as a [[theocracy|theocratic]] leader. He also publicized the practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;The Mormon doctrine of plural wives was officially announced by one of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Twelve Apostles]] [[Orson Pratt]] and Smith's successor [[Brigham Young]] in a special conference of the elders of the church assembled in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] on August 28, 1852, and reprinted in an extra edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]'' Only a small percentage of church leaders participated in plural marriage believing it was a part of a restitution of ancient Priesthood blessings and a commandment of god to raise up a righteous generation. At the time, it was not barred by statute within the United States.{{Cite news | title = Minutes of conference: a special conference of the elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints assembled in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, August 28th, 1852, 10 o'clock, a.m., pursuant to public notice | work = [[Deseret News|Deseret News Extra]] | date = September 14, 1852 | page = 14}}.

By 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Young.&lt;ref&gt;See Tullidge, Edward, ''History of Salt Lake City'', 132-35 (Original from the University of Michigan, 1886).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Utah War|Utah Mormon War]] ensued from 1857 to 1858, which resulted in the relatively peaceful invasion of Utah by the [[United States Army]],&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The most notable instance of violence during this war was the tragic [[Mountain Meadows massacre]], in which leaders of a local Mormon militia, contrary to top church leaders orders, ordered the massacre of a civilian emigrant party who had the misfortune of traveling through Utah during the escalating military tensions. The Mormons feared the mobs which murdered their families at the Haun's mill massacre and other illegal thefts of land, and murders which had plagued them back east.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;To combat the notion that rank-and-file Mormons were unhappy under Young's leadership, Cumming noted that he had offered to help any leave the territory who desired. Of the 50,000 inhabitants of the territory of Utah, the underwhelming response—56 men, 33 women, and 71 children, most of whom stated they left for economic reasons—impressed Cumming, as did the fact that Mormon leaders contributed supplies to the emigrants.

At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other church presidents, who resisted efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the United States Supreme Court, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'', decreed that &quot;religious duty&quot; to engage in plural marriage was not a valid defense to prosecutions for violating state laws against polygamy. Conflict between Mormons and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] escalated to the point that, in 1890, Congress disincorporated the LDS Church and seized most of its assets. Soon thereafter, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|manifesto]] that officially suspended the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Official Declaration —|od|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, so that families would not be split apart, no new polygamous marriages would be performed. Relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. Relations further improved after 1904, when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] again [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before the [[United States Congress]] and issued a &quot;[[Second Manifesto]]&quot;, calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease, as they were already against church doctrine since Woodruff issued the Manifesto. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of [[excommunication|excommunicating]] its members found practicing polygamy and today actively distances itself from &quot;[[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]&quot; groups still practicing polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |quote= If any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose.

[[File:Salt Lake Temple, Utah - Sept 2004-2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Salt Lake Temple]], which took 40 years to build, is one of the most iconic images of the church.]]
During the 20th century, the church grew substantially and became an international organization, due in part to the spread of missionaries around the globe. In 2000, the church reported 60,784 missionaries and global church membership stood at just over 11 million.&lt;ref name=Stats2000&gt;{{citation |title= Statistical Report, 2000 |journal= Ensign |date= May 2001 |page= 22 |first= F.

A number of official changes have taken place to the organization during the modern era. One significant change was the ordination of men of black African descent to the priesthood in 1978, which reversed [[Black people and Mormonism|a policy]] originally instituted by Brigham Young in 1852.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bush 1984 p70&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=445 |chapter= Mormonism's Negro Doctrine: An Historical Overview |last= Bush |first= Lester E., Jr. |year= 1984 |editor1-last= Bush |editor1-first= Lester E., Jr. |editor2-last= Mauss |editor2-first= Armand L. |editor2-link= Armand L.

For example, since the early 1900s, the church has instituted a [[Priesthood Correlation Program]] to centralize church operations and bring them under a hierarchy of priesthood leaders. During the [[Great Depression]], the church also began operating a church welfare system, and it has conducted numerous humanitarian efforts in cooperation with other religious organizations including [[Catholic Relief Services]] and [[Islamic Relief]], as well as secular organizations such as the [[American Red Cross]].

==Teachings and practices==

===Authorized texts===
[[File:Latter-day Saint Scripture Quadruple Combination.jpg|upright=.6|thumb|The written canon of the LDS Church is referred to as its ''[[standard works]]''.]]
The theology of the LDS Church consists of a combination of biblical doctrines with modern revelations and other commentary by LDS leaders, particularly Joseph Smith. The most authoritative sources of theology are the faith's canon of four religious texts, called the &quot;[[standard works]]&quot;. Included in the standard works are the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. The Book of Mormon is said by the church to be &quot;Another Testament of Jesus Christ&quot; that Smith translated from buried [[golden plates]]. The LDS Church believes that the [[Angel Moroni]] told Smith about these golden plates and guided him to find them buried in the [[Hill Cumorah]]. The church believes that this Angel Moroni is at least partial fulfillment of Revelation 14:6 in the Bible. The church characterizes the Book of Mormon as &quot;the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of [the] religion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]] |volume= 4 |page= 461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible, also part of the church's canon, is believed to be &quot;the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}: &quot;We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the church uses the [[Authorized King James Version]]. Sometimes, however, parts of the [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible]] (corrections and restorations of assertedly damaged or lost passages) are considered authoritative. Some excerpts of Smith's translation have been included in the Pearl of Great Price, which also includes further translations by Smith and church historical items. Other historical items and revelations are found in the Doctrine and Covenants.

Another source of authoritative doctrine is the pronouncements of the current Apostles and members of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The church teaches that the First Presidency (the church's president and his counselors) and the Quorum of Twelve Apostles are prophets&lt;ref name=&quot;oct12_conference&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title= The Sustaining of Church Officers |first= Henry B. |last= Eyring |authorlink= Henry B. Eyring |journal= Ensign |date= November 2012 |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2012/11/the-sustaining-of-church-officers |quote= It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.}} For past sustainings, see also: [//www.churchofjesuschrist.org/search?query=sustaining+of+church+officers Search - &quot;The Sustaining of Church Officers&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; and that their teachings are generally given under inspiration from God through the [[Holy Spirit]]. Members of the church [[Common consent (Latter Day Saints)|acknowledge (sustain)]] them regularly as [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]—this is done publicly twice a year at the church's worldwide [[general conference (LDS Church)|general conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oct12_conference&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
[[File:Phil and Marlene.jpg|thumb|upright|A couple after their [[Celestial marriage|marriage]] in the [[Manti Utah Temple]]]]
Several doctrines and practices of the LDS Church are peculiar within Christianity. For example, the [[Mormon cosmology]] and [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] include the doctrines of a [[pre-mortal life]], [[Degrees of Glory|three degrees of heaven]], and [[Exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]]. According to these doctrines, every human spirit is a literal child of a [[God the Father|Heavenly Father]], and each has the potential to continue to learn, grow, and progress in the eternities, eventually achieving eternal life (which Latter-day Saints view as distinct from [[immortality]]), which is to become one with God in the same way that [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] is one with the Father, thus allowing the children of God to become divine beings or &quot;gods&quot; themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51254902|title=The Divinization of the Christian according to the Greek Fathers|last=Gross|first=Jules|last2=|date=2002|publisher=A &amp; C Press|year=|isbn=0736316000|edition= 1st|location=Anaheim, Calif.|page=|pages=|translator-last=Onica|translator-first=Paul|trans-title=|trans-chapter=|oclc=51254902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.i.html|title=Irenaeus: Against Heresies|last=Irenaeus|first=|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Chapter 5, Preface|trans-chapter=|author-link=Irenaeus}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view on the doctrine of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] is also referred to as becoming a &quot;joint-heir with Christ.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM Godhood&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Carter |first= K.

This latter ordinance, known as a [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealing]] ceremony, reflects a singular LDS view with respect to families. According to LDS Church theology, men and women may be &quot;sealed&quot; to one another so that their marital bond continues into the eternities.&lt;ref&gt;A man may be sealed to more than one wife if his previous wives are either dead or legally divorced from him; a living woman, however, may only be sealed to one husband. See {{Citation | author=LDS Church | title=[[Church Handbook of Instructions]] | year=2006 | place=Salt Lake City, Utah | publisher=LDS Church | page=85}}. Thus, there is a common view within the LDS Church that though prohibited by the LDS Church in mortality, [[plural marriage]] will exist in the afterlife.

Kimball]] said that &quot;every male member of the Church should fill a mission&quot;. {{citation |last= Kimball |first= Spencer W. |title= Planning for a Full and Abundant Life |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= May 1974 |page= 86 |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1974/05/planning-for-a-full-and-abundant-life |authorlink= Spencer W.

While there is no compulsion for him to do any of these things, he should do them for his own good.}}. The church's current president, [[Thomas S. Monson]], stated in 2012 that &quot;missionary work is a priesthood duty&quot; and encouraged &quot;all young men who are worthy and who are physically able and mentally capable to respond to the call to serve.&quot;{{citation |last= Monson |first= Thomas S. |title= Welcome to Conference |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2012/11/welcome-to-conference |authorlink= Thomas S.

Prospective male missionaries must be at least 18 years old and no older than 25, not yet married, have completed secondary school, and meet certain criteria for physical fitness and spiritual worthiness. Missionary service is not compulsory, nor is it required for young men to retain their church membership. Unmarried women 19 years and older may also serve as missionaries, generally for a term of 18 months. However, the LDS Church emphasizes that women are not under the same expectation to serve as male members are, and may serve solely as a personal decision. There is no maximum age for missionary service for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=22472472 |title= LDS Church members respond to new mission age rules |first= David Self |last= Newlin |first2= Jennifer |last2= Stagg |date= October 8, 2012 |publisher= [[KSL-TV|KSL]] |accessdate= March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to October 2012, the minimum age for full-time missionary service was generally 19 for men and 21 for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Joseph |last= Walker |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765609643/LDS-Church-lowers-age-requirement-for-missionary-service.html |title= LDS Church lowers age requirement for missionary service |newspaper= Deseret News |date= October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retired couples are encouraged to serve missions, and may serve for either 6-, 12-, 18-, or 23-month terms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Missionary Policy Changes Give More Seniors Opportunity to Serve&quot;, LDS Church News Release, June 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike younger missionaries, these senior missionaries may serve in non-proselytizing capacities such as [[humanitarian aid]] workers or [[family history]] specialists. Other men and women who desire to serve a mission, but may not be able to perform full-time service in another state or country due to health issues, may serve in a service mission. They might assist at Temple Square in Salt Lake City or aide in the seminary systems in schools.

===Comparisons with Christian denominations outside the Latter Day Saint movement===
{{See also|Mormonism and Christianity}}
The LDS Church shares various teachings with other branches of Christianity. These include a belief in the Bible (subject to an acknowledgement that it is imperfect),&lt;ref&gt;Adherents believe in the Bible &quot;as far as it is translated correctly&quot;: see {{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|8}}. Additionally, Joseph Smith taught that the [[Song of Songs|Songs of Solomon]] &quot;are not inspired writings&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the divinity of Jesus, and his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and [[resurrection of Jesus Christ|resurrection]]. LDS theology also includes belief in the doctrine of salvation through Jesus alone, [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restorationism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Articles of Faith|a_of_f|1|6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[millennialism]], [[continuationism]], [[penal substitution]],&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon, Alma 34:8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and a form of [[apostolic succession]]. The practices of [[baptism#Submersion|baptism by immersion]] and the [[eucharist]] (referred to as ''the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]]'') are also held in common. However, the [[Catholic Church]] considers doctrinal differences between the two groups to be so great that it will not accept a prior LDS baptism as evidence of Christian initiation, as it will baptism by other Christian groups, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Protestant]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/theology/mormbap1.htm|title=The Question of the Validity of Baptism Conferred in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints|author=Fr. Luis Ladaria, S.J.|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church does not accept baptisms performed in any other churches, as it teaches that baptism is only valid when it is conducted through proper priesthood authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Restoration of The Gospel in the Latter Days|url=http://mormon.org/restoration|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=Mormon.org|accessdate=July 13, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712133441/http://mormon.org/restoration/|archivedate=July 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the LDS Church differs from the many other churches within contemporary Christianity, and many people do not accept the church as part of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For example, a 2007 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 31 percent of Americans surveyed do not consider Mormons to be Christian.{{cite web|title=Public Expresses Mixed Views of Islam, Mormonism|url=http://pewforum.org/surveys/religionviews07/|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|website=PewForum.org|date=September 25, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The faith itself views other modern Christian faiths as having departed from true Christianity via a [[Great Apostasy|general apostasy]] and maintains that it is a restoration of 1st-century Christianity and the only true and authorized Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith | title=Church History [Wentworth Letter] | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | volume=3 | issue=9 | pages=706–10 [707]  | date=March 1, 1842a | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm#706}} (traditional Christian denominations &quot;were believing in incorrect doctrines, and that none of them was acknowledged of God as His church and kingdom&quot;). {{Citation | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith | title=History of Joseph Smith | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | volume=3 | issue=11 | pages=748–49  | date=April 1, 1842c | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n11.htm#748}} Stating that Jesus told Smith that all existing Christian creeds &quot;were an abomination in his sight&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;C 1:30 (LDS Church is the &quot;only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between the LDS Church and most of traditional Christianity include disagreement with aspects of the [[Nicene Creed]], belief in a theory of [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|human salvation]] that includes three heavens (referred to as &quot;[[degrees of glory]]&quot;, its interpretation of I Cor. 15:35 ''et.seq.''),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Spencer W.

Officially, major Christian denominations view the LDS Church as standing apart from [[creed]]al Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Citation|url=http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/study/lds.htm|title=Presbyterians and Latter-day Saints|accessdate=January 30, 2007}} ([[Presbyterian Church USA]], stating that &quot;Mormonism is a new and emerging religious tradition distinct from the historic apostolic tradition of the Christian Church&quot;); {{Citation|url=http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|title=Should Lutherans Rebaptize Former Mormons Who Are Joining the Congregation?|accessdate=August 15, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211010129/http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/faq/baptism/rebaptize.html|archivedate=February 11, 2006|df=mdy-all}} [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], stating that LDS Church doctrine regarding the [[Trinity]] is &quot;substantially different from that of orthodox, creedal Christianity&quot;; {{Citation|url=http://www.gc2000.org/pets/cal/TEXT/c0806.asp|title=General Conference 2000 806-NonDis|accessdate=August 15, 2006}} ([[United Methodist Church]], stating that the LDS Church, &quot;by self-definition, does not fit within the bounds of the historic, apostolic tradition of Christian faith&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders of the LDS Church assert that the LDS Church is the only true church and that other churches do not have the authority to act in Jesus' name.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Joseph Smith]], Jesus told him that the other churches claiming to be Christian creeds &quot;were an abomination in the Lords sight; that those professors [of religion] were all corrupt&quot;.  ''Pearl of Great Price'', [[Joseph Smith—History]] 1:19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of Christians who agree with creeds, the most significant area of departure is the rejection by the LDS Church of certain parts of ecumenical creeds such as the Nicene Creed, which defines the predominant view of the Christian God as a [[Trinity]] of three separate persons in &quot;[[Homoousian|one essence]]&quot;. LDS Church theology includes the belief in a &quot;[[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]]&quot; composed of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three separate Persons who share a unity of purpose or will; however, they are viewed as three distinct Beings making one Godhead. Other significant differences relate to the church's acceptance of additional scripture, doctrine, and practices beyond what is found in the Catholic, Protestant, or [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] versions of the Bible.

===Comparison with other Latter Day Saint movement faiths===
{{See also|List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement}}
The LDS Church shares a common heritage with a number of smaller faith groups that are collectively called the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. The largest of these smaller groups is the [[Community of Christ]] (previously known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), based in [[Independence, Missouri]], followed by [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)|The Church of Jesus Christ]], based in [[Monongahela, Pennsylvania]]. Like the LDS Church, these faiths believe in Joseph Smith as a prophet and founder of their religion. They also accept the Book of Mormon, and most, but not all, accept at least some version of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. However, they tend to disagree to varying degrees with the LDS Church concerning doctrine and church leadership.

The main branches of the Latter Day Saint movement resulted from the crisis of succession upon the death of Joseph Smith. Other branches may be considered later offshoots of the LDS Church branch, mainly due to disagreements about plural marriage.

Church congregations are organized geographically. Members are generally expected to attend the congregation with their assigned geographical area; however, some geographical areas also provide separate congregations for young single adults (between the ages of 18 and 30), single adults aged 31 to 45,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 2: Administering the Church]] |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |contribution-url= //www.churchofjesuschrist.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/single-members |contribution= 16. Single Members}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for speakers of alternate languages. For Sunday services, the church is grouped into either larger (150 to 400 people) congregations known as [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]], or smaller congregations known as branches. Although the building may sometimes be referred to as a chapel, the room used as a chapel for religious services is only one component of the standard [[meetinghouse]]. The church maintains a virtual tour online of a typical example and also an online meetinghouse locator, which can be used to find the locations and meeting times of its congregations all over the world. Regional church organizations, encompassing multiple congregations, include [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]], [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]], [[District (LDS Church)|districts]], [[Area (LDS Church)|areas]], and regions.

===Priesthood hierarchy===
{{Main|Priesthood (LDS Church)}}
[[File:Russell M. Nelson.png|upright|left|thumb|[[Russell M. Nelson]], current President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.]]
The LDS Church is organized in a hierarchical priesthood structure administered by men. Latter-day Saints believe that [[Jesus]] leads the church through revelation and has chosen a single man, called &quot;the Prophet&quot; or President of the Church, as his spokesman on the earth.  While there have been exceptions in the past, he and two counselors are normally ordained [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] and form the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the presiding body of the church; twelve other apostles form the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haight, David B. 1986&quot;&gt;{{citation|authorlink=David B. Haight|last=Haight|first=David B.|url=http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/1986/05/a-prophet-chosen-of-the-lord|title=A Prophet Chosen of the Lord|magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]|date=May 1986|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a president dies, his successor is invariably the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve (the one who has been an apostle the longest), who reconstitutes a new First Presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haight, David B. 1986&quot;/&gt; Following the death of church president [[Thomas S. Monson]] on January 2, 2018, senior apostle [[Russell M. Nelson]] was named president on January 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/leader-biographies/president-russell-m-nelson|title=President Russell M. Nelson|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These men, and the other male members of the church-wide leadership (including the first two [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Quorums of Seventy]] and the [[Presiding Bishopric (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]]) are called [[general authority|general authorities]]. They exercise both [[ecclesiastical]] and administrative leadership over the church and direct the efforts of regional leaders down to the local level. General authorities and [[mission president]]s work full-time and typically receive stipends from church funds or investments.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, Daniel H., ''Latter-day Prophets Speak: Selections from the Sermons and Writings of Church Presidents'', 1948/1993, ch. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice each year (in April and October), general authorities address the worldwide church through [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference,]] which includes five two-hour sessions over the course of two days. General conference sessions are translated into as many as 80 languages and are broadcast from the 21,000-seat Conference Center in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/general-conference|title=Mormons Gather Twice a Year for General Conference|date=2011-07-14|work=www.mormonnewsroom.org|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to general conference, general authorities speak to church members in local congregations throughout the world; they also frequently speak to youth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face/nelson?lang=eng|title=Face to Face with President and Sister Nelson|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and young adults&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults?lang=eng|title=Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in special broadcasts and at the Church Educational System schools, such as [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://speeches.byu.edu|title=BYU Devotionals, Forums, Commencement Addresses - BYU Speeches|website=BYU Speeches|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224062323/https://speeches.byu.edu/|archive-date=February 24, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the local level, the church leadership are drawn from the laity and work on a part-time volunteer basis without stipend.&lt;ref&gt;For a time, the church had a paid local clergy; however, that practice was discontinued in the early 1900s. See [[D. Michael Quinn]] (1997), ''Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power,'' Salt Lake City: Signature Books, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Like all members, they are asked to donate a tithe of 10 percent of their income to the church. An exception to that rule is for LDS missionaries, who work at the local level and are paid basic living expenses from a fund that receives contributions from their families or home congregations. However, prospective missionaries are encouraged to contribute the cost of their missions to this fund themselves when possible. Members volunteer general custodial work for local church facilities.

All males who are living the standards of the church are generally considered for the [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] and are ordained to the priesthood as early as age 11. Ordination occurs by a ceremony where [[laying on of hands|hands are laid]] on the head of the one ordained. The priesthood is divided into three [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic priesthood]] quorums for young men 11 and up, and a [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] quorum for men 18 and up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Aaronic Priesthood {{!}} The Priesthood of Aaron|url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/aaronic-priesthood|website = www.churchofjesuschrist.org|accessdate = December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Melchizedek Priesthood|url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood|website = www.churchofjesuschrist.org|accessdate = December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs and organizations===
{{See also|Auxiliary organization (LDS Church)}}
Under the leadership of the priesthood hierarchy are five organizations that fill various roles in the church: [[Relief Society]] (a women's organization),&lt;ref&gt;The [[Relief Society]] was founded in 1842 in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], and with the motto &quot;Charity Never Faileth&quot;, the organization today includes more than 5 million women in more than 165 countries. {{Citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/relief-society-history |work= MormonNewsroom.org |title= Topic: Relief Society History |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}. Every Latter-day Saint woman age 18 or older is a member of the Relief Society.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Young Men organization|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations (for adolescents ages 12 to 18), [[Primary (LDS Church)|Primary]] (an organization for children up to age 12), and [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] (which provides a variety of Sunday classes for adolescents and adults). Women serve as presidents and counselors in the presidencies of the Relief Society, Young Women, and Primary, while men serve as presidents and counselors of the Young Men and Sunday School.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Organization How the Church Is Organized |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/church-organization/how-the-church-is-organized |work= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church also operates several programs and organizations in the fields of proselytizing, education, and church welfare such as [[LDS Humanitarian Services]]. Many of these organizations and programs are coordinated by the [[Priesthood Correlation Program]], which is designed to provide a systematic approach to maintain worldwide consistency, orthodoxy, and control of the church's ordinances, doctrines, organizations, meetings, materials, and other programs and activities.

[[File:BYUclarillon.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Brigham Young University Centennial Carillon Tower|carillon tower]] at [[Brigham Young University]], one of several educational institutions sponsored by the church]]
The church operates a [[Church Educational System]] which includes [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) (and its associated [[Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center|Jerusalem Center]]), [[Brigham Young University–Idaho|BYU–Idaho]], [[Brigham Young University–Hawaii|BYU–Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]]. The church also operates [[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]] near the campuses of many colleges and universities. For high-school aged youth, the church operates a four-year [[LDS Seminary|Seminary program]], which provides religious classes for students to supplement their secular education. The church also sponsors a low-interest educational loan program known as the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], which provides educational opportunities to students from [[developing nations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MormonNewsroom.org Education&quot;&gt;{{citation |publisher= LDS Church |title= Topic: Education |work= MormonNewsroom.org |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/topic/education |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LDS genealogy library slc utah.jpg|thumb|right|The church's [[Family History Library]] is the world's largest library dedicated to [[genealogy|genealogical research]]]]
The church's welfare system, initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provides aid to the poor. It is financed by [[fast offering]]s: monthly donations beyond the normal 10 percent tithe, which represents the cost of forgoing two meals on monthly [[Fast Sunday]]s. Money from the program is used to operate [[Bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]]. The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Philanthropies]] division to disaster victims worldwide.

Other church programs and departments include [[Family Services]], which provides assistance with [[adoption]], [[relationship counseling|marital and family counseling]], [[psychotherapy]], and [[intervention (counseling)|addiction counseling]]; the LDS Church History Department, which collects church history and records; and the Family History Department, which administers the church's large [[family history]] efforts, including the world's largest [[Family History Library|family history library]] and organization ([[FamilySearch]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |title=AAG International Research |author=AAG International Research |publisher=AAG |accessdate=October 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212071828/http://www.intl-research.com/overview.htm |archive-date=December 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For over 100 years, the church has also a major sponsor of [[Scouting]] programs for boys, particularly in the United States, where it provides more members of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) than any other church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Boy Scouts of America Membership Report&amp;nbsp;– 2007 |date=January 7, 2008 |url=http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=P.R.A.Y. |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182132/http://www.praypub.org/pdf_docs/BSA_Membership_Report_2007.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2018, the church announced it will no longer sponsor BSA programs, effective the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/new-program-children-youth|title= Church Announces Plan for Worldwide Initiative for Children and Youth |work= Newsroom |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= May 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finances===
{{Main|Finances of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Although the church has not released church-wide financial statements since 1959, in 1997, ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine called it one of the world's wealthiest churches per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Biema|first=David|title=Kingdom Come|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986794,00.html|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=August 4, 1997|accessdate=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2011 cover story, ''[[Newsweek]]'' stated that the LDS Church &quot;resembles a sanctified multinational corporation—the General Electric of American religion, with global ambitions and an estimated net worth of $30 billion.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NewsMorm&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.newsweek.com/mormon-moment-67951 |title= The Mormon Moment |first= Walter |last= Kirn |authorlink= Walter Kirn |journal= [[Newsweek]] |date= June 5, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208224741/http://www.newsweek.com/mormon-moment-67951 |archive-date= December 8, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its for-profit, non-profit, and educational subsidiary entities are audited by an independent accounting firm: {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, some done by [[Deloitte &amp; Touche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sec.edgar-online.com/1995/04/10/00/0000950134-95-000692/Section3.asp |title= Belo Corp 8-K/A SEC Filing § 3 |website= sec.edgar-online.com |publisher= [[EDGAR Online]] |date= April 10, 1995 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090107214358/http://sec.edgar-online.com/1995/04/10/00/0000950134-95-000692/Section3.asp |archive-date= January 7, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Planning|url=http://finserve.byu.edu/files/archives/Handouts/November%202005/Finance%20Section%20Draft%207-Without%20Requirements.doc|website=FinServe.BYU.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527195714/http://finserve.byu.edu/files/archives/Handouts/November%202005/Finance%20Section%20Draft%207-Without%20Requirements.doc|archivedate=May 27, 2008|accessdate=September 13, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the church employs an independent [[audit]] department that provides its certification at each annual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] that church contributions are collected and spent in accordance with church policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Cantwell |first= Robert W. |date= May 2007 |title= Church Auditing Department Report, 2006 |journal= Ensign |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/ensign/2007/05/church-auditing-department-report-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church receives significant funds from [[tithe]]s and [[fast offering]]s. According to the church, tithing and fast offering money is devoted to ecclesiastical purposes and not used in for-profit ventures. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-of-jesus-christ-finances|title=How the Church of Jesus Christ Uses Tithes and Donations|date=2019-12-20|website=newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that the LDS Church received $33-billion in donations from its members in 2010 and, during the decade of the 2010s to net about $15-billion gains per year.

In December 2019, a whistleblower alleged the church holds over $100 billion in investment funds, which are managed by an affiliate, [[Ensign Peak Advisors]]; that it failed to use the funds for charitable purposes and instead used them in for-profit ventures; and that it misled contributors and the public about the usage and extent of those funds. According to the whistleblower, applicable law requires the funds be used for religious, educational or other charitable purposes for the fund to maintain its tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;If confirmed, the $100 billion net worth would exceed the combined net worths of the world's largest university endowment (Harvard University) and the world's largest philanthropic foundation (Gates Foundation). {{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/mormon-church-has-misled-members-on-100-billion-tax-exempt-investment-fund-whistleblower-alleges/2019/12/16/e3619bd2-2004-11ea-86f3-3b5019d451db_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|title=Mormon Church has misled members on $100 billion tax-exempt investment fund, whistleblower alleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have argued that such expenditures may not be legally required as claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Due to the categorization of Ensign Peak Advisors as an &quot;integrated auxiliary of a church&quot;, not a public foundation.{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2019/12/17/100b-in-mormon-till-does-not-merit-irs-attention/#18d34f375d5b|title=$100 Billion In Mormon Till Does Not Merit IRS Attention|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the allegations, the church's First Presidency stated that &quot;the Church complies with all applicable law governing our donations, investments, taxes, and reserves,&quot; and that &quot;a portion&quot; of funds received by the church are &quot;methodically safeguarded through wise financial management and the building of a prudent reserve for the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/first-presidency-statement-church-finances |title= First Presidency Statement on Church Finances: Statement provided in response to media stories |work= Newsroom |publisher= [[LDS Church]] |date= December 17, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
Due to the differences in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, members of the church have developed a distinct culture. It is primarily concentrated in the [[Intermountain West]]. Many of the church's more distinctive practices include adhering to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code which outlines guidelines for maintaining good health. Among these guidelines are instructions prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and improper drug use.&lt;ref name = wordofwisdom/&gt; As a result of members adhering to the Word of Wisdom, areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS members practice these restrictions. They sometimes come into conflict with local retail businesses that serve non-members.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |author= Editorial Board |url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_4903619 |title= Liquor stores: Banning phone listings, stores won't stop abuse |date= December 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/living-well-usn/2008/12/15/americas-10-fittest-citiesand-10-least-fit-too.html |title=America's 10 Fittest Cities—and 10 Least Fit, Too |author= Megan Johnson |date=December 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meetings and outreach programs are held regularly and have become part of Latter-day Saint culture.

===Media and arts===
The culture has created substantial business opportunities for independent LDS media. Such communities include [[LDS cinema|cinema]], [[LDS fiction|fiction]], websites, and graphical art such as photography and paintings. The church owns a chain of bookstores called [[Deseret Book]], which provide a channel through which publications are sold. Titles including ''[[The Work and the Glory]]'' and ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' have found acceptance both within and outside the church; [[BYU TV]], the church-sponsored television station, also airs on several networks. The church also produces [[List of pageants of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|several pageants]] annually depicting various events of the primitive and modern-day church. Its [[Mesa Arizona Easter Pageant|Easter pageant ''Jesus the Christ'']] has been identified as the &quot;largest annual outdoor Easter pageant in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EVT&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 |title=Mesa Mormon temple prepares for Easter pageant |work=[[East Valley Tribune]] |date=March 24, 2007 |first=Lawn |last=Griffiths |accessdate=November 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911150555/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/86475 |archivedate=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After interviewing and polling thousands of youth across America, evangelical statistician Christian Smith writes, &quot;in general comparisons among major U.S. religious traditions using a variety of sociological measures of religious vitality and salience .... it is Mormon teenagers who are sociologically faring the best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1= Christian |last1= Smith |first2= Melinda Lundquist |last2= Denton |title= Soul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers |page= 261 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 019518095X |oclc= 55947930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social events and gatherings===

Additional meetings are also frequently held at the meetinghouse. Church officers may conduct leadership meetings or host training sessions and classes. The ward or branch community may schedule social activities at the meetinghouse, including dances, dinners, holiday parties and musical presentations. The church's [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men]] and [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women]] organizations meet at the meetinghouse once a week, where the youth participate in activities. In 2020, the church implemented a new initiative for children &amp; youth worldwide (for ages 7-18) that focuses on four areas of personal and group development, and which replaced all other programs as of January 1 of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAQ&quot; &gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/english/pdf/children-and-youth/17313_000_notice.pdf?lang=eng Children and Youth—Overview and Frequently Asked Questions], Official Notice from Priesthood and Family Department, churchofjesuschrist.org. Retrieved 8 January 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular activities are basketball, family history conferences, youth and singles conferences, dances, and various personal improvement classes. Church members may also reserve meetinghouses at no cost for weddings, receptions, and funerals.

Also beginning with the new initiative in 2020, during the summer, the LDS Church provides week-long experiences, known as For the Strength of Youth Conferences.  This effectively replaced what was previously known as [[Especially for Youth]], offered through BYU. The program is held Monday through Saturday during the summer months for youth ages 14 to 18. During this week, youth spend the night in college campus dorms and the day in various classes taught by adult religious educators, as well as participating in other various activities such as scripture study and dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Craig|first1=Chanelle|title=Especially For Youth|url=http://ldsefy.weebly.com|publisher=Chanelle Craig|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political involvement===
{{Main|LDS Church and politics in the United States}}
The LDS Church takes no partisan role in politics, stating that it will not &quot;endorse, promote or oppose political parties, candidates or platforms; allow its church buildings, membership lists or other resources to be used for partisan political purposes; attempt to direct its members as to which candidate or party they should give their votes to ... or attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PN&quot;&gt;{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/church-reemphasizes-political-neutrality |title= News Story: Church Reemphasizes Political Neutrality |date= December 6, 2007 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the church takes an apolitical approach to candidates, it encourages its members to play an active role as responsible citizens in their communities, including becoming informed about issues and voting in elections. It actively works to counter anti-Mormonism that may come up during political campaigns. A 2012 [[Pew Center]] on Religion and Public Life survey indicates that 74 percent of U.S. members lean towards the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC News&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/pew-survey-most-mormons-feel-they-are-misunderstood-not-viewed-as-mainstream/|title=Majority of Mormons Lean Republican; Half Cite Discrimination Against Their Faith|date=January 12, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some liberal members say they feel that they have to defend their worthiness due to political differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/30/mormon-liberals-minority/1669155/|title=Liberal Mormons: A Minority Within a Minority|date=October 30, 2012|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the 2012 U.S Republican Presidential Primary, [[Michael Otterson]], the LDS Church's managing director for public affairs stated, &quot;We now have two Latter-day Saints running, and the potential for misunderstanding or missteps is therefore twice what it was before.&quot;&lt;ref name=wsj20110803&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|title=Mormons Duck Political Duel|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 3, 2011|pages=A1, A6|url=http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904772304576470442390289196.html?mod=WSJ_WSJ_US_News_5&amp;mg=reno-wsj}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Gerard|Jack N.

Welfare efforts, originally initiated during the [[Great Depression]], provide aid for the poor, financed by donations from church members. LDSP is also responsible for philanthropic donations to the LDS Church and other affiliated charities, such as the [[Church History Library]], the [[Church Educational System]]—which includes [[Brigham Young University]], the [[Perpetual Education Fund]], and the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]]—the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], and efforts dedicated to providing funds for [[missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]] and [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/ |title= LDS Philanthropies: Helping Change and Save Lives |publisher= [[LDS Philanthropies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=March 2014}} Donations are also used to operate [[bishop's storehouse]]s, which package and store food for the poor at low cost. Distribution of funds and food is administered by local [[Bishop (LDS Church)|bishops]]. These local storehouses distribute commodities to the needy as requested by local bishops on a specified form. Bishop's storehouses also provide service opportunities for those receiving assistance and for those desiring to serve missions or to volunteer in the church's welfare program. The day-to-day operations of the storehouses are typically run by senior-aged missionaries as store managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://apps.churchofjesuschrist.org/welfareoperations/overview.jsf?operation=bishops.storehouses |contribution= Overview of Bishops' Storehouses |title= Welfare Operations Training |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church also distributes money through its [[LDS Humanitarian Services|Humanitarian Services]] division to natural disaster victims worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/annual-report-highlights-church-emergency-relief |title= News Story: Annual Report Highlights Church Emergency Relief |date= March 9, 2011 |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church's Humanitarian Center, established in 1991, prepares emergency relief supplies for worldwide shipment to disaster victims, works to establish a global sense of self-reliance, and offers service opportunities to both church members and non-members. The emergency relief supplies that the church donates typically include clothing, personal care kits, and medical supplies. According to the LDS Humanitarian Center website, it ships about 12 million pounds of shoes and clothing, one million hygiene kits, and one million pounds of medical supplies per year, to relieve suffering in more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/humanitarian-service/center?lang=eng |title= Humanitarian Services: Latter-day Saint Humanitarian Center |work= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a disaster strikes, the church works with local government officials and other organizations to determine the immediate needs, and sends the necessary supplies and food to the affected area within hours. Missionaries are then sent to help alleviate other long-term damages by assisting injured persons and reconstructing damaged buildings. The church carries out these efforts without regard to the nationality or religion of the recipients. According to the church's newsroom, 100 percent of the financial contributions donated to [[LDS Charities]] are used for humanitarian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/topic/humanitarian-services |title= Topic: Humanitarian Services |work= MormonNewsroom.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The LDS Church has been subject to criticism and sometimes [[Anti-Mormonism|discrimination]] since its early years in New York and [[Pennsylvania]]. In the late&amp;nbsp;1820s, criticism centered around the claim by Joseph Smith to have been led to a set of gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was reputedly translated.

In the 1830s, the greatest criticism was for Smith's handling of a [[Kirtland Safety Society|banking failure]] in Kirtland, Ohio. After the Mormons migrated west, there was fear and suspicion about the LDS Church's political and military power in Missouri, culminating in the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] and the infamous Mormon Extermination Order (Missouri Executive Order 44) by Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]].  In the 1840s, criticism of the church centered on its [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] aspirations in Nauvoo, Illinois. Criticism of the practice of [[plural marriage]] and other doctrines taught by Smith were published in the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]].'' Opposition led to a series of events culminating in [[Death of Joseph Smith|murder of Smith and his brother while jailed]] in 1844.
[[File:Prop8templeProtest.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters in front of the [[Newport Beach California Temple]] voicing their opposition to the church's support of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Prop 8]]]]

As the church began openly practicing [[plural marriage]] under [[Brigham Young]] during the second half of the 19th century, the church became the target of nationwide criticism for that practice, as well as for the church's theocratic aspirations in the Utah Territory. Beginning in 1857, the church also came under [[Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|significant media criticism]] after the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] in southern Utah.

Academic critics have questioned the legitimacy of Smith as a prophet as well as the [[Criticism of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Abraham]]. Criticism has expanded to include claims of historical revisionism, homophobia, racism, and sexist policies. Notable 20th-century critics include [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] and historian [[Fawn Brodie]]. [[Evangelical Christians]] continue to argue that Smith was either fraudulent or [[delusion]]al.

[[Mormon apologetics]] organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have been founded to counter these criticisms. Most of the apologetic work focuses on providing and discussing evidence supporting the claims of Smith and the Book of Mormon. Scholars and authors such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[James E. Talmage]] are well-known apologists within the church.

During the [[civil rights era]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the LDS Church was criticized for its [[Blacks and Mormonism|policy of excluding black men of African descent]] from the priesthood, a policy that the church changed in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=John G.|title=Out of Obscurity: Mormonism Since 1945|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199358222|pages=132–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqdHDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, the Internet has provided a new forum for proponents and critics of religions, including the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;
