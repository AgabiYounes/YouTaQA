Climates can be [[Climate classification|classified]] according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The Thornthwaite system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/210739|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/801/001/www/ET/Thornthwaite48-GeogrRev.pdf|author=C. W.

The Bergeron and [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]]s focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.

[[Paleoclimatology]] is the study of ancient climates. Since very few direct observations of climate are available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from [[Proxy (climate)|proxy variables]] that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in [[lake beds]] and [[ice core]]s, and biotic evidence such as [[Dendrochronology|tree rings]] and coral. [[Climate model]]s are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in [[global warming]]. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, &quot;a 3{{formatnum:}}°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological consequences of globalwarming: is the signal already|last=Hughes|first=Lesley|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=56|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TIEE-20000201&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=Leslie |title=Biological consequences of global warming: is the signal already apparent? |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/abstract/S0169-5347(99)01764-4 |date=1 February 2000 |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=56–61 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01764-4 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|2001]] glossary definition is as follows:

{{quote|''Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the &quot;average weather,&quot; or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30&amp;nbsp;years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

The [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) describes climate &quot;normals&quot; as &quot;reference points used by climatologists to compare current climatological trends to that of the past or what is considered 'normal'. A Normal is defined as the arithmetic average of a climate element (e.g. temperature) over a 30-year period. A 30 year period is used, as it is long enough to filter out any interannual variation or anomalies, but also short enough to be able to show longer climatic trends.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WMO data&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Data and Data Related Products |website=[[World Meteorological Organization]] |url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_data_and_products.php |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20141001233620/https%3A//www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_data_and_products.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 October 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WMO originated from the [[International Meteorological Organization]] which set up a technical commission for climatology in 1929. At its 1934 [[Wiesbaden]] meeting the technical commission designated the thirty-year period from 1901 to 1930 as the reference time frame for climatological standard normals. In 1982 the WMO agreed to update climate normals, and these were subsequently completed on the basis of climate data from 1 January 1961 to 31 December 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;WMO history&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Commission For Climatology: Over Eighty Years of Service |year=2011 | publisher=World Meteorological Organization | url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/documents/WMO1079_web.pdf |pp=6, 8, 10, 21, 26 | accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate classification==
There are several ways to [[Climate classification|classify climates]] into similar regimes. Originally, [[clime]]s were defined in [[Ancient Greece]] to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into ''genetic'' methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and ''empiric'' methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the [[relative frequency]] of different [[air mass]] types or locations within [[synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic]] weather disturbances. Examples of [[empirical|empiric]] classifications include [[climate zone]]s defined by [[plant hardiness]],&lt;ref&gt;[[United States National Arboretum]]. [http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704232205/http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/ushzmap.html |date=2012-07-04 }} Retrieved on 2008-03-09&lt;/ref&gt; evapotranspiration,&lt;ref name=&quot;thorn&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Thornthwaite Moisture Index|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=Thornthwaite&amp;submit=Search|accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally the [[Köppen climate classification]] which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain [[biome]]s. A common shortcoming of these [[classification scheme]]s is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.

===Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic===
The simplest classification is that involving [[air mass]]es. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqQXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA50|title=Field behavior of chemical, biological, and radiological agents|last=Army|first=United States Dept of the|date=1969|publisher=Dept. of Defense] Depts. of the Army and the Air Force|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its [[moisture]] properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for [[tropical]], P for [[Polar region|polar]], A for [[Arctic]] or Antarctic, M for [[monsoon]], E for [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]], and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the [[atmosphere]]. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title = Airmass Classification|encyclopedia = Glossary of Meteorology|publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]]|url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=airmass-classification1|accessdate = 2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While air mass identification was originally used in [[weather forecasting]] during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.&lt;ref name=Schwartz1995&gt;{{cite journal|author = Schwartz, M.D.|year = 1995|title = Detecting Structural Climate Change: An Air Mass-Based Approach in the North Central United States, 1958–1992|journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 553–68|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.1995.tb01812.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the [[Spatial Synoptic Classification system]] (SSC). There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).&lt;ref&gt;Robert E.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A) tropical, B) dry, C) mild mid-latitude, D) cold mid-latitude, and E) polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rainforest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[desert]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], and [[polar ice cap]].

'''Rainforests''' are characterized by high [[rainfall]], with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between {{convert|1750|mm|in}} and {{convert|2000|mm|in}}. Mean monthly temperatures exceed {{convert|18|C|F}} during all months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Woodward.

A '''desert''' is a [[landscape]] form or region that receives very little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Deserts usually have a large [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] and seasonal temperature range, with high or low, depending on location daytime temperatures (in summer up to {{convert|45|°C|°F|disp=or}}), and low nighttime temperatures (in winter down to {{convert|0|°C|°F|disp=or}}) due to extremely low [[humidity]]. Many deserts are formed by [[rain shadow]]s, as mountains block the path of moisture and precipitation to the desert.&lt;ref&gt;[[San Diego State University]].

Details of the modern climate record are known through the taking of measurements from such weather instruments as [[thermometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, and [[anemometer]]s during the past few centuries. The instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Weart.

Climate change is the variation in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Arctic Climatology and Meteorology.

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], the term &quot;climate change&quot; often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface [[temperature]] known as [[global warming]]. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the [[United Nations]] [[UNFCCC|Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses &quot;climate variability&quot; for non-human caused variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm |title=Glossary |work=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major [[ice age]]s. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by [[interglacial]] periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface [[albedo]], reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in [[greenhouse gas]]es, such as by [[Volcanic impacts on the oceans|volcanic activity]], can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the [[continent]]s, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;Illinois State Museum (2002).

===Climate models===
{{see also|Climate model|Climatology}}
Climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]],&lt;ref&gt;Eric Maisonnave. [http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/research/variability/ Climate Variability.] Retrieved on 2008-05-02. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610145233/http://www.cerfacs.fr/globc/research/variability/ |date=June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ocean]]s, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.

The most talked-about applications of these models in recent years have been their use to infer the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily [[carbon dioxide]] (see [[greenhouse gas]]). These models predict an upward trend in the [[surface temperature record|global mean surface temperature]], with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:
* Simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energy
* this can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontally
* finally, (coupled) atmosphere–ocean–[[sea ice]] [[global climate model]]s discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Climateprediction.net.
