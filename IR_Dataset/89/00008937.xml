'''''Dsungaripterus''''' is a [[genus]] of [[pterosaur]], with an average wingspan of {{convert|3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=EoDP&gt;{{cite book |editor=Palmer, D.|year=1999 |title= The Marshall Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals|publisher= Marshall Editions|location=London|page= 105|isbn= 1-84028-152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lived during the [[Early Cretaceous]], in China, where the first fossil was found in the [[Junggar Basin]].

==Description==
[[Image:Dsungaripterus weii.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Dsungaripterus'' (above) and the related ''[[Noripterus]]'']]
''Dsungaripterus weii'' had a wing span of 3 to 3.5 metres (9.8-11.5&amp;nbsp;ft). Like most dsungaripteroids it had a rather robust skeleton with thick walls and stouty bodily proportions, suggesting a mostly terrestrial lifestyle. The flight style of these animals is unclear, but it was probably punctuated by abrupt landings and extensive flapping.&lt;ref&gt;Witton, Mark (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy. Princeton University Press. p. 51. {{ISBN|978-0691150611}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its skull, forty to fifty centimetres long, bore a low bone crest that ran down from the base of the skull to halfway to the beak. ''Dsungaripterus'''s head and neck were together almost a meter long. Its most notable feature are its long, narrow, upcurved jaws with a pointed tip. It had no teeth in the front part of its jaws, which were probably used to remove prey from cracks in rocks or/and the sandy, muddy inland environments it inhabited. It had knobbly flat teeth more to the back of the jaw that were well suited for crushing the armor of shellfish or other hard objects.&lt;ref name=EoDP/&gt;

==History of discovery==
[[File:Dsungaripterus-Paleozoological Museum of China.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Holotype specimen, [[Paleozoological Museum of China]]]]
''Dsungaripterus'' was described in 1964 named by [[Yang Zhongjian]]. The genus name combines a reference to the Junggar Basin with a Latinized Greek ''pteron'', &quot;wing&quot;. The [[type species]] is ''Dsungaripterus weii'', the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] honouring paleontologist C.M. Wei of the Palaeontological Division, Institute of Science, Bureau of Petroleum of [[Xinjiang]]. The [[holotype]] is IVPP V-2776, a partial skull and skeleton. From 1973 more material has been found including almost complete skulls.

In 1980 [[Peter Galton]] renamed ''Pterodactylus brancai'' (Reck 1931), a form from a late Jurassic African formation, into ''Dsungaripterus brancai'', but the identification is now commonly rejected. In 1982 [[Natasha Bakhurina]] named a new species, ''Dsungaripterus parvus'', based on a smaller skeleton from [[Mongolia]]. Later this was renamed into &quot;Phobetor&quot;, a preoccupied name, and in 2009 concluded to be identical to ''[[Noripterus]]''. In 2002 a ''Dsungaripterus'' wing finger phalanx was reported from [[Korea]].
