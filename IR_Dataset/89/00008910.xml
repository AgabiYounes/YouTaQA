'''Dean Ray Koontz''' (born July 9, 1945) is an American author. His novels are billed as [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thriller]]s, but frequently incorporate elements of [[horror fiction|horror]], fantasy, science fiction, [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]], and [[satire]]. Many of his books have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], with 14 hardcovers&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt chart toppers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/15/books/review/bestsellers-weekly-graphic.html |title=Koontz’s Chart Toppers |date=January 11, 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-29 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 16 paperbacks reaching the number-one position.&lt;ref name=&quot;deankoontz.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/ |title=About Dean |website=Deankoontz.com |accessdate=23 September 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koontz wrote under a number of [[pen name]]s earlier in his career, including &quot;David Axton&quot;, &quot;Deanna Dwyer&quot; , &quot;K.R. Dwyer&quot; , &quot;Leigh Nichols&quot;, and &quot;Brian Coffey&quot;.
He has published over 105 novels, a number of novellas and collections of short stories, and has sold over 450&amp;nbsp;million copies of his work.

==Early life==
Koontz was born on July 9, 1945, in [[Everett, Pennsylvania]], the son of Florence (née Logue) and Raymond Koontz.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegoodplace.info/adultdating/index_zp_de.php|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130208224509/http://thegoodplace.info/adultdating/index_zp_de.php?kw=houses+for+sale&amp;ta=foxtrot-pic-NV0XhtX4&amp;1=1|url-status=dead|title=ichwillsex.de|access-date=2019-09-07|archive-date=2013-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering Dean Koontz: Essays on America's Bestselling Writer of Suspense and Horror Fiction|author=Munster, B.|date=1998|publisher=Borgo Press|isbn=9781557421456|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVGmM1RuwB4C|page=10|accessdate=2014-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has said that he was regularly beaten and abused by his alcoholic father, which influenced his later writing, as also did the courage of his physically diminutive mother in standing up to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=Carroll |title=Dean Koontz Fears Nothing |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 23, 1998 |page=E-1 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/02/23/DD78392.DTL&amp;ao=all |accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his senior year at [[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]], he won a fiction competition sponsored by [[The Atlantic|''Atlantic Monthly'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Piazza, Judyth: [http://staugnews.com/2009/07/27/judyth-piazza-chats-with-dean-koontz-and-mark-constant-the-market-on-granada.html &quot;Judyth Piazza chats with Dean Koontz and Mark Constant, The Market on Granada&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316154751/http://staugnews.com/2009/07/27/judyth-piazza-chats-with-dean-koontz-and-mark-constant-the-market-on-granada.html |date=2011-03-16 }} St. Augustine News, July 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation in 1967, he went to work as an English teacher at [[Mechanicsburg Area Senior High|Mechanicsburg High School]] in [[Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; In the 1960s, Koontz worked for the Appalachian Poverty Program, a federally funded initiative designed to help poor children.&lt;ref name=Advocates&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertarianism.com/pop_celebrity/44|title=Dean Koontz – Friend of Liberty|publisher=[[Advocates for Self-Government]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819135951/http://www.libertarianism.com/pop_celebrity/44|archivedate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 interview with ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', he said that while the program sounded &quot;very noble and wonderful, . . . [i]n reality, it was a dumping ground for violent children.. . and most of the funding ended up 'disappearing somewhere.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Advocates/&gt; This experience greatly shaped Koontz's political outlook. In his book, ''The Dean Koontz Companion'', he recalled that he:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
realized that most of these programs are not meant to help anyone, merely to control people and make them dependent. I was forced to reconsider everything I'd once believed. I developed a profound distrust of government regardless of the philosophy of the people in power. I remained a liberal on civil-rights issues, became a conservative on defense, and a semi-libertarian on all other matters.&quot;&lt;ref name=Advocates/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
In his spare time, he wrote his first novel, ''[[Star Quest]]'', which was published in 1968. Koontz went on to write over a dozen [[science-fiction]] novels. Seeing the [[Catholic faith]] as a contrast to the chaos in his family, Koontz converted in college because it gave him answers for his life, admiring its &quot;intellectual rigor&quot; and saying it permits a view of life that sees mystery and wonder in all things.&lt;ref name=Drake_2007&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2009-11-28 |last=Drake |first=Tim |title=Chatting With Koontz About Faith |work=[[National Catholic Register]] |url=http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |date=March 6, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117060951/http://www.ncregister.com/site/article/2013 |archivedate=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Tony, [http://catholicexchange.com/2009/08/01/120925/ Best-selling Author Dean Koontz Explores Catholic Values in Novels] Catholic Exchange, August 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He says he sees Catholicism as English writer and Catholic convert [[G.K. Chesterton]] did: that it encourages a &quot;joy about the gift of life&quot;.&lt;ref name=Drake_2007/&gt; Koontz says that spirituality has always been part of his books, as are grace and our struggle as fallen souls, but he &quot;never get[s] on a soapbox&quot;.&lt;ref name=Drake_2007/&gt;

In the 1970s, Koontz began writing suspense and [[horror fiction]], both under his own name and several [[pseudonym]]s, sometimes publishing up to eight books a year. Koontz has stated that he began using pen names after several [[copy editing|editor]]s convinced him that authors who switched back and forth between different [[genre]]s invariably fell victim to &quot;negative crossover&quot; (alienating established fans and simultaneously failing to pick up any new ones). Known pseudonyms used by Koontz during his career include Deanna Dwyer, K. R. Dwyer, Aaron Wolfe, David Axton, Brian Coffey, John Hill, Leigh Nichols, Owen West, Richard Paige, and Anthony North. As Brian Coffey, he wrote the &quot;Mike Tucker&quot; trilogy [''Blood Risk'', ''Surrounded'', ''Wall of Masks''] in acknowledged tribute to the Parker novels of [[Richard Stark]] ([[Donald E. Westlake]]). Many of Koontz's pseudonymous novels are now available under his real name. Many others remain suppressed by Koontz, who bought back the rights to ensure they could not be republished; he has, on occasion, said that he might revise some for republication, but only three have appeared — ''Demon Seed'' and ''Invasion'' were both heavily rewritten before they were republished, and ''Prison of Ice'' had certain sections [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerised]].

After writing full-time for more than 10 years, Koontz's acknowledged breakthrough novel was ''[[Whispers (Koontz novel)|Whispers]]'', published in 1980. The two books before that, ''[[The Key to Midnight]]'' and ''[[The Funhouse (novel)|The Funhouse]]'', also sold over a million copies, but were written under pen names. His first bestseller was ''[[Demon Seed (novel)|Demon Seed]]'', the sales of which picked up after the release of the [[Demon Seed|film of the same name]] in 1977, and sold over two million copies in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=demon seed from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/demon-seed-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first hardcover bestseller, which finally promised some financial stability and lifted him out of the midlist hit-and-miss range, was his book ''[[Strangers (Dean Koontz novel)|Strangers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=strangers from the author|url=http://www.deankoontz.com/strangers-from-the-author/|website=Deankoontz.com|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since then, 12 hardcovers and 14 paperbacks written by Koontz have reached number one on [[The New York Times Bestseller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deankoontz.com&quot;/&gt;

Bestselling science-fiction writer [[Brian Herbert]] has stated, &quot;I even went through a phase where I read everything that Dean Koontz wrote, and in the process I learned a lot about characterization and building suspense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=www.frankherbert.net |title=Interview with Brian Herbert |url=http://www.frankherbert.net/news/BrianHerbertInterview.pdf/ |accessdate=2011-05-03 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[psychologist]] [[Katherine Ramsland]] published an extensive biography of Koontz based on interviews with his family and him. This &quot;[[psychobiography]]&quot; (as Ramsland called it) often showed the conception of Koontz's characters and plots from events in his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dean Koontz : a writer’s biography |authorlink=Katherine Ramsland |first=Katherine M. |last=Ramsland |location=New York, N.Y. |publisher=[[HarperPrism]] |year=1997 |isbn=0-06-105271-X |lccn=97030839 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/deankoontzwriter0000rams }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early author photos on the back of many of his novels show a balding Koontz with a mustache. After Koontz underwent [[hair transplantation]] surgery in the late 1990s, his subsequent books have featured a new, clean-shaven appearance with a fuller head of hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=photo gallery |url=http://deankoontz.com/about-dean/photo-gallery.php |accessdate=2007-08-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629153158/http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/photo-gallery.php |archivedate=2007-06-29 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koontz explained the change by claiming that he was tired of looking like [[G. Gordon Liddy]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Fiction: From C.S. Lewis to Left Behind|last=Tischler|first=Nancy M.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2009|isbn=978 0 313 34568 5|location=|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hXBd-V3vncC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Fiction: From C.S.

Many of his novels are set in and around [[Orange County, California]]. As of 2006, he lives there with his wife, Gerda (Cerra), in Newport Coast, California, behind the gates of Pelican Hills. In 2008, he was the world's sixth-most highly paid author, tied with [[John Grisham]], at $25&amp;nbsp;million annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc100308&quot;&gt;{{cite news

== Pet dogs ==
One of Dean Koontz's pen names was inspired by his dog, Trixie Koontz, a [[Golden Retriever]], shown in many of his book-jacket photos. Trixie originally was a service dog with [[Canine Companions for Independence]] (CCI), a [[charitable organization]] that provides service dogs for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;trixie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Trixie Koontz |url=http://deankoontz.com/trixie/monthly-columns.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710211834/http://www.deankoontz.com/trixie/monthly-columns.php |archivedate=2007-07-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trixie was a gift from CCI in gratitude of Koontz's substantial donations, totaling $2,500,000 between 1991 and 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;benfox&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Ben Fox |title=Associated Press |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20041226/ai_n11495304 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123115347/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20041226/ai_n11495304 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |work=Deseret News |date=2004-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koontz was taken with the charity while he was researching his novel ''[[Midnight (Koontz novel)|Midnight]]'', a book which included a CCI-trained dog, a black [[Labrador Retriever]], named Moose.
In 2004, Koontz wrote and edited ''Life Is Good: Lessons in Joyful Living'' in her name, and in 2005, Koontz wrote a second book credited to Trixie, ''Christmas Is Good''. Both books are written from a supposed canine perspective on the joys of life. The [[royalties]] of the books were donated to CCI.&lt;ref name=&quot;trixie&quot;/&gt; In 2007, Trixie contracted terminal [[cancer]] that created a [[tumor]] in her heart. The Koontzes had her [[Animal euthanasia|put to sleep]] outside their family home on June 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;trixie&quot;/&gt; After Trixie's death, Koontz has continued writing on his website under the name &quot;TOTOS&quot;, standing for &quot;Trixie on the Other Side&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;trixie&quot;/&gt;
Trixie is widely thought to have been his inspiration for his November 2007 book, ''[[The Darkest Evening of the Year]]'', about a woman who runs a Golden Retriever rescue home, and who rescues a 'special' dog, named Nickie, which eventually saves her life. In August 2009, Koontz published ''A Big Little Life'', a memoir of his life with Trixie.

In October 2008, Koontz revealed that he had adopted a new dog, Anna. Eventually, he learned that Anna was the grandniece of Trixie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Koontz | first = Dean | title = The Write Stuff: All About Anna | url = http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/the-write-stuff/ | accessdate = 2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna died on May 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Koontz | first = Dean | title = Anna Koontz: June 22, 2006 – May 22, 2016 | url = http://www.deankoontz.com/anna-koontz-june-22-2006-may-22-2016/ | accessdate = 2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koontz then adopted a new dog, Elsa, on July 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Koontz | first = Dean | title = Introducing Elsa | url = http://www.deankoontz.com/introducing-elsa// | accessdate = 2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputed authorship ==
A number of letters, articles, and novels were ostensibly written by Koontz during the 1960s and 1970s, but he has stated he did not write them. These include 30 [[erotic novel]]s, allegedly written together by Koontz and his wife Gerda, including books such as ''Thirteen and Ready!'', ''Swappers Convention'', and ''Hung'', the last one published under the name &quot;Leonard Chris&quot;. They also include contributions to the [[fanzine]]s ''Energumen'' and ''[[BeABohema]]'' in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including articles that mention the erotic novels,&lt;ref name=&quot;efanzines&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efanzines.com/Energumen/Energumen08.pdf |title=&quot;Dean's Drive&quot;, Energumen 8; June 1971, page 9 |publisher=efanzines.com|accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''BeABohehma'' #8, 1970, ed. Frank Lunney; page 5&lt;/ref&gt; such as a movie column called &quot;Way Station&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;way station&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sjhtn2007.livejournal.com/3810.html|title=Round 8 of the auction|website=Sjhtn2007.livejournal.com|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''BeABohema''.

Koontz wrote in ''How to Write Best Selling Fiction'' (a much revised and updated version of 'Writing Popular Fiction' (1972)) (Writer's Digest Books, 1981, pp18) &quot;During my first six years as a full-time novelist {..} I wrote a lot of ephemeral stuff; anything that would pay some bills {..} I did Gothic romance novels under a pen-name {..}  Like many writers, I did some pornography too, and a variety of other things, none of which required me to commit my heart or my soul to the task.  (This is not to say I didn't bother to do a good job; on the contrary, I never wrote down to any market, and I always tried to give my editors and readers their money's worth.)&quot;  The Gothic novels are identifiable but none of Koontz's acknowledged work fits into the latter category.

Koontz has stated on his website &lt;ref name=&quot;collectors&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Facts for Collectors | url=http://www.deankoontz.com/about-dean/collectors/ |work=deankoontz.com |accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he used only the 10 known pen names&lt;ref name=&quot;collectors&quot;/&gt; and &quot;there are no secret pen names used by Dean&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;collectors&quot;/&gt; he adds that his own identity was stolen by &quot;a person he had previously worked with professionally&quot;, who submitted letters and some articles to fanzines under Koontz's name between 1969 and at least the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;collectors&quot;/&gt; Koontz has stated that he was only made aware of these bogus letters and articles in 1991 in a written admission from the identity thief. He has stated that he will reveal this person's name in his memoirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;collectors&quot;/&gt;
