The '''Detroit River''' ({{lang-fr|Rivière Détroit}}) flows for {{convert|24|nmi|km mi|lk=in}} from [[Lake St. Clair]] west and south to [[Lake Erie]] as a [[strait]] in the [[Great Lakes]] system. It forms part of the [[Canada–United States border|border]] between [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=NHD&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data.

The [[Ambassador Bridge]], the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]], and the [[Michigan Central Railway Tunnel]] connect the cities.

The river's English name comes from the [[French language|French]] {{Lang|fr|Rivière du Détroit}} (&quot;''River of the Strait''&quot;). The Detroit River has served an important role in the [[history of Detroit]] and Windsor, and is one of the world's busiest waterways.&lt;ref name=detnews&gt;{{Cite news |author=Nolan, Jenny |title=How the Detroit River shaped lives and history |url=http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=186 |work=The Detroit News |location=Detroit, Michigan |date=11 February 1997 |accessdate=June 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120710095530/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=186 |archivedate=10 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an important transportation route connecting [[Lake Michigan]], [[Lake Huron]], and [[Lake Superior]] to the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] and [[Erie Canal]]. When Detroit underwent rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century, the Detroit River became notoriously [[water pollution|polluted]] and toxic. Since the late 20th century, however, a vast restoration effort has been undertaken because of the river's ecological importance.

In the early 21st century, the river today has a wide variety of economic and recreational uses. There are numerous [[List of islands in the Detroit River|islands in the Detroit River]], and much of the lower portion of the river part is of the [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]]. The portion of the river in the city of Detroit has been organized into the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] and the [[William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor]]. The Detroit River is designated both an [[American Heritage Rivers|American Heritage River]] and a [[Canadian Heritage Rivers System|Canadian Heritage River]]—the only river to have this dual designation.&lt;ref name=AHRS/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHRS/&gt;

==Geography==
The Detroit River flows for {{convert|28|mi|km|lk=on|abbr=on}} from [[Lake St. Clair]] to [[Lake Erie]].&lt;ref name=NHD/&gt; By definition, this classifies it as both a [[river]] and a [[strait]] — a strait being a narrow passageway connecting two large bodies of water,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=[[Merriam–Webster]] |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/strait%5B3%5D |year=2009 |title=Definition of strait (noun) |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is how the river earned its name from early French settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=[[Windsor Public Library]] |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Folklore/english/intro/francophonese.htm |year=2004 |title=Who are the Detroit River French? |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411104301/http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Folklore/english/intro/francophonese.htm |archivedate=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, today, the Detroit River is rarely referred to as a strait, because bodies of water referred to as straits are typically much wider.

The Detroit River is only {{convert|0.5–2.5|mi|km|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} wide. The Detroit River starts on an east-to-west flow but then bends and runs north to south. The deepest portion of the Detroit River is {{convert|53|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} deep in the northern portion of the river. At its source, the river is at an elevation of {{convert|574|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} above sea level. The river drops only {{Convert|3|feet|metres|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} before entering into Lake Erie at {{convert|571|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}. As the river contains no [[dam]]s and no [[lock (water transport)|locks]], it is easily [[Navigability|navigable]] by even the smallest of vessels. The [[Drainage basin|watershed basin]] for the Detroit River is approximately {{convert|700|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=EPA/&gt; Since the river is fairly short, it has few tributaries, the largest being the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] in Michigan—which is four times longer than the Detroit River and contains most of the watershed. The only other major American tributary to the Detroit River is the much smaller [[Ecorse River]]. Tributaries on the Canadian side include Little River, Turkey Creek and the [[River Canard, Ontario|River Canard]]. The [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] for the Detroit River is relatively high for a river of its size. The river's discharge averaged over the year is {{Convert|5300|m³/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, and the river's flow is relatively constant.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), [https://web.archive.org/web/20090525115501/http://www.epa.gov/ecopage/aquatic/lkstrugeon/index.html ''Spawning by Lake Sturgeon (''Acipenser fulvescens'') in the Detroit River''], Comp. by N. M. Caswell ''et al.'', Lakes Grant, № GL97505001‑1 (Washington, D.C.: EPA, August 2002), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detroit-River.png|250px|thumb|left|Location of the Detroit River in the [[Great Lakes]] system]]

The Detroit River forms a major element of the [[Canada–United States border|international border]] between the United States and Canada. The river on the American side is all under the jurisdiction of [[Wayne County, Michigan]], and the Canadian side is under the administration of [[Essex County, Ontario]]. The largest city along the Detroit River is [[Detroit]], and most of the population along the river lives in [[Michigan]]. The Detroit River has only two automobile traffic crossings connecting the United States and Canada: the [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]]. Both of these are strongly protected by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]].

The upper portion of the river is one of the few places where a Canadian city lies directly south of an American city. In this case, the city of [[Detroit]] is directly north of the city of [[Windsor, Ontario]]. The only other location where this occurs is [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], lying south of several cities in [[Niagara County, New York]]. The cities and communities southwest of Detroit along the American side of the river are popularly referred to as the [[Downriver]] area, because those areas are said to be &quot;down the river&quot; from Detroit. Several of these communities do not border the Detroit River; the term &quot;Downriver&quot; refers broadly to a cluster of 18 suburban communities that lie to the southwest of the city of Detroit and to the west of the Detroit River.

===Islands===
{{Main|List of islands in the Detroit River}}
The Detroit River contains numerous islands, whose ownership and control varies depending on their location along the river. The majority are on the American side of the river; none are divided by the international border. Many are very small and uninhabited, but [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Île]] on the U.S. side and [[Bois Blanc Island (Ontario)|Bois Blanc (Boblo) Island]] on the Canadian side have permanent populations. Most islands are in the southern portion of the waterway, close to where the river empties into Lake Erie. [[Belle Isle Park|Belle Isle]], in the northern section of the river, is a [[Michigan State Park]], and is open to the public via a bridge connection with Detroit.

==History==

The Detroit River was first navigated by non-natives in the 17th century. The [[Iroquois]] traded [[Fur clothing|furs]] with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch colonists]] at [[New Amsterdam]] by traveling through the Detroit River.&lt;ref name=detnews/&gt; The [[French colonial empire|French]] later claimed the area for [[New France]]. The famed sailing ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' reached the mouth of the Detroit River in mid-August 1679 on its maiden voyage through the Great Lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Ken |last=VanEseltine |url=http://my.net-link.net/~vaneselk/ussgryphon/name.htm |date=26 August 2008 |title=''Le Griffon'' is a Meaningful Name |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when the French began settling in the area, they navigated the river using [[canoe]]s made of [[birch]] or [[elm]] bark. Handcrafted vessels were a common mode of travel across the river, and the [[pirogue]] and [[bateaux]] were also used. As the [[North American fur trade]] intensified, European settlers expanded their trade westward into the uncharted territories. French explorer [[Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac]] sailed up the Detroit River on July 23, 1701. The next day, he established [[Fort Detroit|Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]], which developed as Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=T. |last=Granzo |url=http://www.historydetroit.com/people/antoine_cadillac.asp |year=2008 |title=History of Detroit: Antoine de la Mothe, Sieur de Cadillac |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French named the river as ''Rivière Détroit''. ''Détroit'' is [[French language|French]] for &quot;[[strait]]&quot;. The river was known literally as the &quot;River of the Strait&quot;.

[[File:DetroitRiverlaker.jpg|thumb|As the Detroit River is one of the most important waterways in the world, large [[cargo ship|freighters]] are a common sight.]]

[[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] took the Detroit River — and the larger area surrounding it — from the French during the [[French and Indian War]]. It was claimed by the newly formed [[United States]] during the [[American Revolution]] but was not turned over by the British until 1796. During the [[War of 1812]], the Detroit River served as a major barrier between the American [[Michigan Territory]] and British [[Upper Canada]], especially during the [[Siege of Detroit|Battle of Fort Detroit]] in August 1812, when Detroit briefly fell to the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first=J. |last=Rickard|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_detroit.html |date=21 November 2007 |title=Battle of Detroit, 16 August 1812 |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1817, which opened up easier travel to Lake Erie from the [[East Coast of the United States]], the Detroit River became a heavily traversed route for settlers traveling to northern Michigan, and Detroit, as well, experienced a sudden increase in population. Following the [[Patriot War]] which nearly saw a battle between British regulars and Michigan militia on the ice-covered Detroit River, [[Fort Wayne (Detroit)|Fort Wayne]] was built at Detroit to counter Britain's riverside [[Fort Malden]] at Amherstburg.

During the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] feared the seceded [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) would plan a northerly attack from Canada, which was owned by the British Empire and remained neutral in the war. The Union feared the CSA would cross the Detroit River to launch this attack. For that reason, the Detroit River was heavily patrolled and the fortification at Fort Wayne improved, even though it was far removed from any major combat. While no major attack came from Canada, a plot to capture the U.S. Navy warship, [[USS Michigan (1843)|USS ''Michigan'']] and liberate Confederate prisoners from [[USS Michigan (1843)#American Civil War|Johnson Island]], in western Lake Erie, was narrowly averted only after the Confederates had captured two passenger steamships.&lt;ref name=&quot;detnews&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/w/wolverine-i.html |title=''Wolverine'' |author=Naval History And Heritage Command |date= |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |publisher=Naval History And Heritage Command |accessdate=25 January 2015 |ref={{sfnref|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Wolverine''}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, Detroit's industrialization took off on an unprecedented scale. The Detroit River became the world's busiest commercial river and was dubbed &quot;the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth&quot; by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1908. In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67,292,504 tons (61 billion kg) of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world. For comparison, [[London]] shipped 18,727,230 tons (16 billion kg), and [[New York City|New York]] shipped 20,390,953 tons (18 billion kg).&lt;ref name=&quot;detnews&quot; /&gt;

===Prohibition===
From 1920 to 1933 there was [[Prohibition in the United States]], and the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] for consumption were nationally banned. Detroit, as the largest city bordering Canada, where alcohol remained legal during Prohibition, became the center of a new industry known as [[rum-running]].

There were no bridges in the area connecting Canada and the United States until the [[Ambassador Bridge]] was finished in 1929 and the [[Detroit–Windsor Tunnel]] in 1930 so boats were used to smuggle alcohol across the river during the summer, and during the winter months, rum-runners traveled across the frozen Detroit River by car to Canada and back with trunk loads of alcohol. In some cases, overloaded cars fell through the ice, and today, car parts from this illegal era can still be found on the bottom of the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; [[Rum-running in Windsor]] became a very common practice, and led to the rise of mobsters such as [[the Purple Gang]], who used violence as a means to control the route known as the &quot;Detroit-Windsor Funnel&quot; — parodying the newly built tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first=Mark |last=Gribben |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/purple/1.html |year=2008 |title=The Purple Gang: Bootlegger's Paradise |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Detroit River, [[Lake St. Clair]], and the [[St. Clair River]] are estimated to have carried 75% of all liquor smuggled into the United States during Prohibition. Government officials were unable or unwilling to deter the flow.

The rum-running industry died when prohibition was repealed in 1933 by the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]].&lt;ref name=detnews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=LaFaive, Fleenor, and Nesbit |url=http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=10016 |date=3 December 2008 |title=The Appendix B: Prohibition in Michigan and the Avenue de Booze |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Philip |last=Mason |url=http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/2008/marapr/couldnt_get_drink.html |date=Sep–Oct 1994 |title=Anyone Who Couldn't Get a Drink Wasn't Tryin' |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805093913/http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/2008/marapr/couldnt_get_drink.html |archivedate=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Submerged Objects ===
Because of the historical significance of the surrounding [[Metro Detroit]] and [[Windsor, Ontario]], the Detroit River has been home to many sunken objects, ranging from a [[DMC DeLorean]], to anchors, murder weapons, to stolen bronze statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/01/11/detroit-river-artifacts-ambassador-bridge/2545900002/|title=Reports: Archaeologists find 30,000 artifacts along Detroit River|last=Siacon|first=Aleanna|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2019-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifacts recovered are well preserved due to the river's [[fresh water]] but low visibility makes them difficult to find.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/02/01/guns-cannons-cars-history-detroit-river/96833680/|title=Detroit River's muddy bottom conceals cannons, cars, guns|last=Allen|first=Robert|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2019-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1940s era, bronze statue, which depicted a nude woman originally overlooking a reflecting pool in the [[Grosse Pointe War Memorial]] and nicknamed, &quot;The Nude,&quot; was believed to have been successfully stolen for display in some by-any-means-necessary art collector's collection. However, during a police diving exercise near a submerged [[Jeep]], the statue was found and subsequently returned to the memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.secondwavemedia.com/metromode/devnews/warmemorialstatue0116.aspx|title=Grosse Pointe War Memorial to restore, display recovered statue|last=Thursday|last2=May 14|website=Metromode|language=en|access-date=2019-12-27|last3=metromode|first3=2009 {{!}} Source:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchors of the SS Greater Detroit, a luxury [[Steamship]] that toured the Detroit River from 1924-1950 and famed [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald]] have notably both been lost and recovered from the river. The 6,000 pound anchor of the SS Greater Detroit was raised in November 2017, and is reminiscent of a similar July, 1992 project, recovering the lost anchor of the [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald]]. The Greater Detroit's anchor is resting at the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority Building. The Fitzgerald's anchor is resting in the yard of the [[Dossin Great Lakes Museum]] on [[Belle Isle Park (Michigan)|Belle Isle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glmi.org/Default.htm|title=Great Lakes Maritime Institute|website=www.glmi.org|access-date=2019-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/11/15/greater-detroit-anchor-river-steamship/93876838/|title=Historic anchor pulled from Detroit River|last=Allen|first=Robert|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2019-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of six 1700s-era [[cannon]]s were recovered from the river since the 1980s. The last of which was found in 2011 near the [[Cobo Center]]. They're likely connected to a pre-[[War of 1812]] inventory kept by the [[British Armed Forces|British Military]]. It is suspected that there are three more of its kind lurking in the area. The inventory documents show a total of 17 cannons and 14 have been accounted for. It is believed the cannons were dragged onto the frozen river and sunk to the bottom as the river thawed—thus, out of enemy hands. As many as seven larger cannons could have fallen off of a [[barge]] more toward [[Amherstburg]], [[Ontario]] and could still be in the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Pollution and conservation efforts===
[[File:Mud Island in DRIWR.jpg|thumb|250px|Much of the lower portion of the river ''([[List of islands in the Detroit River#Mud Island|Mud Island]] pictured)'' is now part of the [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]].]]

Much of the land that surrounds the Detroit River is urbanized and, in some places, heavily industrialized. This has resulted in excessive [[water pollution]] from the long-term and unregulated dumping of chemicals, industrial waste, garbage and sewage. Much of the Detroit River and its shoreline were heavily polluted and unsafe for recreational use. The oil slicks and contaminated water around the mouth of the Detroit River at [[Lake Erie]] killed thousands of migrating birds after each spring thaw. The river's oxygen levels were depleted to the point where fish could not inhabit its waters. Because this pollution often drained into and affected Lake Erie, the lake was considered &quot;dead&quot; and unable to support aquatic life.&lt;ref name=hartig&gt;{{Cite web| first=John |last=Hartig |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/hunting/columns/story?columnist=swan_james&amp;page=g_col_swan_det_river |date=17 July 2007|title=The Detroit River's amazing comeback |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swan&gt;{{Cite web |first=James |last=Swan |url=http://www.glu.org/news/2009/03/return-of-the-detroit-river%E2%80%99s-charismatic-megafauna/ |date=19 March 2009 |title=Return of the Detroit River's Charismatic Megafauna |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922140030/http://www.glu.org/news/2009/03/return-of-the-detroit-river%E2%80%99s-charismatic-megafauna/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, a congressional order founded the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge. That paved the way for tighter restrictions on industries and allocated substantial government funding to clean up the river. However, there was little support for cleaning up the river, because it would affect Detroit's industrialism and economy. In 1970, the [[fishing industry]] in the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]], the Detroit River, and Lake Erie closed due to toxic levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in the water. This spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River.&lt;ref name=hartig/&gt; For years, the multimillion-dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river and the political influence of nearby industries, hindered conservation efforts.&lt;ref name=swan/&gt;

In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the larger [[Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]], a cooperative effort between the United States and Canada to preserve the area as an ecological refuge. The millions of dollars spent since that time to dredge pollutants out of the Detroit River river has led to a remarkable restoration, although problems remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;hartig&quot; /&gt; Today, many species of native animals driven out by human development are returning to the area. The river is home to a growing number of bird species such as [[eagle]]s (including reintroduced [[bald eagle]]s), [[osprey]]s, and [[peregrine falcon]]s. The river also has large numbers of [[lake whitefish]], [[sturgeon]], [[silver bass]], [[black bass]], [[salmon]], [[perch]], and [[walleye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;swan&quot; /&gt; The Detroit River was designated as an [[American Heritage Rivers|American Heritage River]] in 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;AHRS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=[[American Heritage Rivers]] |url=http://www.epa.gov/rivers/98rivers/detroit.html |date=19 October 2006 |title=Detroit River (MI): An American Heritage Designated River |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722101841/http://www.epa.gov/rivers/98rivers/detroit.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Canadian Heritage Rivers System|Canadian Heritage River]] in 2001&lt;ref name=&quot;CHRS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=[[Canadian Heritage Rivers System]] |url=http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Detroit/Detroit_e.htm |title=Detroit River, Ontario: A Unique International Heritage |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802233729/http://www.chrs.ca/Rivers/Detroit/Detroit_e.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — the only river to have these dual designations.

The Detroit River is used for shipping and trading. The earliest use of the river for these economic activities was the shipping of furs for trade as early as the 17th century.&lt;ref name=detnews/&gt; By the time the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] decreased, Michigan had begun to exploit the [[lumber]]-rich areas of Northern Michigan and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]]. Detroit turned into a major industrial region, largely because of the Detroit River. The only way a ship could travel out of the upper Great Lakes system was to travel down the Detroit River. From there, ships could travel anywhere in the world out of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway|St. Lawrence Seaway]] or the [[Erie Canal]] to [[New York City]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the automotive industry boomed, and the many manufacturers imported abundant supplies of [[iron ore]], sand, limestone and wood.

The Detroit River provides substantial revenue for the local economies. A 1991 study showed $20.1 million came from sales related to waterfowl hunting along the Detroit River. The same year, bird watching, photography, and other non-consumptive uses of waterfowl contributed another $192.8 million to Michigan’s economy. Local economies benefit through boating registrations and fishing licenses. It is estimated walleye fishing alone brings in $1 million to the economy of communities along the lower Detroit River each spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=International Association for Great Lakes Research |url=http://www.iaglr.org/scipolicy/issues/detroithabitat.php |title=Conserving Detroit River Habitats|year= 2009|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fish caught by recreational fisherman include [[white bass]], [[bluegill]], [[crappie]], [[freshwater drum]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[northern pike]] and [[Muskellunge|muskie]]. There are over 800,000 recreation boats in Michigan, and more than half of them are regularly used on or near the Detroit River. Popular river destinations in Detroit include the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] and [[Belle Isle Park]] — both of which host events throughout the year. Several restaurants on the river have docks for boaters. Tour boats and dinner cruises travel through the sights of Detroit and the undeveloped islands downriver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Detroit Princess Riverboat |url=http://www.detroitprincess.com/ |title=Detroit Princess Riverboat| year=2009| accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise ships support tourism on the Great Lakes and dock at the Port Detroit passenger terminal downtown. The iconic [[Renaissance Center]] is on the banks of the Detroit River.

==Bridges and crossings==
[[File:Ambassadorbridgefrombase.jpg|thumb|28% of all merchandise trade between the United States and Ontario crosses the Detroit River at the [[Ambassador Bridge]].]]
[[File:Detroit river running between Detroit and Windsor.jpg|thumb|right|Detroit River flowing between Detroit and Windsor]]

According to a 2004 study, 150,000 jobs and $13 billion in annual production depend on the river crossings connecting Detroit to Windsor. In 2004, the American trade with Ontario alone was $407 billion, in which 28% ($113.3 billion) crossed the Detroit River.

The only automobile traffic routes that completely cross the river are the privately owned [[Ambassador Bridge]] and the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]], both of which connect Detroit, Michigan to Windsor, Ontario. A railway tunnel and a commercial truck ferry service also travel between Detroit and Windsor. In Michigan, there are two bridges connecting the mainland to [[Grosse Ile Township, Michigan|Grosse Ile]] and the [[MacArthur Bridge (Detroit)|MacArthur Bridge]], popularly known as the &quot;Belle Isle Bridge,&quot; that connects the City of Detroit to [[Belle Isle Park]]. All crossings (ports of entry) on the American side are secured by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]]'s Office of Field Operations and on the Canadian side by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]]; all areas between the American ports of entry and on the American side of the river are secured by the [[United States Border Patrol]].

Proposals have been made to create a [[Detroit River International Crossing|third crossing]] to connect Detroit and Windsor. The exact location for this crossing is the most debated element, as it could negatively affect a large number of environmental features and communities along the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Detroiter Contributor |url=http://www.detroiteronline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1159%3f |title=Detroit/Windsor Border Update: Part I-Detroit River International Crossing Study | date=1 November 2005| accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gordie Howe International Bridge]] is a new bridge project which began construction in 2015; it will directly connect [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] in Canada to [[Interstate 75]] in the U.S.
