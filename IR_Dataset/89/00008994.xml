'''''Das Boot''''' ({{IPA-de|das ˈboːt}}, English: &quot;The Boat&quot;) is a 1981 German [[war film]] written and directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]], produced by Günter Rohrbach, and starring [[Jürgen Prochnow]], [[Herbert Grönemeyer]], and [[Klaus Wennemann]]. It has been exhibited both as a [[theatrical release]] and as a TV [[miniseries]] (1985), in several different [[home video]] versions of various running times, and in a [[director's cut]] version supervised by Petersen in 1997.

An [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Lothar-Günther Buchheim]]'s 1973 German novel of the same name, the film is set during [[World War II]] and follows German [[U-boat#World War II (1939–1945)|U-boat]] ''[[German submarine U-96 (1940)|U-96]]'' and its crew, as they set out on a hazardous patrol in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard [[U-boat#World War II|U-boats]] as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country.

Development began in 1979. Several American directors were considered three years earlier before the film was shelved. During production, [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]], the captain of the real ''U-96'' and one of Germany's top U-boat &quot;tonnage aces&quot; during the war, and Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on ''{{GS|U-219||2}}'', served as consultants. One of Petersen's goals was to guide the audience through &quot;a journey to the edge of the mind&quot; (the film's German tagline ''Eine Reise ans Ende des Verstandes''), showing &quot;what war is all about&quot;.

Produced with a budget of 32 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] (about $18.5 million, equivalent to {{Inflation|DE|32|1982}} million {{Inflation-year|DE}} [[Euro|€]]), the film's high production cost ranks it among the most expensive films in [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]], but the film was a commercial success and grossed $84.9 million worldwide (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|84.9|1982}} million {{Inflation-year|US}} $). [[Columbia Pictures]] released both a German version and an English-dubbed version in the United States theatrically, but the film's German version gross was much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box-office.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiewire.com&quot;&gt;http://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Archived copy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html |archive-date=5 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film received highly positive reviews and was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], two of these nominations (for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]) went to Petersen himself; he was also nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]] and [[DGA Award]].

== Plot ==
Lt. Werner ([[Herbert Grönemeyer]]), has been assigned as a [[war correspondent]] on the {{GS|U-96|1940|6}} in October 1941. He is driven by its captain ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), and chief engineer ([[Klaus Wennemann]]), to a raucous French bordello where he meets some of the crew. Thomsen ([[Otto Sander]]), another captain, gives a crude drunken speech to celebrate his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|''Ritterkreuz'' award]], in which he openly mocks [[Adolf Hitler]].

The next morning, the ''U-96'' sails out of the [[harbour]] of [[La Rochelle]] and Werner is given a tour of the boat. As time passes, he observes ideological differences between the new crew members and the hardened veterans, particularly the captain, who is embittered and cynical about the war. The new men, including Werner, are often mocked by the rest of the crew, who share a tight bond. It also becomes clear that the one Nazi officer on board is strongly disliked by the others.  After days of boredom, the crew is excited by another U-boat's spotting of an enemy convoy, but they are soon spotted by a British [[destroyer]], and are bombarded with [[depth charge]]s. They escape with only light damage.

The next three weeks are spent enduring a relentless North Atlantic gale. Morale drops after a series of misfortunes, but the crew is cheered temporarily by a chance encounter with Thomsen's boat. Shortly after the storm ends, the boat encounters a British [[convoy]] and quickly launches four torpedoes, sinking two ships. They are spotted by a destroyer and have to dive below test depth, the [[Submarine depth ratings|submarine's rated limit]]. During the ensuing depth-charge attack, the chief machinist, Johann, panics and has to be restrained. The boat sustains heavy damage, but is eventually able to safely surface when night falls. A British tanker they torpedoed is still afloat and on fire, so they torpedo it again, only to learn there are still sailors aboard. The crew watch in horror as the sailors leap overboard and swim towards them. Unable to accommodate prisoners, the captain orders the boat away.

The worn-out U-boat crew looks forward to returning home to La Rochelle in time for [[Christmas]], but the ship is ordered to [[La Spezia]], Italy, which means passing through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]—an area heavily defended by the [[Royal Navy]]. The U-boat makes a secret night rendezvous at the harbour of [[Vigo]], in [[Neutral country|neutral]] although [[Francoist Spain|Axis-friendly Spain]], with the [[SS Weser|SS ''Weser'']], an [[interned]] German [[merchant ship]] that clandestinely provides U-boats with fuel, torpedoes, and other supplies. The filthy officers seem out of place at the opulent dinner prepared for them, but are warmly greeted by enthusiastic officers eager to hear their exploits. The captain learns from an envoy of the German consulate that his request for Werner and the Chief Engineer to be sent back to Germany has been denied.

The crew finishes resupplying and departs for Italy. As they carefully approach the Strait of Gibraltar and are just about to dive, they are suddenly attacked and heavily damaged by a British [[fighter plane]], wounding the navigator, Kriechbaum. The captain orders the boat directly south towards the North African coast at full speed determined to save his crew even if he loses the boat. British warships begin shelling and they are forced to dive. When attempting to level off, the boat does not respond and continues to sink until, just before being crushed by the pressure, it lands on a sea shelf, at the depth of 280 metres. The crew works desperately to make numerous repairs before running out of oxygen. After over 16 hours, they are able to surface by blowing their [[ballast tank|ballast]] tanks, and limp back towards La Rochelle under cover of darkness.

The crew is exhausted when they finally reach La Rochelle on [[Christmas Eve]]. Shortly after Kriechbaum is taken ashore to a waiting ambulance, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes bomb and strafe the facilities, wounding or killing many of the crew. Ullmann, Johann, the 2nd Watch Officer, and the Bibelforscher are killed. Frenssen, ''Bootsmann'' Lamprecht and Hinrich are wounded. After the raid, Werner leaves the [[submarine pen|U-boat bunker]] in which he had taken shelter and finds the captain, badly injured by shrapnel, watching his U-boat sink in the dock. Just after the boat disappears under the water, the captain collapses and dies. Werner rushes to his body, and surveys the grim scene with tears in his eyes.

[[File:DasbootLIJohann.png|thumb|right|Johann (Leder) and the LI (Wennemann) inspecting the engine.]]
* [[Jürgen Prochnow]] as [[Captain lieutenant|Kapitänleutnant]] (abbr. &quot;Kaleun&quot;, {{IPA-de|kaˈlɔɪ̯n}})&lt;!--do NOT change to &quot;Kaleu&quot; w/o providing source--&gt; and also called &quot;Der Alte&quot; (&quot;The Old Man&quot;) by his crew: A 30-year-old battle-hardened but good-hearted and sympathetic sea veteran, who complains to Werner that most of his crew are boys.&lt;ref&gt;See comment by Wolfgang Petersen in 'Extra Features'; 'The Making Of/Behind The Scenes, ''Das Boot: The Director's Cut'' (1997). DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; He is openly anti-Nazi, and embittered and cynical about the war, being openly critical about how the war is being handled.
* [[Herbert Grönemeyer]] as ''Leutnant'' (Ensign) Werner, War Correspondent: Naive but honest, he has been sent out to sea with the crew to gather photographs of them in action and report on the voyage. Werner is mocked for his lack of experience, and soon learns the true horrors of service on a U-boat.
* [[Klaus Wennemann]] as Chief Engineer (''[[Leitender Ingenieur]]'' or LI, Rank: ''Oberleutnant''): A quiet and well-respected man. At age 27, the oldest crew member besides the Captain. Tormented by the uncertain fate of his wife, especially after hearing about an [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Allied air raid]] on [[Cologne]]. The second most important crewman, as he oversees diving operations and makes sure the systems are running correctly.
* [[Hubertus Bengsch]] as 1st Watch Officer (I. WO, Rank: ''Oberleutnant''): A young, by-the-book officer, an ardent [[Nazi]] and a staunch believer in the [[Endsieg]]. He has a condescending attitude and is the only crewman who makes the effort to maintain his proper uniform and trim appearance while all the others grow their beards in the traditional fashion. He was raised in some wealth in Mexico by his stepparents who owned a plantation. His German fiancée died in a British air raid. He spends his days writing his thoughts on military training and leadership for the High Command. When the boat is trapped underwater near Gibraltar, he becomes pessimistic and begins to let go of his adherence to Nazi ideas as he finally stops shaving every day and wearing his proper uniform all the time.
* [[Martin Semmelrogge]] as 2nd Watch Officer (II. WO, Rank: ''Oberleutnant''): A vulgar, comedic officer. He is short, red-haired and speaks with a mild [[Berlinerisch dialect|Berlin dialect]]. One of his duties is to decode messages from base, using the [[Enigma machine|Enigma code machine]].
* [[Bernd Tauber]] as ''Obersteuermann'' (&quot;Chief Helmsman&quot;) Kriechbaum: The navigator and 3rd Watch Officer (III. WO). Always slightly skeptical of the Captain and without enthusiasm during the voyage, he shows no anger when a convoy is too far away to be attacked. Kriechbaum has four sons, with another on the way.
* [[Erwin Leder]] as ''Obermaschinist'' (&quot;Chief Mechanic&quot;) Johann, also called &quot;Das Gespenst&quot; (&quot;The Ghost&quot;): He is obsessed with a near-fetish love for the ''U-96''{{'}}s engines. Johann suffers a temporary mental breakdown during an attack by two destroyers. He is able to redeem himself by valiantly working to stop water leaks when the boat is trapped underwater near Gibraltar. Speaks [[Austro-Bavarian language|a lower Austrian dialect]].
* [[Martin May (actor)|Martin May]] as ''Fähnrich'' (Senior Cadet) Ullmann: A young officer candidate who has a pregnant [[French people|French]] fiancée (which is considered treason by the French [[French Resistance|partisans]]) and worries about her safety. He is one of the few crew members with whom Werner is able to connect; Werner offers to deliver Ullmann's stack of love letters when Werner is ordered to leave the submarine.
* [[Heinz Hoenig]] as ''Maat'' (Petty Officer) Hinrich: The radioman, sonar controller and ship's [[combat medic]]. He gauges speed and direction of targets and enemy destroyers. Hinrich is one of the few crewmen that the Captain is able to relate to.
* [[Uwe Ochsenknecht]] as ''Bootsmann'' (&quot;Boatswain&quot;) Lamprecht: The severe chief petty officer who shows Werner around the ''U-96'', and supervises the firing and reloading of the torpedo tubes. He gets upset after hearing on the radio that the football team most of the crew supports ([[FC Schalke 04]]) are losing a match, and they will &quot;never make the final now&quot;.
* Claude-Oliver Rudolph as Ario: The burly mechanic who tells everyone that Dufte is getting married to an ugly woman, and throws pictures around of Dufte's fiancée in order to laugh at them both.
* [[Jan Fedder]] as ''Maat'' (Petty Officer) Pilgrim: Another sailor (watch officer and diving planes operator), gets almost swept off the submarine during a storm – a genuine accident during filming in which Fedder broke several ribs and was hospitalised for a while.
* [[Ralf Richter (actor)|Ralf Richter]] as ''Maat'' (Petty Officer) Frenssen: Pilgrim's best friend. Pilgrim and Frenssen love to trade dirty jokes and stories.
* Joachim Bernhard as ''Bibelforscher'' (&quot;Bible scholar&quot;, also the contemporary German term for a member of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]): A very young religious sailor who is constantly reading the Bible. He is punched by Frenssen when the submarine is trapped at the bottom of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] for praying rather than repairing the boat.
* [[Oliver Stritzel]] as Schwalle: A tall and well-built blond torpedoman.
* Jean-Claude Hoffmann as Benjamin: A red haired sailor who serves as a diving plane operator.
* Lutz Schnell as Dufte: The sailor who gets jeered at because he is getting married, and for a possible false airplane sighting.
* [[Konrad Becker]] as Böckstiegel: the sailor who is first visited by Hinrich for crab lice.
* [[Otto Sander]] as ''Kapitänleutnant'' Philipp Thomsen: An alcoholic and [[combat stress reaction|shell-shocked]] U-boat commander, who is a member of &quot;The Old Guard&quot;. When he is introduced, he is extremely drunk and briefly mocks Hitler on the stage of the French bordello. (In the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; DVD [[audio commentary]], Petersen says that Sander was really drunk while they were shooting the scene.) Sometime after ''U-96'' departs, Thomsen is deployed once again and the two submarines meet randomly in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] being put off course by the storm. This upsets the Captain because it means that there is now a gap in the blockade chain. After failing to make contact later, it becomes apparent that Thomsen's boat is missing. When ''U-96'' intercepts the convoy and sees they are without escorts, the Captain makes the observation that they must be away chasing down another boat; this boat is probably Thomsen's.
* [[Günter Lamprecht]] as the Captain of the ''Weser'' (rank: ''Kapitän zur See''): An enthusiastic officer aboard the resupply ship ''Weser''. He mistakes the I. WO for the Captain as they enter the ship's elegant dining room. An ardent Nazi, he complains about the frustration of not being able to fight, but boasts about the food that has been prepared for the crew and the ship's &quot;specialities&quot;.
* [[Sky du Mont]] as an ''Oberleutnant'' aboard the ''Weser'' (uncredited). The II. WO amuses him with a comical demonstration of depth charging, involving a bowl of punch, a ladle and oranges.

The film features both Standard German-speakers and [[dialect]] speakers. Petersen states in the DVD audio commentary that young men from throughout Germany and Austria were recruited for the film, as he wanted faces and dialects that would accurately reflect the diversity of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], around 1941. All of the main actors are bilingual in German and English, and when the film was dubbed into English, each actor recorded his own part (with the exception of Martin Semmelrogge, who only dubbed his own role in the Director's Cut). The German version is dubbed as well, as the film was shot &quot;silent&quot;, because the dialogue spoken on-set would have been drowned out by the [[gyroscope]]s in the special camera developed for filming.  Interestingly, the film's German version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version at the United States box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;indiewire.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Archived copy&quot; /&gt;

== Production ==
During 1941, war correspondent [[Lothar-Günther Buchheim]] joined {{GS|U-96|1940|2}} for a single patrol, in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=Uziel&gt;{{cite book |author=Daniel Uziel |url=https://books.google.at/books?id=1pKnPzrPD7sC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;q=buchheim%20iron%20cross |title=The Propaganda Warriors: The Wehrmacht and the Consolidation of the German Home Front |location=Bern / Oxford |publisher=Lang |year=2008 |isbn=978-3-03911-532-7 |page=402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grauniad&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan van der Vat |authorlink = Dan van der Vat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2026462,00.html |title=Obituary: Lothar-Günther Buchheim |date=March 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His orders were to photograph and describe the [[U-boat]] in action. In 1973, Buchheim published a novel based on his wartime experiences, ''Das Boot'' (The Boat), a fictionalised autobiographical account narrated by a &quot;Leutnant Werner&quot;. It became the best-selling German fiction work on the war.&lt;ref name=Local /&gt; The follow up sequel ''Die Festung'' by Buchheim hit the bookshelves in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1995/22/Der_Krieg_aus_dem_Naehkaestchen|title=Der Krieg aus dem Nähkästchen|first=Peter|last=Wapnewski|date=26 May 1995|publisher=|via=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production for this film originally began in 1976. Several American directors were considered, and the ''Kaleun'' (''Kapitänleutnant'') was to be played by [[Robert Redford]]. Disagreements sprang up among various parties and the project was shelved. Another Hollywood production was attempted with other American directors in mind, this time with the ''Kaleun'' to be portrayed by [[Paul Newman]]. This effort primarily failed due to technical concerns, for example, how to film the close encounter of the two German submarines at sea during a storm.

Production of ''Das Boot'' took two years (1979–1981). Most of the filming was done in one year; to make the appearance of the actors as realistic as possible, scenes were filmed in sequence over the course of the year. This ensured natural growth of beards and hair, increasing skin pallor, and signs of strain on the actors, who had, just like real U-boat men, spent many months in a cramped, unhealthy atmosphere.

The production included the construction of several models of different sizes, as well as a complete, detailed reconstruction of the interior of the {{GS|U-96|1940|2}}, a [[German Type VII submarine|Type VIIC-class U-boat]].

Hans-Joachim Krug, former first officer on [[German submarine U-219|U-219]], served as a consultant, as did [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]], the captain of the real [[German submarine U-96 (1940)|U-96]].

=== Sets and models ===
[[File:Baselapallice08.jpg|thumb|[[U-boat pens]] at the harbor of [[La Rochelle]] (2007)&lt;br /&gt;{{coord|46|9|32|N|1|12|33|W|type:landmark_scale:3000_region:FR|display=inline}}]]
[[File:U995 2004 1.jpg|thumb|[[U 995]], a U-boat of the version VII-C/41, at its exhibition in [[Laboe]] in 2004]]

Several different sets were used. Two full-size mock-ups of a Type VIIC boat were built, one representing the portion above water for use in outdoor scenes, and the other a cylindrical tube on a motion mount for the interior scenes. The mock-ups were built according to U-boat plans from [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].

The outdoor mock-up was basically a shell propelled with a small engine, and stationed in La Rochelle, France and has a history of its own. One morning the production crew walked out to where they kept it afloat and found it missing. Someone had forgotten to inform the crew that an American filmmaker had rented the mock-up for his own film shooting in the area. This filmmaker was [[Steven Spielberg]] and the film he was shooting was ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Marcus Hearn | title =The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =Harry N. Abrams Inc, Publishers | year =2005 | location =[[New York City|New York]] | pages =127–134| isbn =0-8109-4968-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, during production, the mock-up cracked in a storm and sank, was recovered and patched to stand in for the final scenes. The full-sized mock-up was used during the Gibraltar surface scenes; the attacking aircraft (played by a [[North American T-6 Texan]] / Harvard) and rockets were real while the British ships were models.

A mock-up of a conning tower was placed in a water tank at the [[Bavaria Film Studios|Bavaria Studios]] in [[Munich]] for outdoor scenes not requiring a full view of the boat's exterior. When filming on the outdoor mockup or the conning tower, jets of cold water were hosed over the actors to simulate the breaking ocean waves. During the filming there was a scene where actor [[Jan Fedder]] (Pilgrim) fell off the bridge while the U-boat was surfaced. Fedder broke several ribs. This scene was not scripted and during the take one of the actors exclaims &quot;''Mann über Bord!''&quot; (&quot;Man overboard!&quot;) in order to draw attention to Fedder. Petersen, who at first did not realise this was an accident said &quot;Good idea, Jan. We'll do that one more time!&quot; However, since Fedder was genuinely injured and had to be hospitalised, this was the only take available and eventually Petersen kept this scene in the film. In this scene, the pained expression on Fedder's face is authentic and not acted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/trivia &quot;Das Boot&quot; on imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Petersen also had to rewrite Fedder's character for a portion of the film so that the character was portrayed as bedridden. For his scenes later in the film Fedder had to be brought to and from set from the hospital since he suffered a concussion while filming his accident scene. Fedder eventually recovered enough and Pilgrim is seen on his feet from the scene when the ''U-96'' abandons the British sailors. A half-sized full hull operating model was used for underwater shots and some surface running shots, in particular the meeting in stormy seas with another U-boat. The tank was also used for the shots of British sailors jumping from their ship; a small portion of the tanker hull was constructed for these shots.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The interior U-boat mock-up was mounted five metres off the floor and was shaken, rocked, and tilted up to 45 degrees by means of a hydraulic apparatus, and was vigorously shaken to simulate depth charge attacks. Petersen was admittedly obsessive about the structural detail of the U-boat set, remarking that &quot;every screw&quot; in the set was an authentic facsimile of the kind used in a [[World War II]] U-boat. In this he was considerably assisted by the numerous photographs [[Lothar-Günther Buchheim]] had taken during his own voyage on the historical ''U-96'', some of which had been published in his 1976 book, ''U-Boot-Krieg'' (&quot;U-Boat War&quot;).

Throughout the filming, the actors were forbidden to go out in sunlight, to create the pallor of men who seldom saw the sun during their missions. The actors went through intensive training to learn how to move quickly through the narrow confines of the vessel.

=== Special camera ===
Most of the interior shots were filmed using a hand-held [[Arriflex]] of cinematographer [[Jost Vacano]]'s design to convey the claustrophobic atmosphere of the boat. It had two gyroscopes to provide stability, a different and smaller scale solution than the [[Steadicam]], so that it could be carried throughout the interior of the mock-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/19688881|title=SOC 2011 Historical Shot: Das Boot by Jost Vacano|work=Vimeo|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfgang Petersen created the film based on Buchheim's novel of the same name with several alterations to the plot and characters.

As a ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' in the autumn of 1941, Buchheim joined ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' [[Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock]] and the crew of {{GS|U-96|1940|2}} on her seventh patrol in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=Uziel /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grauniad&gt;{{cite news |author=Dan van der Vat |authorlink = Dan van der Vat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2026462,00.html |title=Obituary: Lothar-Günther Buchheim |date=March 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 October 1941, ''U-96'' left for her seventh patrol and joined group Stoßtrupp three days later. The next day, 31 October, the group made contact with convoy OS 10. ''U-96'' launched four torpedoes at a long range, one of which struck the Dutch SS ''Benekom''. The ship went down half an hour after being hit, taking nine of her crew of 56 with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following the attack, the sloop {{HMS|Lulworth|Y60|6}} arrived on the scene and forced ''U-96'' under water with gun fire. The U-boat escaped the barrage of 27 depth charges unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The next day, ''U-96'' encountered two more of the escorts, HMS ''Gorleston'' and {{HMS|Verbena|K85|2}}, but managed to escape again.

The U-boat spent November patrolling the North Atlantic as part of groups Störtebecker and Benecke, until secretly entering the neutral port
of [[Vigo]], Spain, and being resupplied by the interned German {{MV|Bessel}} on 27 November. After leaving Vigo, ''U-96'' made for the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], with orders to enter the Mediterranean. However, late on 30 November the U-boat was spotted by a [[Fairey Swordfish]] from No. 812 Squadron FAA and heavily damaged by two bombs dropped by the aircraft. Unable to reach her destination, ''U-96'' made for the port of Saint Nazaire. On the way she encountered the Spanish SS ''Cabo De Hornos'', which returned from South America, after delivering a group of Jewish refugees to the Dutch colony of [[Curaçao]], when Brazil denied them entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeffrey|last=Lesser|title=Welcoming the Undesirables.

In the film, there is only one ardent Nazi in the crew of 40, namely the First Watch Officer (referred to comically in one scene as ''Unser Hitlerjugendführer'' or &quot;Our [[Hitler Youth]] Leader&quot;). The rest of the officers are either indifferent or openly anti-Nazi (the Captain).  The enlisted sailors and NCO are portrayed as apolitical. In his book ''[[Iron Coffins]]'', former U-boat commander Herbert A. Werner states that the selection of naval personnel based on their loyalty to the party only occurred later in the war (from 1943 onward)  when the U-boats were suffering high casualties and when morale was declining. Such a degree of skepticism may or may not have occurred. In support of ''Das Boot'' on this subject, U-boat historian [[Michael Gannon (historian)|Michael Gannon]] maintains that the U-boat navy was one of the least pro-Nazi branches of the German armed forces.

Both the novel and the film had a much darker ending than in reality, where the U-boat returns to port only to be destroyed during an air raid with many of her crew killed or wounded. In reality, U-96 survived the war unscathed with the majority of her senior officers surviving as well, but much like its on-screen fate, it actually was sunk by Allied bombers at its berth in [[Wilhelmshaven]] in March 1945.

Even though the beginning and the end of the film occur in the port of [[La Rochelle]], it does not correspond historically. The [[submarine base]] in La Rochelle was not functional before November 1941, and at the time of the film the port was dried up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://francois.delboca.free.fr/fsbase.html |title=History of the submarine base of La Rochelle |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326025951/http://francois.delboca.free.fr/fsbase.html |archivedate=26 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Saint-Nazaire]] was the base used in the novel and where the U-96 was based at in late 1941, the film was changed to La Rochelle because its appearance had not changed to such a large degree in the years since World War II. Moreover, none of the British fighter-bombers of late 1941 to early 1942 had the range to bomb La Rochelle from bases in the U.K.; however, it is possible the fighters were carrier-based and not land based.{{syn|date=December 2019}}

;Buchheim's views of the film
Even though impressed by the technological accuracy of the film's set-design and port construction buildings, novelist [[Lothar-Günther Buchheim]] expressed great disappointment with Petersen's adaptation in a film review&lt;ref name=&quot;buchheim&quot;&gt;Lothar-Günter Buchheim (1981). [http://www.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~junghans/dasboot/inhalt.html ''Kommentar – Die Wahrheit blieb auf Tauchstation''] (&quot;Commentary: The truth remained hidden under the sea&quot;), ''Geo'', no. 10, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1981, describing Petersen's film as converting his clearly anti-war novel into a blend of a &quot;cheap, shallow American action flick&quot; and a &quot;contemporary German propaganda newsreel from World War II&quot;.&lt;ref name=Local&gt;{{cite news |author=Jörg Luyken |url=https://www.thelocal.de/20180206/lg-buchheim-the-multi-talented-and-irascible-genius-behind-das-boot |title=LG Buchheim: the multi-talented and irascible genius behind Das Boot |newspaper=[[The Local]] |location=Germany |date=February 6, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;buchheim&quot; /&gt; He also criticised the hysterical overacting of the cast, which he called highly unrealistic, despite their talent. Buchheim, after several attempts for an American adaptation had failed, had provided his own script as soon as Petersen was chosen as new director. It would have been a six-hour epic; Petersen turned him down because the producers were aiming for a 90-minute feature for international release. However, today's Director's Cut of ''Das Boot'' amounts to 207 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/das-boot-the-director-s-cut-1200449025/|title=Das Boot: The Director’s Cut|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|last2=McCarthy|first2=Todd|date=1997-03-31|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Versions}} Different versions and home video ==
Director Wolfgang Petersen has overseen the creation of several different versions of his film. The first to be released was the 149-minute theatrical cut which was released in Germany on September 17, 1981 and subsequently in the United States on February 10, 1982. It was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]] for ([[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Directing]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Sound]] ([[Milan Bor]], [[Trevor Pyke]] and [[Mike Le Mare]]), [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Sound Effects Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Writing]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars1983&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1983 |title=The 55th Academy Awards (1983) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-10-09|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was partly financed by German television broadcasters [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and the [[Süddeutscher Rundfunk|SDR]], and much more footage had been shot than was shown in the theatrical version. A version of six 50-minute episodes was transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in the United Kingdom in October 1984 and, again during the Christmas 1998 season. In February 1985 a version of three 100-minute episodes was broadcast in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puremovies.co.uk/columns/das-boot-probably-the-biggest-german-blockbuster-of-all-time/|title=Das Boot – Probably the Biggest German Blockbuster of All Time  : Pure Movies|website=www.puremovies.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmstarts.de/nachrichten/18516631.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Petersen then supervised the editing of six hours of film, from which was distilled a 209-minute version, ''Das Boot: The Director's Cut''. Released to cinemas worldwide in 1997, this cut combines the action sequences seen in the feature-length version with character development scenes contained in the mini-series. In addition, the audio quality was improved and modified over previous releases.&lt;ref&gt;Official ''Das Boot'' website audio restoration information http://www.dasboot.com/classics.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Petersen had originally planned to release his director's cut version in 1981, but for commercial reasons it was not possible. In 1998 it was released on DVD as a single-disc edition including an audio commentary by Petersen, lead actor Jürgen Prochnow and director's cut producer Ortwin Freyermuth; a 6-minute making-of featurette; and in most territories, the theatrical trailer. In 2003 it was also released as a &quot;[[Superbit]]&quot; edition with no extra features, but a superior quality higher bit-rate and the film spread across two discs.

The miniseries version was released on DVD in 2004, as ''Das Boot: The Original Uncut Version'', also with enhanced audio and video quality. It omits the episode opening flashback scenes of the 1984 television broadcast so is slightly shorter, running 293 minutes.

From 2010 onwards, the 208-minute &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, along with various new extras, was released internationally on [[Blu-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://film.avclub.com/das-boot-the-director-s-cut-1798168781|title=Das Boot: The Director’s Cut|first=Noel|last=Murray|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bluray-disc.de/blu-ray-filme/das-boot-blu-ray-disc | title=Das Boot (Directors Cut) Blu-ray | accessdate=2014-03-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720045229/http://www.bluray-disc.de/blu-ray-filme/das-boot-blu-ray-disc | archive-date=20 July 2010 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American 2-disc Collector's Set also uniquely included the original 149-minute theatrical cut, which is otherwise unreleased on DVD or Blu-ray.

In 2014 the original miniseries, also known as &quot;The Original Uncut Version&quot;, was released on Blu-ray in Germany with optional English audio and subtitles.

In November 2018, &quot;Das Boot Complete Edition&quot; was released as a collection of 5 Blu-ray discs and 3 CDs.  It contains more than 30 hours of material: the Director's Cut (208 min.), the Original Cinema version (149 min.), the complete TV Series in 6 parts (&quot;The Original Uncut Version&quot;, 308 min.), Bonus Material (202 min. + various trailers), the Original Soundtrack by [[Klaus Doldinger]] (38:21 min.) and an Audio Book of the novel read by [[Dietmar Bär]] in German (910 min.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Das-Boot-Complete-Bonus-BD-Soundtrack/dp/B07J35TB8S|title=Das Boot Complete Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, the Original Cinema version and &quot;The Original Uncut Version&quot; TV Series, new English language soundtracks were recorded featuring most of the original cast, who were bilingual. These soundtracks are included on various DVD and Blu-ray releases as an alternate language to the original German.

Today, the film is seen as [[Films considered the greatest ever#Germany|one of the greatest of all German films]]. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 98% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 9.05/10.

The film was ranked #25 in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the [[55th Academy Awards]], ''Das Boot'' was nominated for six awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars1983&quot; /&gt; To this day, it holds the record for the most Academy Award nominations for a German film.

In late 2007, there was an exhibition about the film ''Das Boot'', as well as about the real U-boat ''U-96'', at the [[Haus der Geschichte]] (House of German History) in [[Bonn]]. Over 100,000 people visited the exhibition during its four-month run.

== Soundtrack ==
The characteristic lead melody of the soundtrack, composed and produced by [[Klaus Doldinger]], took on a life of its own after German [[rave]] group [[U96]] created a remixed &quot;techno version&quot; in 1991. The title theme &quot;[[Das Boot (song)|Das Boot]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs master|162882|Die Original Titelmelodie: Das Boot (Klaus Doldinger single)}}&lt;/ref&gt; later became an international hit.

The official soundtrack&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs master|55391|Das Boot (Die original Filmmusik) (album)}}&lt;/ref&gt; features only compositions by Doldinger, except for &quot;[[J'attendrai]]&quot; sung by [[Rina Ketty]]. The soundtrack (&quot;Filmmusik&quot;) released following the release of ''The Director's Cut'' version omits &quot;J'attendrai&quot;.

Songs heard in the film, but not included on the album are &quot;[[La Paloma]]&quot; sung by [[Rosita Serrano]], the &quot;[[Erzherzog-Albrecht-Marsch]]&quot; (a popular military march), &quot;[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]&quot; performed by the [[MVD Ensemble|Red Army Chorus]], &quot;[[Heimat, Deine Sterne]]&quot; and the [[Westerwaldlied (song)|Westerwald-Marsch]].

== Sequel ==
A [[Das Boot (TV series)|sequel of the same name]], in the form of a television series, was released in 2018, with different actors. It was set 9 months after the end of the original film, and is split into two narratives, one based on land, the other set around another U-boat and its crew. Like the original film, the series is based on [[Lothar-Günther Buchheim]]'s 1973 book ''Das Boot'', but with additions from Buchheim's 1995 follow up sequel ''Die Festung''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoerzu.de&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hoerzu.de/unterhaltung/aktuelles/das-boot-die-neue-serie|title=Das Boot • Die neue Serie – Starttermin &amp; Stars|website=www.hoerzu.de|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kino.de&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kino.de/serie/das-boot-die-fernsehserie-1981/news/das-boot-2018-cast-infos-starttermin-neue-sky-serie/|title=„Das Boot“ 2018 – Infos, Cast &amp; Starttermin der Sky-Serie|website=kino.de|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
