Libertarian author [[Samuel Konkin]] recalled Rohrabacher as &quot;a charismatic campus activist, radicalized by [[Robert LeFevre]] who provided him with small funding to travel the country with his instrument and folk songs from campus to campus, converting YAF chapters into [[Libertarian Alliance]]s and [[International Society for Individual Liberty|SIL]] chapters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|publisher=spaz.org|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrabacher left the Reagan administration in 1988 to pursue [[Dan Lungren]]'s trecently vacated House seat.

===Tenure===
[[File:Danarohrabacher105th.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of Rohrabacher from the 105th Congress's directory (1997)]]
In 1990, Rohrabacher opposed the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] and joined [[Mel Hancock]] in demanding its abolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-05/entertainment/ca-1105_1_dana-rohrabacher|title=Embattled NEA Will Survive, Lawmaker Says : Arts: Although Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher demands abolition of the National Endowment for the Arts, most officials back the government grant program.|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February letter to other members of Congress, Rohrabacher sent a photograph by artist and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] activist [[David Wojnarowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/04/21/nea-funded-art-exhibit-protested/1c9a2564-15b0-453d-9fc2-1b7162d1de81/|title=NEA-FUNDED ART EXHIBIT PROTESTED|date=April 21, 1990|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, liberal constitutional rights group [[People for the American Way]] announced its intent to launch a newspaper advert campaign against Rohrabacher. Western vice president of the organization Michael Hudson stated, &quot;Americans overwhelmingly reject censorship of the arts and support the NEA. Rep. Rohrabacher has taken the leading role in the House calling for the abolishment of the NEA. If we are to win this battle, we must energize and mobilize the creative community here in Los Angeles.&quot; Rohrabacher welcomed the announcement, stating that his constituents &quot;don't want federal dollars to go to sacrilegious or obscene art&quot; and that it would help voters to understand the issue. Explaining his position, Rohrabacher stated that he did not believe &quot;anyone should be prevented from seeing what they want to see or painting what they want to paint...on their own time and their own dime. But if you get a government subsidy, that's another question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-20/local/me-1509_1_dana-rohrabacher|title=Group Plans Anti-Rohrabacher Ads|first=Robert W.|last=Stewart|date=April 20, 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, the House passed a bill to reauthorize funds for the NEA with the directive that the organization could not fund obscene art. Rohrabacher introduced an amendment that would include specific guidelines on the kind of art projects that could not be funded, such as works that were sexually explicit or denigrated the American flag or religions, the amendment being rejected by a vote of 249-175. Rohrabacher stated his amendment was supposed to ensure that the federal government was &quot;not subsidizing obscenity, child pornography, attacks on religion, desecration of the American flag or any other of the outrages we have seen in the past.&quot; By the time the House passed the bill, Rohrabacher had become known as &quot; the House's most outspoken critic of the NEA&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/11/House-passes-arts-funding-compromise/1858655617600/|title=House passes arts-funding compromise|date=October 10, 1999|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1991, Rohrabacher wrote a letter to the civil rights division of the Education Department after seven Filipino students complained to the media that they were denied admission to the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD). Rohrabacher requested the department conduct a federal civil rights investigation on what seemed to be &quot;a quota based upon race that illegally discriminates against Filipino-Americans and possibly applicants of other races&quot;. UCSD vice chancellor for undergraduate affairs Joseph Watson refused the letter, dismissing Rohrabacher as &quot;wrong when he says that 40% of admissions are reserved for certain races&quot;. He stated that the school ranks all applicants using a grade-based formula. Watson charged Rohrabacher with fanning hysteria over discrimination: &quot;The Rohrabacher approach is to play to public fears that something fishy is going on. We don't want anyone to feel we're not giving everyone a fair and equitable review that can stand up to any scrutiny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-10/local/me-205_1_dana-rohrabacher|title=Congressman Accuses UCSD of Bias : Quotas: Rep.

In June 2015, Rohrabacher released a statement accusing former treasurer of his reelection committee, Jack Wu, of embezzling more than $170,000 from his campaign. Rohrabacher's attorney Charles H. Bell Jr. stated that the congressman had filed criminal charges against Wu with the Orange County district attorney and state attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-rohrabacher-campaign-embezzlement-170-000-20150624-story.html|title=Rohrabacher accuses campaign treasurer of stealing $170,000|first=Michael|last=Finnegan|date=June 24, 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;2011 visit to Iraq
During a trip to Iraq in June 2011, he said that Iraq should pay back the US for all the money it had spent since the invasion, when it becomes a wealthy country. Rohrabacher also commented he would be holding a hearing with the Sub-Committee on Oversight and Investigations into whether Iraq committed &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; during an attack on [[Camp Ashraf]] in April 2011. The incident left 34 residents killed and over 300 wounded. The delegation was denied access to the camp by Iraqi government, citing their sovereignty. Rohrabacher's delegation was subsequently asked to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dana Rohrabacher, U.S. Congressman, Suggests That Iraq Pay Back U.S. For War Cos|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/10/dana-rohrabacher-iraq-war-cost_n_875163.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=June 11, 2011|date=2011-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/war-zones/iraq-bars-us-visit-to-iranian-camp/2011/06/10/AGqpHFPH_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=William | last=Wan | date=2011-06-10 | title=Iraq bars U.S. visit to Iranian camp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Payment for 30-year-old screenplay
On November 4, 2005, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Rohrabacher was paid $23,000 for a 30-year-old screen play he had written. At issue was whether the producer paid him for the screenplay or for introductions to congressional and federal officials. Rohrabacher said that the introductions were made in good faith, were nothing that was not done regularly for legitimate causes, and that the introductions had only become an issue because of [[Joseph Medawar]]'s alleged misdeeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Welkos|first= Robert W.|url= https://articles.latimes.com/2005/12/11/calendar/ca-rohrabacher11|title= And now, the plot thickens|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 2005-12-11|accessdate= 2008-04-15|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080609060204/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/12/11/calendar/ca-rohrabacher11|archive-date= June 9, 2008|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, Rohrabacher announced through his press secretary that he would return the $23,000. The decision was made public shortly before Medawar took responsibility in a United States District Court for bilking $3.4 million from about 50 investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohrabacher to Give Back $23,000 – Los Angeles Times | first1=Greg | last1=Krikorian | first2=Christine | last2=Hanley | date=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Rohrabacher faced criticism for refusing to meet with constituents that showed up at his local Huntington Beach office.

===Russia===
On September 8, 2008, at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, Rohrabacher argued that the Georgians had initiated a recent military confrontation in the ongoing [[Russia–Georgia war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/12/america/NA-US-Lawmaker-Russia-Georgia.php|title=US Congressman defends Russia in Georgia conflict|work=International Herald Tribune|date=2008-09-12|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-13183/r_538/Russia_Georgia_conflict_U.S._hearings/ |title=U.S. Intelligence Sees It Russia's Way |work=Kommersant |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2008-09-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912231620/http://www.kommersant.com/p-13183/r_538/Russia_Georgia_conflict_U.S._hearings/ |archivedate=2008-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2827424/Rebel-Republican-congressman-Dana-Rohrabacher-backs-Russia-over-Georgia.html|title=Rebel Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher backs Russia over Georgia |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=2008-09-14|accessdate=2008-09-14|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Rohrabacher gave a speech urging the right to self-determination for the Baloch people in Pakistan at a UNPO conference in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2013/02/27/us-congressman-rohrabacher-demands-referendum-in-balochistan/|title=US Congressman Rohrabacher demands referendum in Balochistan|work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported in multiple sources that Rohrabacher is known for his long-time friendship with Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]] and his defense of &quot;the Russian point of view.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Putin's Washington|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putins-washington-113894#ixzz3O6keOMJp|work=[[Politico Magazine]]|date=January–February 2015|last=O'Brien|first=Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://theweek.com/speedreads/666135/gop-rep-dana-rohrabacher-fiercely-defends-russia-calls-human-rights-violations-baloney|title=GOP Rep.

It was not reported for another year that around that time, Rohrabacher had planned, in his capacity as chair of the Europe subcommittee, to hold a hearing on the [[Magnitsky Act]], which bars certain Russian officials from entering the United States or holding any financial assets in American banks. At the hearing [[Bill Browder]], the American-born investor who had lobbied for the act's passage after what he claims was the illegal appropriation of his [[hedge fund]]'s assets and the subsequent murder of his Russian lawyer [[Sergei Magnitsky]], was to testify. Rohrabacher planned to subject him to what was described as a &quot;[[show trial]]&quot;, where in addition to questioning Browder closely and skeptically about his claims, a feature-length [[documentary film]] critical of the Magnitsky claims, directed by [[Andrei Nekrasov]], was to be shown in its entirety. Among the other witnesses scheduled to testify were Russian lawyer [[Natalia Veselnitskaya]], a longtime lobbyist against the Magnitsky Act; at around the same time, she had attended [[Trump campaign–Russian meeting|a meeting]] with [[Donald Trump Jr]], [[Jared Kushner]] and Trump's then-campaign manager [[Paul Manafort]] at which the Russians purportedly offered to share negative information about [[Hillary Clinton]], Trump's opponent in that year's election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Beast Browder hearing article&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hines|first=Nico|title=GOP Lawmaker Got Direction From Moscow, Took It Back to D.C.|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-lawmaker-got-direction-from-moscow-took-it-back-to-dc|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=July 19, 2017|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Foreign Affairs Committee chairman [[Ed Royce]] learned of the plans, he canceled the hearing and forbade Rohrabacher from showing the film. In its stead, he held a full committee hearing on U.S.-Russia relations at which Rohrabacher was allowed to submit some of the pro-Russian claims into evidence. The film was ultimately shown at the [[Newseum]], and an intern in Rohrabacher's office who later worked for the Trump transition team sent emails promoting the film from the subcommittee offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Beast Browder hearing article&quot; /&gt;

After [[Donald Trump]] won the 2016 presidential election, Rohrabacher defended his approach to improving [[Russia–United States relations|Russian–American relations]]. He had previously met at least twice to discuss Russian sanctions with [[Rinat Akhmetshin]], a former Soviet spy &quot;who met with President Trump's son, son-in-law and campaign manager in June 2016&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-rohrabacher-has-met-with-lobbyist-who-1500062618-htmlstory.html|title=California politics updates: Legislature extends cap-and-trade on a rare bipartisan vote|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2017 interview with [[CNN]], Rohrabacher said, &quot;We have a huge double standard with Russia when it comes to prisoners and other things,&quot; and further stated that interference by the Russian intelligence services' in the 2016 U.S. election was the same as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) bugging German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel|Angela Merkel's]] phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/politics/rohrabacher-prevezon/index.html|title=US Congressman talks Russian money laundering with alleged ex-spy in Berlin|author=Michael Weiss |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Rohrabacher voted for imposing new sanctions on Iran, North Korea, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/25/house-overwhelmingly-approves-russia-sanctions-240951|title=House approves Russia sanctions that handcuff Trump|date=July 25, 2017|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs placed restrictions on Rohrabacher's ability to use committee money to pay for foreign travel due to concerns over his interest in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-leaders-refusing-to-pay-for-dana-rohrabachers-travel-over-russia-fears|title=GOP Leaders Refusing To Pay For Dana Rohrabacher's Travel Over Russia Fears|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-10-24|date=October 24, 2017|last1=Hines|first1=Nico|first2=Sam|last2=Stein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Fox Business Channel on August 24, 2018, Rohrabacher attacked Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], because Sessions had refused to fire Robert Mueller and shut down the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Russia collusion investigation]]. He said: &quot;The fact that Jeff Sessions has not quit is a disloyalty to this president and to the country, the fact is, if he disagrees with what the president wants him to do, he should resign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-rohrabacher-sessions-20180824-story.html|title=Rohrabacher says Sessions should resign if he won't bend to Trump's will|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===
In 2006, Rohrabacher chaired the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|U.S. House Committee on International Relations]], which investigated whether the Oklahoma City bombers had assistance from foreign sources; the committee determined there was no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/24/AR2006122400571.html |work=The Washington Post |first=John |last=Solomon |title=Panel Faults FBI in Okla.

Rohrabacher has said that he sees Islam as the source of a major terrorist threat to the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsmax&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scicchitano|first1=Paul|last2=Walter|first2=Kathleen|title=Rohrabacher: US and Russia Must Unite to Fight Islamic Threat|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/rohrabacher-us-russia-fight/2013/06/05/id/508183|publisher=Newsmax|date=June 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221092718/http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/rohrabacher-us-russia-fight/2013/06/05/id/508183/|archivedate=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about Islam, he said during a hearing in April 2013, &quot;I hope we all work together against a religion that will motivate people to murder children and other threats to us as a civilization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown|first=Hayes|title=GOP Congressman Says Islam Will 'Motivate People To Murder Children'|url=http://thinkprogress.org/security/2013/04/26/1928321/rohrabacher-boston-islam/|website=[[ThinkProgress]]|accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rohrabacher suggested that Iraq's borders be redrawn in response to the establishment of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140723/NEWS05/307230061 |title=U.S. officials, lawmakers clash over Iraq policy |date=July 23, 2014 |work=Military Times |agency=AP |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]], Rohrabacher put out a press release stating that he felt &quot;outrage&quot; and a &quot;renewed commitment to defeat and destroy the radical Islamic movement that fosters such mayhem.&quot; He stressed that Americans must &quot;be sure not to label all Muslims as terrorist murderers.&quot; Rohrabacher met Seddique Mateen, the father of the shooter, in 2014 during routine meetings with constituents. He called Mateen an &quot;estranged individual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkowitz61616&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berkowitz|first1=Bonnie|last2=Cai|first2=Weiyi|last3=Lu|first3=Denise|last4=Gamio|first4=Lazaro|title=Everything lawmakers said (and didn't say) after the Orlando mass shooting|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/how-lawmakers-responded-to-the-orlando-mass-shooting/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2017, during a [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]] hearing on Lebanon's [[Hezbollah]], a day after two [[2017 Tehran attacks|ISIL attacks in Tehran]], Rohrabacher said that:&lt;ref name =&quot;Garcia&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|We have recently seen an attack on Iran, and the Iranian government, the mullahs, believe that Sunni forces have attacked them. This may signal a ratcheting up of certain commitments by the United States of America. As far as I'm concerned, I just want to make this point and see what you think, isn't it a good thing for us to have the United States finally backing up Sunnis who will attack Hezbollah and the Shiite threat to us? Isn't that a good thing? And if so, maybe this is a Trump — maybe it's a Trump strategy of actually supporting one group against another, considering that you have two terrorist organizations.}}

Rohrabacher's statement was criticised in social media by British political journalist [[Mehdi Hasan]], [[Human Rights Watch]] Deputy Director Jim Murphy, journalist [[Negar Mortazavi]], and the [[National Iranian American Council]], among others.&lt;ref name =&quot;Garcia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Carlos|title=GOP Rep criticized for shocking statement on ISIS attack in Iran|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/11/gop-rep-criticized-for-shocking-statement-on-isis-attack-in-iran/|accessdate=June 15, 2017|publisher=TheBlaze|date=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=January 2018}}

In a further statement to clarify his position, Rohrabacher wrote that he opposes &quot;the use of force against unarmed civilians no matter who is the victim or who is doing the killing&quot; but he is also against &quot;Iran's vicious Mullah monarchy&quot; and &quot;when it comes to Sunni terrorists or Shiite terrorists, I prefer them to target each other rather than any other victims, especially innocent civilians and Americans.&quot; He added that it will &quot;require support for those proud Iranians who want to win their freedom and heritage from Mullahs and are willing to fight for it. That does not include Isis, but it may include a lot of Iranians who see blowing up Khomeini's mausoleum as an expression of freedom from the yolk [sic] of Islamic terror.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rohrabacherclarification&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrorist Attack: Clarification of My Position|url=http://www.rohrabacher.com/news/terrorist-attack-clarification-of-my-position|publisher=rohrabacher.com|date=June 12, 2017|access-date=June 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616215855/http://www.rohrabacher.com/news/terrorist-attack-clarification-of-my-position|archive-date=June 16, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense of interrogation techniques and extraordinary rendition===
On April 17, 2007, during a House hearing on trans-Atlantic relations, Rohrabacher defended the Bush administration's program of [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]]. He said that the unfair treatment of one innocent suspect is an acceptable &quot;unfortunate consequence&quot; of holding others who would otherwise be free to commit terror acts. After he received boos and groans from the gallery, Rohrabacher responded, &quot;Well, I hope it's your families, I hope it's your families that suffer the consequences,&quot; and &quot;I hope it's your family members that die.&quot; Rohrabacher was subsequently interrupted by protesters wearing orange jumpsuits who were removed from the gallery. For his comment that imprisoning and torturing one innocent person was a fair price to pay for locking up 50 terrorists who would &quot;go out and plant a bomb and kill 20,000 people&quot;, on April 25 Rohrabacher was named ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann's'' &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congressman Dana Rohrabacher Personifies Why Many Dislike America and Its Policies|author=Ann Wright|url=http://www.truth-out.org/article/ann-wright-rep-rohrabacher-typifies-why-many-dislike-america|newspaper=truthout|date=April 23, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615203430/http://www.truth-out.org/article/ann-wright-rep-rohrabacher-typifies-why-many-dislike-america|archive-date=2010-06-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/2007/04/24/rohrabacher-terrorists/|title=Rep.

===Afghanistan===
Rohrabacher's interest in Afghanistan extends back at least to the late 1980s, before his time in office, when he entered the country in the company of [[mujahedin]] fighters who were fighting [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet occupation forces]]. Reportedly, these fighters &quot;actually engaged Soviet troops in combat near the city of [[Jalalabad]] during the two months Rohrabacher was with them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Lawmaker Questions Approaches To Pakistan, Afghanistan |author=Ron Synovitz |date=December 7, 2007 |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1079238.html|accessdate=August 22, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989), Rohrabacher said his &quot;passion&quot; was to bring back the country's exiled king, [[Muhammad Zahir Shah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dana Rohrabacher's War|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/04/dana-rohrabacher-afghanistan-war/|work=Mother Jones|first=Daniel|last=Schulman|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Rohrabacher defended the new Afghan constitution against those who saw in it mainly empowerment of warlords, saying:

{{quote|I've heard a lot of negative posturing about ... these people who happened to have been the guys who sided with the United States ... Dostam, Atta, Khan ... these were the people who defeated the Taliban ... Just keep that in mind if you're an American. They came to help us defeat people who slaughtered our own people [September 11, 2001]. And I'm grateful for that. And I'm not about to label them in these pejorative terms [as warlords], especially when the Taliban are still on the border. ... I would admonish [you] not to go so quickly in getting rid of people who helped us defeat the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite web |title=The New Afghan Constitution: A Step Backwards for Democracy |author=James Ingalls |date=March 10, 2004 |url=http://www.fpif.org/articles/the_new_afghan_constitution_a_step_backwards_for_democracy |accessdate=2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rohrabacher has since become a proponent of withdrawing from Afghanistan. He protested against the troop build-up in Afghanistan by President Obama, saying &quot;If the Taliban is going is be defeated, it's got to be by the Afghan people themselves, not by sending more U.S. troops, which could actually be counterproductive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TNR-Crowley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal = The New Republic |author = Michael Crowley |title = Dana Rohrabacher, Unlikely Afghanistan Dove |date = October 1, 2009 |url = http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-plank/dana-rohrabacher-washingtons-most-surprising-afghanistan-dove |accessdate = 2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Congressman [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern]] offered an amendment in 2011 requiring the Pentagon to draw up an exit plan from Afghanistan, Rohrabacher was just one of six Republicans to sign on. Rohrabacher voted for McGovern's Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, requiring an exit plan from Afghanistan. The bill failed by a 204–215 margin.&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll373.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrabacher was against former President Obama's gradual drawdown of troops, instead supporting a full withdrawal. Saying &quot;If we're going to leave, we should leave.&quot; Rohrabacher has said that &quot;The centralized system of government foisted upon the Afghan people is not going to hold after we leave.&quot; And &quot;So let's quit prolonging the agony and inevitable. Karzai's regime is corrupt and non representative of Afghanistan's tribal culture. This failed strategy is not worth one more drop of American blood. Under the current strategy, our military presence alienates more Afghans that it pacifies. So if you're going to pull the plug, then we need to get the hell out now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rohrabacher.house.gov/|title=Congressman Dana Rohrabacher|publisher=Congressman Dana Rohrabacher|access-date=January 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102040634/https://rohrabacher.house.gov/|archive-date=January 2, 2019|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrabacher has repeatedly raised high-level concerns in the [[US Congress]] and Washington, D.C., about the significant [[corruption in Afghanistan]], including the [[Kabul Bank]] scandal, where hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars allegedly disappeared in a short period of time at the apparent hands of close Karzai family members, including brothers [[Mahmoud Karzai]] (a.k.a. Mahmood Karzai) and [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]]. Rohrabacher worked to bring attention to the systemic corruption in the Karzai government and cut U.S. taxpayers' funding for these wasteful projects and programs, involving corruption within the [[Hamid Karzai]] government.

In April 2012, CNN reported that &quot;A top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee was asked by the State Department not to go to Afghanistan because President Hamid Karzai objected to the visit. ... Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, told Security Clearance he was readying to travel with five other Republicans from Dubai to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, when the State Department requested he stay behind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/23/republican-congressman-asked-to-stay-out-of-afghanistan/ |publisher=CNN |title=Clinton, Panetta ask congressman to stay out of Afghanistan |date=2012-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Kosovo independence===

Rohrabacher was opposed to the involvement of American ground troops in the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. He advocated for the direct bombing of the military on Yugoslav soil, criticizing the ineffectiveness of western forces against the Bosnian Serbs. (NATO was limited to small fixed attacks, as these Serbs penetrated UN safe areas and attacked Bosniak forces.) Rohrabacher said they &quot;should bomb Serbia's military infrastructure, in Serbia – get that, in Serbia – rather than dropping a couple of duds on tents, which only proves the West's gutlessness, and emboldens Serbian cutthroats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hE3oIMB6aj8C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;q=rohrabacher%20bomb%20serbs.%20military|title=Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia at peace and at war: selected writings, 1983–2007|author=Sabrina P.

In 2001, the leader of the [[Albanian American Civic League]] ethnic lobby group, [[Joseph J. DioGuardi]], praised Rohrabacher for his support to the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA), a militia that was once labeled by Bill Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans [[Robert Gelbard]] as a terrorist organization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shenon |first1=Philip |title=U.S. Says It Might Consider Attacking Serbs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/13/world/us-says-it-might-consider-attacking-serbs.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying &quot;He was the first member of Congress to insist that the United States arm the Kosova Liberation Army, and one of the few members who to this day publicly supports the independence of Kosova.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohrabacher Shills for the KLA.(Rep Dana Rohrabacher and the Kosovo Liberation Army)(Brief Article)|author=The New American|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-79789123|newspaper=The New American|date=May 4, 2001|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2001, Rohrabacher gave a speech in support of American equipping the KLA with weaponry, comparing it to French support of America in the Revolutionary War, saying &quot;Based on our own experience, the Kosova Liberation Army should have been armed. ... If the U.S. had armed the KLA in 1998, we would not be where we are today. The 'freedom fighters' would have secured their freedom and Kosova would be independent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rohrabacher Shills for the KLA.|author=The New American|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rohrabacher+Shills+for+the+KLA-a079789123|newspaper=The New American|date=September 24, 2001|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
After a reconnaissance flight over the [[Spratly Islands]] in 1998, Rohrabacher said, &quot;We can't ignore this bullying by the Communist Chinese in the Spratlys. The presence of the Chinese military troops...is not only a concern of the Philippines. It is also a concern of the U.S. and other democratic countries in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/15/news/mn-54172|title=Spratly Spat Heats Up Over Chinese 'Bullying'|first=David|last=Lamb|date=December 15, 1998|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1999, Rohrabacher led the House floor in opposition to legislation normalizing trade ties between the United States and China. The following year, as the House weighed another China trade bill, Rohrabacher said the trade bill was a giveaway to a select number of American billionaires and the Beijing regime, adding that President [[Bill Clinton]] could call &quot;communist China 'our strategic partner' until his face turns blue, but it won't make them any less red.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/07/news/mn-27471/2|title=GOP Split Over China Trade Bill|first=Nick|last=Anderson|date=May 7, 2000|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124131731/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/07/news/mn-27471/2|archive-date=November 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 interviews, Rohrabacher described the Chinese government under the leadership of [[Hu Jintao]] as &quot;a gangster regime that murders its own people&quot; and described the Chinese government as Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/china-hu-jintao-us-congress|title=Chinese president Hu Jintao given frosty reception on Capitol Hill|date=January 20, 2011|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, after President-elect Trump had a phone call with [[President of Taiwan]] [[Tsai Ing-wen]], Rohrabacher said the call had &quot;showed the dictators in Beijing that he's not a pushover&quot; and that China &quot;has had an enormously aggressive foreign policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/dana-rohrabacher-trump-taiwan-232188|title=Rohrabacher: Trump's Taiwan call shows China he's not a pushover|date=December 5, 2016|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organ harvesting in China====
{{main|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China|Persecution of Falun Gong#Organ harvesting}}
In 2012 Rohrabacher stated,

{{quote|The CCP and its state security machine uses a wide range of repression techniques including, not only limited to, censorship, beatings, home imprisonment, forced labor camps, those labor camps called the Laogai of course. And the most ghoulish manifestation of this gangsterism is the forced harvesting of organs of the political prisoners and religious followers that it arrests, particularly of the Chinese religious movement known as the Falun Gong.&lt;ref name=OH/&gt;}}

and

{{quote|to rip open the body of someone who is simply involved in a religious or personal or political idea that is contrary to the wishes of the ruling elite, to rip a body open of someone like that especially if that person's religious or political beliefs are pacifistic and not a physical threat to the regime, this is about the most monstrous crime that I can conceive of.&lt;ref name=OH&gt;[http://archives.republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/75859.pdf &quot;Organ Harvesting of Religious and Political Dissidents by the Chinese Communist Party&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907020421/http://archives.republicans.foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/75859.pdf |date=2016-09-07 }}, Joint Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, [[United States House of Representatives]], September 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Iraq War===
Rohrabacher voted in support of the [[Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll455.xml|title=Final Vote Results For Roll Call 455|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives }}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that he later said was &quot;a mistake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2010/03/dana-rohrabacher-afghanistan-war|title=Dana Rohrabacher's War|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In August 2012, Rohrabacher noted on his official website that he had written a letter addressed to the U.S. State Department, noting his support of U.S. sponsorship of separatist movements in Iran. This elicited criticism from the Iranian-American community, which included challenging Rohrabacher's understanding of the historical background alluded to in his letter to the Department of State.&lt;ref&gt;http://iranianfacebook.com/2012/08/27/congressman-dana-rohrabacher-embarrasses-himself-by-calling-for-a-separatist-movement-in-iran-based-on-a-flawed-historical-understaning/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, a day after an [[2017 Tehran attacks|ISIL attack in Tehran]], during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rohrabacher stated: &quot;Isn't it a good thing for us to have the United States finally backing up Sunnis who will attack Hezbollah and the Shiite threat to us, isn't that a good thing?&quot; This comment was strongly criticized by the [[National Iranian American Council]], which wrote, &quot;Rohrabacher has a long history of bizarre and offensive statements on Iran, but his callousness toward the Iranian victims of ISIS terror might be his most callous and extreme thus far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niacouncil.org/rohrabacher-tehran-terror-attacks-isnt-good-thing/|title=Rohrabacher on Tehran Terror Attacks: &quot;Isn't That a Good Thing?&quot;|date=June 7, 2017|publisher=[[National Iranian American Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrabacher supported removing the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] (MEK) from the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]]; it was included on the list from 1997 to 2012. Rohrabacher received $10,300 from the MEK between 2013 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/02/26/long-march-yellow/|title=Long March of the Yellow Jackets: How a One-Time Terrorist Group Prevailed on Capitol Hill|publisher=The Intercept|author=Ali Gharib, Eli Clifton|date=26 February 2015|access-date=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aid to Pakistan===
In May 2011, in the wake of Osama Bin Laden's death, Rohrabacher introduced a bill to stop aid to Pakistan, stating that members of the government and of Pakistan's security force, the ISI, were either sheltering Bin Laden or completely incompetent.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} &quot;We can no longer afford this foolishness. ... The time has come for us to stop subsidizing those who actively oppose us. Pakistan has shown itself not to be America's ally.&quot; Rohrabacher also demanded the return of the US helicopter that crashed in the operation to kill Bin Laden, stating &quot;If this is not done immediately, it is probable, given Pakistan's history, that our technology has already found its way into the hands of the Communist Chinese military that is buying, building, and stealing the necessary military technology to challenge the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt;

In June 2017, while speaking to Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs [[Tina Kaidanow]], Rohrabacher said, &quot;We need to go on the record here, in this part of our government, to say that we're not going to be providing weapons systems to Pakistan that we're afraid are going to shoot down our own people. And we know they're engaged in terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2017/06/15/us-lawmakers-skeptical-of-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-pakistan-lebanon/|title=US lawmakers skeptical of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Lebanon|first=Joe|last=Gould|date=June 15, 2017|publisher=defensenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for Mohiuddin Ahmed===
In 2007, Rohrabacher supported Mohiuddin Ahmed, a detainee in the U.S., who was said to be involved in an attempted coup in Bangladesh, during which several people were murdered. He was convicted of the [[assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/6-killers-bangabandhu-no-progress-bringing-them-back-1448734|title=6 Killers of Bangabandhu: No progress in bringing them back|date=2017-08-15|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013081303/http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/6-killers-bangabandhu-no-progress-bringing-them-back-1448734|archive-date=2017-10-13|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first President of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/wdb45b/the-man-who-allegedly-murdered-the-president-of-bangladesh-is-safe-in-canada|title=The Man Who Allegedly Murdered the President of Bangladesh Is Safe in Canada|date=2013-05-29|work=Vice|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh's extradition request was halted as Rohrabacher voiced concern about his legal rights, saying that he should be sent somewhere with no death penalty.

===Uzbekistan===
During a US Congressional delegation's visit to Uzbekistan in February 2013, Rohrabacher made several controversial statements.

In the wake of the [[2017 clashes at the Turkish Ambassador's Residence in Washington, D.C.|clashes at the Turkish Ambassador's Residence]] in May 2017, Rohrabacher called [[Donald Trump]] to never invite [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] again to the United States, and to bar Americans from purchasing Turkish government debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-push-trump-to-punish-erdogan-over-embassy-violence/article/2624165#!|title=Lawmakers push Trump to punish Erdogan over embassy violence|last=Gehrke|first=Joel|work=The Washington Examiner|access-date=2017-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eritrea ===
In August 2017, Rohrabacher proposed amending the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget whereby the United States would establish military ties with [[Eritrea]].&lt;ref name=voa2017-08-04&gt;{{Cite news | author=Salem Solomon | url=https://www.voanews.com/a/congressman-pushes-eritrea-us-military-partnership/3972539.html | title=Congressman Calls for US Military Partnership with Eritrea | publisher=[[Voice of America]] | date={{Date|2017-08-04}} | accessdate={{Date|2017-08-11}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrabacher suggested that the two countries should cooperate in fighting the [[War on Terror]], curbing Iranian influence in the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]], and securing the [[Red Sea]] region.&lt;ref name=voa2017-08-04 /&gt; At the time of Rohrabacher's proposal, Eritrea was subject to international sanctions due to its alleged support of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]], and to U.S. sanctions against the [[Eritrean Navy]] following an alleged shipment of [[North Korea]]n military hardware to Eritrea.&lt;ref name=newsweek2017-08-17&gt;{{Cite news | author=Conor Gaffey | url=http://www.newsweek.com/us-military-al-shabab-dana-rohrabacher-eritrea-647542 | title=U.S. Should Fight Terror With Eritrea, Accused of Sponsoring Al-Qaeda Affiliate, GOP Congressman Says | work=[[Newsweek]] | date={{Date|2017-08-07}} | accessdate={{Date|2017-08-11}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Julian Assange ===
In August 2017, Rohrabacher attended a meeting in London with [[Julian Assange]] organized and attended by right-wing political activist [[Charles C. Johnson]]. Rohrabacher said that the discussion was about the possibility of a presidential pardon in exchange for Assange supplying information on the [[Democratic National Committee cyber attacks|theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee]], which were published by [[WikiLeaks]] before the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Christine Mai-Duc |date=August 17, 2017 |url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-right-wing-blogger-charles-c-johnson-1502992726-htmlstory.html |title=Rohrabacher on meeting with WikiLeaks' Assange: We talked about 'what might be necessary to get him out.' |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nico Hines |date=February 2, 2020 |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-offered-assange-pardon-if-he-covered-up-russian-hack-court-hears |title=Trump Offered Assange Pardon if He Covered Up Russian Hack, WikiLeaks Founder’s Lawyer Claims |newspaper=Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, Rohrabacher and Johnson met with Senator [[Rand Paul]] (R-Kentucky) to discuss Assange supplying information about the source of leaked emails. However, Assange responded to news accounts of the meeting, tweeting, &quot;WikiLeaks never has and never will reveal a source. Offers have been made to me—not the other way around.

===Other foreign policy===

In March 2005, Rohrabacher introduced HR 1061, the American Property Claims Against Ethiopia Act, which would &quot;prohibit United States assistance to the Federal Democratic Republic of [[Ethiopia]] until the Ethiopian government returns all property of United States citizens&quot;. The bill was introduced by Rohrabacher at the behest of Gebremedhin Berhane, a former [[Eritrea]]n national and friend of the Rohrabacher family, after his business was expropriated by the Ethiopian government.

On March 7, 2006, Rohrabacher introduced HR 4895, an amendment to the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961, &quot;to limit the provision of the United States military assistance and the sale, transfer, or licensing of United States military equipment or technology to Ethiopia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eritreadaily.net/News0306/article0306261.htm|title=Eritrea, Ethiopia, Abramoff, and Rohrabacher|work=Eritrea Daily|date=2006-03-26|accessdate=2008-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704070429/http://www.eritreadaily.net/News0306/article0306261.htm|archive-date=2008-07-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an appearance on MSNBC's ''[[The Ed Show]]'', Rohrabacher accused Barack Obama of allowing violence in [[Iran]] to get out of hand because he did not speak forcefully enough against the country's leadership. He also said that Gorbachev tore down the Berlin Wall because Reagan told him to (&quot;[[Tear down this wall]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=476422 MSNBC &quot;The Ed Show&quot; Interview – Transcript] 2009-06-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, he went to Honduras to commend the election of the new president. His entourage included a group of Californian property investors and businessmen, a dealer in rare coins, and CEOs from San Diego biofuels corporation (which is headed by a family friend).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/21/wikileaks-summary-key-points-day-22 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=WikiLeaks embassy cables, day 22: summary of today's key points |date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrabacher had drawn public criticism for some of his positions. His controversial statements included the [[conspiracy theory]] claims, first promoted by the politically-biased conspiracy theory website [[Infowars]], that Democrats secretly organized the [[Unite the Right Rally]] in Charlottesville to provoke the violence by the alt-right (which led to the murder of one anti-Nazi protester) in order to discredit President Trump.

===Global warming===
Rohrabacher doubts that [[global warming]] is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by [[carbon dioxide]] released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by &quot;dinosaur flatulence&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ralph Hall to chair Science panel&quot;/&gt; &quot;In fact, it is assumed at best to be unproven and at worst a liberal claptrap, trendy, but soon to go out of style in our new Congress.&quot; ''[[Politico]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that on May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming and suggested that, if global warming is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and replanting. These reports sparked strong criticism by some scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the [[University of Leeds]]. They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55731.html|title=Do trees cause global warming?|work=Politico|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-30|first=Darren|last=Samuelsohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/republicans-climate-solution-clearcut-the-rain-forest/|title=Republican's Climate Solution: Clear-Cut the Rain Forest|work=The New York Times|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-30|first=John|last=Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Rohrabacher stated,

{{quote|Once again those with a global agenda have created a straw man by misrepresenting the position of their critics. I do not believe that CO2 is a cause of global warming, nor have I ever advocated the reduction of CO2 through the clearing of rainforests or cutting down older trees to prevent global warming. But that is how my question to a witness during my subcommittee hearing on May 25th is being reported. I simply asked the witness, Dr. Todd Stern, who is a supporter of a global climate treaty that would dramatically hurt the standard of living for millions of human beings, if he was considering a policy that would address naturally emitted carbon dioxide, which makes up over 90% of emissions. To suggest that I'm advocating such a radical approach instead of simply questioning the policy is a total misrepresentation of my position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rohrabacher.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=243674 |title=Rohrabacher Response to Misleading Reports on His Position Concerning Rainforests and Climate Change |publisher=Office of Dana Rohrabacher |date=May 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602033856/http://rohrabacher.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=243674 |archivedate=June 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rohrabacher does not believe that global warming is a problem.

===Healthcare===
On May 4, 2017, Rohrabacher voted in favor of repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare) and passing the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wash Post GOP Health&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/ahca-house-vote/|title=How the House voted to pass the GOP health-care bill|website=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/04/health-care-vote-puts-pressure-dozens-vulnerable-gop-reps/101297824/|title=Health care vote puts pressure on dozens of vulnerable GOP reps|work=USA Today |access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 2018 re-election campaign, Rohrabacher pledged to protect protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/republicans-fought-obamacare-now-they-re-campaigning-to-save-it|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrabacher voted for his party's Obamacare replacement bill that included state waivers from rules that prohibit charging higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Immigration===
Rohrabacher was an advocate for the state of California's [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]], which prohibited illegal immigrants from acquiring government services. In 2004, he sponsored an amendment that would have prohibited federal reimbursement of hospital-provided emergency care and certain transportation services to undocumented aliens unless the hospital provided information about the aliens' citizenship, immigration status, financial data, and employer to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Aliens who were in the country illegally would receive reimbursement only after they were deported. The proposed bill was defeated, 331–88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R.3722 |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.r.03722: |accessdate=2008-06-18|date=May 18, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Rohrabacher opined that the Republican Party was split on the issue of immigration: &quot;There are those of us who identify with the national wing and patriotic wing of the party who have always been adamant on the illegal immigration issues. And, on the other side, you have those people who believe in the business and global marketplace concept. So, you have a party with two different views on one of the major issues of the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2005/12/16/house-immigration-bill-focuses-on-security/|title=House immigration bill focuses on security|first=Dena|last=Buris|date=December 12, 2005|publisher=ocregister.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, Rohrabacher endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] in the Republican presidential primary, citing his positions on stemming illegal immigration and criticizing [[John McCain]]. About McCain, he said: &quot;He's been the enemy of those of us who have stemmed the flow of illegals into our country, whereas Romney has made some very tough commitments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caesar |first=Chris |url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/01/23/politics/dpt-endorsement23.txt|title=Rohrabacher supports Mitt Romney for president|publisher=Daily Pilot|date=2008-01-23|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Rohrabacher proposed the bill H.R. 787 known as the &quot;No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011&quot;. The bill: &quot;Amends title II of the Social Security Act to exclude from creditable wages and self-employment income any wages earned for services by aliens performed in the United States, and self-employment income derived from a trade or business conducted in the United States, while the alien was not authorized to be so employed or to perform a function or service in such a trade or business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h787/show |title=H.R.787: No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011 – U.S. Congress |publisher=OpenCongress |accessdate=June 22, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729191127/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h787/show |archivedate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an 18-year-old student visited Rohrabacher's office to discuss immigration reform. At some point their conversation became disagreeable, and the student said the congressman yelled at her: &quot;I hate illegals!&quot; He also allegedly threatened to deport her family. Rohrabacher's spokesperson has disputed both statements, averring that it was actually the student who started the confrontation by yelling at the spokesperson and telling her to &quot;butt out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCPR-Felde&quot;/&gt;

In September 2017, Rohrabacher supported the Trump administration's rescinding of the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program, saying that those &quot;in Congress must work to prevent such cynical loopholes from being created again by executive fiat&quot; despite their possible empathy for the immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dreamers-denied-Trump-administration-12173747.php|title=Trump ending DACA immigration program; Opponents slam 'heartless' move on Dreamers|first=Hamed|last=Aleaziz|date=September 5, 2017|publisher=sfgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization [[NumbersUSA]] has given Rep. Rohrabacher an A+ rating in accordance to his stance on illegal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.numberusa.com/content/my/congress/124/gradescoresheet/|title=Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Report Card - NumbersUSA - For Lower Immigration Levels|publisher=www.numbersusa.com}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT issues===
Rohrabacher has drawn controversy over his views on LGBT rights. He opposed [[same-sex marriage]] and endorsed [[2008 California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]], the ballot initiative in 2008 that would have prohibited same-sex marriage in California, during a debate at [[Orange Coast College]], stating he &quot;would suggest not changing the definition of marriage in our society to make a small number of people feel more comfortable&quot;.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2008/10/21/46th-congressional-candidates-debate-global-warming-and-bailout/|title=46th congressional candidates debate global warming and bailout|newspaper=Orange County Register|accessdate=2018-05-26|date=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rohrabacher voted in favor of the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in both 2004 and 2006, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would have defined marriage as between a man and a woman and forbade states from recognizing or legalizing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/CA/Dana_Rohrabacher.htm|title=Dana Rohrabacher on the Issues|last=OnTheIssues.org|publisher=www.ontheissues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] issued its decision in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' in 2013, that legalized [[same-sex marriage in California]], Rohrabacher criticized the decision, stating that the decision was &quot;not based on the merits of the issue but on a technicality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ocregister.com/2013/06/26/voices-on-gay-marriage-rulings/|title=Voices on gay-marriage rulings|date=June 26, 2013|newspaper=Orange County Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rohrabacher has appeared to have endorsed the idea of [[Marriage privatization|leaving marriage to religious institutions only]], stating on [[Twitter]] that churches should be solely responsible for conducting marriages but that the government should only recognize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=DanaRohrabacher |number=388739977871257600 |date=October 11, 2013 |title=@Diusgh @jlop117 Only so much space per tweet.

In May 2018, Rohrabacher provoked severe criticism after telling a meeting of the Orange County Association of Realtors that homeowners &quot;should be able to make a decision not to sell their home to someone (if) they don't agree with their lifestyle.&quot; Though the statement did not explicitly refer to LGBT people, it was widely interpreted as such. LGBT groups denounced Rohrabacher for the remarks, and the [[National Association of Realtors]], which had previously donated to Rohrabacher's re-election campaigns, condemned Rohrabacher, halted all of its financial support for him and repudiated its past donations to him. After Rohrabacher's constituents unseated him in favor of [[Harley Rouda]], ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' praised the results and condemned Rohrabacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange County Register&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collins|first1=Jeff|title=Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher says it's OK to not sell homes to gays; loses support of Realtors|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/05/24/dana-rohrabacher-says-its-ok-to-not-sell-homes-to-gays-loses-support-of-realtors/|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/2018/11/10/homophobe-dana-rohrabacher-loses-congressional-seat-harley-rouda|title=Homophobe Dana Rohrabacher Loses Congressional Seat to Harley Rouda|date=10 November 2018|publisher=The Advocate|accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannabis===
[[File:Steve kuykendall-Dana Rohrabacher.jpg|thumb|Dana Rohrabacher (right) with [[Steven T. Kuykendall]]]]
Rohrabacher supported the legalization of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for both medical and recreational purposes. He spoke against the policy of cannabis prohibition as early as May 2013, calling it a &quot;colossal failure&quot; in an op-ed penned for the ''[[Orange County Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohrabacher|first1=Dana|title=The colossal failure of marijuana prohibition|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/marijuana-508206-federal-prohibition.html|accessdate=January 22, 2017|work=Orange County Register|date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607142718/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/marijuana-508206-federal-prohibition.html|archive-date=June 7, 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further outlined his views in a May 2014 op-ed in ''[[National Review]]'', arguing that the prohibition of cannabis has incurred a number of undesirable costs upon free society, such as an increase in gang violence, soaring incarceration rates, unconstitutional seizure of private property through [[Civil forfeiture in the United States|civil forfeiture]], corruption and [[militarization of police]] forces, and negative impacts on minority communities and relationships with [[Latin-American]] countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;NR oped&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rohrabacher |first1=Dana|title=Let States Decide on Pot|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/379018/let-states-decide-pot-dana-rohrabacher|accessdate=November 16, 2016|work=National Review|date=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrabacher has called on fellow Republicans to reconsider their stance towards cannabis, citing core [[Conservatism|conservative]] principles such as limited government, individual liberty, respect for the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], and respect for the [[doctor–patient relationship]] that Rohrabacher says lend support to loosening current laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron C.|title=GOP congressman: Republicans should embrace marijuana legalization|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/gop-congressman-republicans-should-embrace-marijuana-legalization/2014/11/14/49e20ad8-6b77-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html|accessdate=November 16, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=November 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117144405/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/gop-congressman-republicans-should-embrace-marijuana-legalization/2014/11/14/49e20ad8-6b77-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html |archive-date=November 17, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes conservative leaders such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[William F.

Rohrabacher is a strong proponent of [[states' rights]] when it comes to cannabis policy. He has introduced the [[Rohrabacher–Farr amendment]] for a number of years beginning in 2003, to prohibit the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical cannabis laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullum|first1=Jacob|title=The Federal Ban on Medical Marijuana Was Not Lifted|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/01/04/the-federal-ban-on-medical-marijuana-was|accessdate=November 16, 2016|work=Reason|date=January 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment passed the House for the first time in May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=October 26, 2016|title=Rohrabacher Urges Continuation of Medical Marijuana Amendment|url=https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-urges-continuation-of-medical-marijuana-amendment|access-date=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129210038/https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-urges-continuation-of-medical-marijuana-amendment |archive-date=November 29, 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming law in December 2014 as part of an [[omnibus spending bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=December 16, 2014|title=Rohrabacher, Farr Hail Medical Marijuana Amendment in Funding Bill|url=https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-farr-hail-medical-marijuana-amendment-in-funding-bill|access-date=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209021923/https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-farr-hail-medical-marijuana-amendment-in-funding-bill |archive-date=December 9, 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=June 4, 2015|title=Rohrabacher Hails Passage of Medical Marijuana Amendment|url=https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-hails-passage-of-medical-marijuana-amendment|access-date=November 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109031557/https://rohrabacher.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rohrabacher-hails-passage-of-medical-marijuana-amendment |archive-date=November 9, 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional legislation that Rohrabacher has introduced includes the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=April 12, 2013|title=Rep.

===Patent reform===
Rohrabacher was an opponent of the [[America Invents Act]], a bill that is attempting to change the current Patent System. Rohrabacher opposes changing from a &quot;first to invent system&quot; to a &quot;first to file system&quot; saying it &quot;hurts the little guy&quot;. Rohrabacher commented: &quot;Make no mistake, 'first to file' weakens patent protection. It is likely to make vulnerable individual and small inventors, who don't have an army of lawyers on retainer. These 'little guys' have been the lifeblood of American progress and competitiveness for more than 200 years. Our system was designed to protect individual rights, and it has worked for all – not just the corporate elite.&quot; Rohrabacher went on to comment in a ''[[Politico]]'' op-ed: &quot;We're told this is necessary to harmonize with Japanese and European patent law. But those systems were established by elitists and economic shoguns interested in corporate power, not individual rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53564.html|title=Opinion: Patent reform hurts 'little guy' – Rep.

Rohrabacher was chairman of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics from 1997 to January 2005&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography – Past Accomplishments |publisher=Rohrabacher Congressional Webpage |url=http://rohrabacher.house.gov/Biography/ |accessdate=2008-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625212356/http://rohrabacher.house.gov/Biography/ |archivedate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been active on space-related issues. In 2000, [[Space.com]] described Rohrabacher as &quot;a strident advocate for supremacy in space, a philosophy shaped along a winding road from [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] activist to White House speech writer in the Reagan administration&quot;. In 2007, Rohrabacher introduced a bill that would direct NASA to develop a strategy &quot;for deflecting and mitigating potentially hazardous near-Earth objects&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stein |first=Jeff |title=The End Might Be Nearer Than You Think |publisher=CQ Politics |date=2008-05-16 |url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&amp;docID=hsnews-000002877953 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521112020/http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&amp;docID=hsnews-000002877953 |archivedate=2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rohrabacher has applauded the [[Apollo]] astronauts, calling them unofficial ambassadors. Rohrabacher stated &quot;I applaud their efforts and accomplishments over the past fifty years.

On July 18, 2017, Rohrabacher asked a panel of space experts testifying before the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology if civilizations could have existed on Mars in the past. Kenneth Farley, a project scientist on NASA's Mars Rover 2020 Project, said: &quot;I would say that is extremely unlikely.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/19/nasa-wanted-to-talk-about-science-a-congressman-wanted-to-ask-about-martian-civilizations/|title=NASA wanted to talk about science.

===Tax reform===
Rohrabacher voted against the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]. Despite efforts made by Republicans to change the bill to be more generous regarding cap deductions on new [[home mortgage]]s, Rohrabacher remained staunch at voting nay on the bill, as the more than half of the new mortgages in his district are above the $750,000 cap.&lt;ref name=&quot;LynchRD1220&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Dennis|title=How the new tax bill could negatively affect LA homebuyers|url=https://therealdeal.com/la/2017/12/20/how-the-new-tax-bill-could-negatively-affect-la-homebuyers/|publisher=The Real Deal Los Angeles|accessdate= December 20, 2017|date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated on his [[Facebook]] page that &quot;Due to the pressure of several members like me, the bill was improved, but not enough for my constituents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisckol&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wisckol|first1=Martin|title=All but two area Republicans vote for tax reform|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/19/all-but-two-area-republicans-vote-for-tax-reform/|newspaper=Orange County Register|accessdate=December 20, 2017|date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
