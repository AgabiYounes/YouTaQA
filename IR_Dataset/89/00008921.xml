'''Diplomatic immunity''' is a form of [[legal immunity]] that ensures [[diplomat]]s are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to [[lawsuit]] or [[prosecution]] under the host country's laws, although they may still be [[deportation|expelled]]. Modern diplomatic immunity was codified as [[international law]] in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961) which has been ratified by all but a handful of nations. The concept and custom of diplomatic immunity dates back thousands of years. Many principles of diplomatic immunity are now considered to be [[customary law]]. Diplomatic immunity was developed to allow for the maintenance of government relations, including during periods of difficulties and [[War|armed conflict]]. When receiving diplomats, who formally represent the sovereign, the receiving head of state grants certain privileges and immunities to ensure they may effectively carry out their duties, on the understanding that these are provided on a reciprocal basis.

Originally, these privileges and immunities were granted on a [[Bilateralism|bilateral]], [[ad hoc]] basis, which led to misunderstandings and conflict, pressure on weaker states, and an inability for other states to judge which party was at fault. An international agreement known as the Vienna Convention codified the rules and agreements, providing standards and privileges to all states.

It is possible for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious [[crime]], unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, for example, allegations of [[espionage|spying]]), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse to waive immunity as a matter of course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity&lt;ref name=&quot;Subramanian2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramanian|first1=S.

==History==
{{more citations needed section |date=February 2014}}

===Ancient===
[[File:Krishna Mediating between the Pandavas and Kauravas.jpeg|thumb|right|x216px|text|[[Krishna]], an avatar of [[Vishnu]], [[Kurukshetra War#Krishna's Peace Mission|mediating for peace]] to avert the [[Kurukshetra War]] of [[Mahabharata]]]]
The concept of diplomatic immunity can be found in ancient Indian epics like ''[[Ramayana]]'' (between 3000 and 2000 BC) (traditional Hindu dating: over 100,000 years ago) and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (around 4th century BC; traditional Hindu dating: 3000 BC), where messengers and diplomats were given immunity from capital punishment. In [[Ramayana]], when the demon king [[Ravana]] ordered the killing of [[Hanuman]], [[Ravana]]'s younger brother [[Vibhishana]] pointed out that messengers or diplomats should not be killed, as per ancient practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aravamudan|first=Krishnan|title=Pure Gems of Ramayanam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJe9BAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=PartridgeIndia|isbn=978-1-4828-3720-9|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=CJe9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA773&amp;dq=%22ambassadors+are+not+sentenced+to+death%22 773–774]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evolution of international justice, many wars were considered rebellions or unlawful by one or more combatant sides. In such cases, the servants of the &quot;criminal&quot; sovereign were often considered accomplices and their persons violated. In other circumstances, harbingers of inconsiderable demands were killed as a declaration of war. [[Herodotus]] records that when heralds of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian king]] [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] demanded &quot;earth and water&quot; (i.e., symbols of submission) of Greek cities, the [[Athens|Athenians]] threw them into a pit and the [[Sparta]]ns threw them down a well for the purpose of suggesting they would find both earth and water at the bottom, these often being mentioned by the messenger as a threat of siege. However, even for Herodotus, this maltreatment of envoys is a crime.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He recounts a story of divine vengeance befalling Sparta for this deed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotos. ''Histories''. Book VII, Ch. 133-134. (pp. 558–559 in the cited version.) Transl. Rawlinson, G. Wordsworth. Ware, Herefordshire. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85326-466-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] envoy was urinated on as he was leaving the city of [[Taranto|Tarentum]]. The oath of the envoy, &quot;This stain will be washed away with blood!&quot;, was fulfilled during the [[Second Punic War]]. The arrest and ill-treatment of the envoy of [[Raja Raja Chola]] by the king of [[Kulasekhara dynasty (Second Cheras)]], which is now part of [[modern India]], led to the naval [[Kandalur War]] in AD 994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchman|first1=David|title=Why we fight : the origins, nature, and management of human conflict|date=2013|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham|isbn=9780761861386|page=239|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] sent and received envoys and strictly forbade harming them. This practice was continued by the [[Rashidun caliphs]] who exchanged diplomats with the Ethiopians and the Byzantines. This diplomatic exchange continued during the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FadlAbou2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fadl|first1=El |last2=Abou |first2=Khaled|last3=Hopley|first3=Russell |editor=John L. Esposito|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World: Creeds-Intercession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KLiEAQAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530513-5|chapter=Diplomatic Immunity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical [[Sharia]] called for hospitality to be shown towards anyone who has been granted ''amān'' (or right of safe passage). ''Amān'' was readily granted to any emissary bearing a letter or another sealed document. The duration of the ''amān'' was typically a year. Envoys with this right of passage were given immunity of person and property. They were exempt from [[taxation]], as long as they didn't engage in trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;FadlAbou2009&quot;/&gt;

As diplomats by definition enter the country under safe conduct, violating them is normally viewed as a great breach of honor, although there have been numerous cases in which diplomats have been killed. [[Genghis Khan]] and the [[Mongols]] were well known for strongly insisting on the rights of diplomats, and they would often take terrifying vengeance against any state that violated these rights. The Mongols would often raze entire cities in retaliation for the execution of their ambassadors, and [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia|invaded and destroyed the Khwarezmid Empire]] after their ambassadors had been mistreated.&lt;ref name=Prawdin&gt;[[Michael Prawdin|Prawdin, Michael]]. ''The Mongol Empire''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===

The [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] first guaranteed [[Diplomatic Privileges Act 1708|diplomatic immunity]] to foreign ambassadors in 1709, after Count [[Andrey Matveyev]], a Russian resident in London, had been subjected to verbal and physical abuse by [[Bailiff#British Isles|British bailiffs]].

Modern diplomatic immunity evolved parallel to the development of modern diplomacy. In the 17th century, European diplomats realized that protection from prosecution was essential to doing their jobs, and a set of rules evolved guaranteeing the rights of diplomats. These were still confined to Western Europe and were closely tied to the prerogatives of nobility. Thus, an emissary to the Ottoman Empire could expect to be arrested and imprisoned upon the outbreak of hostilities between his state and the empire. The French Revolution also disrupted this system, as the revolutionary state and Napoleon imprisoned numerous diplomats who were accused of working against France. More recently, the [[Iran hostage crisis]] is universally considered a violation of diplomatic immunity. Although the hostage takers did not officially represent the state, host countries are obligated to protect diplomatic property and personnel. On the other hand, during [[World War II]], diplomatic immunity was upheld and the embassies of the belligerents were evacuated through neutral countries.

For the upper class of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, diplomatic immunity was an easy concept to understand. The first embassies were not permanent establishments but actual visits by high-ranking representatives, often close relatives, of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] or the sovereign in person. As permanent representations evolved, usually on a treaty basis between two powers, they were frequently staffed by relatives of the sovereign or high-ranking nobles.

[[War]]fare was a status of hostilities not between individuals but between their sovereigns, and the officers and officials of European governments and armies often changed employers. Truces and ceasefires were commonplace, along with fraternization between officers of enemy armies during them. When prisoners, the officers usually gave their [[wikt:parole|parole]] and were only restricted to a city away from the theatre of war. Almost always, they were given leave to carry their personal sidearms. Even during the French revolutionary wars, British scientists visited the French Academy. In such an atmosphere, it was easy to accept that some persons were immune to the laws. After all, they were still bound by strict requirements of honour and customs.

In the 19th century, the [[Congress of Vienna]] reasserted the rights of diplomats; and they have been largely respected since then, as the European model has spread throughout the world. Currently, diplomatic relations, including diplomatic immunity, are governed internationally by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], which has been ratified by almost every country in the world.

In modern times, diplomatic immunity continues to provide a means, albeit imperfect, to safeguard diplomatic personnel from any animosity that might arise between nations. As one article put it: &quot;So why do we agree to a system in which we're dependent on a foreign country's whim before we can prosecute a criminal inside our own borders? The practical answer is: because we depend on other countries to honor our own diplomats' immunity just as scrupulously as we honor theirs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |title=Raymond Davis and the Vienna Convention |publisher=Jinnah-institute.org |accessdate=19 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203911/http://www.jinnah-institute.org/issues/252-raymond-davis-and-the-vienna-convention- |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention, the [[Holy See]] was granted diplomatic immunity to its [[nuncio|foreign ambassadors]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNA2019&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Holy See waives diplomatic immunity for accused nuncio to France |work=Catholic News Agency |date=8 July 2019 |access-date=7 October 2019 |url= https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/holy-see-waves-diplomatic-immunity-for-accused-nuncio-to-france-22125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ({{UnitedStatesCode|22|254a}} et seq.) follows the principles introduced by the Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because a large number of U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to [[Persona non-grata|expel the diplomat]]. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and they and their family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/diplomatic-immunity |title=diplomatic immunity: West's Encyclopedia of American Law (Full Article) from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions to the Vienna Convention==
Some countries have made reservations to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, but they are minor. A number of countries limit the diplomatic immunity of persons who are citizens of the receiving country. As nations keep faith to their treaties with differing zeal, other rules may also apply, though in most cases this summary is a reasonably accurate approximation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=List of Party States, Declarations and Reservations to Chapter III of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961 |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=III-3&amp;chapter=3&amp;lang=en |date=16 April 2011 |publisher=UNITED NATIONS TREATY COLLECTION |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227154400/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=III-3&amp;chapter=3&amp;lang=en |archivedate=27 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention does not cover the personnel of [[international organization]]s, whose privileges are decided upon on a case-by-case basis, usually in the [[Treaty|treaties]] founding such organizations. The United Nations system (including its agencies, which comprise the most recognizable international bodies such as the World Bank and many others) has a relatively standardized form of limited immunities for staff traveling on [[United Nations laissez-passer|U.N. laissez-passer]]; diplomatic immunity is often granted to the highest-ranking officials{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} of these agencies. Consular officials (that do not have concurrent diplomatic accreditation) formally have a more limited form of immunity, generally limited to their official duties. Diplomatic technical and administrative staff also have more limited immunity under the Vienna Convention; for this reason, some countries may accredit a member of technical or administrative staff as an [[attaché]].

Other categories of government officials that may travel frequently to other countries may not have diplomatic passports or diplomatic immunity, such as members of the military, high-ranking government officials, ministers, and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Many countries provide non-diplomatic official passports to such personnel, and there may be different classes of such travel documents such as official passports, service passports, and others. De facto recognition of some form of immunity may be conveyed by states accepting officials traveling on such documents, or there may exist bilateral agreements to govern such cases (as in, for example, the case of military personnel conducting or observing exercises on the territory of the receiving country).

Formally, diplomatic immunity may be limited to officials accredited to a host country, or traveling to or from their host country. In practice, many countries may effectively recognize diplomatic immunity for those traveling on diplomatic passports, with admittance to the country constituting acceptance of the diplomatic status. However, this is not universal, and diplomats have been prosecuted and jailed for crimes committed outside the country they are accredited to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/saudi-diplomat-lawyer-ordered-to-pay-costs-for-frivolous-9941168|title=Saudi diplomat's lawyer ordered to pay costs for 'frivolous' application to Court of Appeal|website=channelnewsasia.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and abuses==
In reality, most diplomats are representatives of nations with a tradition of professional [[civil service]], and are expected to obey regulations governing their behaviour and they suffer severe disciplinary action if they flout local laws. In many nations, a professional diplomat's career may be compromised if they (or members of their family) disobey the local authorities or cause serious embarrassment, and such cases are, at any rate, a violation of the spirit of the Vienna Conventions.

The Vienna Convention is explicit that &quot;without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State.&quot; Nevertheless, on some occasions, diplomatic immunity leads to some unfortunate results; protected diplomats have violated laws (including those that would be violations at home as well) of the host country and that country has been essentially limited to informing the diplomat's nation that the diplomat is no longer welcome (''[[persona non-grata]]''). Diplomatic agents are not, however, exempt from the jurisdiction of their home state, and hence prosecution may be undertaken by the sending state. For minor violations of the law, the sending state may impose administrative procedures specific to the foreign service or diplomatic mission.

Violation of the law by diplomats has included [[espionage]], smuggling, [[child custody]] law violations, money laundering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Respectable and Professional?

On-duty police officer [[murder of Yvonne Fletcher|Yvonne Fletcher was murdered]] in [[London]] in 1984, by a person shooting from inside the [[Libyan Embassy in London|Libyan embassy]] during a protest.

In 1987 in New York City, the Human Resources Administration placed 9-year-old Terrence Karamba in a foster home after his elementary school teachers noticed suspicious scars and injuries.

No charges were filed, as Karamba had diplomatic immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/01/nyregion/court-won-t-bar-return-of-boy-in-abuse-case-to-zimbabwe.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Court Won't Bar Return of Boy in Abuse Case to Zimbabwe | date=1 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1999 in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, Kazuko Shimokoji, wife of the Japanese Consul-General, showed up at the [[emergency department]] of a city hospital with two black eyes and a bruised neck. She told doctors that her husband had beaten her. When local police questioned her husband, Mr. Shimokoji said, &quot;Yes, I punched her out and she deserved it&quot;, and described the incident as &quot;a cultural thing and not a big deal&quot;. Although an arrest warrant was issued, Mr. Shimokoji could not be arrested due to his diplomatic immunity. However, his statement to the police was widely reported in both the local and Japanese press. The subsequent public uproar prompted the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to waive Mr. Shimokoji's immunity. Though he pleaded guilty in Canadian court, he was given an [[Discharge (sentence)|absolute discharge]]. Nonetheless, he was recalled to Japan where he was reassigned to office duty and had his pay cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wife-beating diplomat ordered home | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/03/04/japan990304.html | publisher = CBC News | date = 4 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 in [[Manila]], Panamanian diplomat Erick Bairnals Shcks was accused of raping a 19-year-old [[Filipino people|Filipino]] woman, but was later released from detention because Shcks &quot;enjoys protection under the 1961 Vienna Convention.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Panamanian diplomat in alleged rape case enjoys diplomatic immunity&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Amoulin|title=Panama diplomat in alleged rape case has full immunity|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/257821/news/nation/dfa-panama-diplomat-in-alleged-rape-case-has-full-immunity|publisher=[[GMA News]]|date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, the [[Supreme Court of India]] restricted Italian ambassador Daniele Mancini from leaving India for breaching an undertaking given to the apex court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India-Italy marines row: 'No legal immunity' for envoy Daniele Mancini|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-21826651|work=BBC News: India|publisher=BBC|date=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Italian and European Union protests regarding the restrictions as contrary to the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], the Supreme Court of India said it would be unacceptable to argue diplomatic immunity after voluntarily submitting to the court's jurisdiction. The Italian envoy had invoked Article 32 of the Constitution of India when filing an affidavit to the Supreme Court taking responsibility for the return of the two Italian marines to India after casting their votes in the March 2012 general elections in Italy. The Indian Supreme Court opined that the Italian ambassador had waived his diplomatic immunity and could be charged for contempt. The two marines were being tried in India for the murder of two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala (see the [[Enrica Lexie case]]).

In October 2013, Russian diplomat Dmitri Borodin was arrested in [[The Hague]], The Netherlands, after neighbours called the police. Borodin was alleged to have been drunk and violent towards his children, aged two and four. Police were in the area because Borodin's wife had lost control over her car while also intoxicated, and had rammed four parked cars near the diplomats' house.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOS08102013&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nos.nl/artikel/560093-borodin-was-gevaar-voor-kinderen.html |title=Borodin was gevaar voor kinderen |date=8 October 2013|work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia immediately demanded an apology from the Dutch government for violating Borodin's diplomatic immunity. The row came at a time of tension between Russia and the Netherlands, after the Russian security services captured a [[Greenpeace]] vessel sailing under the Dutch flag, [[MV Arctic Sunrise|''Arctic Sunrise'']], that was protesting against oil drilling in the [[Prirazlomnoye field]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC04102013&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24395769 |title=Dutch take legal action over Greenpeace ship in Russia |date=4 October 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[New Zealand government]] confirmed that [[2014 Malaysian diplomat indecent assault case|Mohammed Rizalman Bin Ismail]] from Malaysia, aged in his 30s and employed at Malaysia's High Commission in Wellington, had invoked diplomatic immunity when faced with charges of burglary and assault with intent to rape after allegedly following a 21-year-old woman to her home.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZHJun30&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=11284197|title=Govt wanted sex case diplomat to face charges - Key|date=30 June 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Malaysia in May 2014 with his family while the case was still in hearing.

In July 2017, in Jordan, two Jordanian carpenters were invited to repair furniture at an Israeli diplomatic security agent's residence near the Israeli Embassy. It is believed that the Jordanians and Israeli security agent quarreled over the ongoing tensions regarding the installations of metal detectors at entry points to al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.803076|title=Diplomatic Crisis With Jordan: Embassy Guard Who Killed Assailant Prevented From Returning to Israel|last=Ravid|first=Barak|date=24 July 2017|work=Haaretz|access-date=26 July 2017|last2=Khoury|first2=Jack|language=en|last3=Cohen|first3=Gili}}&lt;/ref&gt; One carpenter, a teenager of Palestinian origin reportedly tried to stab the Israeli security agent with his screwdriver, and the Israeli security agent shot and killed the Jordanian carpenter, and also shot the property landlord as well, a doctor, who happened to be there at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanchez2017&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Israel and Jordan in diplomatic standoff after Israeli security agent kills two at embassy in Amman |last=Sanchez |first=Raf |work=The Telegraph |date=24 July 2017 |access-date=7 October 2019 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/24/diplomatic-standoff-israel-jordan-shooting-israeli-embassy-amman/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel refused to allow Jordanian authorities to question the agent, claiming diplomatic immunity under the Vienna convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/23/at-least-one-person-killed-in-shooting-near-israel-embassy-in-jordan|title=Two killed in shooting at Israeli embassy in Jordan|last=Beaumont|first=Peter|date=24 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=26 July 2017|last2=agencies|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smuggling===
Diplomats and officials involved in drug smuggling have benefited from diplomatic immunity. For example, a Venezuelan general wanted in the United States on drugs charges was arrested in [[Aruba]] only to be released after the Venezuelan government protested his diplomatic immunity and threatened sanctions if Aruba did not release him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Netherlands Says Venezuelan Detained in Aruba Has Immunity |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/netherlands-rules-venezuelan-detained-in-aruba-has-diplomatic-immunity-1406505987 |accessdate=14 December 2014 |agency=WSJ |date=27 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710115148/http://www.wsj.com/articles/netherlands-rules-venezuelan-detained-in-aruba-has-diplomatic-immunity-1406505987 |archivedate=10 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-plans-sanctions-on-some-venezuelan-officials-1406697081|title=U.S. Plans Sanctions on Some Venezuelan Officials|accessdate=17 March 2015|date=30 July 2014|agency=WSJ&lt;!-- confirms that he is wanted in the U.S. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, Gambian diplomats were found guilty by Southwark Crown Court of London for selling tax-free tobacco from the Gambian embassy in the United Kingdom. The Crown Prosecution Service told the court that much of this was sold from the embassy without paying [[value-added tax]] and [[excise duty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30383204 |title=Gambian Diplomats Guilty of Tobacco Fraud|website=BBC News|date= 8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employer abuse and slavery===
Diplomatic immunity from local employment and labor law has precipitated incidents in which diplomatic staff have been accused of abusing local workers, who are often hired for positions requiring local knowledge (such as an administrative assistant, press/PR officer) or for general labor. In such situations, the employees are in a legal limbo where the laws of neither the host country nor the diplomat's country are enforceable. Diplomats have ignored local laws concerning [[minimum wage]]s, maximum working hours, vacation and holidays, and in some cases have imprisoned employees in their homes, deprived them of their earned wages, [[passport]]s, food, and communication with the outside world, abused them physically and emotionally, and invaded their privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/newsprint.cgi?file=/news2007/1115-01.htm |title=ACLU: Abused Domestic Workers of Diplomats Seek Justice From International Commission |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910141714/http://www.commondreams.org/cgi-bin/newsprint.cgi?file=%2Fnews2007%2F1115-01.htm |archivedate=10 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/womensrights/humanrights/28030prs20070117.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Charges Kuwait Government and Diplomats With Abusing Domestic Workers |publisher=Aclu.org |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reported incidents include the following:
*In 1999, a Bangladeshi woman, Shamela Begum, claimed she had been enslaved by a senior Bahraini envoy to the United Nations and his wife. Begum charged that the couple took her passport, struck her, and paid her just $800 for ten months of service—during which she was only twice allowed out of the couple's New York apartment. The envoy and his wife claimed diplomatic immunity, and Begum later reached a civil settlement with her employers. By some estimates, &quot;hundreds of women have been exploited by their diplomat employers over the past 20 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reader's Digest&quot;/&gt;
*In 2003 in Finland, a Filipino maid escaped from an embassy of an unidentified Asian country, and reported being held in conditions approaching slavery: she was forced to work from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., 7 days a week, and the ambassador's children were permitted to hit her. On grounds of diplomatic immunity, no charges could be filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/201312140065720_uu.shtml|title=Skandaali Suomessa: Suurlähettiläs piti naista orjatöissä|website=iltalehti.fi|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327213309/http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/201312140065720_uu.shtml|archive-date=27 March 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2009, [[South Africa]] was criticised for claiming immunity from labor laws relating to a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[domestic worker]] at the residence of the South African ambassador in [[Dublin|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2009/1130/1224259709379.html |title=Use of diplomatic immunity |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=11 November 2009 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2010, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed an [[amicus brief]] in ''Swarna v. Al-Awadi'' to argue that [[human trafficking]] is a commercial activity engaged in for personal [[Profit (economics)|profit]], which falls outside the scope of a diplomat's official functions, and therefore diplomatic immunity does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/swarna-v-al-awadi-amicus-brief |title=American Civil Liberties Union: Swarna v.

*In 2013, Indian consular official [[Devyani Khobragade]] was detained, hand-cuffed, strip searched, DNA swabbed, and held in a federal holding cell in New York, relating to allegations of non-payment of U.S. minimum wage and for fraudulently lying about the wages to be paid on a visa application for her domestic worker. India registered a strong protest and initiated a review of privileges afforded to American consular officials in India as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/20/politics/india-us-diplomat/ | work=CNN | title=India's foreign minister: Drop charges against diplomat - CNN.com | date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicular offences===

====Parking violations====
A particular problem is the difficulty in enforcing ordinary laws, such as prohibitions on [[double parking]]. For example, the [[Autobahn 555]] in [[Cologne]], Germany was nicknamed the &quot;Diplomatenrennbahn&quot; (Diplomat's Raceway), when [[Bonn]] was the capital of [[West Germany]], because of the numerous diplomats that used to speed through the highway under diplomatic immunity. Certain cities, for example [[The Hague]], have taken to impounding such cars rather than fining their owners. Diplomats' status does not guarantee the release of impounded cars.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Diplomatic missions have their own regulations, but many require their staff to pay any fines due for parking violations. A 2006 economic study found that there was a significant correlation between home-country [[Political corruption|corruption]] (as measured by [[Transparency International]]) and unpaid parking fines: six countries had in excess of 100 violations per diplomat: [[Kuwait]], [[Egypt]], [[Chad]], [[Sudan]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first =Ray | last =Fisman | first2 =Edward | last2 =Miguel | title =Cultures of Corruption: Evidence from Diplomatic Parking tickets | url =http://www.usc.edu/schools/business/FBE/seminars/papers/AE_4-28-06_FISMAN-parking.pdf | date =28 April 2006 | publisher =USC FBE Applied Economics Workshop | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160217001131/http://www.usc.edu/schools/business/FBE/seminars/papers/AE_4-28-06_FISMAN-parking.pdf | archivedate =17 February 2016 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[New York City]], the home of the [[United Nations]] Headquarters, regularly protests to the [[United States Department of State]] about non-payment of parking tickets because of diplomatic status. As of 2001, the city had more than 200,000 outstanding parking tickets from diplomats, totaling more than $21.3 million, of which only $160,682 had been collected.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOHN J. GOLDMAN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/03/news/mn-18122|title=NYC's Diplomatic Take on Tickets|date=3 July 2001|author=JOHN J. GOLDMAN|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, then-mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] proposed to the [[Clinton administration]] that the U.S. State Department revoke the special DPL plates for diplomats who ignore parking summonses; the State Department denied Giuliani's request.&lt;ref name=&quot;JOHN J. GOLDMAN&quot;/&gt;

In cities that impose a [[Congestion pricing|congestion charge]], the decision of some diplomatic missions not to furnish payment has proved controversial. In London, embassies have amassed approximately £58 million in unpaid charges as of 2012, with the American embassy comprising approximately £6 million and the Russian, German and Japanese missions around £2 million each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18725937 | location=London | work=BBC News | title=Diplomats 'owe £58m in London congestion charges' | date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/new-york-times-urges-us-embassy-pay-congestion-charge |title=New York Times urges US Embassy to pay congestion charge &amp;#124; Greater London Authority |publisher=London.gov.uk |date=31 March 2006 |accessdate=19 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502021241/http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/new-york-times-urges-us-embassy-pay-congestion-charge |archivedate= 2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vehicular assault and drunk driving====
=====Georgian driver in the United States=====
In January 1997, Gueorgui Makharadze, a high-ranking [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] diplomat, caused a five-car pileup in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States, which killed a 16-year-old girl. Makharadze's claim of diplomatic immunity created a national outrage in the United States, particularly given Makharadze's previous record of driving offenses: In April 1996, Makharadze had been charged with speeding in Virginia, and four months later, he was detained by District of Columbia police on suspicion of drunk driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/us/georgian-diplomat-pleads-guilty-in-death-of-teen-age-girl.html|title=Georgian Diplomat Pleads Guilty in Death of Teenage Girl|author=MICHAEL JANOFSKY|date=9 October 1997|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both prior cases, charges were dismissed based on his immunity. On the basis of the media coverage, Georgia revoked Makharadze's immunity, and he was ultimately sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of involuntary manslaughter and four counts of aggravated assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/dec/20/news/mn-531|title=Ex-Diplomat Gets 7 Years for Death of Teen in Crash|agency=Associated Press|date=20 December 1997|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====American driver in Russia=====
On 27 October 1998, in [[Vladivostok]], [[Russia]], Douglas Kent, the American [[Consul (representative)#Consul general|Consul General]] to Russia, was involved in a car accident that left a young man, Alexander Kashin, disabled. Kent was not prosecuted in a U.S. court. Under the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations|Vienna Convention]], diplomatic immunity does not apply to civil actions relating to vehicular accidents, but in 2006, the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]] ruled that, since he was using his vehicle for consular purposes, Kent could not be sued civilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immunity shelters former US Consul from Russian invalid |url=http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue531/Crime_watch/Immunity_shelters_former_US_Consul_from_Russian_invalid |publisher=Vladivostok News |date=17 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505012445/http://vn.vladnews.ru/issue531/Crime_watch/Immunity_shelters_former_US_Consul_from_Russian_invalid |archivedate=5 May 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia student in diplomatic controversy |url=http://media.www.dailylobo.com/media/storage/paper344/news/2002/09/16/News/Russia.Student.In.Diplomatic.Controversy-274101.shtml |publisher=New Mexico daily Lobo, From AP |date=16 September 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608195621/http://media.www.dailylobo.com/media/storage/paper344/news/2002/09/16/News/Russia.Student.In.Diplomatic.Controversy-274101.shtml |archivedate=8 June 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Russian driver in Canada=====
In 2001, a Russian diplomat, Andrei Knyazev, hit and killed a woman while driving drunk in Ottawa. Knyazev refused to take a breathalyzer at the scene of the crash, citing diplomatic immunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/former-russian-diplomat-guilty-of-involuntary-manslaughter-1.313443|title=Former Russian diplomat guilty of involuntary manslaughter|date=19 March 2002|publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia refused Canadian requests to waive his immunity, and Knyazev was expelled from Canada. Though the Russian Foreign Ministry fired him and charged him with involuntary manslaughter, and Russian and Canadian authorities cooperated in the investigation, the case caused a political storm in Canada. Many accused the Foreign Ministry of incompetence after it emerged that Knyazev had twice been previously investigated for drunk driving. The Canadian Foreign Minister had fought unsuccessfully to have Knyazev tried in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/17/news/mn-26623|title=Russia Says Diplomat Will Be Tried in Drunk-Driving Case|date=17 February 2001|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Knyazev was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC News&quot;/&gt;

=====American driver in Pakistan=====
In January 2011 in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]], American embassy employee [[Raymond Allen Davis incident|Raymond Allen Davis]] shot and killed two Pakistani civilians, while a third man was struck and killed by a U.S. consulate car responding to the shooting. According to Davis, they were about to rob him and he acted in self-defense. When detained by police, Davis claimed to be a consultant at the U.S. consulate in Lahore. He was formally arrested and remanded into custody. Further investigations revealed that he was working with the CIA as a contractor in Pakistan. The U.S. State Department declared him a diplomat and repeatedly requested immunity under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], to which Pakistan is a signatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamabad.usembassy.gov/pr-11012901.html U.S. Embassy Calls for Release of American Diplomat – U.S. Embassy, Islamabad, Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201133320/http://islamabad.usembassy.gov/pr-11012901.html |date=1 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/02/04/pakistan.us.shooting.index.html]{{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 March 2011, Davis was released after the families of the two killed men were paid $2.4&amp;nbsp;million in ''[[diyya]]'' (a form of monetary compensation or [[blood money (term)|blood money]]).

On 10 April 2011, in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan, Patrick Kibuta, an electrical engineer in the [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] caused a vehicle collision with another vehicle, while under the influence of alcohol. Kibuta, who was driving in the opposing lane, injured a [[Canadians|Canadian]] citizen residing in Islamabad, who suffered multiple fractures and required surgery. The Kohsar police impounded Kibuta's UN vehicle on the scene, and a blood test confirmed that he had an elevated blood alcohol level.

=====Qatari driver in the United States=====
On 12 September 2015, Sheikh [[Khalid bin Hamad Al Thani]] tried to claim diplomatic immunity when his [[Ferrari LaFerrari]] and a [[Porsche 911 GT3]] were caught on camera [[drag racing]] through a residential neighborhood in [[Beverly Hills]]. He owns the cars and a drag racing team, and is a member of [[Qatar]]'s ruling family. The Beverly Hills Police Department contacted the [[U.S. State Department]] to clarify if he had diplomatic immunity. They stated he did not. However, his face was not shown on camera, and no officer witnessed the crime, so the state of California has not yet pressed charges. He has since fled the country. The investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/autos/owner-of-beverly-hills-laferrari-does-not-have-129289165617.html|title=Owner of Beverly Hills LaFerrari Does Not Have Diplomatic Immunity, Flees Country|website=yahoo.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/does-driver-in-beverly-hills-high-speed-race-have-diplomatic-immunity/|title=Does driver in Beverly Hills high-speed race have diplomatic immunity?|website=cbsnews.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Saudi driver in Germany=====
In June 2017, in Germany a Saudi driver killed a cyclist by opening the door of his Porsche directly into the cyclist's path without checking to see if the road was clear. Anger arose when the Saudi claimed diplomatic immunity. Police said that under normal circumstances the driver would face investigation and possible prosecution on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, but prosecutors said they had no choice but to close the case because he had diplomatic immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/16/anger-berlin-saudi-driver-killed-cyclist-claims-diplomatic-immunity/|title=Anger in Berlin after Saudi driver who killed cyclist claims diplomatic immunity|first=Our Foreign|last=Staff|date=16 June 2017|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American driver in the United Kingdom====
{{main|Death of Harry Dunn}}

On 27 August 2019, Anne Sacoolas, the wife of an American National Security Agency employee working in the United Kingdom was a suspect in a traffic incident involving 19-year-old [[Death of Harry Dunn|Harry Dunn]] in [[Croughton, Northamptonshire|Croughton]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-49945461|title=Crash victim mum appeals for US suspect's return|date=5 October 2019|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn was riding his motorcycle when it was reported that a woman emerged from [[RAF Croughton]] driving on the wrong side of the road, resulting in a head-on collision. After [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] handlers wrongly categorized the call, there was a 43-minute wait for an ambulance, resulting in a two-hour delay arriving at a trauma center, where Harry Dunn later died.&lt;ref&gt;{{https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/harry-dunn-left-die-ditch-999-handlers-wrongly-categorised-call-11054291/&lt;/ref&gt; Sacoolas was breathalyzed at the accident site. The following day, police interviewed Sacoolas at her home, learning the US claimed diplomatic immunity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heavy.com.Anne-Sacoolas{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:-US-diplomat’s-wife-identified-in-Harry-Dunn-fatal-crash.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sacoolas told police she had no immediate plans to leave the country. However, on 13 October US authorities notified the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office of plans to send Sacoolas home, unless serious objections were raised: on 16 October, the UK's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, went to present objections, a day after the family was sent back.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heavy.com.Anne{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Sccoolas.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Woody Johnson]], US Ambassador to the UK, expressed &quot;profound sadness&quot; at the death of Harry Dunn and the US Embassy also offered their sympathies and condolences. US President [[Donald Trump]] called it a &quot;terrible accident&quot; and mentioned that the woman was &quot;driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-49986700|title=Crash death parents 'let down' by governments|date=9 October 2019|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/05/us-diplomats-wife-claims-immunity-leaves-uk-afterfatal-road/|title=US diplomat's wife claims immunity and leaves UK after fatal road accident|date=5 October 2019|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=5 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government has not waived the diplomatic immunity afforded to Sacoolas and has stated she would not return to the UK, despite calls by the UK government to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49962359|title=Boris Johnson responds to Harry Dunn diplomatic immunity row|date=7 October 2019|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-49995867|title=Harry Dunn crash: Donald Trump notes say US suspect 'will not return to UK'|date=10 October 2019|publisher=BBC NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial abuse===
Historically, the problem of large debts run up by diplomats has also caused many problems. Some financial institutions do not extend credit to diplomats because they have no legal means of ensuring the money be repaid. Local citizens and businesses are often at a disadvantage when filing civil claims against a diplomat, especially in cases of unpaid rent, alimony, and child support.

====Rents====
{{globalize|date=May 2017}}
The bulk of diplomatic debt lies in the rental of office space and living quarters. Individual debts can range from a few thousand dollars to $1 million in back rent. A group of diplomats and the office space in which they work are referred to as a [[diplomatic mission]]. Creditors cannot sue missions individually to collect money they owe. Landlords and creditors have found that the only thing they can do is contact a city agency to see if they can try to get some money back. They cannot enter the offices or apartments of diplomats to evict them because the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] says that &quot;the property in the United States of a foreign state shall be immune from [[Attachment (law)|attachment]], arrest and execution&quot; ({{UnitedStatesCode|28|1609}}). This has led creditors who are owed money by diplomats to become more cautious about their renters and to change their rental or payment policies.

In one case, for example, officials from Zaire stopped paying rent to their private landlord and ran up $400,000 in debt. When the landlord sued, the U.S. State Department defended the Zaireans on the basis of diplomatic immunity, and a circuit court agreed. When the landlord finally cut off the utilities, the officials fled without paying their back rent. The landlords reportedly later reached an &quot;amicable agreement&quot; with the Zaire government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reader's Digest&quot;/&gt;

====Alimony and child support====
The issue of abusing diplomatic immunity in family relations, especially [[alimony]] and [[child support]], has become so widespread that it prompted discussion at the 1995 U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, in [[Beijing]]. Historically, the [[United Nations]] has not become involved with family disputes and has refused to garnish the wages of diplomats who owe money for child support, citing [[sovereign immunity]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} However, in September 1995, the incumbent head of [[Legal Affairs]] for the [[United Nations]] acknowledged there was a moral and legal obligation to take at least a partial responsibility in family disputes. Fathers working as diplomats who refused to fulfill their family-related financial duties were increasing in numbers in the [[United Nations]]: several men who had left their wives and children were still claiming U.N. dependency, travel, and education allowances for their families, though they are no longer supporting those families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Diplomatic+Immunity |title=Diplomatic Immunity legal definition of Diplomatic Immunity. Diplomatic Immunity synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date=19 July 1988 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxes and fees====
Diplomats are exempt from most taxes, but not from &quot;charges levied for specific services rendered&quot;. In certain cases, whether a payment is or is not considered a tax may be disputed, such as [[central London]]'s [[congestion charge]]. It was reported in 2006 that the UAE embassy had agreed to pay their own accumulated charges of nearly £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Embassy to pay congestion charge | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4881442.stm | work = BBC News | date = 6 April 2006 | accessdate = 28 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an obligation for the receiving state not to &quot;discriminate as between states&quot;; in other words, any such fees should be payable by all accredited diplomats equally. This may allow the [[diplomatic corps]] to negotiate as a group with the authorities of the receiving country.

Diplomats are exempt from [[import duty]] and [[tariffs]] for items for their personal use. In some countries, this has led to charges that diplomatic agents are profiting personally from resale of &quot;tax free&quot; goods. The receiving state may choose to impose restrictions on what may reasonably constitute personal use (for example, only a certain quantity of [[cigarette]]s per day). When enacted, such restrictions are generally quite generous so as to avoid [[Tit for tat|tit-for-tat]] responses.

===Espionage===
On 24 April 2008, in [[New Orleans]], Mexican [[press attaché]] Rafael Quintero Curiel was seen stealing [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] units from a [[White House]] press meeting room. Quintero made it all the way to the airport before members of the [[United States Secret Service]] caught up with him. He initially denied taking the devices, but after being confronted with security video, Quintero claimed it was purely accidental, gave the devices back, claimed diplomatic immunity and left New Orleans with the Mexican delegation. He was eventually fired for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352378,00.html |title=Mexican Embassy: Official Fired After Getting Caught With White House BlackBerries|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513091626/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352378,00.html |archive-date=13 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
