In [[organic chemistry]] a '''diene''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|.|iː|n}} {{respell|DY|een}}) ('''diolefin''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|oʊ|l|ə|f|ᵻ|n}} {{respell|dy|OH|lə-fin}}) or '''alkadiene''') is a [[covalent compound]] that contains two [[double bond]]s, usually among [[carbon]] atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC dienes&quot;&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=D01699|title=dienes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus contain two [[alkene|alk''ene'']] units, with the standard prefix ''di'' of [[systematic nomenclature]].  As a subunit of more complex molecules, dienes occur in naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals and are used in [[organic synthesis]].  [[Conjugated system|Conjugated]] dienes are widely used as [[monomer]]s in the [[polymer]] industry. [[Polyunsaturated fat]]s are of interest to [[nutrition]].

==Classes==
Dienes can be divided into three classes, depending on the relative location of the double bonds:&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC dienes&quot;/&gt;
#'''Cumulated dienes''' have the double bonds sharing a common atom. The result is more specifically called an [[allene]].
#'''Conjugated dienes''' have [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds separated by one single bond. Conjugated dienes are more stable than other dienes because of resonance.
#'''Unconjugated dienes''' have the double bonds separated by two or more single bonds. They are usually less stable than [[isomer]]ic conjugated dienes. This can also be known as an isolated diene.

[[File:Dienes various examples.png|thumb|structure of various alkadienes (also called dienes or diolefins)|center|650 px|Some dienes: '''A''': 1,2-Propadiene, also known as [[allene]], is the simplest cumulated diene. '''B''': [[Isoprene]], also known as 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, the precursor to natural rubber. '''C''': [[1,3-Butadiene]], a  precursor to synthetic polymers.  '''D''': [[1,5-Cyclooctadiene]], an unconjugated diene (notice that each double bond is two carbons away from the other). '''E''': [[Norbornadiene]], a strained bicyclic and unconjugated  diene.  '''F''': [[Dicyclopentadiene]].]]

According to the ''[[Gold Book]]'' definition, a &quot;diene&quot; could include one or more [[heteroatom]]s which replace unsaturated carbon atoms, giving structures that could more specifically be called ''heterodienes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC dienes&quot;/&gt;

Compounds that contain more than two double bonds are called [[polyene]]s. Polyenes and dienes share many properties.

==Synthesis of dienes==

On an industrial scale, butadiene is prepared by [[thermal cracking]] of [[butane]]s. In a similarly non-selective process, [[dicyclopentadiene]] is obtained from [[coal tar]]s.

In the laboratory, more directed and more delicate processes are employed such as [[dehydrohalogenation]]s and [[Condensation (chemistry)|condensations]].  Myriad [[organic reaction|methods]] have been developed, such as the [[Whiting reaction]].  Families of nonconjugated dienes are derived from the [[oligomerization]] and [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]] of conjugated dienes.  For example, 1,5-cyclooctadiene and vinylcyclohexene are produced by dimerization of [[1,3-Butadiene|1,3-butadiene]].

Diene-containing [[fatty acid]]s are [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from [[acetyl CoA]].

α,ω-Dienes have the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  They are prepared industrially by [[ethenolysis]] of cyclic dienes.  For example, [[1,5-Hexadiene|1,5-hexadiene]] and 1,9-decadiene, useful crosslinking agents and synthetic intermediates, are produced from [[1,5-Cyclooctadiene|1,5-cyclooctadiene]] and [[cyclooctene]], respectively.  The catalyst is derived from Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; on alumina.&lt;ref name=KO&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Metathesis|encyclopedia=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|authors=Lionel Delaude, Alfred F. Noels|year=2005| doi=10.1002/0471238961.metanoel.a01|place=Weinheim|publisher=Wiley-VCH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactivity and uses==

===Polymerization===
The most heavily practiced reaction of alkenes, dienes included, is [[polymerization]].  1,3-Butadiene is a precursor to [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] used in tires, and [[isoprene]] is the precursor to [[natural rubber]].  [[Chloroprene]] is related but it is a synthetic monomer.

===Cycloadditions===
An important reaction for conjugated dienes is the [[Diels–Alder reaction]].  Many specialized dienes have been developed to exploit this reactivity for the synthesis of [[natural product]]s (e.g., [[Danishefsky's diene]]).

===Other addition reactions===
Conjugated dienes add reagents such as [[bromine]] and [[hydrogen]] by both 1,2-addition and 1,4-addition pathways.  Addition of polar reagents can generate complex architectures:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | author = Roger Bishop | collvol = 9 | collvolpages = 692 | prep = CV9P0692

===Metathesis reactions===
Nonconjugated dienes are substrates for [[ring-closing metathesis]] reactions.  These reactions require a metal [[catalyst]]:
::[[File:RCM cyclophane example.png|520px]]

===Acidity===
The position adjacent to a double bond is [[acidic]] because the resulting [[allyl]] anion is stabilized by resonance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more alkenes are involved to create greater stability. For example, deprotonation at position 3 of a 1,4-diene or position 5 of a 1,3-diene give a [[pentadienyl]] anion. An even greater effect is seen if the anion is aromatic, for example, deprotonation of [[cyclopentadiene]] to give the [[cyclopentadienyl]] anion.&lt;!-- TODO: chart of pKa for methylene in alkane, singly and doubly allylic, and Cp --&gt;

===As ligands===
Dienes are widely used chelating [[ligand]]s in [[organometallic chemistry]].  In some cases they serve as placeholder ligands, being removed during a catalytic cycle.  For example, the cyclooctadiene (&quot;cod&quot;) ligands in [[bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0)]] are labile.  In some cases, dienes are spectator ligands, remaining coordinated throughout a catalytic cycle and influencing the product distributions.  [[Chirality|Chiral]] dienes have also been described.&lt;ref&gt;Ryo Shintani, Tamio Hayashi, &quot;Chiral Diene Ligands for Asymmetric Catalysis&quot; Aldrich Chimica Acta 2009, vol. 42, number 2, pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other diene complexes include [[(Butadiene)iron tricarbonyl|(butadiene)iron tricarbonyl]] and [[cyclooctadiene rhodium chloride dimer]].
