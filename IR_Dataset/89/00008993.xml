{{nihongo foot|'''''Duck Hunt'''''|ダックハント|Dakku Hanto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1984 [[light gun shooter]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) [[video game console]]. The game was first released in Japan in April 1984, and was released as a [[launch game]] for the NES in North America in October 1985, with it also releasing in Europe two years later.

In ''Duck Hunt'', players use the [[NES Zapper]] in combination with a [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] television to shoot [[duck]]s that appear on the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Jason |title=How the Nintendo NES Zapper Worked, and Why It Doesn’t Work On HDTVs |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/181303/htg-explains-how-the-nintendo-zapper-worked-and-why-it-doesnt-work-on-new-tvs/ |website=www.howtogeek.com |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ducks appear one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. The player receives points upon shooting each duck. If the player shoots the required number of ducks in a single [[level (video gaming)|round]], the player will advance to the next round; otherwise, the player will receive a [[game over]].

The game initially received few reviews, but was given mild critical praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allgame review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamespot people&quot;/&gt; Prior to the NES version, Nintendo also made a ''Duck Hunt'' game based on [[Laser Clay Shooting System]] released in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070302073933/http://www.japan-games.com/Database/images/Nintendo/TV-Game/Duckhunt/index.htm Nintendo Duck Hunt (1976)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning with the nationwide roll-out of the NES in 1986, ''Duck Hunt'' was one of several titles Nintendo included as a [[pack-in game]] with some of its releases. The initial Deluxe Set included ''Duck Hunt'' and ''[[Gyromite]]''. The later Action Set was packaged with ''Duck Hunt'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in for an upgraded Basic Set; unlike with those releases, Nintendo opted to place both games on one cartridge as opposed to having separate individual cartridges. The last NES release to include ''Duck Hunt'' as a pack-in was the Power Set, which came with the [[Power Pad]]; for that particular release the multicart added ''[[Stadium Events|World Class Track Meet]]'' as a third selectable game with ''Duck Hunt'' and ''Super Mario Bros.'' The game was released as a [[Virtual Console]] title for the [[Wii U]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendo direct&quot;/&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{Imageframe|align=left|width=180|content=[[File:Duck hunt pic.PNG|180px]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Duck Hunt (NES) clay pigeon mode.png|180px]]|caption=''Duck Hunt'' offers different game modes, with two focused on shooting [[duck]]s (top) and the other focused on shooting [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeons]] (bottom). In all modes, the player has three attempts to shoot the on-screen targets when they appear.}}

''Duck Hunt'' is a [[shooter game]] in which the objective is to shoot moving targets on the television screen in mid-flight. The game is played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective and requires the [[NES Zapper]] [[light gun]], which the player aims and fires at the screen. It also requires a [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] television screen since the Zapper gun will not work with [[LCD]] or [[HDTV]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Jason |title=How the Nintendo NES Zapper Worked, and Why It Doesn’t Work On HDTVs |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/181303/htg-explains-how-the-nintendo-zapper-worked-and-why-it-doesnt-work-on-new-tvs/ |website=www.howtogeek.com |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each round consists of a total of ten targets to shoot. Depending on the game mode the player selects prior to beginning play, one or two targets will appear on the screen at any given time and the player has three attempts to hit them before they disappear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duck Hunt rules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title='Duck Hunt' |url=http://www.nindb.net/game/duck-hunt.html |accessdate=November 21, 2006 |work=NinDB |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619100111/https://nindb.net/game/duck-hunt.html |archivedate=June 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the player fails to shoot any of the ducks, the dog will laugh and the game is over.

The player is required to successfully shoot a minimum number of targets in order to advance to the next round; failure will result in a [[game over]]. The difficulty increases as the player advances to higher rounds; targets will move faster and the minimum number of targets to shoot will increase. The player receives points upon shooting a target and will also receive bonus points for shooting all ten targets in a single round. ''Duck Hunt'' keeps track of the players' highest score for all games played in a single session; it is lost, however, upon shutting the game off.

''Duck Hunt'' has three different game modes to choose from. In &quot;Game A&quot; and &quot;Game B&quot;, the targets are flying ducks in a woodland area, and in &quot;Game C&quot; the targets are [[Clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeon]]s that are launched away from the player's perspective into the distance. In &quot;Game A&quot;, one duck will appear on the screen at a time while in &quot;Game B&quot; two ducks will appear at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duck Hunt rules&quot;/&gt; &quot;Game A&quot; allows a second player to control the movement of the flying ducks by using a normal [[Nintendo Entertainment System#Controllers|NES controller]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cheats&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cheats.ign.com/ob2/068/007/007158.html |title=Duck Hunt Cheats |accessdate=November 21, 2006|website=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gameplay starts at Round 1 and may continue up to Round 99. If the player completes Round 99, he or she will advance to Round 0, which is a [[kill screen]] (in &quot;Game A&quot;) where the game behaves erratically, such as targets that move haphazardly or do not appear at all, and eventually ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://satoshimatrix.wordpress.com/2011/08/17/top-100-nesfamicom-games-list-100-90/ |title=Top 100 NES/Famicom Games List #100-90 |work=Retro and Contemporary Gaming Archives |date=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vs. Duck Hunt''===
''Duck Hunt'' was released as an [[arcade game]] in the [[Nintendo VS. System|''Nintendo VS.'' series]] in 1984&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090202191217/http://www.arcadevault.com/duck_hunt_2.html ''Duck Hunt'' at Arcade Vault]. Retrieved November 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Vs. Duck Hunt'', and is included in the [[PlayChoice-10]] arcade console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/history/nes_arcade.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20061210021100/http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/nes/history/nes_arcade.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= December 10, 2006 |publisher=Playchoice |title= PlayChoice History|accessdate=November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console supports two light guns, allowing two players at once.

Gameplay consists of alternating rounds of Games B and C, with 12 ducks/targets per round instead of 10 and sometimes requires the player to shoot three ducks/targets at a time instead of two. In addition, the player is given a limited number of lives; every duck/target that is not hit costs one life. When all lives are gone, the game ends.

After every second round, a bonus stage is played in which ducks can be shot for points as they fly out of the grass. However, the [[hunting dog]] occasionally jumps out, putting himself in the line of fire and creating a distraction. If the player shoots the dog, the bonus stage immediately ends.

''Duck Hunt'' features a nameless [[Non-player character|non-playable]] [[hunting dog]], known simply as &quot;Dog&quot; according to his collectable trophy in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Wii U'']], and often referred to by the media as the &quot;Duck Hunt Dog&quot; or the &quot;Laughing Dog&quot;. The dog accompanies the player in the &quot;Game A&quot; and &quot;Game B&quot; modes, in which he serves to both provoke the ducks and retrieve any fallen ones. The dog is infamous and iconic for laughing at the player whenever the player fails to shoot any of the ducks on screen. The dog has been labelled as &quot;one of the most annoying video game characters ever&quot; by numerous gaming critics and journalists, including [[IGN]], [[GamesRadar]], and [[ScrewAttack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pirrello |first=Phil |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/883/883629p1.html |title=ACD: Duck Hunt Dog - Stars Feature at IGN |publisher=Stars.ign.com |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-12-most-annoying-sidekicks-ever/ |title=The 12 most annoying sidekicks EVER |publisher=GamesRadar |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Screwattack's Top 10 douchebags in gaming|series=''[[ScrewAttack's Top 10]]''|publisher=screwattack.com|url=http://screwattack.com/videos/Top-10-Douchebags-in-Gaming|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724170328/http://screwattack.com/videos/Top-10-Douchebags-in-Gaming |archivedate=July 24, 2010|accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have expressed the desire to be able to shoot the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Buffa, Chris |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/characters-we-wish-we-could-kill-but-cant/?page=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507055503/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/characters-we-wish-we-could-kill-but-cant/?page=2 |archivedate=May 7, 2009 |title=Gallery and Images |publisher=GameDaily |date=May 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;game spy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;/&gt; Both IGN and ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' have referred to the dog as something players &quot;love to hate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/825/825314p1.html |title=Smash It Up! - The Animal Kingdom - Wii Feature at IGN |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69jvq0OpK?url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/825/825314p1.html |archive-date=August 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Nintendo Power]] 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |page=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
