The '''Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''DARPA''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Defense]] responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

Originally known as the '''Advanced Research Projects Agency''' ('''ARPA'''), the agency was created in February 1958 by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in response to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] launching of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957. By collaborating with academic, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate [[U.S. military]] requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commission2008&quot;&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower and Science &amp; Technology, (2008). Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101027163454/http://eisenhowermemorial.org/onepage/IKE%20%26%20Science.Oct08.EN.FINAL%20%28v2%29.pdf Source].&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA-funded projects have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as [[computer networking]] and the basis for the modern Internet, and [[graphical user interface]]s in information technology.

DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA has about 220 employees, of whom approximately 100 are in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/about-darpa|title=About DARPA|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the organization first changed from its founding name ARPA to DARPA in March 1972, briefly changing back to ARPA in February 1993, only to revert to DARPA in March 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mil-embedded.com/guest-blogs/arpa-darpa-and-jason/|title=ARPA, DARPA, and Jason – Military Embedded Systems|website=mil-embedded.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history (1958–1969)===
The creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was authorized by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1958 for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond immediate military requirements,&lt;ref name=&quot;Commission2008&quot;/&gt; the two relevant acts being the Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fiscal_year_1958_supplemental_military_c.html?id=N-IPAAAAIAAJ |title = Fiscal Year 1958 Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force): Hearings, Eighty-fifth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 9739 |date=1958|last1 = Subcommittee On Military Construction |first1 = United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Armed Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Public Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958. Its creation was directly attributed to the launching of [[Sputnik]] and to U.S. realization that the [[Soviet Union]] had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial funding of ARPA was $520 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards20 &gt;&quot;$ 520 million appropriation and a $ 2 billion budget plan.&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 20). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson, left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at ARPA.&lt;ref name = Wizards21 &gt;&quot;Roy Johnson, ARPA’s first director, was, like his boss, a businessman. At age fifty-two, he had been personally recruited by McElroy, who convinced him to leave a $160,000 job with General Electric and take an $18,000 job in Washington.&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert York]] from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] was hired as his scientific assistant.&lt;ref name = Wizards21a &gt;&quot;Herbert York, whom Killian had been keen on, was given the job and moved to ARPA from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 21). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when [[NASA]] was established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do &quot;high-risk&quot;, &quot;high-gain&quot;, &quot;far out&quot; basic research, a posture that was enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research universities.&lt;ref name = Wizards21,22 &gt;&quot;The staff of ARPA saw an opportunity to redefine the agency as a group that would take on the really advanced &quot;far-out&quot; research....The scientific community, predictably, rallied to the call for a reinvention of ARPA as a &quot;high-risk high-gain&quot; research sponsor— the kind of R&amp; D shop they had dreamed of all along&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 21,22). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, who resigned in early 1961.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} He was succeeded by [[Jack Ruina]] who served until 1963.&lt;ref name = Wizards23,24 &gt;&quot;In early 1961 ARPA’s second director, Brigadier General Austin W. Betts, resigned&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 23,24) Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA, managed to raise its budget to $250 million.&lt;ref name = Wizards23 &gt;&quot;Ruina raised ARPA’s annual budget to $ 250 million.&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruina who hired [[J. C. R. Licklider]] as the first administrator of the [[Information Processing Techniques Office]], which played a vital role in creation of [[ARPANET]], the basis for the future Internet.&lt;ref name = Wizards27-39  &gt;&quot;J. C. R. Licklider.&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet'' (pp. 27–39). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and execute R&amp;D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.

From 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues, including space, [[ballistic missile defense]], and [[nuclear test]] detection.&lt;ref name = Wizards23a &gt;projects in ballistic missile defense and nuclear test detection, couched in terms of basic research, were the top priorities.&quot; Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). ''Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet'' (p. 23). Simon &amp; Schuster. Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were transferred to the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the military space programs to the individual services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the [[Project Defender]] (defense against ballistic missiles), [[Project Vela]] (nuclear test detection), and [[Project AGILE]] ([[counterinsurgency]] R&amp;D) programs, and to begin work on computer processing, [[behavioral sciences]], and materials sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA sensor, [[surveillance]], and directed energy R&amp;D, particularly in the study of [[radar]], [[infrared]] sensing, and [[x-ray]]/[[gamma ray]] detection.

ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]] (also called NavSat) a predecessor to the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transit to Tomorrow.

TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite positioning system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629003311/http://www.darpa.mil/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=2565 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-29 |title=The Story of GPS |author=Catherine Alexandrow |date=Apr 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gap&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.darpa.mil/about/history/first_50_years.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506103713/http://www.darpa.mil/About/History/First_50_Years.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-05-06 |title=DARPA: 50 Years of Bridging the Gap |date=Apr 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972, and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs, information processing, and tactical technologies.

Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially through its support of the development of [[time-sharing]] (all modern operating systems rely on concepts invented for the [[Multics]] system, developed by a cooperation among [[Bell Labs]], [[General Electric]] and [[MIT]], which DARPA supported by funding [[Project MAC]] at MIT with an initial two-million-dollar grant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |author1=Stefanie Chiou |author2=Craig Music |author3=Kara Sprague |author4=Rebekah Wahba |date=5 Dec 2001 |title=A Marriage of Convenience: The Founding of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101306/http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2001/AILab.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DARPA supported the evolution of the [[ARPANET]] (the first wide-area packet switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and ultimately, the [[Internet]] and research in the [[artificial intelligence]] fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of [[Shakey the robot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ieee&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Bertram_Raphael |title=Oral History: Bertram Raphael |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |accessdate=2012-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516195054/http://ghn.ieee.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History%3ABertram_Raphael |archivedate=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DARPA also funded the development of the [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s NLS computer system and [[The Mother of All Demos]]; and the [[Aspen Movie Map]], which was probably the first [[hypermedia]] system and an important precursor of [[virtual reality]].

===Later history (1970–1980)===
The [[Mike Mansfield|Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense research (through ARPA/DARPA) only to projects with direct military application. Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} contend that the amendment devastated American science, since ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the time; the [[National Science Foundation]] never made up the difference as expected.

The resulting &quot;[[Human capital flight|brain drain]]&quot; is also credited with boosting the development of the fledgling personal computer industry. Some young computer scientists left the universities to startups and private research laboratories such as [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]].

Between 1976 and 1981, DARPA's major projects were dominated by air, land, sea, and space technology, tactical armor and anti-armor programs, infrared sensing for space-based surveillance, high-energy laser technology for space-based missile defense, antisubmarine warfare, advanced cruise missiles, advanced aircraft, and defense applications of advanced computing. These large-scale technological program demonstrations were joined by integrated circuit research, which resulted in submicrometer electronic technology and electron devices that evolved into the [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-Large-Scale Integration]] (VLSI) Program and the Congressionally-mandated charged particle beam program.

Many of the successful programs were transitioned to the Services, such as the foundation technologies in [[automatic target recognition]], space based sensing, propulsion, and materials that were transferred to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative Organization]] (SDIO), later known as the [[Ballistic Missile Defense Organization]] (BMDO), now titled the [[Missile Defense Agency]] (MDA).

===Recent history (1981–present)===
During the 1980s, the attention of the Agency was centered on information processing and aircraft-related programs, including the [[Rockwell X-30|National Aerospace Plane (NASP)]] or Hypersonic Research Program. The Strategic Computing Program enabled DARPA to exploit advanced processing and networking technologies and to rebuild and strengthen relationships with universities after the [[Vietnam War]]. In addition, DARPA began to pursue new concepts for small, lightweight satellites ([[LIGHTSAT (DARPA)|LIGHTSAT]]) and directed new programs regarding defense manufacturing, submarine technology, and armor/anti-armor.

On February 4, 2004 the agency shut down its so called &quot;LifeLog Project&quot;. The project's aim would have been, &quot;to gather in a single place just about everything an individual says, sees or does&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2004/02/pentagon-kills-lifelog-project/|title=Pentagon Kills LifeLog Project|first=Wired|last=Staff|magazine=Wired|date=2004-02-04|accessdate=2019-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2009 the agency broke ground on a new facility in [[Arlington, Virginia]] a few miles from the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Times]]'', &quot;Pentagon Agency Breaks Ground&quot;, October 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2011, DARPA hosted the [[100 Year Starship|100-Year Starship]] Symposium with the aim of getting the public to start thinking seriously about interstellar travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/01/28/fmoon-colony-newt-darpa-has-100-year-starship/|title=Forget the Moon Colony, Newt: DARPA Aims for 100 Year Starship|first=Tina|last=Casey|publisher=CleanTechnica|date=2012-01-28|accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA announced that it planned to build new X-planes with NASA's plan setting to create a whole series of X planes over the next 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Building X Planes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |title=NASA and DARPA plan to release new X-Planes |last=Grady |first=Mary |date=June 5, 2016 |website=[[Yahoo Tech]] |access-date=June 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611120846/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasa-darpa-reveal-radical-future-160000121.html |archivedate=June 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, it was announced that DARPA would bring a group of top-notch computer security experts to search for security vulnerabilities and create a fix that patches those vulnerabilities and it is called the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |title=Darpa to create Cyber Grand Challenge to fight security vulnerabilities |last=Howley |first=Daniel |date=17 July 2016 |access-date=17 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718190614/https://www.yahoo.com/tech/darpa-grand-cyber-challenge-hacking-000000417.html |archivedate=18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, DARPA leaders demonstrated a number of new technologies that were developed within the framework of the GXV-T program. The goal of this program is to create a lightly armored combat vehicle of not very large dimensions, which, due to maneuverability and other tricks, can successfully resist modern [[anti-tank weapon]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newatlas.com/darpa-gxv-t-demonstration-military-vehicle-technology/55198/ &quot;DARPA demonstrates 6 new technologies behind the agile combat vehicles of tomorrow&quot;] New Atlas, June 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Current program offices===
DARPA has six technical offices that manage the agency's research portfolio, and two additional support offices that manage special projects and transition efforts.{{clarify |reason= there are seven offices listed, instead the expected eight|date=September 2017}} All offices report to the DARPA director:

* The [[Adaptive Execution Office|Adaptive Execution Office (AEO)]] is one of two new DARPA offices created in 2009 by the DARPA Director, [[Regina Dugan]]. The office's four project areas include technology transition, assessment, rapid [[productivity]] and [[adaptive system]]s. AEO provides the agency with robust connections to the warfighter community and assists the agency with the planning and execution of technology demonstrations and field trials to promote adoption by the warfighter, accelerating the transition of new technologies into DoD capabilities. 
* The [[Defense Sciences Office|Defense Sciences Office (DSO)]] vigorously pursues the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and develops those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |title=DARPA/DSO Home Page |date=2 December 1998 |accessdate=6 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202153000/http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/ |archivedate=2 December 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSO identifies and pursues high-risk, high-payoff fundamental research initiatives across a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines – sometimes reshaping existing fields or creating entirely new disciplines – and transforms these initiatives into radically new, game-changing technologies for U.S. national security.&amp;nbsp;
* The [[Information Innovation Office|Information Innovation Office (I2O)]] aims to ensure U.S. technological superiority in all areas where information can provide a decisive military advantage. Some of the program managers in I2O are Wade Shen (as of December 2014), Stuart Wagner (as of September 2014), Steve Jameson (as of August 2014), Angelos Keromytis (as of July 2014), and David Doermann (as of April 2014). Brian Pierce is currently the office director.
* The [[Microsystems Technology Office|Microsystems Technology Office (MTO)]] mission focuses on the heterogeneous microchip-scale integration of electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Their high risk/high payoff technology is aimed at solving the national level problems of protection from biological, chemical and information attack and to provide operational dominance for mobile distributed command and control, combined manned and unmanned warfare, and dynamic, adaptive military planning and execution.
* The [[Strategic Technology Office (DARPA)|Strategic Technology Office (STO)]] mission is to focus on technologies that have a global theater-wide impact and that involve multiple Services.&lt;ref name=&quot;darpa.mil&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015051855/http://www.darpa.mil/offices.html |archivedate=2009-10-15 }} DARPA Offices.

* The [[Tactical Technology Office (DARPA)|Tactical Technology Office (TTO)]] engages in high-risk, high-payoff advanced military research, emphasizing the &quot;system&quot; and &quot;subsystem&quot; approach to the development of aeronautic, space, and land systems as well as embedded processors and control systems. 
* The [[Biological Technologies Office (DARPA)|Biological Technologies Office (BTO)]] fosters, demonstrates, and transitions  breakthrough fundamental research, discoveries, and applications that integrate biology, engineering, and computer science for national security. Created in April 2014 by then director [[Arati Prabhakar]], taking programs from the MTO and DSO divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2014-04-01|title=DARPA Launches Biological Technologies Office |date=1 April 2014 |website=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former offices===
* [[Information Awareness Office]]: 2002–2003
* The [[Advanced Technology Office (DARPA)|Advanced Technology Office (ATO)]] researched, demonstrated, and developed high payoff projects in maritime, communications, special operations, command and control, and information assurance and survivability mission areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* The [[Special Projects Office (DARPA)|Special Projects Office (SPO)]] researched, developed, demonstrated, and transitioned technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments ranged from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. SPO developed technologies to counter the emerging threat of underground facilities used for purposes ranging from command-and-control, to weapons storage and staging, to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. SPO developed significantly more cost-effective ways to counter proliferated, inexpensive cruise missiles, UAVs, and other platforms used for weapon delivery, jamming, and surveillance. SPO invested in novel space technologies across the spectrum of space control applications including rapid access, space situational awareness, counterspace, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures.
* The [[Information Systems Office| Information Systems Office (ISO)]] in the 1990s developed system applications of advanced information technologies.  It was a predecessor to the Information Exploitation Office.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
A 1991 reorganization created several offices which existed throughout the early 1990s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708012812/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6712/is_n27_v171/ai_n28601257/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-07-08 | work=Defense Daily | title=DARPA restructures/creates new offices | year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Electronic Systems Technology Office]] combined areas of the Defense Sciences Office and the Defense Manufacturing Office.
