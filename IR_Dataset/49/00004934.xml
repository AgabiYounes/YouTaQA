'''Basic English''' is an [[English language|English]]-based [[controlled natural language|controlled language]] created by linguist and philosopher [[Charles Kay Ogden]] as an [[international auxiliary language]], and as an aid for teaching [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a second language]]. Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930).

Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in [[World War II]] as a means for world peace. Although Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate [[I. A. Richards]] promoted its use in schools in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886748,00.html Time Magazine. Dec. 31, 1945. ''Education: Globalingo'']&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has influenced the creation of [[Voice of America]]'s [[Special English]] for news broadcasting, and [[Simplified Technical English]], another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.

What survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edmond H Weiss ''The Elements of International English Style'', pp. 17-18, M. E. Sharpe, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1572-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design principles ==
Ogden tried to simplify English while keeping it normal for native speakers, by specifying grammar restrictions and a [[controlled natural language|controlled small vocabulary]] which makes an extensive use of [[Paraphrase|paraphrasing]]. Most notably, Ogden allowed only 18 verbs, which he called &quot;operators&quot;.  His ''General Introduction'' says &quot;There are no 'verbs' in Basic English&quot;, with the underlying assumption that, as noun use in English is very straightforward but verb use/conjugation is not, the elimination of verbs would be a welcome simplification.&lt;ref&gt;A good summary in Bill Templer: ''Towards a People's English: Back to BASIC in EIL'' [http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 Humanising Language Teaching] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204112933/http://www.hltmag.co.uk/sep05/mart05.htm#C5 |date=December 4, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Word lists ==
Ogden's word lists include only word roots, which in practice are extended with the defined set of affixes and the full set of forms allowed for any available word (noun, pronoun, or the limited set of verbs).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordthere.html the list of words which are assumed and not counted] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The 850 core words of Basic English are found in Wiktionary's [[wikt:Appendix:Basic English word list|Basic English word list]]. This core is theoretically enough for everyday life. However, Ogden prescribed that any student should learn an additional 150-word list for everyday work in some particular field, by adding a list of 100 words particularly useful in a general field (e.g., science, verse, business, etc.), along with a 50-word list from a more specialised subset of that general field, to make a [[wikt:Appendix:1000 basic English words|basic 1000-word]] vocabulary for everyday work and life.

Moreover, Ogden assumed that any student already should be familiar with (and thus may only review) a core subset of around 200 &quot;international&quot; words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpi.html Ogden's &quot;International Word&quot; List—Alphabetic]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a first-level student should graduate with a core vocabulary of around 1200 words. A realistic general core vocabulary could contain around 2000 words (the core 850 words, plus 200 international words, and 1000 words for the general fields of trade, economics, and science). It is enough for a &quot;standard&quot; English level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/wordalpn.html Ogden's Basic English Next Steps]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogden.basic-english.org/word2000.html Ogden's Basic English Combined Word Lists]&lt;/ref&gt; This 2000 word vocabulary represents &quot;what any learner should know&quot;. At this level students could start to move on their own.

Ogden's [[:simple:Wikipedia:Basic English combined wordlist|Basic English 2000 word list]] and Voice of America's [[:simple:Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book|Special English 1500 word list]] serve as dictionaries for the [[Simple English Wikipedia]].

== Rules ==
Basic English includes a simple [[grammar]] for modifying or combining its 850 words to talk about additional meanings ([[morphological derivation]] or [[inflection]]). The grammar is based on English, but is much simpler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 1, 1996|title=Rules of Grammar|work=Ogden's Basic English|url=http://ogden.basic-english.org/rules.html|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Plural]] nouns are formed by adding ''-s'' or related forms, as in ''drinks'', ''boxes'', or ''countries''.
* Nouns are formed with the endings ''-er'' (as in ''prisoner'') or ''-ing'' (''building''). Adjectives are formed with the endings ''-ing'' (''boiling'')  or ''-ed'' (''mixed'').
* [[Adverb]]s can be formed by adding ''-ly'' (for example ''tightly'') to words that Basic English calls &quot;qualities&quot; ([[adjective]]s that describe objects).
* The words ''more'' and ''most'' are used for comparison (for example ''more complex''), but ''-er'' and ''-est'' may appear in common use (''cheaper'').
* Negatives can be formed with ''un-'' (''unwise'').
* The word ''do'' is used in questions, as it is in English (''Do you have some?'').
* Both pronouns and what Basic English calls &quot;operators&quot; (a set of ten [[verb]]s) use the different forms they have in English (for example ''I go to him'', ''He goes to me'').
* [[Compound word]]s can be formed by combining two nouns (e.g. ''soapbox'') or a noun and a [[preposition]], which Basic English calls &quot;directives&quot; (''sunup'').
* [[International word]]s, words that are the same or similar in English and other European languages (e.g. ''radio''), use the English form. English forms are also used for numbers, dates, money, or measurements.
* Any technical terms or special vocabulary needed for a task should be written in inverted commas and then be explained in the text using words from the Basic English vocabulary (for example ''the 'vocabulary' is the list of words'').

== Criticism ==
Like all [[international auxiliary language]]s (or IALs), Basic English may be criticised as inevitably based on personal preferences, and thus, paradoxically, inherently divisive.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html Farewell to Auxiliary Languages]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, like all natural language based IALs, Basic is subject to criticism as unfairly biased towards the native speaker community.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a sample quotation from [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&amp;L=AUXLANG&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2560 the auxlang mailing list archives] and another from noted linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teaching aid for [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a Second Language]], Basic English has been criticised for the choice of the core vocabulary and for its grammatical constraints.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, by proponents of Essential World English. See [http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm a summary of EWE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818175724/http://www.langmaker.com/outpost/eswldeng.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }} for instance and, again, the linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[readability]] expert [[Rudolf Flesch]] published an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', &quot;How Basic is Basic English?&quot; in which he claimed, &quot;It's not basic, and it's not English.&quot; The essence of his complaint is that the vocabulary is too restricted, and, as a result, the text ends up being awkward and more difficult than necessary. He also argues that the words in the Basic vocabulary were arbitrarily selected, and notes that there had been no empirical studies showing that it made language simpler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flesch&quot;&gt;Flesch, R. F. &quot;How Basic is Basic English?&quot; 'Harper's Magazine'', March 1944. pp.&amp;nbsp;339-343.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary references ==
In the novel ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', published in 1933, [[H. G. Wells]] depicted Basic English as the [[lingua franca]] of a new elite that after a prolonged struggle succeeds in uniting the world and establishing a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]]. In the future world of Wells' vision, virtually all members of humanity know this language.

From 1942 to 1944 [[George Orwell]] was a proponent of Basic English, but in 1945 he became critical of [[universal language]]s. Basic English later inspired his use of [[Newspeak]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich |first=Ivan |authorlink=Ivan Illich |author2=Barry Sanders |title=ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind |year=1988 |publisher=[[North Point Press]] |location=[[San Francisco]] |language= |isbn=0-86547-291-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/abcalphabetizati00illi_0/page/109 109] |quote=The satirical force with which Orwell used Newspeak to serve as his portrait of one of those totalitarian ideas that he saw taking root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere can be understood only if we remember that he speaks with shame about a belief that he formerly held... From 1942 to 1944, working as a colleague of William Empson's, he produced a series of broadcasts to India written in Basic English, trying to use its programmed simplicity, as a ''Tribune'' article put it, 'as a sort of corrective to the oratory of statesmen and publicists.' Only during the last year of the war did he write 'Politics and the English Language,' insisting that the defense of English language has nothing to do with the setting up of a Standard English. |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/abcalphabetizati00illi_0/page/109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evelyn Waugh]] criticized his own 1945 novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', which he had previously called his magnum opus, in the preface of the 1959 reprint: &quot;It &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[World War II]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster — the period of [[soya beans]] and Basic English — and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language that now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Waugh | first=Evelyn | title=Brideshead Revisited  | location=New York | publisher=Dell | origyear=1946 | year=1959}}. Full [http://www.odysseyeditions.com/EBooks/Evelyn-Waugh/Brideshead-Revisited/Evelyn-Waughs-Author-commentary-for-Brideshead-Revisited preface text] available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his story ''[[Gulf (novella)|Gulf]]'', science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] used a [[constructed language]] called [[Speedtalk]], in which every Basic English word is replaced with a single [[phoneme]], as an appropriate means of communication for a race of genius supermen.&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Robert A., ''Gulf'', in ''Assignment in Eternity'', published by Signet Science Fiction (New American Library), 1953. pp. 52–53: &quot;It was possible to establish a one-to-one relationship with Basic English so that ''one phonetic symbol'' was equivalent to an entire word&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
