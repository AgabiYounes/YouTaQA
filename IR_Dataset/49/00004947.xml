{{About|Bézout's theorem in arithmetic|Bézout's theorem in algebraic geometry|Bézout's theorem}}

In elementary [[number theory]], '''Bézout's identity''' (also called '''Bézout's lemma''') is the following [[theorem]]:{{math_theorem|name=Bézout's identity|math_statement=Let ''a'' and ''b'' be [[integer]]s with [[greatest common divisor]] ''d''. Then, there exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that {{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by'' &amp;#61; ''d''}}. More generally, the integers of the form {{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by''}} are exactly the multiples of ''d''.}}

The integers ''x'' and ''y'' are called '''Bézout coefficients''' for (''a'', ''b''); they are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients can be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. If both ''a'' and ''b'' are nonzero, the extended Euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that &lt;math&gt;|x|\le \left |\frac{b}{d}\right |&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y|\le\left |\frac{a}{d}\right |&lt;/math&gt;
(equality may occur only if one of ''a'' and ''b'' is a multiple of the other).

Many other theorems in elementary number theory, such as  [[Euclid's lemma]] or [[Chinese remainder theorem]], result from Bézout's identity.

A [[Bézout domain]] is an [[integral domain]] in which Bézout's identity holds. In particular, Bézout's identity holds in [[principal ideal domain]]s. Every theorem that results from Bézout's identity is thus true in all these domains.

==Structure of solutions==

When one pair of Bézout coefficients {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} has been computed (e.g., using [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]), all pairs can be represented in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+k\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)},\ y-k\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''k''}} is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.

Among these pairs of Bézout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; |x| \le \left |\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)}\right |\quad \text{and}\quad |y| \le \left |\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right |,&lt;/math&gt;
and equality may occur only if one of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} divides the other.

This relies on a property of [[Euclidean division]]: given two integers ''c'' and ''d'', if ''d'' does not divide ''c'', there is exactly one pair {{math|(''q'',''r'')}} such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{!}}''d''{{!}}}}, and another one such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=-{{!}}''d''{{!}} &lt; ''r'' &lt; 0}}.

The two pairs of small Bézout's coefficients are obtained from the given one {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} by choosing for {{math|''k''}} in the above formula either of the two integers next to &lt;math&gt;\frac{-x}{b/\gcd(a,b)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Extended Euclidean algorithm always produces one of these two minimal pairs.

===Example===

Let ''a'' = 12 and ''b'' = 42, gcd (12, 42) = 6. Then we have the following Bézout's identities, with the Bézout coefficients written in red for the minimal pairs and in blue for the other ones.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\vdots \\
12 &amp;\times ({\color{blue}{-10}}) &amp; + \;\; 42  &amp;\times \color{blue}{3} &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times ({\color{red}{-3}}) &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times \color{red}{1} &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{red}{4}  &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times({\color{red}{-1}}) &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{blue}{11} &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times ({\color{blue}{-3}}) &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{blue}{18} &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times ({\color{blue}{-5}}) &amp;= 6 \\
\vdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|1=(x, y) = (18, -5)}} is the original pair of Bézout coefficients, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{-18}{42/6} \in [-3, -2]&lt;/math&gt; yields the minimal pairs via {{math|1=''k'' = -3}} resp. {{math|1=''k'' = -2}}: {{math|1=(18-3⋅7, -5+3⋅2) = (-3, 1)}} and {{math|1=(18-2⋅7, -5+2⋅2) = (4, -1)}}.

==Proof==
Given any nonzero integers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, let &lt;math&gt;S=\{ax+by \mid x,y\in\mathbb{Z} \text{ and } ax+by&gt;0\}.&lt;/math&gt; The set {{mvar|S}} is nonempty since it contains either {{mvar|a}} or {{math|–''a''}} (with {{math|1=''x'' = ±1}} and {{math|1=''y'' = 0}}). Since {{mvar|S}} is a nonempty set of positive integers, it has a minimum element &lt;math&gt;d = as + bt&lt;/math&gt;, by the [[Well-ordering principle]]. To prove that {{mvar|d}} is the greatest common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, we must prove that {{mvar|d}} is a common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and that for any other common divisor {{mvar|c}}, one has {{math|''c'' &lt; ''d''}}.

The [[Euclidean division]] of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|d}} may be written
:&lt;math&gt;a=dq+r\quad\text{with}\quad 0\le r&lt;d.&lt;/math&gt;
The remainder {{mvar|r}} is in &lt;math&gt;S\cup \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, because
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
r  &amp; = a - qd \\
&amp; = a - q(as+bt)\\
&amp; = a(1-qs) - bqt.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
As &lt;math&gt;r\in S\cup \{0\},&lt;/math&gt; {{math|0 ≤ ''r'' &lt; ''d''}}, and {{mvar|d}} is the smallest positive integer in {{mvar|S}}, the remainder {{mvar|r}} is necessarily 0. This implies that {{mvar|d}} is a divisor of {{mvar|a}}. Similarly {{mvar|d}} is also a divisor of {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|d}} is a common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}.

Now, let {{mvar|c}} be any common divisor of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}; that is, there exist {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} such that
{{math|1=''a'' = ''cu''}} and {{math|1=''b'' = ''cv''}}. One has thus
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}d&amp;=as + bt\\
&amp; =cus+cvt\\
&amp;=c(us+vt).\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
That is {{mvar|c}} is a divisor of {{mvar|d}}, and, therefore {{math|''c'' ≤ ''d''}}

==Generalizations==

===For three or more integers===

Bézout's identity can be extended to more than two integers: if 
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = d&lt;/math&gt;

then there are integers &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;d = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n&lt;/math&gt;

has the following properties:
* ''d'' is the smallest positive integer of this form
* every number of this form is a multiple of ''d''

===For polynomials===
{{main|Polynomial greatest common divisor#Bézout's identity and extended GCD algorithm}}
Bézout's identity works for [[univariate polynomial]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] exactly in the same ways as for integers. In particular the Bézout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].

As the common [[root of a polynomial|root]]s of two polynomials are the roots of their greatest common divisor, Bézout's identity and [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] imply the following result: 
:For univariate polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' with coefficients in a field, there exist polynomials ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''af'' + ''bg'' = 1 if and only if ''f'' and ''g'' have no common root in any [[algebraically closed field]] (commonly the field of [[complex number]]s).

The generalization of this result to any number of polynomials and indeterminates is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].

===For principal ideal domains===
As noted in the introduction, Bézout's identity works not only in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers, but also in any other [[principal ideal domain]] (PID).
That is, if ''R'' is a PID, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''R'', and ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'',
then there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. The reason is that the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''Ra''+''Rb'' is principal and equal to ''Rd''.

An integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds is called a [[Bézout domain]].

==History==

[[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Étienne Bézout]] (1730–1783) proved this identity for polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bézout, É.|authorlink=Étienne Bézout|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RDEVAAAAQAAJ |title=Théorie générale des équations algébriques |place=Paris, France |publisher=Ph.-D. Pierres |year=1779}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this statement for integers can be found already in the work of another French mathematician, [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]] (1581–1638).&lt;ref&gt;

Deux nombres premiers entre eux estant donnez, treuver le moindre multiple de chascun d’iceux, surpassant de l’unité un multiple de l’autre.&quot;  (Given two numbers [which are] relatively prime, find the lowest multiple of each of them [such that] one multiple exceeds the other by unity (1).)  This problem (namely, ax - by = 1) is a special case of Bézout's equation and was used by Bachet to solve the problems appearing on pages 199 ff.
