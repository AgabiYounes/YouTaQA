The '''House of Bonaparte''' (originally ''Buonaparte'') was an imperial and royal European [[dynasty]] of [[Italians|Italian]] origin. It was founded in 1804 by [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], the son of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] nobleman [[Carlo Buonaparte]]. Napoleon was a French military leader who had risen to power during the [[French Revolution]] and who in 1804 transformed the [[First French Republic]] into the [[First French Empire]], five years after [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|his ''coup d'état'']] of November 1799. Napoleon turned the ''[[Grande Armée]]'' against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, extending the power of the dynasty.

The House of Bonaparte formed the [[Imperial House of France (First French Empire)|Imperial House of France]] during the French Empire, together with some non-Bonaparte family members. In addition to holding the title of [[Emperor of the French]], the Bonaparte dynasty held various other titles and territories during the Napoleonic Wars, including the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Kingdom of Spain]], the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the [[Kingdom of Holland]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Naples]]. The dynasty held power for around a decade until the Napoleonic Wars began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies, such as [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], as well as royalist (particularly [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]) restorational movements in France, Spain, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]], and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], the dynasty eventually collapsed due to the final defeat of Napoleon at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and the restoration of former dynasties by the [[Congress of Vienna]].

During the reign of Napoleon I, the Imperial Family consisted of the Emperor's immediate relations – his wife, son, siblings, and some other close relatives, namely his brother-in-law [[Joachim Murat]], his uncle [[Joseph Fesch]], and [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], his stepson.

Between 1852 and 1870, there was a [[Second French Empire]], when a member of the Bonaparte dynasty again ruled France: [[Napoleon III]], the youngest son of [[Louis Bonaparte]]. However, during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871, the dynasty was again ousted from the Imperial Throne. Since that time, there has been a series of pretenders. Supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the [[throne of France]] are known as [[Bonapartists]]. Current head [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon]], has a Bourbon mother.

==Italian origins==
The Bonaparte (originally ''Buonaparte'') family were [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] in the Italian towns of [[Sarzana]], [[San Miniato]] and [[Florence, Italy|Florence]]. The name derives from Italian: ''buona'' (&quot;good&quot;) and ''parte'' (&quot;part&quot; or &quot;side&quot;).
 
Gianfaldo Buonaparte was the first known Buonaparte at Sarzana around 1200. His descendant Giovanni Buonaparte in 1397 married Isabella Calandrini, a cousin of later cardinal [[Filippo Calandrini]]. Giovanni became mayor of Sarzana and was named commissioner of the [[Lunigiana]] by [[Giovanni Maria Visconti]] in 1408. Their great-grandson Francesco Buonaparte was an equestrian [[mercenary]] at the service of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Bank of Saint George]]. In 1490, he went to the island of [[Corsica]], which was controlled by the bank. In 1493, he married the daughter of Guido da Castelletto, representative of the Bank of Saint George in [[Ajaccio]], Corsica. Most of their descendants during subsequent generations were members of the Ajaccio town council. Napoleon's father, [[Carlo Buonaparte]], received a [[patent of nobility]] from the King of France in 1771.&lt;ref name=Horricks/&gt;

There also existed a Buonaparte family in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]]; however, its eventual relation with the Sarzana and San Miniato families is unknown. [[Jacopo Buonaparte]] of San Miniato was a friend and advisor to [[Medici]] [[Pope Clement VII]]. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]], which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event.&lt;ref&gt;Jacopo Bonaparte: ''Sac de Rome''. Écrit EN 1527 par Jacques Bonaparte. Témoin oculaire, hrsgg. by Bonaparte, Napoléon Louis, Florenz 1850&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier Antonio Buonaparte and Giovanni Buonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by [[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence]]. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Buonaparte maintained political neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The partbooks of a Florentine ex-patriate: new light on Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Ms. Magl.

The last member of the Florence family was a canon named Gregorio Bonaparte, who died in 1803, leaving Napoleon as heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Sir Bernard |title=Vicissitudes of Families |year=1869 |publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dye |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSYwAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Buonaparte tomb lies in the Church of San Francesco in San Miniato. Another in Ajaccio, the ''Chapelle Impériale'', was built by Napoleon III in 1857.

[[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] is the most prominent name associated with the Bonaparte family, because he conquered much of Europe during the early part of the 19th century. Due to his indisputable popularity in France both among the people and in the army, he successfully took part in the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]], overthrew the [[French Directory|Directory]] with the help of his brother, [[Lucien Bonaparte]], president of the [[Council of Five Hundred]], and participated in the creation of a new Constitution, which allowed him to become the First Consul of France on 10 November 1799. 2 December 1804, he crowned himself Emperor of the French and ruled from 1804 to 1814, and again in 1815 during the &quot;[[Hundred Days]]&quot; after his return from Elba.

Following his conquest of most of Western Europe, Napoleon I made his elder brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] (1768–1844) king first of Naples (1806–1808) and then of Spain (1808–1813), his younger brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] (1778–1846) King of Holland (1806–1810; subsequently forcing his abdication after his failure to subordinate Dutch interests to those of France), and his youngest brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jérôme]] (1784–1860) King of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], the short-lived realm created from some of the states of northwestern Germany (1807–1813).

Napoleon's son [[Napoleon II|Napoléon François Charles Joseph]] (1811–1832) was created King of Rome (1811–1814) and was later styled as Napoléon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication.

Louis-Napoléon (1808–1873), son of Louis, was President of France (1848–1852) and then Emperor of the French (1852–1870), reigning as [[Napoleon III]]. His son, [[Napoléon, Prince Imperial]] (1856–1879), died fighting the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], today the South African province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. With his death, the family lost much of its remaining political appeal, though claimants continue to assert their right to the imperial title. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The arms of the Bonaparte family were: ''Gules two bends sinister between two mullets or''. In 1804, Napoleon I changed the arms to ''Azure an imperial eagle or''. The change applied to all members of his family except for his brother Lucien and his nephew, the son from Jerome's first marriage.

== DNA research ==
According to studies by G. Lucotte and his coauthors based on DNA research since 2011, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] belonged to [[Y-DNA]] (direct male ancestry) haplogroup [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)#E1b1b1c .28E-M123.29|E1b1b1c1* (E-M34*)]]. This haplogroup, rare in Europe, has its highest concentration in [[Ethiopia]] and in the [[Near East]] (Jordan, Yemen). According to the authors of the study, &quot;Probably Napoléon also knew his remote oriental patrilineal origins, because Francesco Buonaparte (the Giovanni son), who was a mercenary under the orders of the Genoa Republic in Ajaccio in 1490, was nicknamed ''The [[Moors|Maure]] of [[Sarzana|Sarzane]]''.&quot; The latest study identifies the common Bonaparte DNA markers from Carlo (Charles) Bonaparte to 3 living descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jmbr/article/view/10609 |title=Haplogroup of the Y Chromosome of Napoléon the First |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology Research |volume=1 |number=1 |year=2011 |first1=Gerard |last1=Lucotte |first2=Thierry |last2=Thomasset |first3=Peter |last3=Hrechdakian |doi=10.5539/jmbr.v1n1p12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newadv/&gt;

Lucotte et al. published in October 2013 the extended Y-STR of Napoleon I based on descendant testing, and the descendants were E-M34, just like the emperor's beard hair tested a year before. The persons tested were the patrilineal descendants of Jérome Bonaparte, one of Napoleon's brothers, and of [[Alexandre Colonna-Walewski]], Napoleon's illegitimate son with Marie Walewska. These three tests all yielded the same Y-STR haplotype (109 markers) confirming with 100% certainty that the first Emperor of the French belonged to the M34 branch of haplogroup E1b1b.

==Living members==
[[Charles, Prince Napoléon]] (born 1950, great-great-grandson of [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] by his second marriage), and his son [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon]] (born 1986 and appointed heir in the will of his grandfather [[Louis, Prince Napoléon]])  currently dispute the headship of the Bonaparte family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Herbert|first= Susannah|title= Father and son in battle for the Napoléonic succession|date = 12 March 1997|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/12/03/wnap03.html|accessdate = 4 June 2007|location= London|work= The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other male member of the family is Charles's recently-married (2013) brother, [[Prince Jérôme Napoléon]] (born 1957). There are no other legitimate descendants in the male line from Napoleon I or from his brothers.

There are, however, numerous descendants of Napoleon's illegitimate but unacknowledged son, Count [[Alexandre Colonna-Walewski]] (1810-1868), born from Napoleon I's union with [[Marie, Countess Walewski]]. A descendant of Napoleon's sister [[Caroline Bonaparte]] was the late actor [[René Auberjonois (actor) |René Auberjonois]]. Recent DNA-matches with living descendants of Jérôme and Count Walewski have confirmed the existence of descendants of [[Lucien Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, namely the Clovis family.&lt;ref name=newadv&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Journal of Molecular Biology Research |volume= 5 |number= 1 |year= 2015 |title= New Advances Reconstructing the Y Chromosome Haplotype of Napoleon the First Based on Three of his Living Descendants |first1= Gerard |last1= Lucotte |first2= Peter |last2= Hrechdakian |doi= 10.5539/jmbr.v5n1p1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
